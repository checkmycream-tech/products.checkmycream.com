<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works wonderfully &amp; smells great! I started using Insta Natural products about 2 months ago and my skin looks awesome.  Love their products &amp; would recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> For me, there wasn&#x27;t anything extraordinary about this product. It smelled great, like fresh roses, but that&#x27;s about it. It didn&#x27;t calm my skin or moisturize it like I was hoping.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s an update for instanatural rose water and night cream. After a week of using it I can finally say I love the result. The dry skin( red and itchy ) is totally gone. And my pimples fading little by little. I see big result in just a week. So I can&#x27;t wait to order my rose water again. :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I tried this in place of another rose water product I typically use as dollar-wise it was comparably priced and my hope was it would be better as well.  Since this is all I use in the a.m. I was hoping it would be a bit more moisturizing than my typical product because of the added Moroccan oil but I can&#x27;t say I notice that much of a difference (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  Beyond that though, it works well and I&#x27;m love with the smell.  I&#x27;ve put it in a spray bottle which I use to mist my face and it dries nicely without any undue shininess or stickiness.</li>
    <li> I love this. I have been using for over a month now and My skin feels so soft and hydrated after I use it. Would highly recommend this</li>
    <li> I love the feel of my skin after using it - very refreshing - and it smells so good I used a small amount watered down to mist my sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there was some product leakage during shipping, approximately 1/4 of the bottle. When I mentioned it to the company they instantly sent me another bottle, free of charge. Great customer service together with quality ingredients will lead me look into what else this company sells!</li>
    <li> This toner has a soft, pleasant smell of roses (and I typically don&#x27;t like anything with any sort of fragrance).  I have been using it in conjunction with Instanatural&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum and I love the results of brighter looking (and feeling) skin.</li>
    <li> Loved it, but clumsy me. I managed to knock off the bottle off the bathroom counter and it broke hitting the tile floor, spreading all the goodness (about half) all over the floor. Wish the packaging was plastic :-( But I liked the product. It smells like mild fresh roses and feels so refreshing on my skin. I enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Oh the smell!!!!!!  I love the smell of this Rose Water!  InstaNatural  is a great company that stands behind it&#x27;s products.  This I use this water to remove make up as well as to refresh my skin.  Delivery was fast and item was well packaged.  I highly recommend.  And the price is affordable!</li>
    <li> My skin (and I) LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s changed my skin for the better. I&#x27;m a user for life! So glad I ordered after hearing over and over how great rose water is for your skin.</li>
    <li> Nummy!  Pure and smells SO good! :-)  I bought it as a skin toner but liked the scent so much I mixed about 6ml of rose geranium essential oil (The Enchanted Wilderness has a great one!) into some vegetable glycerin then into a 4 ounce spray bottle mixed with this rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glycerin seems to be acting as a sort of emulsifier because I don&#x27;t have to shake the bottle to mix the oil and water every time I spritz myself with this incredible delicate lasting scent!  The glycerin and essential oil are gentle moisturizers too and rose geranium is good for my mature skin...or any skin!  So I&#x27;ll spritz myself right before bed and then my skin feels alive and soft, the scent is soft and I feel like I&#x27;m drifting off on a bed of rose petals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a toner an after every use my face feels cleaner, looks even and smells rosey.</li>
    <li> This rise water is amazing. Smells so nice and leaves your skin smooth and bright. I would highly recommend it. If there is any advice I want to give, then it&#x27;s for almost all the companies out there to learn how to have excellent customer service like InstaNatural. It&#x27;s the best customer service I ever dealt with and I shop online a lot.</li>
    <li> This Rose Water is the best thing I&#x27;ve used on my skin, period. I use it right after cleansing, and it takes off what &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; by philosophy leaves behind.  It also makes my pores invisible - I didn&#x27;t expect that!  Nothing else has ever left my skin looking so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can also be used as a quick cleanser, a blemish fixer, and a moisturizer, though I usually do use Jojoba Oil lightly on my skin at night.  Just think, you can take your skin care regimen down to 3 or 4 easy items.  Cleanse, tone, retinol cream for the eyes (I am 65, after all) and since we all really should use a sun screen, throw that in too.  A little blush and out the door!  I just cleared my vanity and I haven&#x27;t seen the top of it for a few years!</li>
    <li> Wonderful communication.  Thank you</li>
    <li> this smells great and is so much nicer than other toners I&#x27;ve used...not medicinal, but nice and light fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is so refreshing. Smells great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good toner for clean dirty on face after makeup&lt;br /&gt;But I want to know I can used twice a day or only one time?</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an Moroccan toner and I love this stuff. I use it everyday. Its nice on the skin and doesnt irratate. Plus it smells so good. Its nice to have a toner that doesnt stink.</li>
    <li> Item was perfect for what i wanted</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!!!!! Not only does it smell GREAT! But it has worked wonders on my skin. I had a lot of acne scars and dark spots on my face this has clears my face so much! I wish I would&#x27;ve takes before and after pix to post. I highly recommend this it&#x27;s Great!!!</li>
    <li> Great refreshing toner, wonderful smell thank you!</li>
    <li> So, I purchased the rose water.  Then I thought. . .&amp;#34;What do I do with it?&amp;#34;.  After using it ~ how did I live without it?  It smells heavenly!  I love using it on my skin, especially after being out in the sun.  It is a wonderful toner and I just love using it!  Love having something new to add to my facial routine!</li>
    <li> New InstaNaturals fan! Smells great and once applied gives a nice softness to skin. I only use it on my face. I&#x27;ve used other brands and definitely prefer this one. I just wish the size of the bottle was bigger for the money. I would like to use in bath but due it&#x27;s small size I don&#x27;t b/c I don&#x27;t want to run out every two weeks. Still worth the purchase. I hope to see larger bottles sold in the future for those that want to add to bath water.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it as a toner a few times but honestly I mostly use it as a light perfume cause it smells so nice and rosy. It does feel good as a toner but I&#x27;m used to using just witch hazel and it seems a little milder and a lot better smelling than that.</li>
    <li> The scent is simply refreshing and wonderful.  I have very oily skin and some acne scarring. This product has slowly diminished the scarring, the redness of my face is gone and it leaves my skin refreshed and not dry or oily. It is so gentle and 100% natural. I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Smells heavenly and the quality is superb.  I used this to make homemade lotion for friends, family, and ofcourse myself.  It was easy and fun to make.  Almond oil, honey, beeswax, and rose water...that simple and the lotion is said to have properties, thanks to the Rose Water and other pure clean ingredients, to erase lines and wrinkles.  I will have to see about that part, but I will enjoy the test trial since it smells wonderful.  Thanks for making this great product available via Amazon.  I will be back for more soon.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. Makes my face feel so soft. Plan to continue using!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this product.  I love rose water and this is just the perfect beauty product.  I have always wanted to use a toner, because of all the positive effects, but my skin is dry and all toners I&#x27;ve used in the past have just dried my face out more.  Most toners actually make me break out, and skin breakouts is not something that is common for me.  Not with this toner.  It smells awesome and my skin is glowing and moisturized.  I highly recommend this for anyone, especially those with dry skin looking to get the benefits of a toner.  I will definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Really great toning water I feel it really does tone , refreshes and hydrates my acne prone skin. I use in the morning followed by mousturizer and sunscreen. The smell is luxurious !!! I would have given this 5stars deffinately but I was a bit disappointed how small the jar is! For the value in price... And I requested a bigger bottle to purchase and the small jars are the only available ... So I was a bit disappointed .. Please make larger bottles with more product !!</li>
    <li> This toner is fantastic! It smells great. It makes my skin feel amazing! It has helped to heal my acne significantly. It helps my skin feel moisturized and healthy. I am so glad that I was sent this item to review! I will definitely be buying more! I am adding it to my normal skin care routine! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. It&#x27;s a good rose water toner.</li>
    <li> i love this face toner i use it all the time it is more than half way gone it is my favorite toner and i will be buying it i received this for free in exchange of my thoughts and i recommend every one trying it</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I adore this product. Absolutely adored it. It cleared up my rosacea quickly and made my skin look amazing. Smells like a lovely day in a rose garden. Unfortunately, when I ordered my second bottle, it never arrived. By all accounts it has been delivered, but no sign of my package. We looked high and low, asking neighbors and our apartment complex, but no sign of it. I&#x27;d love to keep buying this product but I&#x27;m wary of not receiving my order again :(</li>
    <li> Reduce ance plus fine line</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has extreme eczema on her face and can&#x27;t use most cleansers.  It is alcohol free and is great for sensitive skin.  It also smells so good, unlike most products.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles and I like the smell...I mix it with the coconut oil for better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this toner, i put on my face, neck and hair, it makes my face glow, a good buy!</li>
    <li> Love this toner. Smells great, my face feels better after using it.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful after cleansing. I used a spray top from another bottle and spritz this one after I get out if the shower</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I am currently in my 30&#x27;s and have always struggled with acne as well.  I have completely cut out all conventional soaps/moisturizers and I am so pleased I have added this product to my regimen.  I love the smell of it, first of all.  I have to admit I did miss the &#x27;perfumy&#x27; scent of some products, but the fragrances were irritating my skin.  When using this on my face, I feel a little tightness, but not painful or unpleasant.  I have already purchased two bottles and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> really liked this and will get it again.</li>
    <li> I like this toner - it smells great but light and it is refreshing to use - I think this is a great product for anyone to use - my skin feels clean and refreshed when I use this after cleaning my face before bed - great product with a great smell.</li>
    <li> I really wish this worked for me. I had already had semi clear skin as far as acne, but I wanted a deeper clean than what my wash was giving me. I read incredible reviews so I gave it a try. It&#x27;s been about a month and I have more acne than I did when I began using it. I have finally discontinued regular use. However, this might just be my type of skin? Not sure. But keep in mind it doesn&#x27;t work for every body... I wish it did :( giving it two stars because it smells so good! ;)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product...leaves my skin soft, clean and hydrated. Best toner ever.</li>
    <li> This nicely scented rose water is all natural which is great.  My better half uses this to help clean the skin as it not only cleans the skin but also moisturizes and helps with acne.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn’t make you feel oily.  I also started using this for my dry itchy scalp and it has helped with that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product. At first I was a little skeptical because some reviews said that it smelled awful, but it doesn&#x27;t! This rose water literally smells like roses, I&#x27;m not sure if some people are confused and expected it to smell &amp;#34;sweeter&amp;#34; but its a dusty rose scent, and if you dont like it too much, it doesn&#x27;t linger around for long. I started using rose water as my face gets very oily at times, and ever since then, the oil on my face is drastically reduced. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great</li>
    <li> Love this  produckt ,  easy to fres your skin and clean</li>
    <li> LOVE this toner!!! I use it in the morning and evening after washing my face. The light scent of rose water is amazing and is such a pleasure to begin and end my day with. I got a little too much sun this weekend, even with sunscreen and a hat, and this toner was so soothing and calming to my skin! Excellent customer service!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is incredible! This is all I want to use now as a toner and even a hair/scalp mist to keep my scalp healthy and my hair silky soft. It is hard to believe there are no added fragrances as the scent is very strong. Hopefully it really is as pure as it says because I use it everyday now. I transfer it to a glass spray bottle as I would not use it as much with the current container. I am sure you could buy a spray pump at the health food store as well.</li>
    <li> Love rose water and I like that it is a glass bottle that I can reuse when it&#x27;s empty for other things in house with my essential oils</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;this smells heavenly. I put some in a mist bottle so I can spritz it on my pad to wipe my face after cleansing and on my damp hair.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent; very pleased with product.  The scent is strong and pure without being overpowering.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this! Always use it as an essential part of my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> this is the real deal 100% REAL ... LOVE THE SCENT ......</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> exactly as described!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good and I like using it from time to time. I also put a cap full in my humidifier sometimes.</li>
    <li> I really love this Toner! My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and have experiened less breakouts. I only use eyeshadow, mascara, and Eyeliner. My routine is I apply Insta Natural Facial Cleanser to my face with a cotton pad using small upward circles.  Using a hot wet clean washcloth I wipe away the cleanser. Then I appy this Insta Natural toning rose water (Which smells lovely by the way) with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again. Immediately followed with Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum and just one squirt of Insta Natural Rosebud Oil. The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products. All in all it has been a great experience :)</li>
    <li> I was blown away by the true-to-life rose aroma that I sniffed as soon as I opened the bottle. I loved it as I wiped it across my skin as well. It is aroma therapy in its purest form. The effects were amazing and instant: my skin looked smooth and dare I say, perfect. There was a tightening of pores without any feeling of tight skin. I felt refreshed and smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose water can be used for several purposes. The natural properties can be used on hair and skin, whether you are trying to hydrate, refersh or renew. This pure rose water can also be used for aftershave. I think I will save it for my face though, I really like inhaling the fragrance as it is doing its wonders on my pores. Smell the roses every day!</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly.  This is part of a basic facial at my spa, people love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, and makes my skin feel soft as a Rose petal!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft....</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and the subtle fragrance last all day. It provides moisture so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out like regular toners. I bought two bottles and am getting another one for my sister in law.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It smells so good and relaxing. It feels great on my skin. It does not break me out or has any negative effect on my skin. I have not used it long enough to see changes but I love how it makes me feel so relaxed. I am pretty sure I will repurchase this.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to use on your face in the mornings. After your morning wash to your face this is an great toner to apply to the face and the smell of the roses is truly an eye opener for me. Leaves not trace on the skin and works with others products that you use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use my skin is not seeing and additional lines in the face but my skin is bright and I love the way feel after using Natural Moroccan Rose. You can only say words but your skin tells the truth.</li>
    <li> Love this it quickly reduce inflammation from acne, n smells great, just all good for your skin!</li>
    <li> Very nice product! Smells great! Happy with the purchase and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just used this Moroccan Rose Water for the first time and I am in love with this stuff. I put it in a small spray bottle to spritz my face with after I get out of the shower and washing my face and it leaves my skin feeling so smooth. It also smells amazing and catch myself randomly spraying it anytime I walk by it. I have used other rose waters in the past that have a fake rose smell to them but this does not. I plan to keep using this as a toner and also to make facial creams with. There are directions that explain how to use it as a hair treatment and I will be trying that asap. I can tell that this is a GREAT quality product and so glad I had the opportunity to test it out and share my thoughts.</li>
    <li> After reading up several brands of Rose water I decided to splurge on this one. I am so glad I did! I use it as a quick toner right after both am and pm cleasing and a week later I can see/feel the difference. Small  drop on a round cotton pad, and 3 quick swipes later I&#x27;m good to go! My pores appear thankful and tighter because of this  quick readying step. Sounds silly but the scent is so light and airy it lightens my mood as well. No need to look anywhere else grab this one and you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading that rose water was good for sensitive skin. My sensitive skin (with rosacea) has done really well. I put into a spray bottle and I mist after cleansing - no irritation at all. I highly recommend. Oh, and the price for real rosewater was great.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice now and would highly recommend it.  It has become a part of my daily routine.  Great smell and makes your face happy as well.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m in love!  If you haven&#x27;t tried mixing some of this in your shampoo, your missing out.  Does wonders for the hair.  Also great as a toner-especially when your using retina A.  It seems to have healing properties. I just wish they put it in a BIGGER and more friendly bottle.  A bottle that is more controllable as far as the amount coming out.</li>
    <li> I love this toner,it helps my skin looks great. I feel my face much smoother and moisture.</li>
    <li> This is great! I love it</li>
    <li> Smells great (like roses) and does not irritate my sensitive skin at all, not even the skin around the eye area. This is my first rosewater and I love it.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell wonderful but after using my face felt clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Transparency:  Let me preface this by saying that I don&#x27;t like writing reviews (it&#x27;s tedious) however I signed up for this program that allows me to buy discounted items for doing something I don&#x27;t like - writing reviews.  I was able to buy this Rose water for $1.00 and I couldn&#x27;t pass that up. I am writing this after having just applied it for the millionth time this week.  I also don&#x27;t even like the way roses smell, normally.  My only other experience with rose water was another product I purchased on amazon that was not sealed and it smelled like someone dumped out the rosewater and replaced it with something else.  What a waste of money!  So I&#x27;m sure you can understand my hesitation when buying more rose water from amazon. However, this had the safety seal and it definitely smells like roses.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day, and while I can&#x27;t say I notice anything changing or any  real magic happening, my face feels softer.  I always had oily skin, but in my 20s that turned into combination with some oilyness, but also a lot of dryness especially on my cheeks.  So maybe I over do it by dousing them with this intoxicating liquid (hey the rose smell is really potent), but it feels nice, and it smells heavenly. As I write this I am seriously pausing just too inhale, because I can smell it. So it&#x27;s a bit like aromatherapy as well.  I know this is labled as a toner, but I feel it does more than that. I honestly haven&#x27;t been using anything else. No cleansers, no moisturizers. Just this 1-2x a day.  I sometimes break out due to having very sensitive skin. Last year, I used an enzyme peel I had purchased at sephora that gave me a weird burning rash.  Since then I&#x27;ve been very careful about what I use, but I figured that this would be okay since it has no added ingredients. It&#x27;s very gentle, and feels a bit cool but not menthol-cool. It would be lovely to carry with me on a summer day in a little spray bottle. I wonder if the company makes a travel version with a spritzer?If not, PLEASE DO.  How I use it:  I open it and i pour some on a cotton round, usually 2 pours, and then i start on my forehead and work my way down massaging my face with it.  If the scent is really strong and it feels amazing then I leave it as is, but if not I get another round and start again.  I also rub it along my jaw, on my neck and across my shoulders.  All in all, I am definitely going to purchase this again.  It would be nice to find it for $1.00 again, but if I don&#x27;t I am okay with paying full price for something that is helping to normalize my face as I enter my...30s.  :-(</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle for rose water and I love it. I love the smell and which last long. I kinda use this as after shave for me. and its one of the perfect hydrating. I used this in bath and it works great but with bath you need to put a lot. and this price its worth buying. My wife love this too and she will using this with her face pack she has. And she like the product smell</li>
    <li> I received a discount to try this product. I&#x27;m using it as a gentle cleanser for my face and love it. It smells divine!  No harsh chemical detergents for my skin!</li>
    <li> Works great but it needs a spray top. I will continue to buy this product. I believe this product took away my razor bumps.</li>
    <li> A nice toner for the face</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is soothing to my face and neck.  I think it really adds a lot to my skin care regimen actually improving skin texture. I apply it with a cotton round before using my vitamin C serum in the morning and before the Retin A at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed both with the product and InstaNatural.  After slightly over a week using the Rose Water as a toner, I see a noticeable difference in my skin.  It also smells AMAZING!  InstaNatural has also been wonderful, sending tips and suggestions for product use and following up to make sure the product is working out.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Rose Water, and I love it.  It has made a big difference in balancing the moisture of my skin and reducing breakouts.  And it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> The rose water smells divine,  It is 100% natural with no additives.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t say the source of the water, for instance if it is a hydrosol from steam distillation.  It has a light rose scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses and seems to be gentle enough for use on everyone including the eldery and the young.  I have used this on my face alone and have mixed it into moisturizers for myself.  You can use it for facial and hair care.  It states on the packaging that you can use in the bath also but, that is a little to expensive for me to use in my bathwater.  It mixes beautifully into body butters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this Rose Water for a few days so I don&#x27;t know If I can add much to the other raving reviews. I will agree it smells good, I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells like roses on a vine though. I&#x27;ve been applying it to my face and neck with a cotton ball and I do love how it cools my skin quickly and removes dirt and other grime of the day. I had a red blotch on my face that appeared out of nowhere a couple months ago and it is now gone, not sure if its from the product but if it is that&#x27;s awesome. I think I need more time to decide if its helping my pores, although I don&#x27;t think I have a huge problem with large pores thanks to my genetics. Overall it seems to be a nice product. I&#x27;ll update in a couple months or when the bottle is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the price but then I tend to think all skin care products are over priced and over hyped.</li>
    <li> I asked my friend how she had such great skin and she told me this was her secret so of course I bought it. This bottle has become my daily routine as I just put a little on a cotton ball after I wash my face. I absolutely love this facial toner! It has made my skin look even toned and my face glow. My friends all tell me I have beautiful skin and I always tell them it&#x27;s because of Insta Naturals Moroccan rose water. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great!</li>
    <li> It is the best stuff ever. It cleans and does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice.  Learned about it from a dermatologist who said to use it as a cleanser/toner.  It is very gentle and cleans well.  I still however use my Vitamin C Cleanser when I have make up on. Otherwise, I use my rose water for a freshener.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the company&#x27;s customer service is awesome!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and is a great toner. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I enjoy using it - although it is too early to know all the results.</li>
    <li> I had never used a toner on my skin and after my last facial I was told I should use rose water. It’s very gentle and make my skin feel great. It really helps your moistures absorb better. I suggest you use it in a spray bottle and not cotton swap</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells wonderful and I can already see my pores getting smaller. I&#x27;ve only had this for 3 days and I am already seeing a difference!</li>
    <li> This is good, I even use it for my hair</li>
    <li> I really like the rose water, it works really well with me and make my face get better and soft,love it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> So refreshing on my skin! I LOVE this rosewater toner.</li>
    <li> Love this toner! I use it twice a day and it does not irritate my skin nor would it dry it. It removes the dirt and oil from my face and helps in preventing breakouts and reducing the appearance of my large pores. I love the fact that it does not have a strong smell (in comparison to some of the toners I have used in the past from the local stores). I received a discount for my 100%  honest and unbiased feedback and I just want to recommend it to those with sensitive, acne prone and oily skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells great, feels very refreshing on my skin. I have to say that it&#x27;s not a drastic change that you will notice once you start using this product, but I am seeing my skin slowly improving day by day. So I&#x27;m hoping with the constant use, my skin will just continue to get better. Would recommend this toner to everyone!</li>
    <li> The Moroccan Rose Water is awesome. I have been using it for about three weeks now. I use it twice a day.  I have acne skin and it looks like the Rose Water is helping. :) It smells soooo good...I want to take a bath in it! It&#x27;s very refreshing. I am going to order more Rose Water.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural offers a wide line of Pure and Natural beauty products, all of which I would easily and highly recommend. Their Moroccan Rose Water is no exception. It acts as a great toner in a daily beauty regimine, as well as additionally useing for break outs, aromatherapy, cleanser,  sun burn or skin ailments, and as the &#x27;thiner&#x27; to facial and hair masks. I use it twice daily as a toner, and my skin continues to clear up and brighten using this product as well as a cleanser oil and moisturizer from InstaNatural. Their products are great, the price is reasonable, and the guarantee and customer service is exceptional!</li>
    <li> I have recently started using this Rose Water and I love it. It is like washing your face with Rose petals. My skin feels so clean after using it. The fragrance alone is enough to make you fall in love with it. I smells like rose petals. I am using it as a toner after cleansing and it really prepares your skin for InstaNaturals incredible serums.  The products from this company are amazing and they really work.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this rose water smells and I enjoy using it as a toner. I was using my witch hazel that made my skin feel tight, but I don&#x27;t have that feeling with this product. When I run out of the product I will definitely re-order and I will do some additional research on other products by this great line.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this Rose Water.</li>
    <li> the price is great and i just ordered my second bottle. I definitely noticed a change is texture after using this as a toner day and night. my face feels more supple and soft.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great. Feels very nice over the face and smells soothing... non-irritant and works well with my skin, acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Had a relaxing smell. Cleans extra residue that didn&#x27;t wash off my face.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of all things InstaNatural so I love it when they send me a new product to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  This Rose Water Face Toner is a new favorite of mine!  Not only does this Rose Water smell fantastic (think a small bouquet of fresh picked roses!!) but it works great as a toner and preps the skin perfectly, getting it ready for serums &amp; moisturizers. Love, love, love! :)</li>
    <li> There hasn&#x27;t been any changes of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it for a week. My acne is still here and doesn&#x27;t prevent it. At first it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin, it felt tight. Now I feel like I&#x27;m putting water on my face with rose scent. Doesn&#x27;t do anything else. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair shiny and soft too. I honestly feel like I wasted money. I want a refund. :( I don&#x27;t see the miracle everyone was talking about.</li>
    <li> I have been using this rose water toner for the past week and I absolutely love it. The aroma is wonderful and it makes my skin feel so soft. This is my first time to purchase rose water toner and I must say that I am 100% pleased with my order. If you don&#x27;t like how roses smell this is not the rose water toner for you, however, if you love how roses smell then this is the perfect rose water toner for you. After my shower I put the rose water on my face and neck and just let the product totally soak in before I put anything else on. By waiting to apply my sunscreen and make-up, I also get a chance to enjoy the heavenly aroma of roses while I let the rose water soak in. In the evening after I take off my make-up I once again use this rose water. After using the rose water I usually wait an hour to use my homemade face serums.  My face feels naturally soft after I apply my rose water toner but because I am over 60 I know that I need some extra help keeping my face younger looking. Today I received an email from InstaNatural asking how I like their product? I was told that if for any reason I was not pleased with their product that I could get a full refund. InstaNatural rose water toner is an awesome product and I will be ordering it again.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I often had trouble pouring out just a tiny amount of this rose water ......I recently purchased more Argan Oil from InstaNatural and I decided to use the new pump that came with my purchase on my bottle of rose water! Oh My Gosh......it is just perfect! No more late night spills......I love the scent of this rose water so I want every drop to end up on me not my bathroom counter!</li>
    <li> Best smelling toner ever! I love the rose scent. It works well for all skin types and is moisturizing, too. I used this morning and night. After using the InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner for a while I just wish this came in a spray bottle, too for easier and faster application. Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
    <li> Like the product for skin toning and in the middle of winter I really appreciate the wonderful rose fragrance just like my English rose garden in early summer!</li>
    <li> This has an incredible floral scent. Its soothing on my face and isnt tacky or sticky. Just pure clean. I recieved this product to try and review for free but this is my opinion. I havent had the opportunity to add it to hair care routine yet but cant wait to do so</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves my skin so clean and smooth. The smell is great and the price is amazing. My face is smoother and brighter after using it for just two weeks. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I don&#x27;t know if it has really improved my skin, but it smells like a high end spa product and is all natural as well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Instanatural and as soon as I opened the bottle it smelled like a Rose Garden! Its very gentle on the skin and makes my skin feel more refreshed. It doesnt dry out my skin or make it feel tight.  I then use my Argan or Rosehip Oil from Instanatural and my skin has improved a lot! I also use their Eye Gel , Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Essential Oils. I love this company.</li>
    <li> After using the InstaNatural Rosewater about 10 days, I am very pleased. It feels and smells wonderful. I use it after cleansing and before using the InstaNatural Retinol moisture cream. My skin looks and feels softer. I feel, given more time, I will see an even more significant improvement. I plan to continue using these 2 products and will re-order from InstaNatural. The service and followup have been great. The pricing is fair and shipping is free. The packaging is nice, but for my use, I would prefer white or beige packaging in order to blend into my dressing table top.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Nice and gentle. A new favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water!  It smells so lovely and natural.  It is also very versatile; I use it alone as a toner, I mix some with a little aloe and glycerin as a super light facial moisturizer and I have used it as a hair rinse as well.  I like to tinker with DIY natural skin and hair care ideas and this rose water has been a superb addition!  Many of the natural ingredients I use have no scent at all or a nutty or woodsy scent.  I add this rose water to many concoctions because I would much rather smell like roses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased several InstaNatural products now.  They seem to always have the product I am looking for when I am seeking natural, organic skin and hair care items.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to completely rate it, but it does seem to leave my face softer, tighter and more radiant than before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I literally LOVE this toner! Have sensitive, acne prone skin and this helps tremendously! Smells wonderful as well!</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my skin &amp; hair.</li>
    <li> This product was an excellent find for my sensitive acne-prone skin. I love that it has no additives. I use it to both cleanse and tone. It has improved my skin tone without the irritation. I just wish it was available in a larger bottle as I use it very quickly.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly and not drying at all. When she needs a pick-me-up, she will reach for this bottle of rose water. I&#x27;ve used it for a week so I will give it some more time to see the benefits.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a whim upon reading exceptional reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of toners, but they all either dried out my skin or didn&#x27;t make any noticeable improvements. This is so gentle and after 2 weeks of using the product, I see my skin changing for the better. Suffering from winter dry skin, it helped cleanse my skin without irritating or drying it further. It also smells amazing ! This is a new staple to my skin regiment and I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling naturally refreshed.  I tried it mixed with my shampoo and it made my feel really soft.  Very versatile product.</li>
    <li> Great toner for every skin type</li>
    <li> I love this toner! It smells so good and feels very refreshing. I use it morning and night between my face wash and moisturizer. Good quality, and good customer service. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water.  It smells wonderful and has made my skin look and feel clean, smooth and toned.  I also used it in a henna mask which worked great.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and right away I love the natural smell of roses. I used this as a toner for my troubled skin. Also, I am using it on a small cyst that has recently developed on my daughter&#x27;s  hand. I only gave it 4/5 starts because have not had this product for long.</li>
    <li> Fabulous rose water for my daughters sensitive and oily skin.  She loves the scent and the way it&#x27;s working for her combination skin.</li>
    <li> wonderful ador! I  my skin love it!</li>
    <li> I never used rose water before so I was anxious to try it.  First of all it has a really nice scent.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as a toner and have been happy with it.  I appreciate all the uses other customers have been listing and will also try them.</li>
    <li> After using this for a while I noticed that my skin seemed clearer and less red. It did dry out my skin a little at first (I have sensitive skin) but I found using it only at night and applying a moisturizer solved that problem. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This rose water works as an excellent toner. My skin is brighter, and it smells wonderful. I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face very clean and clear after using the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser. Would recommend, and will also be trying out some of their other products in the future!</li>
    <li> Have really been enjoying this rose water. My skin is sensitive but have no problems with this. Tried some others but this by far is the BEST!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  This product is now part of my daily beauty routine!  I am always looking for anti-aging products and when I found InstaNatural products I truly fell in love.  I love the smell of this product but most important how hydrated it keeps my skin.</li>
    <li> For new experience I bought one bottle of this water. After my surgery I had red pimples on the skin and this staff really make clean my face. I also used cream, mask and pilling also lotion for remove make up. But this water make your skin good for put day or night cream. So after one month use I orden 4 bottles of this staff and one bottle gave to my neighbor.  I think that she ll be glad about results like me.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly! !!!</li>
    <li> First of all I just wanted to say that this is the best rose water I have EVER received. The smell is phenomenal and I like the fact that it came in a dark amber bottle. I normally use this as a toner after I finish washing my face with Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Cleanser and I&#x27;ve noticed that this tightens my pores and leaves my skin incredibly soft. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this again!</li>
    <li> Pretty good !!very comfortable !</li>
    <li> Very very nice toner for face.Fresh and nature.</li>
    <li> The smell is incredible!! I use this on my face and neck twice a day after washing my face and I feel like my skin looks better, maybe brighter? I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I STARTED USING ROSEHIP OIL 2-3 MONTHS AGO BECAUSE OF MY TERRIBLE SKIN DISOLORATION/HYPERMENTATION AND SUNBURN&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS MY VERY FIRST TIME TRYING ROSE WATER ON MY FACE.  THE SMELL IS BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAN.  THE APPLICATION IS VERY SMOOTH GOING ON SKIN; YOU MUST RUB IT UPWARD TOWARD YOUR HEAD.  AFTER IT BEGINS TO DRY, YOU CAN FEEL THE TIGHTENING. THEN I APPLY MY ROSEHIP CREAM (WHEREIN I ADDED MORE ROSEHIP OIL, JOJOBA OIL, ARGAN OIL, VIT C POWDER AND HYALURONIC ACID POWDER AND BLENDED IT TOGETHER).  AFTER 2 DAYS, I SEE  A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.  THIS IS A KEEPER!&lt;br /&gt;I AM EXPERIMENTING WITH ALL NATURAL OILS FOR AN EXCELLENT OUTCOME WITHOUT USING HARSH CHEMICALS.  NATURE KNOWS BEST. GOD HAS GIVEN US ALL WE NEED FROM M0THER EARTH!</li>
    <li> Helped sooth my skin and has a very pleasant fragrance.  Has made my skin so much softer.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!  Leaves skin feeling soft!</li>
    <li> I’m very much a fan of getting “back to basics” and I think this is a first-class product to start with. I’ve seen several articles on the internet about Rosewater being a part of Cleopatra’s beauty regimen (literally, rose petals in water) so I wanted to see for myself. This rosewater has very much of a “calming effect” as I feel like I’m at a day spa every time I apply it after cleansing my face. It smells just like roses, which coincidentally has one of the highest frequencies among all essential oils (according to research done by Young Living Oils).  When I first used this product it was too drying for my skin. For that reason I think it may be more suited to someone with oily or acne-prone skin. But never one to waste money on a product, I simply created my own hyaluronic acid serum, used rosewater instead of regular distilled water, stored it in the refrigerator, and aaagh! -- love the cool, fresh, and hydrated aromatherapy feel of it all. I also had a really bad sunburn and this concoction was very soothing to my skin for the four to five days that it burned. You can add rosewater to your shampoo, lotions, linen spray, or use as an aromatic face/body spritz.  I’ve become a fan of most of Instanatural’s products. I like that they are organic and everything has a money back guarantee in case something doesn’t exactly work for you.</li>
    <li> Love this product so far. Only been using a week. Will come back to give it another star if it continues to prove itself.</li>
    <li> Best. Toner. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan rose smells so much better than Damascus Rose, and after a chemical peel this toner soothes the skin so much. I use it after some strong exfoliating toner to balance the skin PH, and guess what, if I skip this step my sensitive skin will start flaking in ten minutes.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Love it I use it in my shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly, I use it as a spritz toner on my face and chest, leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Seems to be super high quality, was shipped quickly and packaged well. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great rose water, love the rose smell to it.  It absorb great for my skin, leave it soft and silky.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I can see the difference in my skin after just two weeks of use. I didn&#x27;t have acne but I always had a few deep rooted pimples here and there and blackheads and blemishes. Now my skin feels smooth and healthy and mostly all of that had cleared up! I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks, this is my miracle product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and made my skin clean and smooth</li>
    <li> I love this rose water!  It smells so good and it feels lovely on my skin.  I have switched to using this as a toner - got rid of the other one I was using.  It has helped calm down some redness that I always seem to have in my skin.  I am so glad I found this rose water!  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is awesome, it smells great and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> I really like this rose water toner.  I have never used a toner, and decided I should start.  I use it after cleansing, and before applying serums.  It is a great value, for the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> smell soooo good. love it! cant live without it now.</li>
    <li> It smells so good!  I use it as a facial toner and use it twice a day after washing my face.  I always sniff while putting on my face because it smells GREAT!  I really like the smell and it drys up quickly with no residue or sticky feelings.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this rosewater. I have very sensitive skin and use it to wash my face. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this toner.  LOVE!!!!!!!!!!  smells so wonderful, feels so light and refreshing.  no harsh astringents like some have which dries out skin.  this stuff is just the bees knees</li>
    <li> It smells really good. love this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toner. It makes my face look and feel great. Not to mention it smells amazing. I have very sensitive skin and have experienced no effects from the toner except smoother skin. I also have received remarks from my significant other that I smell GREAT. What gal doesn&#x27;t want to smell like roses?</li>
    <li> This is very nice. I love the smell, it leaves my skin clean and soft. I am always using it but I like to use it after the gym more.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Rosewater as a toner and in a mister,  and I love it.  It smells wonderful,  and helps maintain moisture in the skin.  I top it with some emu or argan oil that I also purchased from instanatural and my skin stays moisturized for hours.  I love it! I am very impressed with the instanatural brand,  they have great customer service and high quality products, I would definitely purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> I love the refreshness of this product after I was my face! It makes it feel fresh and smooth! Also, great to use in the bathtub!</li>
    <li> Great product. Worth buying and checking it out.</li>
    <li> I must be one of the only women in the world who has never used a toner before, but since this was my first stab at it-- I figured I&#x27;d try a trusted brand with no additives! InstaNatural&#x27;s Rose Water Toner is flipping amazing. That&#x27;s all I can really say!! Try for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love this rose water! It&#x27;s very fragrant, yet gentle. No stinging, no irritation. Feels great on my skin. Would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and am quoted pleased with the product. The only thing I am not thrilled with is that it has a very strong scent. If you are sensitive to smells, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend as it&#x27;s quite powerful. If you can ignore the smell, then it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This rose water is very thin. The smell is luscious and smells like real roses but I did not notice any benefit to my skin. I probably will not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff......Third time ordering.</li>
    <li> Lovely product! Great smell and works well as a toner!</li>
    <li> I use this as a morning toner after getting out of the shower and it works amazing. I first tried another brand (Thayer) and was really put off by the smell so I didn&#x27;t buy it again. Since then, I was using apple cider vinegar DIY because it was cheaper but again, if not more, the smell really got to me. When I decided to switch up my face routine I was reading all sorts of amazing things about rose water, so I reluctantly decided to try out a different brand and am glad I did. This smell is much calmer than Thayer&#x27;s (which smells like baby powder and perfume in my opinion) and has helped, along with Jojoba oil, to even out my skin tone and prevent acne. I absolutely love it</li>
    <li> love the way my skin feels</li>
    <li> Great stuff - it smells nice and is an excellent toner without making the face dry or oily</li>
    <li> I feel my skin is looking better after using this for a couple weeks. I like it and will definitely reorder. AND also a good bargain!</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described and did not irritate my sensitive skin.  It smells wonderful and does a good job in balancing, but not so much for moisturizing.  I usually use another brand of rose water, which I think does a better job in both balancing and moisturizing, only it&#x27;s a lot more expensive.  I&#x27;d like this better if it came in a spray bottle for easier application.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the scent of this Rose Water Toner!  I&#x27;ve purchased it numerous times and cry when I run out.  It is scent therapy for my nighttime routine.</li>
    <li> I love this Rose Water Toner.  I used two bottles already.  I re-ordered 3 more again. Great Toner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now as my morning face refresher.  I love it - it smells lightly of roses and removes, without stripping, the vestiges of make-up and dead skin that build up after sleep - a perfect toner.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product to have in my \\&quot;self care\\&quot; kit. I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I don&#x27;t use it regularly but here and there and it is wonderful to use when I get the chance. And best of all...I don&#x27;t mind the smell :)</li>
    <li> Works very well.. I saw results after one use. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this as a toner after cleaning my face at bedtime. My skin has never felt cleaner or more refreshed! My 58-year old sensitive skin loves it!</li>
    <li> I keep this in the fridge to use as a mid-day toner on hot days. Works, great, my skin is very happy and it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Have heard about Rose Water for years and never tried it.  I have combination, sensitive skin and have not had any adverse reaction.  I find when I use it in the morning, I don&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer in addition.  Leaves my skin balanced, soft, and smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have only had this product over a week, but I already like it. My skin is super sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it. It feels refreshing and calming!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I&#x27;d been reading about the benefits of Rose Water for a couple of months. So when I made my purchase I knew exactly what I wanted;  pure, high quality,  no additives, preservatives and not diluted. This product exceeded my expectations. You won&#x27;t be sorry with this purchase and I will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Very nice!! I love using rose water as a toner. It smells amazing &amp; keeps my skin fresh.</li>
    <li> The odor is mild. Works well, my daughter says I have to buy this again. She uses on her face and adds to her conditioning step. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Plan to use it as toner</li>
    <li> This product arrived in the mail quickly and I love how it makes my skin feel. The scent is very pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and good for toning your face</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS TONER! I don&#x27;t love many products but when I find one I do I tell everyone. I have been wanting to try a natural toner and always wanted to try rose water as well. When I saw this product on Amazon and I was able to get it at a huge discount I grabbed it. I have finished the whole bottle and want to order more. It was very soothing to my sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I have oily skin and it did not cause me to be oily or red. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wow, I cannot believe how great this Moroccan Rose Water works on the skin of my face. My skin on my face had been dry. The dryness caused my skin to form discoloration on certain spots. I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I have noticed a great improvement in my skin retaining moisture, and it seems the dark patches are lightening up at even tone with the rest of my skin color.</li>
    <li> I adore this product and will be continually reordering it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with Moroccan Rose Water!  My skin looks and feels better after just a few weeks of use and the light rose scent is pleasing without being overpowering.  Rose Water helps to calm my skin and subdue redness I tend to get.  Definitely an excellent purchase and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I did do my research before purchasing this and I absolutely love it, just ordered my 2nd bottle. I have a combination skin and after cleansing pores around my nose and chin my skin starts feeling tight and dry right away, but after couple sprays (I use a spray bottle) the dryness and tightness are gone, it does feel wonderful. Considering the quality and the cost - well I&#x27;m thinking in ordering couple more bottles, just in case :)</li>
    <li> I had read about using rose water on my face and hair but had never tried it.  I am over 40, so am always looking for all natural ways to prevent wrinkles, hydrate my skin and to do it naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this rose water, it was sealed and wrapped in bubble wrap but had leaked all over the box.  Only about an inch was missing from the bottle so I am still using it.  The scent of this rose water is amazing, it smells so nice.  I use this after I wash my face, I let it dry a little bit then add moisturizer.  I like how it feels, I like how it smells and will continue to use this.  A great alternative to the alcohol based toners you get at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been into using natural things for myself, family, and home. When it comes to meeting my needs of something natural and result-giving, this Rose Water Toner is a great product. It will, without a doubt give you instant results after use. The 100% natural guarantee gives you piece of mind to knowing what you are applying to your skin. Great product, worth recommending to others!</li>
    <li> Great product! It balances your skin really well! Wonderful together with rose hip oil!</li>
    <li> I bought it because the company has good customer service. It has sweet  rose flower smell, it helps my skin lightened up, looks brighter after two times. I didn&#x27;t see the big difference other than that on my face but it makes my hand more smoother,I applied the left over on my hands, before they&#x27;re so dry. I am using this rose water only for a week as a toner and will continue to use it. Love the product and already have recommended to my friend and sister in law.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It helped reduce blackheads and tighten up pores. It also feels refreshing during the summer, keeping skin vibrant and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a toner for my face &amp; it works very well. I like that it&#x27;s all natural &amp; tightens my pores without leaving my skin too tight.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love how effective it is for being pure and natural. I use it daily as a toner for my dry and sensitive skin and find it very calming. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I guess I have not used it long enough to give a good  review ask me again in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Its a good rosewater but a bit pricey for the quantity. I use it just as a toner so far, my acne hasn&#x27;t lessened and still get the occasional breakout but I have seen my pores cleared up a bit since I started using it. I would really want to use it as an after shave on my legs but since this is soo pricey I might get another Rose water bottle of either a Heritage brand, or from Indian stores for other uses on my body.</li>
    <li> Not moisturizing. It makes my skin very dry....</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look radiant.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Moroccan Rose Water is a ph balanced skin toner with no burn. After using it a couple times, my large pores on my cheek look a lot smaller than before. The scent is very calming and you can even add it to your bath water for aromatherapy purposes. I have tried mixing a bit with my shampoo to wash my hair and it leaves my hair strands soft with a slight rose afterscent. I like that this is 100% pure rose water in the bottle. There is nothing like alcohol or water to dilute it like the ones you find in the drugstore or some aromatherapy shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> My Instanatural Rose Water arrived when expected and I was very pleased with the generous size of the bottle. When I opened the bottle the fragrance was amazing. After cleansing your face and neck you simply apply the Rose Water to a cotton ball and gently apply avoiding getting it in your eyes. It is so light and smells so awesome. The whole room smells like roses. It is a very soothing experience. It leaves your face feeling so clean and with a nice healthy glow. So much better than those chemical toners. I will be buying this Rose Water regularly.</li>
    <li> As for the Rose Water Toner, I really really wanted to like it! I am in need of a new toner, and this one boasts all natural rose water without chemicals, preservatives or artificial fragrances. Therein lies the problem for me: I am so hyper sensitive to scents, that I couldn&#x27;t put this on my face. I know that most of the female population love roses, and flowers in general, but I most certainly do not. I am a strange kitten in that way, but I wouldn&#x27;t let this stop you from trying this toner. It&#x27;s a one stop shop: cleanses, tones, moisturizes and replenishes. It will even help with sunburn and can be used on your hair to make it soft and shiny. I really wish I wasn&#x27;t such a ginormous dork and was able to use this toner, because it seems like the missing link in my beauty routine! I am wondering if adding a few drops of essential oil will help? Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I don’t know how to start this review….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. I need to start this off by saying…I hope this is a magic bottle. Magic in the way that it refills itself. I wish you could smell thru the screen because this is what a corner of Heaven smells like (new baby, fresh cut grass, and if a hug could smell..that smell,  are the three other corners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love dabbing this on my face and neck and smelling roses for the next hour (although when I asked my son to smell my face he wasn’t having it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product and I admit that I was a slight bit concerned at first. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and I read a review or two that this broke a few people out. Not the case for me at all. I wash my face with my regular face soap that I always use and then with a cotton ball I smooth this all over in an upward fashion. I don’t feel a tingle, I don’t feel like I have applied a product, a lotion…nothing. It was just like swiping on…water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the claims…&lt;br /&gt;For the face…tightens pores? I have huge pores..big enough that I believe little families live in them.  I think my pores look a tab smaller but in all honesty I really can’t tell. What I can tell you is that my face feels fresher and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Has my acne gotten better? It hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse and anytime I add a new product/beauty treatment to my regimen I have an initial reaction...not so with this.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this on your hair and in your bath but I am much too stingy with this little bottle to use it for that. I would rather keep every drop for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I be trying this product again?…uh. Yeah. I will also be looking into what other products Insta Natural has to see how they stand up to their claims. Ok Ok..and to see if they smell wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;Will I let my teen daughters use this product? …uh Yeah. If they buy their own!</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times before bed under moisturizer and before makeup in the morning. It is working just like any other toner. I&#x27;ll post an update when i know better of any changes.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because of the amazing reviews. It did absolutely nothing for my skin and made no difference whatsoever. This is why I&#x27;m so skeptical of products with thousands of reviews on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know, maybe others will have better results but I used the entire bottle and there was nothing different about my complexion at all. The only thing I will say is that it really does smell wonderful, just like roses, but other than that, it really is just rose scented water with no real benefits.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love rose water and this has been fabulous, I use it as an astringent for my face after washing, before putting on my Vitamin c and then moisturizer for extra support. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  Smells super fantastic too.</li>
    <li> love it.. refreshing rose scent</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about nine days now- the big pores on my nose are visibly smaller. Love the smell too. Will try on my hair.</li>
    <li> I  like the product. I mix it with a bit of green tea and apple cider vinegar to stretch it out a bit--but by itself it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Smells really good leaves skin feeling so soft I will be purchasing more for sure.</li>
    <li> Exceptionally good. Have an amazing feeling every time I apply. They should consider increasing the quantity for the price they charge or at least offer a discount to the repeat purchasers.</li>
    <li> From the second day I used it on my face, I noticed a change; my face looks brighter and clearer than before.  My husband also noticed the change.  The smell is great. I will recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Fallen inlove with this product, I use it morning and night as my face toner. Wonderful scent and makes my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with problems with greasy oily face for years and tried everything but nothing has ever worked.  I&#x27;m so glad my sister introduced this product to me.  I&#x27;m hooked for life.  My face is oil free now even after wearing makeup for hours.  I definitely recommend it for people with oily tzones.  This took care of mine for good.  One happy customer</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best toner I have ever used.  Unlike the other toners I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t dry me out or break me out.  I love how it smells great, and how refreshing it feels on my skin.  I recently purchased my second bottle and I love it.</li>
    <li> I received my 1st bottle as a gift from my neighbor. Now Im on my 3rd bottle that I purchased myself.. I put this in a small spray bottle &amp; spray it all over my face after cleansing as a toner before I apply my other skin care products. I use this in the AM &amp; PM. I love the Rose scent &amp; it hasn&#x27;t broken me out. My skin has been looking very good since I started using this but I can&#x27;t give this product all the credit since I&#x27;m also using other beauty products in conjunction with my Rose Water Toner. But one thing for sure I&#x27;ll be buying more of this when I ran out.</li>
    <li> I love this Rose water toner. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin...which is already angry. It&#x27;s all natural. I been using it for about 2 weeks. It smells heavenly. I&#x27;m so glad I made the purchase. I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I also used a bit in my hair and it really made my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I have never heard of using rose water as a toner until I purchased several products from InstaNatural.  I have very sensitive skin due to over exfoliation and was pleasantly surprised that this product calms my skin down and does NOT cause any redness.  I love the smell of real roses (not the old lady smell).  I use it mainly on my face and neck after cleansing morning and night.  I also want to use a few drops on my hair but I need to transfer some over to a bottle with a dropper so I don&#x27;t waste so much of this precious water. The reason I did not give it a five star is I wish it would come with a dropper.  Other than that, it is perfect. The amber glass is good quality and so is the product.  I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is excellent. The seller sent me directions on how to use their products several days prior to products arriving.</li>
    <li> I really like.. Use it everyday..</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I use it for my face and hair and my face is soft, it cleans the skin well without drying.  It&#x27;s so soft.  And my hair this morning is so shiny after putting the rosé water in my conditioner.  I love it and will have to buy another bottle real soon!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have a younger looking face.  I will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells. It also does a good job of cleaning up the dirt left behind on my face even after washing with cleanser. It helps to soothe my skin and has not broken me out.</li>
    <li> This Rose Water is heaven in a bottle!!  Softens the skin and leaves a lasting smell of lovely roses!  Very relaxing!  My must have product.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Cleans my face well! Very happy</li>
    <li> It made me break out horribly.. maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it...</li>
    <li> I do freelance makeup, and I&#x27;m always looking for the perfect toner for all skin types! Of course, natural rose water is the best option, not only because it is gentle, but also because it is completely natural! Yes, you could get rose water at an organic food store, and this is a bit pricey considering what it is, but I think the glass bottle and packaging is very hygienic and fits right into my MUA kit.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST rose water on the market!  I absolutely love it! Too bad it&#x27;s not Prime eligible.</li>
    <li> I love the gentleness on my skin and the wonderful smell. It is a product that I can use in multiple areas/cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Thank you InstaNatural for such a wonderful product and great customer service. This product is everything it says it is and I am so pleased with it. I so love the scent, it is lovely. It truly does smell like roses and is simply beautiful and clean. This is a product I would order again when needed and I highly recommend this 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water. AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for making this platform available.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the Moroccan Rose Water. My favorite way to use it, is to spritz it on my face before my makeup, after applying my makeup and thru out the day. It gives my face a great fresh feeling. If I could have a mini bottle in my pocket I would use it even more. It is refreshing and the scent lasts. I was sent this for review, however I will always give my honest and unbiased opinions.  Update:   This has been especially helpful in the cooler weather. Although here in my neck of the woods it doesn&#x27;t get too cold, but just the humidity dropping off can cause havoc on my skin.  I always have rose water on hand to prevent my face from getting too dry and painful.</li>
    <li> My face have been suffering for about two years due to hormonal changes. It started with acne, then the acne marks. After two years I was plagued with marks all over my face. People were always asking me, &amp;#34;What is going on with your skin?&amp;#34; I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was something I was eating, using, taking or all of the above. I had invested hundred of dollars trying to sooth my cystic acne and get rid of the spots. I decided to do some research and decided I would try the natural way. My research led me first to Argon Oil. I have oily skin so I always thought that using an oil would make my skin produce more oil....WRONG!!!! The Argon Oil did the opposite. I could not believe that I could go all day with makeup and I didn&#x27;t have to constantly blot the oil on my face. So, my search for more natural products lead me to THE MOROCAN ROSE WATER TONER..I read the reviews and decided that if the product was as good as the description and reviews, I would have a winning combination. Well if you are suffering with acne prone, scarring, uneven skin tone and not to forget oily skin, Try this MOROCCAN ROSE WATER TONER!!!  Give your skin about 6 weeks and you will be mad for wasting money on chemically loaded products that don&#x27;t work and probably do more harm to you skin. Give it a try, you really don&#x27;t have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I have only used the Rose Water for a little over a week, but very happy with it so far.  I use it both at night and in the morning, I have noticed that my adult acne has cleared up and my skin is much softer. The customer service is fantastic and has been very helpful in their guidance in the use of their products. I basically use this as a toner and I also use as a spritzer on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and am very happy with this toner.  I am on my second bottle and it has not done anything to aggravate my skin.</li>
    <li> I usually buy rose water from Whole Foods and it&#x27;s really expensive so it&#x27;s nice to see this product at 100% pure and at such a reasonable price. I spray cool rosewater on my face as a refresher during the hot days of summer. I just keep a little spritzer bottle in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this rosewater smells stronger than the one I already have, but it is not overbearing. The smell should be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SETAF provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It is so much better than witch hazel.  I&#x27;m using it as an astringent.  My face/neck area feels smooth and silky after I apply it and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> My soon to be mother in law got me a bottle of this rose water for my birthday, after that, I was hooked! I noticed such wonderful improvements in my skin. My face feels smoother and just looks better, my blackheads are disappearing too! ( I&#x27;ve been fighting that since I was 10, I&#x27;m now 32). You have a customer for life in me!</li>
    <li> Okay quality water. Alright fragrance to water but a bit over-priced for  more authentic rose water for 1/3 of the price.</li>
    <li> I am generally not into facial cleaners because I always use a natural soap or face mask to get rid of impurities, but I have recently started a new job and wearing a bit of makeup trying to get rid of my Mom-Hag face so I figured I&#x27;d try this out as a toner. I love it! The rose scent isnt strong which is great for me because I am not a huge fan of flowery scents and the last thing I wanted was to smell like a walking rose bush. This really cleaned my face, left it soft, and since it dries really fast you can use it during your morning beauty rush and have very little wait time before putting on your makeup! I am definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> The Rose Water smells wonderful and feels super refreshing! I love to use this as a toner after cleansing my face and I say this is a much better alternative to those toners you can get in the drugstore or even high end. A lot of times they add unpronounceable ingredients and also alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol is actually not good for your skin and instead of toning you only strip your skin´s natural balance and dry it out. Check the label of your toner! I am really happy I found this Rose Water! The only ingredient is 100 % Pure Moroccan Rose Water! And that is it! How simple and wonderful is that? Recommend this highly to everybody!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. But after 3 weeks it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my face. I feel there should have been some kind of improvement by now.</li>
    <li> The smell is phenomenal.  It feels great and helped clear up my often problematic skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality rose water. I used it as toner for my face, and I love the scent. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> wonderful natural option</li>
    <li> Love this as a toner...smells amazing, brightens skin!!</li>
    <li> The Moroccan Rose Water product is of highest quality.  My skin is already looking and feeling healthier. I use it daily, first thing after my shower.</li>
    <li> Wonderful facial toner. Use it before my other InstaNatural products.</li>
    <li> This is the first Rose Water I have ever used so I do not have anything to compare it with. I have no issues with the product nor how it was delivered.</li>
    <li> Decided to buy this after getting a facial and my facialist recommended it to me and its 100% natural which is hard to come across! My face is oily in some spots and I feel like this has really helped in the oily spots better than most toners that contain alcohol!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product. So refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product that should be part of your daily routine.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  It has a true rose smell that lingers.</li>
    <li> Product was completely broken! When I opened the box glass was all over the place!</li>
    <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and I have combination skin. This year I started to break out more than usual. I read the reviews on here and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This works wonders for my skin! I thought my acne would increase but it did the exact opposite. The smell is very light and not overpowering. I also used a couple drops in my bath water, which was very relaxing :)  I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Item delivered. Great product</li>
    <li> Love this item it makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time today and I will never go back to crappy facial care products. InstaNatural makes such quality products and my face is looking so much better.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and it feels great on my skin.  I noticed my pores seem to be shrinking a little too!</li>
    <li> Skin feels soft and smells delightful</li>
    <li> I love this toner its not strong for my face and the smell its amazing.  Recommend 100 %</li>
    <li> It smell so good in  soap and  Diffusion to make the room smell  good  ...  4/1/15  Mary Lee Parker</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, I actually use it on my baths.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Helps to soothe skin, my daughter has eczema and it is working very well for that.  Also, I used it for my face as a toner.  That too worked very well. Smell is light and not too much.  Really enjoy using this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been an amazing product for me. Great for prepping my face before applying makeup and also for using after face wash to keep skin soft. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This tones my skin, smells wonderful, and makes my skin look dewy!  Two thumbs way up!  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d never tried this before.</li>
    <li> Just as good or better as the expensive brands  such as BeautyCounter.  Smells fantastic! Shipping was very quick. I put it in a spray bottle for a couple quick mists a day.</li>
    <li> This is my second order Love using this on my face daily. Makes my skin smooth, decreases my pores and gives me a glow. As a black woman its not always easy to find a good honor but this does the trick and then some.</li>
    <li> I am providing this review as part of a promotion. When I ordered the rose water, I honestly did not know what to expect! I am so excited about this product &amp; will definitely add rose water to my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;A very pleasant, light rose smell. It is not overpowering, but quite relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Color:&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is amber color, but the rose water is clear.&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;Simply take a cotton ball &amp; rub on your face. I think it would work as a nice splash too! It would smell nice while soaking in the tub or added to body wash or shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
    <li> Using every day.  A terrific product with so many uses: hair, body, deodorant, and so much more. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Noticed nothing but smells great..</li>
    <li> Not at all harsh!  Great toner for face neck. I&#x27;ve even used it on my arms after sun.  I&#x27;ve used mainly natural products for skin &amp; hair for years.  Glad to find this as it&#x27;s as thorough as what I used before but more gentle at the same time.  Put some in my shampoo &amp; I like the subtle lift it gives my hair also.</li>
    <li> Its so soothing and feels so nice on your face. I used it after dermarolling and its so comforting. I now use it morning and night on my face and neck, my face acne has lessened somewhat but my neck acne is 100% gone!!!! I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because the smell was not like fresh roses, it was a little more like decaying roses. Its not a fake rose smell though, which is awesome. I&#x27;m new to rose water so maybe that&#x27;s how its supposed to smell. I&#x27;ll come back and up the stars if it is.</li>
    <li> Cleans my face of grime even after it has been washed. Strong scent, but it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried it my face felt a little strange and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so even though it says for all skin types I would not  recommend this for someone with sensitive skin. After that first time though I haven&#x27;t had any problems. Now I just love to pour a little on my hands and splash it all over my face because it feel so fresh and clean after. My favorite thing about this Moroccan Rose Water is that it really smells like roses.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite product by Insta Natural! The smell is pure rose water, nothing added! The rose water naturally balances the skin&#x27;s pH, making your skin soft, smooth &amp; radiant. I use mine in my bath but could also be used for cleansing your face, toning, hair care, aftershave, acne treatment, sunburn, aromatherapy, etc. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT. VERY SOOTHING. I MIX IT WITH WITCH HAZEL. GREAT BRAND.</li>
    <li> Delightful and light. Like to spritz on my hair!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. Absolutely nothing! I would not recommend if you are searching for pure rose water</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming right out of the bottle, but once applied to hair or skin the scent dissipates and clean softness remains! I do wish the bottle had some eased was of distributing the product- as it is you have to pour it or tip it over a cotton ball. I think giving it a spray bottle would be GREAT for hair, then you can easily apply it to dry hair. For now, I&#x27;ve poured it into my shampoo and applied using cotton balls. I really like the rose water, but I took a star off for packaging.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of InstaNatural Argan Oil, and I love to use rose water toners on my skin. For about a year I have been using an excellent rose water toner by Teliaoils, a company in Greece. The downside of it was that it comes in very small bottles and takes about 2 -3 weeks to ship. I decided to try InstaNatural Rose Water because it ships fast and comes in a larger bottle; also as I said I use and highly recommend their argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is fantastic to use with the argan oil! It is lightly moisturizing, smells like rose petals and leaves my skin feeling just like a rose petal. I have also swiped it beneath and over my eyes and it is very soothing, not irritating at all - this coming from someone with extremely sensitive eyes and skin. It is great used in conjunction with InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum and argan or rosehip oil, as the serum tends to be a bit drying. This toner and the oils provide proper moisturization to counterbalance the slightly drying effect of the serum. I have not yet tried their rosehip oil as I am still using up the bottle of Teliaoils rosehip oil I have, but will be happy to order some when I run out. But definitely use this as a toner before moisturizing even if you don&#x27;t use the serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited about this new company and its products; all that I have tried so far have been top-notch quality, fresh, non-allergenic (for me) and the prices are incredibly reasonable. Customer service is above-and-beyond as well; in fact part of the reason I was willing to give them a shot is because of their gracious responses to the few folks who&#x27;ve reviewed negatively. Highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> Boxed well; speedy delivery</li>
    <li> Having allergic, dry, sensitive skin, I find this rose water to be soothing to my sense of smell as well as my skin.</li>
    <li> Now in a lot of natural hair product use rose water, and since I&#x27;m coming out with my own line of natural hair and skin product I want to use all natural ingredients that is healthier for your skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to every and anyone to use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works or not but like the smell</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the rose water-overall. The fragrance is pleasant. To describe the rose fragrance; it has a subtle, alluring but not overly rosy fragrance.  I detect a green hint to it as if the stems were used in the extraction process. I use rose water/toner daily for my facial care as a refresher and I soak facial sheets in the rose water as part my skin regimen; therefore I use a lot of Rose water. My skin loves Rose water!! I will say, I would enjoy this product even more if it was available in a larger container and  for a more competitive price.</li>
    <li> i just love this rosewater and it&#x27;s just amazing how my pores have shrunk. The smell is so inviting in wonderful i truly recommend this product. thank you:-) Terry C.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water however I mix it with my own concoction to lessen the harsh effects it can have on my sensitive skin. This stuff works like a charm, my skin is less oily, softer, and brighter.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a natural product that is safe for use on baby skin. The Moroccan Rose Water worked perfectly, and it helped reduce the dryness and rash on our baby&#x27;s face. It smells like real rose and our baby likes it!</li>
    <li> The product is great as a toner.  My skin responds better to it than to much more expensive department store toners these days.  Any rose water works though, and I can get a bigger bottle of food-grade quality rose water for cheaper at my local Indian grocery store.</li>
    <li> I would use the Insta Natural 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water if for no other reason, than the smell alone! The wonderful perfumey scent of roses will greet you as soon as you open the bottle! I was in love with this product just for that reason. But of course I had to check it out to see if there was more to it than just a wonderful scent!&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Water can be used for many purposes and I always appreciate a product that is good for more than just one thing. Some of these include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;-Toner&lt;br /&gt;-Hydrator&lt;br /&gt;-Reduces sunburn&lt;br /&gt;-Aromatheraphy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to get a sunburn the day after I received this so I decided to put it to the test. I used a cotton ball to apply it to my burnt shoulders. It felt cool and soothing to the touch and absorbed quickly into my skin. Since hydration is one of it&#x27;s uses, I was hoping it would rehydrate my skin and give it the moisture the sun took from it. I used it for a couple of days until the sunburn disappeared and my skin never peeled like it usually does so I&#x27;m guessing it really did hydrate. And it left me smelling like roses - literally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it as a Toner on my face. I love the way it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into my skin. It is thin and watery in texture and smells amazing. The scent alone really does calm and sooth the senses and leave me with a feeling of peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water is a great hydrator and Toner and cleanses at the same time while leaving you smelling amazing!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and I like the light rose smell. I wish the scent lingers longer though~ Also, it would be better if the bottle cap was better designed.</li>
    <li> I like writing reviews especially for products I really like but even better when I find a company that has great customer service. You guys can clearly see from all the reviews this is a great product. It does so many amazing things! I used it as a toner and I loved it for that. It felt so light and clean. It was calming and soothing on my iritated skin. This would be great for any skin type but especially for sensitive skin. When you purchase your Rose Water from InstaNatural you get the added bonus of a company with great customer service. I&#x27;ve had a really enjoyable intereaction the Founder of the company. Usually you have trouble, or I do, reaching customer service and here I am able to interect with the Founder. So if you&#x27;re looking for a great toner and a great company to purchase it from than look no further than here. I was impressed before I even received the product. So after you buy the product but before you get it they email you a list of tips or suggestions that you can do with the Rose Toner.  I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied and you will be too</li>
    <li> I was recommended to buy this from AJ at instanatural. I am absolutely in love with all instanatural products! Great value for the money 100% all natural and has multiple uses! Will buy again and again</li>
    <li> Love this rose water!  It has a wonderful aroma and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth!  I have used it in my face and sunburned body.</li>
    <li> Incredible toner.  My face hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in years!  I&#x27;ll be buying this one over and over!</li>
    <li> This rose water is lovely. The smell is heavenly because it is PURE rose water not artificial . My skin loves it. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair. I would reccommended it . I use it as a toner . I am very happy with it. A great product for a great price. Love this company!</li>
    <li> The Moroccan Rose water is amazing. My skin feels clear  and refreshed after using it. It smells amazing and I only need a tiny amount to cover my whole face. It even helps heal angry blemishes and eliminates redness. This product is definitely going to stay a staple in my skin care repertoire.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> I love it! My first time using this brand and it won&#x27;t be my last. Not to mention the great service. It arrived quickly and the provider followed up and made sure I was satisfied...</li>
    <li> I LOVED the first bottle of this rose water I received and was on top of ordering another as soon as I needed to. Unfortunately, the second bottle is much different. The scent is strange/strong and is not having the same effect on my skin. Will be trying a different brand.</li>
    <li> I had never used rose water before ordering this and I am so glad I did. I have really sensitive skin but it&#x27;s also oily so I like to use a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toner can be too harsh for my skin so I tired this. It smells great and makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT - NOTHING BAD TO SAY! IT&#x27;S ALL NATURAL AND LEAVES MY FACE &amp; BODY FEELING SOFT AND CLEAN PLUS PREPARES FACE N NECK PERFECTLY B4 PUTTING ON REGULAR MOISTURIZING CREAM!!!! TRY IT!!!!! SO MANY BENEFITS FOR ALL SKIN TYPES!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL MY FAMILY ANS FRIENDS FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT BENEFITS</li>
    <li> Excellent for my sensible, acne prone skin. It feels very refreshing while keeping it clean. I like to used with my clay mask as well and leaves my face squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> The rose water makes my skin feel nice. I put it in a glass spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I was using a different rose water product prior to purchasing InstaNatural and noticed a difference between the two immediately.  InstaNatural tightened my skin more and left it feeling softer.  It has only been a couple of weeks since I started using it, so I&#x27;m hoping after a few more weeks of usage,  I will see an improvement with skin discoloration.</li>
    <li> It helps makes my hair stronger and softer!</li>
    <li> My SO uses rose scent, and I prefer it.  When I had a chance to review some of these pure &amp; natural rose products, I jumped on the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s her take on this: Insta natural Moroccan Rose Water&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely fragrance that stays a bit but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you. It did a really good job of cleaning my face and neck and it was a nice pick me up. It would be really refreshing chilled but I keep it in the bathroom so it is handy to use a lot. It&#x27;s nice as just a light scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, I liked it one her, had a clean rose scent, not cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rcvd a sample for review.</li>
    <li> I love the product but it is too expensive for the size so I give it 3 stars</li>
    <li> I recently received a bottle of this to review for my blog. I could not be more pleased. I used this in the shower and I used it all over my body and hair, as the bottle indicates.&lt;br /&gt;A hair rinse after shampoo&lt;br /&gt;A face cleanser&lt;br /&gt;An all over body cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was so incredibly soft, I could not believe it. I have been testing many muds, masks and cleansers and have felt clean, but never as much as with this rosewater. Such a simple beauty solution. It meets so many needs. I will be using this for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> Looking for that hint of romance and relaxation in your bath? Look no further this rose water has a wonderfuly potent and calming scent.</li>
    <li> I am another big fan of their rose water too! It is so natural and perfect for my skin.Actually it is great for any skin type! It just hydrates,refreshed,moisturized at a same time. Rose water has natural calming and soothing properties.Maintains the pH level of skin to make it soft and supple and add a glow .Excellent cleanser, toner, &amp; moisturizer.Helpful for sunburn and roughness. You can also add this toner with a face mask for extra glow. I love it because it&#x27;s natural, alcohol free, smell amazing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I use a cotton pad to apply on my face.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a61ecebe5baee0e6b55af9eea34a412]]Back in January of this year, I began seeking alcohol-free, natural alternatives for after shaves and facial cleansers. I have been using a self-concocted mixture of pure patchouli oil (you may be amazed at the topical benefits) and alcohol-free, additive-free distilled witch hazel (another wonderful topical substance). Frankly, I had NO clue how great Rose Water is as well. Always willing to investigate new avenues of Earth&#x27;s natural bounties, I gave this Morroccan Rose Water a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it as a direct aftershave via cotton swab. Heh, as a dude, the rose scent may be a bit foo-foo when used by itself, but the scent only lingers perhaps half-an-hour. However, I then added it to my concoction of patchouli and witch hazel to great success. The sweet rose overtones are diminished but melds in just right with the earthy patchouli, and I get all the compounded topical goodies these forgotten natural wonders hold in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, for those curious about my mad alchemist aftershave mixture, I currently use 20 drops of pure patchouli oil in a 4 oz glass spray bottle, then half distilled witch hazel, half rose water, shake very vigorously, spritz on cotton swab, and feel refreshed. My youngest brother has also taken up using my mixture as an after shave tonic since he has far more sensitive skin than I and prone to acne breakouts with any synthetic product.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my fridge. It goes on a cotton pad and feels cool and refreshing on my face. Yes it removes my foundation. Yes it smells amazing, like crushed rose petals, and not the cheapy roses either.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a facial toner but surprisingly it&#x27;s multipurpose .use this in my bath as well and also in facial mask .terrific multipurpose product !</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product that I am enjoying very much. I also appreciated the thoughtful follow up to make sure I was happy with the product and to answer any questions I might have. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> Works great for toning!</li>
    <li> It was my second experience with a Skin Toner. I found this Product way better than the product I used earlier. It has an authentic sweet fragrance of a Rose. My skin looks much clearer and has become softer. This Product has also helped my skin to maintain a proper  PH Balance(My skin was very sensitive earlier and was not able to maintain a proper balance.)&lt;br /&gt;The Delivery of the Product was just on time.</li>
    <li> So, I received this in conjunction with the rose hip seed oil from InstaNatural as a trial. I have to say….I am VERY impressed with their natural skincare line. Actually so impressed, that I ridded my medicine cabinet of all the ridiculously expensive skincare items I have used in the past. Goodby Strivectin! Goodby Skinceuticals! Goodby Cellex! My 50 year old skin just loves the InstaNatural line apparently….and what a pleasant surprise! I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts….not a ONE with this natural line. Had I known this, I would not have invested a small fortune in the &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; revolutionary skin care &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; touted by Drs &amp;#34;so and so&amp;#34;. With that said…I will continue using InstaNatural…my skin just loves it AND I love it too! I currently use the Morrocan Rose Water, Rosehip Oil and the B3 serum. I think I am going to try their Argan oil for my hair next. I cannot say enough great things about this company and will continue to order their products as long as they are around. (I was not paid to review, nor coaxed into writing a review by the way) Best Regards.</li>
    <li> Clean and refresh your skin with gentle ingredients. Lovely &amp;#34;non-chemical&amp;#34; fragrance. Leaves skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> It smells great! It makes my skin clean and moist. It feels very organic and made for people who love nature.</li>
    <li> After using this the first week I saw results happening instantly and it makes my face smell like roses. It has improved my skin making it soft and clean. My skin is sensitive and oily so most products I tend to break out and this product did not do that and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now. I&#x27;m very please with it. Will be purchasing this product as my toner and make up for now on. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Great product! I was looking online for new ways to update my beauty routine naturally and I found the InstaNatural&#x27;s line and I&#x27;m very impressed. I love the many uses for this rose water.</li>
    <li> This toner definitely smells like roses. The scent lingers for quite a while. I poured some into a small spray bottle and spritz it on my face after washing. My sensitive skin seems to like it. I have had no issues with redness. I plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> The quality of this rose water is wonderful. My skin loves it and I can see the difference right away after I use it. I will definitey be buying more. Thanks InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant of the healing properties of rose water and how it would affect me, but I was pleasantly surprised with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely hard water and on top of that, I have really bad ezcema on my face. Naturally, I wanted to find a toner that was gentle on my skin but would also help balance the pH. Rose water worked amazingly on my skin! Not only was it soothing for my dry skin, it help moisturize and tighten my pores. I really love this product and I&#x27;m so happy to be adding it to my everyday face routine.</li>
    <li> Its okay, the smell isnt over powering, which is good. However, I was disappointed with the effectiveness of it as a toner and a cleanser.</li>
    <li> didnt really help for under eye moisture and reduction of baggy eyes, which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Skin is blemish free and baby soft! Asked the company for a larger size and since they didn&#x27;t offer one they sent me a complimentary one! BEST customer service I have experienced on Amazon-will continue to buy this product and if you are looking, try it, it&#x27;s wonderful! Not overpowering at all, just gives a faint scent that smells great! I use it on my entire body-should be called all over body toner!!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a Rose Water and the vendor Instanatural LLC.  I rated the seller as Excellent for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-My product arrived sooner than what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;-Before I received the rose water, the seller sent me an email on all of the uses (note that I was only purchasing the rose water to use on my hair).&lt;br /&gt;-When I talked with a representative from InstaNatural about their product the rep was courteous and understanding.  It wasn&#x27;t as though their customer service was nonexistent after they got my money.  They were really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product now for over 1 week and I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair (great smell by the way) and I had a small cut on my neck, so I used the rose water on the irritated area and it soothe the irritation immediately.  I would recommend anyone to try the product as it has some many beneficial uses and this seller is very prompt, courteous and helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it as a toner and cleanser for my face.  I love that it is 100% rose water with nothing else added.  No chemicals, and just a gentle rose fragrance - no strong fragrances to make me sneeze!  I try to use skincare products that are as natural and additive free as possible, and this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also surprised to read about all the other uses it has.  You can use it on your hair, it can be an acne treatment, it can even be used on sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will keep it in my beauty regimen for various reasons, definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells.  would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing beauty product. Great floral scent and freshenes the skin. It has become a beauty stable as it clears redness and zaps any pimps I develop. Doubles as a makeup setter.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, mature skin and so I dilute it with distilled water to use as a toner...just in case. Even so, it leaves my skin feeling very refreshed. It still has a strong rose scent and I have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Leaked. Fragrance is very. Very super strong..!&lt;br /&gt;Returned it, charged me with restocking fee.</li>
    <li> When I was offered an opportunity to try some Moroccan Rose Water, I got a bottle for my wife to try. Her comments are below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I have been using the Rose Water as a cleanser and toner for about two weeks.  First of all, it is becoming like aromatherapy when I use the product.  The scent is refreshing and delightful.  The product has shown remarkable results on some of the deep scarring on my face.  Over the years, persistent acne has scarred some areas of my face.  I have tried many products to improve these areas.  Some of them were harsh and drying, and I didn&#x27;t like them at all.  The first time I applied the rose water, it was so gentle and refreshing that I assumed it would not be effective as a toner.  I was completely wrong.  At the end of the first week, I could see a difference in the look of the deep scars.  The surrounding skin seemed to have been hydrated and toned so that the scars were not as noticeable.  This improvement continued through the second week.  No previously used product has come close to the results of the Moroccan Rose Water.  I am very pleased, highly recommend the product, and will continue to purchase and use this to improve my skin tone.  Thank you for this remarkable product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample of Moroccan Rose Water was provided by InstaNatural for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> So refreshing!! Used it in my hair as well and made my hair soft.</li>
    <li> This toner has such a sweet and delicious rosy smell. I&#x27;m not one to look forward to daily skin maintenance - it feels like a chore. But for the first time, I actually do look forward to my daily regimen because of this product. I actually find myself caring for my skin more frequently as an excuse to use this product more often! Not only does it smell fantastic, it also leaves my skin feeling very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and refreshed. It&#x27;s great after a face mask. It feels like I&#x27;m giving myself a special a gift whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> FOUND A KEEPER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love that my skin doesnt feel dry after using this product, Living in a tropical climate during humid days the last thing you want on your face is moisturizer coz it tends to get oily after a while, and with this product i can actually give my moisturizer a break!! and still keep my is skin soft and less oily (than what it use to be) will definitely restock.</li>
    <li> Does not really show results</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised.  I add this product to my shampoo, use it as a toner and add it to my homemade facial wash.  It&#x27;s also a great hair conditioner...I mix it with olive oil and leave it on my hair for 30 minutes, then wash as usual.  Super shiny and manageable hair!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the product! My skin feels great.</li>
    <li> My skin LOVES Rose Water, and this product more than lived up to my expectations. It cools, soothes, and brightens my skin. I only wish it was available in a larger bottle. Next time I&#x27;ll order several bottles. A great product, and a keeper!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this toner and can&#x27;t wait to purchase again. I not only used it as a base will deep conditioning, but I also used it in my infusion water and it tastes just as amazing as it smells!! I have and will continue to recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! You can add it to your shampoo, add it to your bathwater, its for more than just your face!!  I have extremely sensitive skin, and this has truly been a blessing!!</li>
    <li> This toner is great!  It makes my skin smooth, less red, and my pores are smaller.  As a result, my skin is not dry and flaky. I will order this product again. It has now become an essential product in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a product to clean my face that was not greasy and did not require water and decided to try this. I&#x27;m very satisfied. Cleans well and leaves my 66 year old skin feeling smooth and slightly tingly. I put on moisturizer after cleaning. The rose scent is very strong but now I&#x27;m used to going to bed smelling like roses.</li>
    <li> Great work item arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> ~~ Quick Quote: A natural product that leaves my girlfriend very pleased with soft, not-dried skin. If you&#x27;ve dealt with oily or acne-prone skin, it&#x27;s certainly worth a try! ~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When InstaNatural approached me about reviewing their products, there were a couple that caught my eye, but the Rose Water was something that my girlfriend requested. The following is her honest feedbck:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;ve long since battled acne. Not the awful kind that requires prescriptions and trips to the dermatologist, but definitely stress related, makeup related and just the sheer fact that I have oily skin. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried MANY toners. All of them promise to help fight acne and clean right down to the poors; which usually meant its going to burn the heck out of your face, but you&#x27;re still going to break out. Oh, and cure shininess? Forget about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I like best about this rose water toner;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s natural. No chemicals. Just rose water.&lt;br /&gt;-It dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;-It leaves my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;-it smells FANTASTIC.&lt;br /&gt;-My skin takes longer to get shiny through the day.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in my acne. A few pimples will pop up here and there, but I have not had too many major break out spots after nearly a month of use (and I use it in the morning and before bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger bottle!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t use toner, but having been shopping with my girlfriend for beauty products I know that she doesn&#x27;t just put anything on her face! I&#x27;ve been instructed to buy more, and that&#x27;s enough for me to recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s rose water without reservations.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this toner. It is so so so gentle, but it really gets the job done. It removes literally every speck of my makeup, and it&#x27;s so gentle that I&#x27;m not afraid to use it around my eyes. I love it SO much I&#x27;d buy about a million bottles. It keeps my skin even, acne free, and feeling super clean after I use it. It&#x27;s crazy to think about how much makeup is left over after already washing my face. This product is a MUST have and really does work!</li>
    <li> It really does smell like roses, so if for any reason you don&#x27;t like the scent of roses, then you more than likely won&#x27;t like this product. I thought I better be up front and honest about this because that is why it&#x27;s called Moroccan Rose Water. I wouldn&#x27;t want you to get it and think I deceived you or anything, so really and truly, it is a very rose like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved how my skin felt after using this product for about a week. I don&#x27;t have acne but I do have some pores on my cheeks that I have constantly battled and while using the Moroccan Rose Water, it seemed to help them be less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try this on my scalp and then shampooed my hair. It left my hair smelling fresh and clean. Wherever I went I had people asking me what kind of shampoo I used because they couldn&#x27;t place the scent. I just smiled and said it was a natural remedy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last two weeks and it really leaves your face very smooth. I am using it as a hydrator and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I apply the rose water with a cotton ball. The smell of the rose water is heavenly and even lingers on the cotton ball long after it has dried. A couple of dabs of the rose water on the cotton ball is enough for my whole face. I have been applying it after being in the sun to ward off any skin burns. My skin feels so good after applying rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using the rose water to clean my face after gardening. It definitely removes dirt because I can see it on the cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has not reacted to the rose water, though my husband&#x27;s burned back did tingle and itch after I applied rose water (subsided within 5 minutes). Make sure you test a small patch before applying to burned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s great as an all natural toner after I wash my face. I also use it over my face at the end of the day if I&#x27;m too tired to wash the make up. It&#x27;s super hydrating!</li>
    <li> First off, the product smells, feels, and works beautifully.  Secondly, the customer service is excellent.  And it&#x27;s one of those product lines you know you&#x27;ll use in the future.  I will buy any new product from this company.  So far, I&#x27;ve purchased three: 1. the Moroccan Rose Water, the C Serum, and the Rosehip Seed Oil.  I&#x27;m in love with all of them.  They make my skin feel great!  And I know there are no artificial ingredients that are harmful - a great find indeed!</li>
    <li> Love it. Absolutely fabulous. Amazing natural toner and you can&#x27;t beat the smell. You&#x27;ll love how your face looks. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I have used this rose water for about 10 days. I can&#x27;t tell any change of my skin. I have been use other brands&#x27; rose hip oil for 6 months, and I am very impressed with it. So I did some research and decided to try insta natural&#x27;s rose water. I trust the reviews, and I ordered 2 bottles. To be honest it&#x27;s not bad but it gives my face a really bad odor. When I first spray it on my face, it smells really good. After a while, it starts to smell like a rotted rose. I try really hard to like this product, but the odor is just really bad.</li>
    <li> Definitely buy this product!  I use as a toner right after I cleanse my face and I can almost instantaneously feel my pores tighten and become smaller.  My skin feels smooth and soft.  I love that this is chemical free and natural and comes in a big bottle that will last a long time.  Love the products from this company and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I liked it, but I didn&#x27;t love it. My MIL however loves it and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this toner.  My post menopausal skin was in need of help.  I had dry patches and bumps everywhere.  I tried this plus their Vitamin C cleanser and my face looks just beautiful.  It&#x27;s healthy, it took away a rosacea looking patch by my nose and has really brightened my skin tone.  My skin is very sensitive but this just works wonderfully.  It leaves my face feeling soft afterward too.  The smell is amazing.  I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, long lasting scent. Very gentle and hydrating for the skin. Using this rosewater as the toner after face wash has become my routine and I will be sure to purchase more of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing the company may consider improving in the future is making it available in larger volume (100mL is not a whole lot if you use it daily) and also in a spray bottle for ease of application.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I had discontinued using &amp;#34;toners&amp;#34; as I felt they were too dryng.  This is a product that makes your skin feel wonderful. My face feels softer, the smell of roses makes the use very enjoyable.  I would and have recommended this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This rose water makes my face feel nice and clean and doesnt leave it tight. Just natural. I love it.</li>
    <li> I want to love this but my issue is the smell... It&#x27;s so strong! It&#x27;s right under my nose literally and all I can smell! Can I cut this with something? I&#x27;d really like to benefit from using this daily but the smell is hard to ignore!</li>
    <li> So refreshing. I use this as a toner, after I wash my face and before I use my moisturizer. I believe it opens my skin so that my moisturizer is more effective. I feel it makes my skin look much younger using this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin. The product leaves it  smoother and fully hydrated. Also, I noticed that since I have been using the rose water my skin is healthier. The bottle lasts almost two months and I apply the rosa water on my face twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;I  highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like roses</li>
    <li> My skin feels great. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel any tingling...a normal sign to me that my pores are being penetrated. But it does smell amazing, and my skin looks good.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and works well as a toner.</li>
    <li> This toner smells and feels amazing! When I got the product the cap was cracked and I was worried about the toner being exposed to air so I contacted the company and asked for a new cap. Their customer service was amazing and they sent me a whole new one. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a visible difference in how my skin looks after using this. I use it as an astringent after a face wash, and it gets off more dirt. I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks now, and have had positive results.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and I use this as a toner. So far, I&#x27;m just noticing my skin is less oily and is not dry. My main use of rose water is as an ingredient in my hairspray. I like that the smell blends well with the other ingredients, giving my hair a fresh scent. It also helps with moisture retention as well.</li>
    <li> I like the rose water. It leaves skin feeling soft.  I will continue to use and maybe this will help with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ever!!!</li>
    <li> Beautuful on my face. I love the natural scent and it removes all dirt at the end of the day.  It&#x27;s very gentle and nice on my skin and has not caused any breakout or problems. I don&#x27;t see it as a toner as much as a cleanser that I use to remove impurities at days&#x27; end but perhaps it is toning and I&#x27;m not aware. I just like that it&#x27;s natural and light and I can use it daily without stripping my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Rose Water before but was looking for a natural sort of toner. Really love this product!  It smells nice (but isn&#x27;t overpowering) &amp; it really softens my skin.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I received the product in good condition. The packaging was excellent. Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with the product itself. I had two days to test out the rose water toner. My package was shipped internationally via a freight forwarder. I did the spot test as recommended especially since I have very sensitive skin and all seemed well. I used the toner on my face as part of my normal skin care routine. The next morning I woke up with hives on my face and neck. I am afraid to use it again to make the hives worse. I really wanted to like this product because there were so many good reviews. I didn’t mind having to pay the extra government duties and taxes to have this toner because I was sold on the reviews. I am a bit disappointed because now I paid twice the price for a product I may never be able to use again. I rated this two stars instead of one because the packaging was excellent considering it was a glass bottle and it was shipped internationally. One of my fears was that it might get broken along the way and I am happy that it didn&#x27;t. I might give it to someone else to use who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s fine, I use it in my hair mist (water, glycerine and rose water in a spray bottle) helps the glycerine make my hair softer. Smells very, very strongly. Tried to use it as a toner - as expected it made me break out. Rose is a skin irritant! If you have sensitive skin this isn&#x27;t something you want to put on your face.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to go au naturel but as I have acne prone skin, I think I&#x27;ve gotta stick with salicylic acid in the the cleanser or the toner. The struggle continues!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love the smell and that it is 100% natural. My wife bought it and I started using it on my face about a week ago. Instead of having splotchy skin, it is starting to tone up and look and feel much healthier. We will buy again! Thank you.</li>
    <li> smells pure and natural,good.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  I use it after washing my face and after face masks.</li>
    <li> Really nice product makes my skin feel smooth and smells like roses. Arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this fragrant rose water. I use it along with Braggs Apple cider vinegar to make a great, natural face toner. My skin always feels soft when using this.</li>
    <li> Far and away the best pure rosewater I&#x27;ve tried in decades of using rosewater toner. My local &#x27;rose-brewer&#x27; isn&#x27;t making rosewater right now so I tried different brands on Amazon: hands-down this is the best of the lot for quality &amp; is surprisingly affordable too. I use rosewater on a cotton pad after washing my face to remove residual cleanser; as a substitute for washing when my skin is sensitive (per doctor&#x27;s recommendation), &amp; in hot weather during the day to cleanse &amp; refresh my skin (followed by SPF). It&#x27;s one of nature&#x27;s little miracles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how or why it&#x27;s &#x27;Moroccan&#x27; but it&#x27;s made with water &amp; 100% Rosa Damascena, one of the Old Roses &amp; the finest of the rose species for skin: there are no other ingredients.  The quality is immediately obvious: for those who&#x27;ve posted that their product smells &#x27;off&#x27; I highly recommend returning it to Amazon as you&#x27;ve gotten a bottle that has been stored improperly or for too long. I haven&#x27;t had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Rosewater contains no alcohol or other elements that act as preservative so I store mine in the &#x27;fridge to prolong it&#x27;s life &amp; have no problems. I decant about a 3-day supply into a travel bottle &amp; store that with my other facial products for ease of access. Unless you&#x27;re going to use the entire bottle very soon upon receipt I highly recommend doing this.  Refrigerated rosewater on cotton pads is also very soothing placed on the brow or the eyelids while you&#x27;re lying down, if you have a tension headache.</li>
    <li> Wow, it smells great, and makes my skin so so soft.  I have aging skin and bought this because I live in Denver where the climate is dry .  This is a fabulous toner , the best part is either the customer service or the natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Since receiving the Rose Water Face Toner, I have been storing it in the refrigerator when not using.  The coolness adds to the healthy feeling on my skin when used.  The best toner I have used.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it let my skin become better.</li>
    <li> I love spritzing this on my face at night and both before and after I put on my makeup. It&#x27;s highly refreshing! I just poured a bit in a misting spray  bottle and I love it! Beautiful natural rose scent!</li>
    <li> I was contacted by InstaNatural to try out some of their natural beauty products. Once I saw what they offered I jumped at the chance to try their items out. The first one I have tried out is the InstaNatural 100% Pure Argan Oil which I love, the next one I tried out is the InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water. By the way, I am able to use all of their products together which is also a big bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Rose water is made from pure Moroccan roses. It is calming and soothing for all skin types. It is good for your skin because it maintains your skin&#x27;s pH level to make it soft and supple and it still adds a little glow to your skin. It is a cleanser, toner and moisturizer. It is also helpful for sunburn and rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You can also use Rose Water for your hair, it not only makes it soft and shiny but also improves the quality and strength of your hair.  Lastly, Rose Water is great aromatherapy, the smell is heavenly and goes great with a bath. If you are worried about smelling like roses all day one thing I did like was although the smell is very pleasing it wears right off. My husband loved it as an aftershave and we had to make sure he did not smell of roses which he did not nor did I when using it on my face or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have to admit I did not find many useful qualities for it and I do not think it is a must use every day item. However, I am glad to have it. As I found it more useful to add to baths, and to use for sunburns and rashes in general. It reminds me of a sort of Witch Hazel, but it smells much better. Not a bad idea to keep a bottle around especially for the price. It will definitely come in handy at some point especially if you prefer natural cures for kids. I had no problem putting this on Xavier&#x27;s cuts or bruises as it cleared them up right away and did not hurt him like normal antiseptic does when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  InstaNatural strive to have their customers 100% satisfied. Their logo is actually &amp;#34;we truly care about you&amp;#34;. The Rose Water comes in a 4 fl. oz (120 mL) glass bottle. Trust me while experimenting with this a little goes a long way.

    <li> I had the opportunity to review the Moroccan Rose Water and was extremely excited as I have heard the many uses for the product. The idea behind sales by instanatural are cleanser, toner, hydrator and replenisher. The product comes in a sealed glass bottle at 4 fl oz. which is plenty for a number of uses to really get the feel for a product.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser and Toner- During the summer months I by no means where any makeup unless its necessary, I have NO skin issues and my skin is a normal tone(not greasy, not dry) more combination, no acne issues..BUT my son does have some acne so I tried on me and then on him. For me it cleaned any dirty and oil and left my skin feeling soft and pleasant scented. For my son it didn&#x27;t inflame any areas in fact he said it felt almost tingly and made his skin feel soft. *We have both used for a week and no skin issues or irritation noted*&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing and so long lasting that I did add it to my shampoo and conditioner while in shower and the scent last for entire shower. After patting dry I did put some on my hands and rubbed onto my skin and the scent lasted through most of the day and to many the scent was noticeable. Finally I did rub some into my hair after it had dried just for some extra smell.&lt;br /&gt;**Finally I did use the Rose Water on my nails after removing the nail color with a cotton ball and I did notice it made it easier to fix my cuticles and clean of the the nail** Im very happy with the product and it is perfect for many uses besides ones noted.&lt;br /&gt;-not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;-preservative free&lt;br /&gt;-no artificial fragrance&lt;br /&gt;-100%natural&lt;br /&gt;-made in the USA</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I use it to help my eyes with the pollen.</li>
    <li> Great and refreshing.  Leaves my skin feeling clean.  Smells so good.  Trying to find a little bottle to carry in my purse for a day at the beach or pool to use it in the go too!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it.  I assume it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing.  Love the scent!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin.. Smells nice.. I only used it 2 times but so far I like it.. Did not irritate my skin.. Skin look good and felt good after I used it..</li>
    <li> I did leave my skin soft but eventually my skin started to break out. Also the smell was way too strong. Was disappointed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in good condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells amazing and feels great on my face.  I&#x27;m using it as a facial toner.</li>
    <li> Not using consistently but OK</li>
    <li> Arrived immediately and is very authentic!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, very good product!</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered two of these and was planning on returning one, but I love this product so much that after using it for a couple weeks I am holding onto the extra for when I run out.  The smell is wonderful, and I love using it as a toner after cleansing.  I recently switched all of my facial products over to more organic, natural brands, and I have been extremely pleased.  My face has never looked better.  Can&#x27;t wait to try this in the bath water.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This rose water is excellent. I use it as a toner, and it leaves my face feeling and looking great. I will definitely order this again. Wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Got this for a friend and she said it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only started to use it and I like the pleasant smell. I am not sure if I am seeing anything radical but so far it has not been a conflict to my skin when applied as a toner which is GREAT for me since my skin tends to be sensitive.</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels and smells wonderful! So glad I found this, I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> perfect !!!&lt;br /&gt;made my face soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I love this product and will buy again.  I wish I could get it on subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin, and as I&#x27;m getting older it&#x27;s getting acne prone (WHAAAT???).  This rose water toner really helps with both issues and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, not for sure if it is making a change since I been using it for a very short time. My face does seem to be softer and the few breakouts (that a person over 40+ should not have) are clearing up with out new in its place. I give 4 stars cause I never rate anything to the 5&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic! It has such a delicate scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used several of the products from Insta Natural and feel confident that this company uses only the finest of ingredients--pure and organic and natural. This produce is great to splash on your face. I am hyper allergic to perfumes, so this is a great substitute (rose water) as it smells wonderful without giving me asthma. I use it also as a facial toner after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
    <li> I really like this product and will most likely be repurchasing, helped with my breakouts and redness.</li>
    <li> Always refreshing, and perfect for toning</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Already seeing beautifully toned face! Dark spots going away!</li>
    <li> It smelled nice at first. I have been using it every night for about a week now and the nice smell it did have is slowly vanishing and starting to smell stale. The product has not maintained its fresh rose smell very long. Such a disappointment I had hoped it lasted longer too seeing I bought it to add to my nightly face cream.</li>
    <li> We used the Rose Water (diluted) as a deodorant in our bathroom and utility room, leaving a pleasant aroma. We intend to use it for other listed indications. We are very satisfied about this product.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I really love the Rosehip toner.  After I wash my face, this toner removes all and any last traces of makeup.  It doesn’t sting or burn.  I usually am not a fan of rose scented products, but the rose smell is subtle and doesn’t linger, so I’m a fan.  It leaves my skin soft and doesn’t dry it out.  I love that I can pronounce the ingredient in it, which is just one, because one is all it needs.  At best of all, it is at a price that I can afford, and I’m not paying for chemicals.  And on Amazon it’s free shipping.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I normally use it after I use derma roller on my face, scrub or anytime I see something on my face that I don&#x27;t like. It works perfectly well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if this product is the answer to all my skincare prayers, but I&#x27;m sure hoping it is. Even if you don&#x27;t need anything from this company, I still suggest you purchase something from them just so you can experience EXCELLENT customer service. When they state that they will stand behind their product and make certain you are completely pleased? They really mean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Water smells nice and leaves you feeling fresh and clean. I&#x27;ll definitely order from them again. And it&#x27;s a nice fat bottle, too. :)</li>
    <li> perfect and useful! if you are in a long journey, it will be helpful for you skin, hair and body!</li>
    <li> I love this product and will be ordering again. However I wish you would put it in a pump bottle or a spray glass bottle. Smells wonderful and feels great on my skin. Well done product.&lt;br /&gt;Mari</li>
    <li> I use this as a toner after I wash my face.  It smells amazing and feels great!</li>
    <li> Amazing product...smells great and it naturally moisturize your skin... Love it</li>
    <li> Good alternative to witch hazel. Less irritating on skin!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great cleanser and toner for your skin this is great. There is not fragrances so nothing to knock you out from the smell. It is pleasant smell and easy to use. Before I used moisturizers or a serum. It helps prep my skin to take the next product the best. I have combination skin and some acne prone skin and it works well. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! It states it is great for all skin types. Let&#x27;s say one day you are out and your regular sunscreen doesn&#x27;t provide enough coverage. Well if you got a little too much sun lightly dab this on the skin to help calm the skin down from the burn. There is another way to use this. I didn&#x27;t use it this way this time, but you could use it on your hair.</li>
    <li> Holy I love this!!!!!  I have some really sensitive skin.  This product is totally gentle and feels and smells great.  My face is so much more moisturized.  I just can not get over how much better my skin feels in just a few days.  I am totally all for this product.  I am going to ask for this for all presents every year!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! I was asked for an honest and unbiased opinion, and this is mine.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this as my toner after I cleanse. I love the smell, the feel, and a little goes a long way with this. Definitely something I would purchase again and definitely would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Sweet smell. I add a tiny bit to my lotion and hair oil. I can&#x27;t wait to add it to my shampoo.</li>
    <li> I actually used mine as a toner for the last few weeks. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really cleanse, but when I saw the extra makeup and oil it pulled from my skin while using it as a toner, I was convinced it would make a very effective cleanser too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using this product for the last 2 weeks, my skin looks and feels amazing. My acne has improved a bit and my skin has been incredibly moisturized, soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I am pretty amazed by how effective this product is. I was interested in trying it because I have recently developed acne again -- the middle -aged variety. I went to a dermatologist and was given oral antibiotics as well as dapzone topical. After two weeks of using this my face was clearing up, but  I had a horrific sore throat, cold sores, yeast infection and everything I ate tasted like metal. I couldn&#x27;t stand the cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I read a review by another user that she had the same mid-life acne and this worked, I was excited, but not overly optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that this stuff is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me be clear about what it has done for me. It does not prevent the formation of the annoying cysts that I get, those are so far beneath the surface of my skin that it would be impossible. However, it does stop them from developing into full-blown nasty surface sores/scars. It is nothing short of a miracle, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike stuff like with salicylic acid it doesn&#x27;t leave the part of your face that is NOT a zit red and angry. Instead, this makes your skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it is making my face look better without throwing my entire system out of whack. Antibiotics are powerful, but the physical cost is too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that you WILL smell like roses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a free sample of this product to review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used rose water in cooking before but never for my skin. (Note - this brand is only recommended for external use) I used this as a face cleanser and toner and it&#x27;s just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been working in the garden a lot this summer and when I come in my face is grimy and overheated. This is SO refreshing and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Rose water face toner is a great right after cleansing. This rose water smells great but is not overly floral while being more moisturizing than other chemical toners. The size is also a great value as the bottle is enough to use on hair in addition to use as facial toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the products for review free of charge. I was not compensated in any other way. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Trying product for free for my review. First I&#x27;d like to say I love anything with rose water I think it&#x27;s amazing. Always makes whatever I use it on my hair, face, body, feet. Makes them soft</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair and skin love it</li>
    <li> nice feeling on your face and removes oil and dirt very well</li>
    <li> simply adore it. love how universal it is. hair, acne, sunburns pretty much anything. I dont know why its not to be taken internally though. Rose water is wonderful to cook with and use in skinny waters.</li>
    <li> I wish I had tried this long ago. I am using this as a toner, and with my shampoo. My skin is less oily, and looks great and clear. My hair is much more smooth and shiny (and no, I did not change shampoos). I am working on getting rid of the chemicals in my life, and this makes it so much easier! It smells wonderful, but it is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I know that experts say toners/astringents are import to use regularly. That said, all toners break me out because my skin is so sensitive. This is the first toner that I can actually use. I used it daily before my serum for the first week and my skin felt great. Towards the ends of the week I did notice my cheeks getting a little dry so I cut back to every other day. It smells great and my skin really is noticeably smooth and more even.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! I have not used a toner in years. The smell is yummy and light. I am a week into using the toner and I have noticed a glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the rose water.  It smells wonderful (doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like), it feels so refreshing &amp; every time I get a whiff of it, it lifts my spirits.</li>
    <li> Since using this, I&#x27;ve less breakouts and don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from this or getting a tiny bit of color during summer, but see my horribly dark, hideous circles, like 80% less than I have my entire life.  I&#x27;ve gotten darker suntans than now, and still had the dark circles like crazy.  I tried to save $5 a bottle and got a different brand and it stunk like stagnant dog water....this one smells divine, and I&#x27;m not a fan of flowery scents unless it&#x27;s real roses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Moroccan Rosewater, Argan Oil &amp; Rosehip Seed Oil for the past month and I am extremely happy with the results. I wanted to give it some time before reviewing it and my skin has reacted really well to it. I use the Argan Oil in the morning as a day moisturizer, the Moroccan Rosewater as a toner at night &amp; the Rosehip Seed Oil as my night moisturizer. I&#x27;ve also used the oils in my hair, nails &amp; neck to great results. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer &amp; would recommend their products.</li>
    <li> I prefer the oil separate from the rose water.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been using this stuff for about a month on my face. My skin as gotten softer, pores have gotten smaller, and redness has gone down a lot! Will recommend to my friends. :)</li>
    <li> I love how soft and toned the Moroccan Rose Water makes my skin feel. And, as a bonus, the smell is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Rose fragrance is pleasant and their after-sell service is extremely good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and costomer service is very impressive</li>
    <li> I love this Rose water face toner. I use it after i cleanse my face with ceptaphil anti-bacterial soap. My face is super sensitive yet oily and pron to breakouts..ugghhhhh... but the combination of the two leaves my face feeling soft not tight..refreshing. i feel the difference. im going to continue to use this product im highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> The item smell really good,it make my skin really soft, I love it!</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel very clean but does&#x27;not dry out my skin.  In fact ,  my face  feels very soft  and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I absolutely looove this product! I use it on my face and even in a moisturizing spritz that I made for my hair! Its moisturization properties are off the charts!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this rose water! and the customer service is just as great as the product! it has a wonderful smell and it&#x27;s so great that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all natural. i use this as a toner and as natural eye drops and it&#x27;s been working great.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of Moroccan Rose Water.  One for me and one for my daughter.  We have both been using it as a facial toner.  It is really wonderful!  Makes our skin feel soft and smooth before adding a moisturizer and we both love the scent.  It is just right. Not too overwhelming.  My Daughter loves the scent so much that she dabs a little on some days instead of perfume. We are both really pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Earlier, I left a one-star review for this product, as the bottle I got smelled AWFUL. I mean, just horrific. As soon as I left the review, the seller contacted me, refunded my money and sent me a new bottle to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually spent several days now trying to figure out how I feel about it. The first thing that&#x27;s clear to me is that previously, I did indeed get a batch that was somehow spoiled. The fresh bottle they sent me did not smell like the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very uniquely scented rose water, and it&#x27;s VERY VERY STRONG. It lingers wherever it goes for hours. When I tossed a used cotton pad into the bathroom bin, it made the entire bathroom smell that way for the entire day before finally fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, within that unique smell is some scent I can&#x27;t identify that keeps putting me off. I&#x27;ve seriously been taking random sniffs for days and thinking as hard as possible to try to figure out what this reminds me of that I just can&#x27;t remember. It&#x27;s not really good, actually, but it&#x27;s also not horrible. But most of all, whatever it is, it&#x27;s NOT ROSES. I have several other brands of rose waters that I cycle through using, and overall, this rose water does not smell ANYTHING like those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, whatever it smells like is a very familiar scent, but I still can&#x27;t put my finger on it. I had my husband sniff it and he had to think a while before finally guessing it smelled like cheap perfume. I told him it was rose water, and he frowned and thought for a while longer and said, \\&quot;Maybe over-extracted roses?\\&quot; Since I don&#x27;t know the process for making rose water, I have no idea how it works and if that&#x27;s a thing, but it did sort of match in my mind. Like how over-extracted coffee smells bad, you know? It still smells like coffee, but it has some other note in there that makes it sour. So it really does feel like maybe it&#x27;s some seriously aggressive attempt to make this smell as powerful as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, scents are one of those things that are very personal and tastes vary widely. I see there are a ton of reviews that enthuse about the good smell of this product. I am not sure why no one else is smelling what I am. I know that I&#x27;m not nose-deaf, and in fact am one of those \\&quot;super smeller\\&quot; people who have a heightened sense of smell and taste and can pick out subtle notes in a scent. And I know I know what roses smell like, and as I stated before I have several different brands of rose water I use, and they all smell like roses and nothing but roses. So this, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening here. I doubt that I got *yet another* spoiled bottle, but it&#x27;s still just not a product I would immediately identify as rose water if someone used it for a blind smell-test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Okay, wow, I went to go take a photo of the rose water so I could show the nice new label and that the rose water is perfectly clear, and I decided (against my better judgement) to taste it. That&#x27;s when I realized what it was that it smelled like. Soap. It doesn&#x27;t taste BAD, like, omg I have to spit this out bad, but it has a very distinct taste of soap. What it smells like is rose soap. It has a sort of artificial scent to it, which is why it was so difficult for me to identify. I was not expecting \\&quot;soap\\&quot; to be the scent I was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about you all, but I have tasted culinary grade rose water, and I have eaten turkish delight (one of the most traditional, common flavors is rose, and uses rosewater to impart that taste) and this is just not at all your standard rose water. It just is not it. When I use my other brands of rose water my husband sometimes remarks that I smell like turkish delight. As I mentioned earlier, when I presented him with this bottle, his first guess was *not* rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, really, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with this rose water, or why it&#x27;s so extraordinarily strong, why it lingers much (MUCH) longer than other rose waters, or why it has that extra, somewhat-artificial &#x27;soap&#x27; scent to it, but I know it&#x27;s not for me. Clearly, as you can see by other reviews, others find the scent delightful and love the product. I could not even use it on my face because the smell was too strong for me to actually keep on my skin. I put it on my wrist for a time and had no particular skin reaction, but I just couldn&#x27;t say how it would work as a facial toner because I could never get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I suppose I could say this much - try it, if you&#x27;re trying out rose waters, and rest assured that the seller absolutely DOES mean what it says when it offers a money-back guarantee. They were very quick to offer my money back and give me a new bottle, and they followed up on it quickly, communicating with me the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have every confidence - from experience - that if you try this and don&#x27;t like it, the company will take good care of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my previous review, which was based on the bad bottle I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but my bottle was just RANK. I&#x27;ve been buying an assortment of rose water products from a variety of sellers/brands these last few weeks and this was the only one with this particularly bad stench. I wish I knew how to describe it - it had a familiar quality to it, but I couldn&#x27;t keep sniffing it to figure it out; it was just so awful. And the smell... just clung to everything and lingered everywhere. I wanted to dispose of it without spreading the stink everywhere but even flushing it down the toilet made the bathroom reek. The worst part was that for some reason when I got it I didn&#x27;t believe my nose and put it on my face anyway before bed. I have had to wash my pillowcases and bedsheet 3 times to get the smell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know WHAT went wrong, but it was the worst rose water I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune to encounter. I kind of want to know if that&#x27;s just how this product smells in general or if I got a bad batch, but I don&#x27;t want to risk buying it again. Pew fif.r why it has that extra, somewhat-artificial &#x27;soap&#x27; scent to it, but I know it&#x27;s not for me. Clearly, as you can see by other reviews, others find the scent delightful and love the product. I could not even use it on my face because the smell was too strong for me to actually keep on my skin.

    <li> Fabulous Rose Water Toner.  I love the scent and it is very calming right before I lay down to sleep!  My skin feels fresh and healthy.  Great product !!!</li>
    <li> Works great and smells great. I use it on my hair and face and body and bath, I love it.</li>
    <li> The rose water smells nice on my face.. All I can say, I like it and have purchased it 3 times. It would be better if it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I am 63 years old with super-sensitive skin and this is the best product I have every used on my skin - wish I had found it 50 years ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been convinced about the benefits of using a toner but decided I might as well go the whole hog if I were serious about establishing a skin care regime. So having read the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this a go, although initially, I was a bit concerned reading some reviews objecting to the rose scent. To each her own but to me, the scent is divine. I store this toner (and all my other skin care products in the fridge) and it is very refreshing to apply the cold toner to a cleansed skin.  Have I noticed a difference? Having used this for only 10 days, it&#x27;s too early to give an informed review. My skin does feel tighter but it is hard to say whether it is due solely to this product or to a combination of the other 3 products I bought at the same time (Vit  C Serum, Hyaluronic Acid and Vit C Moisturiser). I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible effect on my pores yet, which is what I am really after from a toner. But as I&#x27;ve said, it&#x27;s early days yet.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a few days but the smell is heavenly without being overwhelming &amp; it refreshes my skin.  I look forward to improvements the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Moroccan rose water from InstrNatural about three months ago. I wanted to try a all natural produce on my skin. What I love about this produce if after I wash my face it feels dry and tight. Then I apply a little of the Moroccan rose water and my skin feels refreshed and soft. The pores on my cheeks have gotten smaller -- which amazes me. The InstraNatural stand by their products and are all natural.  I would recommend their products.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have both been using this and so far we love it.  It was shipped quickly and securely.  Would definitely purchase again and recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the Rosewater to use on my face as a toner. I now also put some in a small spritzer bottle and spray on my hair before blow drying. My hair smells wonderful smells and has extra shine. The seller is great about delivering the product when promised. I would like to suggest that seller offer an extra pump spray cap that screws onto the bottle. It would be so refreshing to spray on my face throughout the day to liven up my makeup as well as to spray on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love love this product.  To begin with it arrived safely, well packed. The waters smells just like fresh roses, leaving my skin moist while feeling clean. I will buy this again for sure!!!!&lt;br /&gt;An update: still loving those rose water, an as I said before, I did get it again</li>
    <li> I love this rose water. It smells amazing and it leaves my skin so smooth. I use it every day after I wash my face and it&#x27;s been so hot and humid here in NYC this is so perfect</li>
    <li> This 100% pure rose water is distilled from the petals of heirloom Damask roses in Morocco.  It has a delightfully sweet rose fragrance that is very intense, almost dizzying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most uses, such as for spraying on linens, in a bath, or as an air freshener, it can be diluted, so the 4 oz. bottle will last quite a while.  A cotton ball soaked with the pure rosewater will fill a drawer or closet with the scent.  I have been using just a couple of drops in a  [[ASIN:B00HZXJV5A rabbit mister]] and it refreshes the entire room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose water has a very relaxing and calming effect on me, similar to that of lavender.  It does make a nice moisturizer before applying creams or lotions, and I even enjoy dabbing it under my nose just for pleasure, and misting my pillow with it at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided by InstaNatural for testing and evaluation.  This is a very high quality rose water and I unreservedly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;ve now tried 3 different products from this company and really like all of them.  Something that is quite rare for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently telling someone that I can&#x27;t find a way to clean my skin because water alone doesn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t want to put any chemicals on my skin and to my surprise, she told me to try rose water.  I use rose water in my cooking but I had never heard of it used for skin care.  So when I saw this product, I jumped at the chance to use it and I have to say that it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the scent is obviously great because it smells like roses.  Second, it cleans your skin beautifully.  You put a tiny bit on a cotton ball and and wipe your face with it.  Take a look at the cotton ball after you&#x27;re done and you&#x27;ll be amazed by the amount of dirt and grime this product removes. And finally and most importantly for me, it does so completely naturally without the use of any sort of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says that it can be used to tone, remove wrinkles, etc.  I don&#x27;t know about those because I don&#x27;t use it for those purposes.  I have heard that it works but don&#x27;t have first hand knowledge of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that it is a fabulous option for cleaning your skin naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
    <li> Moroccan rose water has numerous benefits from toning, replenishing, to calming skin irritations like sunburn, or even using for aromatherapy. It is safe for all skin types, and does not contain any harsh chemicals or preservatives. I never used rose water prior to discovering InstaNatural’s product, so I was excited to finally get the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, it was faint rose scent that wasn’t overpowering, which was pleasant, and obviously all-natural. I decided to begin using this as a toner because it is suitable fro sensitive skin, and as someone with easily irritated skin, I was hoping this would become my go-to. Now for those who don’t know, rose water can naturally balance the skin’s pH, which in return can make it soft, calm skin irritations, and make skin radiant. It removes dirt from skin, so can also be used as a cleanser, and is safe to be used as a natural make-up remover as well. So, based on the numerous uses for rose water, it is something to consider purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this a chance, so began using it in my nighttime routine. I applied as directed, and within a few weeks, I noticed a difference in my skin’s complexion. Most importantly, for me, it wasn’t harsh on my skin. Most toners have a tendency to cause redness, or breakouts, but this rose water was gentle, and impressed me. It has now become a staple in my skincare routine, and overall just leaves my skin soft, and glowing.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works for acne/blemishes for all skin types. EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS IF YOU HAVE MINIMAL- AGGRESSIVE ACNE! I truly love this stuff; awesome customer service as well.</li>
    <li> The product smells wonderful. I placed in a spray bottle and spray on my face daily after cleansing. What a wonderful feeling. It is very light and absorbs right into my skin. Product was packaged nicely and I received it promptly also. Would buy this again</li>
    <li> Nice toner. Not a fan of the strong rose smell but that&#x27;s just personal preference. Does leave my skin feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recieved for free to review.</li>
    <li> Mary Gray: Purchased this item to help calm the redness in my sensitive skin. Sadly it did not, it actually made it red! I like it for its pureness.</li>

    <li> I love the InstaNatural Rose Water.  It smells wonderful  I am finding that the more of the InstaNatural products that I use, the more pleasantly surprised that I am.  The products are a great value. Time will only tell if the long term performance is remarkable.</li>
    <li> I adore this and use it as a morning skin freshener for my face. I&#x27;ll be buying it again. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural toner to add to my skin care regimen, and when I read the reviews for this Moroccan Rose Water, it sounded like just what I was looking for! I use it after I cleanse my face, and I love the way it makes my skin feel- very soft and smooth. And I really enjoy the smell too! I really love that it is not full of yucky chemicals, as I am trying to remove as much toxic stuff as possible from my life. Great product!</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven! If smells sweet, flowery. I want to wear it every day. I put it in my soap when I made it and it smelled amazing</li>
    <li> Great quality and even better than what I expected.</li>
    <li> I love using this after washing my face. It makes my skin feel tighter and I think has even shrunk my pores a little. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
    <li> I have used this as a toner, leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated. I also have used it in a face cream that I apply morning and night and I love it. I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this, even applying it directly on my face. It has a very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite things to use on my face. It absolutely makes my face feel so smooth and fresh. A little goes a long way so this should last for a while. Has a wonderful scent as well. You will love this!!</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft using this. I love the smell! And Ive had these red bumps under one eye for months now and theyve finally started disappearing,</li>
    <li> I use this every night for a face toner and it smells like roses. I can see on the cotton pad any residual makeup it cleans off my face. Works great , smells great, and gentle enough for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> i use this a lot especially on my hair</li>
    <li> I use this after washing my face, as a toner. It has been working wonders on my skin, as I have not been experiencing much breakouts. It is also the best product for my sensitive skin and it works well with the serum and creams I use. I love the fact that all the ingredients used for this product is all natural and it is very well priced for all the wonderful ingredients that you get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

    <li> high quality, both in packaging and product. I put in a spray bottle and with every spritz, I am transported to Morocco. While this may seem more expensive than other brands, because it is 100% rose water (not rose water +.....), it lasts a good amount of time. I probably go through 2-3 bottles a year, using it 2x a day as a facial toner.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple brands and this is hands down THE BEST. My skin feels amazing. I am very sensitice to frangrances and this fragrance is definitely natural and not overpowering. I would give this product 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Very nice. I&#x27;ve never used rose water before but I decided to get it instead of the toners I usually use since they often contain alcohol and other stuff that dries the skin. It works great as a toner and the scent is wonderful, and I look forward to using it every day. Definitely worth the price though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than ordinary toners.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s natural which I love and its a wonderful toner. Also I have a dry scalp and it does wonders for that!!!</li>
    <li> Premium pampering at a value price.  Extremely &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; label.  I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
    <li> Soothing toner with a great price!</li>
    <li> Really love how good this smells. It moisturizes your face well .  i RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> great product for hydration, soothing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend Instanatural LLC anytime for this quality product and also for their high level of customer service. Customer care is highly impressive.</li>
    <li> There are so many different uses for this product, which is one of the things that I like about this product. I also love the smell of it, rose is one of my favorite scent&#x27;s and this is dead on with how rose&#x27;s smell. You can use this on your hair, your face, and body. I love using it on my face, it gives me nice clean feeling and in my opinion is one of the better toner&#x27;s I have used (and I have used a lot!). I also like using it to put a little bit in my bath water, it not only smells great but it make&#x27;s my skin super soft! Another great thing to do with this product is using it on your hair. You can put it on your hair 15-20 minutes before you wash it, leaving it super shiny, healthy, and soft! This is one of my new favorite toner&#x27;s, and when I run out I plan on getting more. For me it work&#x27;s that great, and out of all of the products I have tried from InstaNatural (I have tried them all!) it is one of my top picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad. If this review happened to be good than it deserved it).</li>
    <li> I used it in my shampoo to give my hair a extra shine ... I love the way ir smells and my hair is a lot shiner.. Will order again ..Thanks</li>
    <li> The smell is a little strong at first but you get use to it. I like having a natural remover and cleanser for my face. I&#x27;m very sensitive to products and have had no issues with this one.</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater. It smells beautiful. I use it as a toner and put it on cotton balls and then on my eyes at night. It is so relaxing.  The company also has great customer service. I will definitely by again!</li>
    <li> It was my first time using a Rose Water Toner so I&#x27;m very happy I was sent this product to review and I just love it because it didn&#x27;t break me out or anything. It has the smell of an actual rose. It leaves your face feeling clean and fresh. It has many uses which I have yet to try but as a toner it works great. You get a lot of product but the only is, sometimes too much product can come out so you have to be careful when pouring it on to a cotton ball. Would recommend this toner to anyone who loves natural products.</li>
    <li> Love this! Amazing toner for your face, among many other uses. InstaNatural is an awesome company, too--always looking out for their customers. I am super pleased with this product --- 2 thumbs up! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this for review, which in no way effects my opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and arrived super fast. Smells great! Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;LW</li>
    <li> I am happy to have my item so quickly. My skin feels and smells amazing after the first use. I only wish I had a gallon of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the other reviews &amp; I am so happy that I did!  First off, I received my order very quickly &amp; the company sent an email with directions for use, as well as a point of contact if I had any questions.  As for results, my 50+ year old skin loves this toner.  I use it twice a day and my skin tone has greatly improved.  I had a lot of discoloration on my cheek bones  (I think from sun damage) &amp; I am amazed how much it has diminished.  The bottom line is that I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Makes a great soothing toner for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have a hypersensitive skin so I do not use any chemical products available in the market. I am originally from India now settled in the US so I come from a culture which believes in &amp;#34;natural is the best&amp;#34;. The other thing is I have no choice being a person with allergies and sensitivity to everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this rose water as an astringent/cleanser which is excellent. Smells just like roses, reduces the redness on my skin, soothes and calms it when it is irritated, use it under my eyes for the dark patches and I just love it. My grandmother told me about the properties of rose water and how it can be used in different ways and forms for beauty, health and medicine. I have been using this on my face before I go to bed and any irritation or redness is gone when I wake up in the morning. I can actually see the dirt come off on the cotton ball when I clean my face with it every night. I have used rose water in India and this comes closest to the purity of the rose water in India.</li>
    <li> smells SO good. I love it, i&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this rose water. I use it every morning and it is so refreshing and smells amazing. I also keep a spray bottle of it in my bag when my so I can spritz some throughout the day if needed. Definitely a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Very nice rose water. I use it as a toner, and I do think my pores have tightened a bit as a result.</li>
    <li> Tried this as an alternative to a more expensive brand. It smelled good, even had more of a &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scent than the other brand, which I am sure would be an asset for pouring in a bath or some other use where you value more of that &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scent. When used as a facial toner for some reason it did not work as well for my skin as another brand, but it is a mystery as to why that is -I contacted the company who assured me that this product IS distilled with no other ingredients added. Yet, I had irritation that cleared up when I switched back to a different brand -I don&#x27;t think that was a coincidence but if there is nothing else in the bottle I feel like I cannot say this means there is anything wrong with the product so I am still going to give a positive review. Every now and then you read in reviews that people say they received a bad batch of rose water from one company or another, but that was not the case, this bottle smelled pretty and fresh. I am a little on the fence about trying it again on my face, but I am very impressed with the customer service for this company, so I am still giving this 4 stars because you can buy from them with confidence. Also, I am very happy with their argon oil, and I am open to trying other products from the company as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and great product.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Smells like real roses. I would&#x27;ve given five stars if not for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this rose water. I was looking for a winter toner that won&#x27;t dry my skin out like the regular toner I use for summer and fall. I have combination skin which tends to be oily in the summer and dry in the winter. My T-zone is oily most of the time with occasional dry patches during winter. This is inexpensive, and smell of fresh roses. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. It won&#x27;t substitute for a moisturizer. I use a gentle cleanser and then use a cotton ball to apply this rose water all over my face.</li>
    <li> This review is for:&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Rose Water&lt;br /&gt;Organic Rosehip Oil&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;Eye Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot begin to say enough good things about all of these products. I was a bit skeptical, I will admit. But the other reviews were really good and the company promises a money back guarantee, which is rare. First of all, each product is natural and all of them are really excellent. The Rose water smells divine, if I could bathe in it, I would. The Rosehip oil is so moisturizing! Yes it does have an earthy smell, but honestly, I like it and I even wouldn&#x27;t mind eating it! The Vitamin C serum smells like oranges and I adore it the most of all! The Eye Gel, let me just say that it works, it just works. I use it around my entire eye, including the lids and I use the last of it around my lips. I have seen a marked difference in my skin since I began using this line. I don&#x27;t regret any of the products and will certainly order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, the sizes of these products are very large and a little goes a long way. They should last for a long time, making them not only effective in doing their job, but also affordable. It&#x27;s a WIN! If you&#x27;re on the fence, jump off and just go for it.</li>
    <li> The best rose water I have been used ever !!!! I love it so much . It leaves my skin soft and super duper clean.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: in the morning, in stead of using Facial Foam, clean your face with water, dry your face and using THIS ROSE Water with a cotton pad. Your skin condition will absolutely improve .</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this rose water and good for toner as well.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible! I&#x27;m not sure if I can keep using this product!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product twice since I got it yesterday, but I can&lt;br /&gt;already feel a difference. My face just feels cleaner. The smell is light and delicate. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I love using this as a toner every night.  It works well on my skin.  I love the light scent of rose that dissipates in a few moments.  It feels clean and refreshing.  I have combination skin that tends towards the oily side at times as well as sensitive skin.  This worked well and didn&#x27;t create any problems for my skin.  It&#x27;s a nightly routine and using it as a toner has really helped.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it. I really did. I used this on my combination skin for two weeks. Unfortunately, it did cause some troublesome blemishes for me. I took a break from it in case something else caused the breakout. Once my skin cleared, I tried again. Another breakout. Bummer. I do, however, still like using this around my eyes. It&#x27;s not as good as something intended for use under the eye for fine lines, but if I apply this, wait for it to soak in (it&#x27;s quick), then dab aloe vera gel over it, I can see a small difference in the moisture level under my eyes. On the plus side, it did rid my cheeks of some stubborn dry spots. I would personally recommend this for someone with dry to normal skin.</li>
    <li> So I have heard a lot about this InstaNatural Rose Water , so I decided to give it a try. I love this product. Not only does it smell so good and refreshing, but it makes my face feel so good. It feels smooth and shiny. My face tone has improved a lot since I have been using this product. I recommended it to my sister too, who loves it. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this because it will forever be part of my skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review. What great quality of rose water. I use this on my face before my serum and it&#x27;s the best toner. I also use this on my hair before my shower. I just love this product.</li>
    <li> do wish it came in a spray for misting!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way rose water smells!  I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week. So far I&#x27;ve just use it as a face toner &amp; put a little in my bath water.</li>
    <li> I have known about Rose Water for a long time. Usually get this after I get my eyebrows threaded. So it was great to be able to have this on a daily for my skin. Just feel very cool and refreshing on the skin. The scent is just aromatherapy. I have also noticed its great for some scarring I had on my face. I am medium brown skin. I excited to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my skin soft! It also calms my skin.</li>
    <li> love it, great product. finally found something that works and smells so nice</li>
    <li> The rose fragrance of this extract is exquisite. I was initially hesitant to apply it to my extremely sensitive facial skin, but it felt wonderfully refreshing with an added aromatherapy bonus, and my skin had no negative reaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday! Wonderful Rose water, very mild scent and very refreshing</li>
    <li> I am new to Rose Water and purchased this due to the reviews. It is a great product that has really helped my skin look more refreshed and bright during one of the worst winters on record in the Midwest. I use it as a cleanser at night, just dab a little on a cotton round and clean my face. I have normal skin and am in my early 30s and really like it. I can tell its working... i see the dirt on the pad!! and i also use it as a toner. I&#x27;ve added it to my hair rinse but have also been using apple cider vinegar so I&#x27;m not sure which is doing it but my hair is nice and Shiny!!! Great product I would highly recommend. It does smell like roses (obviously) but would not be what I would consider overpowering by any means.</li>
    <li> I am a eyebrow threader and a nail tech.This product is really very nice and has a nice fragrance.After threading when i put this rosewater on customers face they love it. Its little expensive for me otherwise awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is one of life&#x27;s wonderful little luxuries. I never imagined that rose water could possibly be this useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lists a lot of uses, at first I thought it might make everybody beautiful or handsome. After using this, well it is useful, it might not make everybody pretty - but wow does it feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t some weak rose water that sort of smells like roses - this is potent. Both my wife and I find the fragrance pleasing. It smells like roses with a hint of earthiness. The toner is clear and lightweight. In general you apply it with a cotton ball. I have used it in the morning on my face as a nice wake up. It is also an excellent aftershave for razor burn - the toner is cooling. My wife used it to remove makeup. After using her normal make up removal routine, she then used this on a cotton ball and more make up came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Insta Natural&#x27;s packaging. This rose water comes in a small brown glass bottle, simple and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is a personal thing, what smells fabulous to me might be overpowering to another. I love the smell for both men and women. Aside from using on your face, bath water and hair (add to shampoo or conditioner) are listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the small things in life that make things wonderful. This is one of those luxuries that just make things feel a little bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> You can use this product for so many things . I like it as a toner because so many other toners tend to dry out my skin. you can also use it in your hair for shine and scent its like having a really good skin care product combined with aroma therapy . it really does smell wonderful and is a nice big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I received a low cost sample to try it so I could make an informed review for it , you cant beat it for price and purity and with so many uses its a great value</li>
    <li> I have been using the Natural Moroccan Rose Water for about 2 weeks along with the suggested facial cleansing regime from InstaNatural and am very happy with it. I have noticed that my pores appear to be smaller and blackheads are almost completely gone. I am pleased with the results of all of the products I have used so far. I was very impressed with the customer service I received while making my purchase. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I needed for my age and skin type and when I called my questions were answered and my concerns were addressed and in spite of the fact that I was willing to purchase more products it was suggested that I only get the basics and try those first, who does that now days?  I highly suggest anyone who is looking for an excellent natural product from a company who cares that you order from InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> Smells AWESOME!!  I put this on my daughter&#x27;s scalp.  She has very dry scalp and this seemed to work.  I also use it as a toner.</li>
    <li> Thank you! I loved the product.</li>
    <li> Wow! Love this stuff...... it makes my skin feel awake and fresh and cleansed... and the smell is amazing.... this is my favorite facial product and i love using it every morning and evening.</li>
    <li> Love this! My new favorite toner and my daughter asks me each night if she can &amp;#34;smell my face&amp;#34; because it smells so good! Great price too!</li>
    <li> Refreshing and toning. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product...my skin is very sensitive and oily with occasional breakouts. .I noticed a change in my skin texture the first day I started using the product...my skin is glowing and the tonic has brighten my skin tone..I recommend using the rose hip oil in conjunction with the rose...believe me you will be amazed...great product and great customer service from InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural Morrocan Rose Water is my guilty indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;I adore the scent and I love to use it in my bath. I&#x27;ve tried it as a wash/toner, I&#x27;ve used a dab on my wrists for scent, I&#x27;ve even sprayed it on my pillow cases before bed. Rose water is great and InstaNatural has some of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The scent lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried and it even seems to be a bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the label on the bottle. The red-orange label really catches the eye. I think a plainer label on the brown bottle would be overlooked. The bottle itself could be a little more user friendly. The only way to get the rose water out is to use a cotton ball or pour it out. I would have liked to see a spray or push pump to make it easier to get out, but it is what it is, and it isn&#x27;t really that hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose water has so many uses other than just the scent. It is a toner, a cleanser, a moisturizer, it softens skin, removes make-up, and it is really soothing for skin (even sunburned skin!). Its been used for centuries and is even used in cooking recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used rose water, I would definitely recommend picking up a bottle and trying it out. It is a luxurious experience no matter how you choose to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday since I got it and I love it, it&#x27;s cleared my skin up and makes my face feel like a rose. Great product.</li>
    <li> This surprised me since I&#x27;m not normally a fan of rose scented things. I actually like how it smells and I like it more with how it&#x27;s treating my skin. It feels more hydrated and supple and it&#x27;s not irritating at all. I&#x27;m very glad I was kindly given the product to try for review. Thanks InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> The reason I say I wish I could marry this stuff is because I don&#x27;t want to go a day without it ! I&#x27;m completely in love with this product . This is the first product that I have tried from InstaNatural and I couldn&#x27;t be happier . Shipping was on time and the bottle came sealed. Not only that, but the bottle was nicely protected by plenty of wrapping. I find myself reaching for this product every night and morning. I use it as a toner after I wash my face and also on top of my moisturizer . I pour the rose water into a little bottle so that I can easily spray it on my face as a refresher . No matter how much I apply, my skin just wants more and more of it . It never makes me look oily or greasy . It&#x27;s my new little gem . I&#x27;m only 20, but I&#x27;m a full time premed student so I&#x27;m not getting nearly enough sleep. &amp; unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the best skin (acne scars, discoloration, ect) this rose water honestly makes my skin look refreshed even if I&#x27;m on the verge of exhaustion . InstaNaturals, you&#x27;re awesome and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of your products ! I&#x27;ve actually gotten some of my friends and my roommates hooked on it too. I&#x27;m living on a college student budget with not much money to spare but I will repurchase this over and over again . It&#x27;s a must have in my life now ! I know it&#x27;s just rose water, but if anyone is reading this review , give it a try and you&#x27;ll see why I&#x27;m so in love with this stuff . You will be too!</li>
    <li> The smell of this toner is heavenly. It makes my face very soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love how it smells and makes my skin look! Lil pricey, but you gotta expect it with a quality product..</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this product.  Taut but not dry.  And the scent is one of my favorite things about it.  I will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> smells so wonderful, great product, great customer service! A+++</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the most pleasant smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever owned! I wish they could make this into a fragrance without all the chemicals. I&#x27;ve even poured it in my hair after washing and before drying, and it smells like fresh roses! As far as making a life-changing difference in my face/skin, I can&#x27;t really say, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not bad for it! I just can&#x27;t get enough of the smell!</li>
    <li> rating from 1-5&lt;br /&gt;smell &#x3D; 2 it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, but i dont like the way it smells, honestly i think it smells weird LOL&lt;br /&gt;i use it has a facial toner, your face feel soft after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;soften &#x3D; 4&lt;br /&gt;toner &#x3D; 3 not too sure if it really works as a toner just yet</li>
    <li> This is a great product and great value. I just wish it came with a spray. Cotton balls absorb too much of the product so it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Just bought this rose water and I&#x27;m already out!? Will buy 2 or 3 bottles next time. Soooo many uses. I love this !!!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been keeping my acne at bay and slowly fading my acne scars! Just what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product!! Excellent quality. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this rose facial toner. The smell is so light and pleasant, it makes me not want to skip this step in my skin regimen.It feels very refreshing and like my skin is clean. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other uses - as a hair rinse, and a capful in the bath! arrived very quickly and was packaged nicely.  I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the product bc it did not come with inner seal. I like Thayer&#x27;s toners.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing - I love the scent.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly-priced product in a simple, practical glass bottle.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described. This is a good quality product. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I will definitely buy from this seller again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the feeling it leaves on the face. The only thing that I dislike is the bottle itself. I think if there is a spray head, it would be much better and more convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I used this for a week and it dried my skin and I had bumps on my face. This was too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> so far so good, but I just got it  is a little early to find more about it to put it a five star, which I might have otherwise. I would really like to know for sure that it is 100% pure.  Would like to know a little more ways and on how to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Smells lovely, and I can literally see my pores diminishing when I put it on!  This is exactly what I had hoped for in a toner.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My esthetician told me to use a toner and since I like the InstaNatural Moisturizer and Night Cream I thought it would make sense to try the toner. I used a whole bottle and that combined with the other products seems to be working well. I am buying my second bottle now :)</li>
    <li> This rose water is the best I have ever used! I used other rose waters from other brands but this one makes me the happiest! When I put it on my hair especially it feels so much more smooth and shinier. It&#x27;s better than the effects my shampoo and conditioner use, I just spray it on my hair and the scent is so good! When I don&#x27;t dilute the rose water, the scent can linger, but I love that because I can use it as a healthy perfume. People have complimented that it looked soft and smooth, and when they touched it, they told me it felt just like how it looked! I loved those compliments, and this really hydrates the skin as well! I use it on dry skin and this can health soothe it and get the dryness to pass. I am not going to stop ordering these, it really is the best I ever used!</li>
    <li> After purchasing several bottles of this, I feel like I&#x27;ve used it long enough for a thorough review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a pleasant smell, works well with my skin, and I like it so much that I use it a few times a week in place of a Clinique toner. It soothes my sensitive skin and leaves it feeling refreshed. I love the cool, clean feeling after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the bottles a few months ago arrived with a broken top and the customer service team was excellent and sent a replacement next day - thanks, amazon!</li>
    <li> i did notice this made my skin feel cleaner and brighter. i love the smell too by the way, great product</li>
    <li> Love the feel and subtle rose scent. It&#x27;s been especially good as we&#x27;ve had a long stretch of weather in the single digits where I live and this helps make my skin retain the moisturizer I apply.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective toner that would work well to remove dirt and makeup during the winter months. I use many other products in Instanatural&#x27;s line and have been very pleased with the results. It&#x27;s amazing how effectively this toner takes away any residual dirt left over from washing. The smell is simply amazing too! I would definitely buy this toner again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like using this as a toner and it leaves my skin feeling nice</li>
    <li> I received this Moroccan Rose water for ree in exchange fot my honest reive of the product and I am amazed at all the benefits this water has to offer and especially because it is 100% rose water with no other additives added; it is just Rosa Damascena distilled into pure water. Apparently this Rose water has natural calming and soothing properties and maintains the pH level of skin to make it soft, supple and add a glow. It is also an excellent cleanser, toner, &amp; moisturizer. It is also helpful for soothing sunburns and softening rough skin. I did not know that you could get soft and shiny hair just by adding this rose water to shampoo and I had never thought to add a few drops to my bath water for a soothing effect. I had been aware that you could use it on your hair and scalp to improve the quality and strength of hair however and because this rose water smells so amazing it is perfect to use as aromatherapy. I add about 4-5 drops of this water into a small pot of boiling water and let it infuse the entire house with its beautiful smell. My favorite way to use this rose water is to apply it to my face with a cotton ball or apply some onto the palm of my hands and rub it across my face until it fully absorbs. This is a perfect toner and can be used in combination to my makeup routine as it does not interfere with my makeup. I am enjoying this roseater. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I am embarrassed to say that the bottle slipped out of my hands and broke all over my bathroom floor, it smelled very nice but maybe it should be in a different type of bottle?</li>
    <li> Love this pure organic rose water that serves as a toner as well as dark spots corrector! It leaves skin soft and fresh smelling while evens out skin tone in just a week! The effects are noticeable and I have been using this daily for almost two months now. Pair this with a mixture of pure organic rosehip, lavender, jojoba and lemongrass oil diluted with pure Apple cider vinegar with no additives creates a natural skin care set that beats any expensive brand names by a margin with a fraction of the price! Highly recommend this product as I&#x27;ve personally tried a wide range of high end skincare products which contain too much chemical and end up stressing out my skin. I have very sensitive skin that usually reacts almost immediately to products that contains chemicals but have no issues with this pure organic rose water.</li>
    <li> Tried this for several days but had to return it because of the strong scent that would linger that would often keep us awake.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not to say that the product didn&#x27;t work well on the face, but I was not able to give it a longer test.</li>
    <li> For the price, I wanted to love it and I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! It works super well as a toner and I noticed less breakouts after I consistently used this product. I like to apply it right before bed. It has a soft soothing smell.</li>
    <li> So cool and refreshing. I always look forward to applying it. My only complaint is the scent that is so appealing when applied starts to stink after several hours. My daughter even said it stunk while sitting near me. Because of this, I have started applying it only before bed. Again, I love the scent when it is applied. I wish it would stay that way or fade away as opposed to turning stinky.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and fantastic customer service!</li>
    <li> Great toner and excellent customer service!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Its natural, smooth and refreshing. I also like it because it doesnt contain alcohol. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Rose Water Face Toner by InstaNatural is FANTASTIC! The smell is light and really does smell like freshly cut roses. No chemical smell or alcohol smell here.  It is like it says......natural.  I found that I was breaking out a lot BEFORE this product, and now that I use this daily my breakouts have decreased and my skin is left glowing, soft, clear, and refreshed.  I LOVE this product and will definitely purchase again. The customer service is phenomenal and they actually send emails to follow up with you. Not many companies do that these days so I found that to be very satisfying. Great job InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> This product is extremely gentle on my skin.  The smell of the Rose Water is so refreshing and soft.  I&#x27;ve actually used it as aromatherapy.  It&#x27;s so light and mixes very well my hair conditioner.  It does not leave any form of residue on my scalp.  This product is gentle enough to be used on all skin types.  After using the InstaNatural Moroccan Rose Water for four days, I received numerous Compliments regarding how radiant my skin looks.  I certainly plan to keep a bottle of this product within my reach.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good.</li>
    <li> Five days of using this amazing product and am in love with it! my skin is  looking good! very hydrating, I highly recommend it! plus the service is great!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair when i shower and on pimples when i break out! I have dry skin so all the pimple creams make skin worse.</li>
    <li> This is first time I try use rose water, and I love this product.  It delivered quickly to me, the flower  fragrance is very pleasant yet not too strong. It get absorbed by skin quickly, and with no sticky feel. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle opening is wild open and no flow control. So, I switch the rose water to my own spray bottle.  I bring it everywhere including gym. Best product I ordered for skin care, and am getting more bottle to my girl friends as gift.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and changing products usually gives me problems.  I decided to try this line and have been using it for about 10 days.  So far so good.  The Rose Water Toner is fragrant and light with no harsh chemicals or alcohol.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a gentle, effective toner that is pure and unadulterated.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. The best rose water I ever bought, definitely going to order more in the future. My skin never felt smoother.</li>
    <li> There are so many uses listed for rose water. I use it for the pretty scent. It&#x27;s pleasant and light, not weighed down like perfumes. It dries very quickly, so I don&#x27;t feel any moisturizing effects, but there is a tingle of toning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the bottle was not open mouth. It would be so much easier to apply if there was a smaller drip spout or spray pump. If it had a spray pump, I could spritz this all over. As it is, I use a cotton ball, but a spout or other dispenser would be much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> 100% pure and natural.  I can use this on my face and HAIR!!  I use this as a cleanser, toner and even a moisturizer!! I was skeptical at first that this could truly remove all my make up, I’m not skeptical now! Moroccan Rose Water by InstaNatural did a great job! I couldn’t believe how much of my makeup was removed with just one cotton pad!! My face felt refreshed, clean and moisturized with just one product!!?!?  First I removed my make up, then with a clean cotton pad I wiped my face a second time for the toner, moisturizing effects. WONDERFUL!!!  Using this Moroccan Rose Water is an experience for the senses too! That subtle scent of roses is heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another use I’ve found is zits! Yup, 55 and I broke out with pimples last week. Say WHAT!?!?! I dabbed my rose water on them and by morning GONE!! G-O-N-E!! I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how my skin glows when I use my rose water. I love how my hair shines after I rub a couple of drops into it. A couple drops in the palm of hands, rub them together and then into my hair. SHINE!! SHINE!! SHINE!! Oh and extra bonus my hair smells divine!! Very subtle rose scent lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Rose Water is great on all skin types, yes, even sensitive! You can use it for cleansing, toning, replenishing and moisturizing! This rose water will calm skin. (yes even zits on a 55 year old!) Naturally balances pH levels of your skin. This will help with a sun burn too!! And the bottle is pretty too! (It’s PINK! WHAT? You thought I could just let that go by without comment?? REALLY??? IT’s PINK!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Moroccan Rose Water by InstaNatural two thumbs WAY, WAY UP!!! Another InstaNatural home run product!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this stuff. It smells nice, and works beautifully. I even use it as a toner on my face. Great results so far.</li>
    <li> I Love the fragrance---fresh and not overpowering. Very soothing and refreshing for face and neck. I even spritz on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I do not care for this product. It is very drying. Since I don&#x27;t feel like returning it, it will go to waste.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Scent is very natural and not overpowering. I love it as a refreshing toner. It leaves my skin soft and smooth and without irritation after cleansing. I also find it calming to my eczema prone skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING! I use it as a makeup setting spray, hydrator, toner &amp; anytime I need that extra fresh feeling. Rose water is one of those wonders that a woman shouldn&#x27;t go without. Definitely give this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> i first noticed the fresh rose smell as i opened the bottle. my skin felt clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I use this after my face wash, it leaves my skin soft and supple and smelling like roses, loved it</li>
    <li> The smell alone is disgusting and does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This Rose Water is great. Its fragrance is pleasant and not over powering. I use it daily. The vendors are dependable and packed the bottle well. I&#x27;ll definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a replacement for Bigelow Rose Water, which has been discontinued, and I&#x27;ve found it in Moroccan Rose Water.  Light, fresh and lovely.</li>
    <li> I am a African America female in my early 30&#x27;s. I started using the product for a few weeks, and it made my skin darker. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement, and I won&#x27;t be using this product on my face again.</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite Instanatural product that I have tried so far. It smells so unbelievably amazing, exactly like roses. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and feels awesome. It can be used to remove makeup, as aftershave, as a bath treatment, I plan on using it for many different things. It seems luxurious and exotic. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was suppose to use this at first when I got it in, but now, I use this as a toner for my face, and it smells amazing! This rose water has a lot of other uses, but the main thing I use this for is a toner. I think if your toner smells good, you are bound to remember to use it more often. I would recommend this rose water to anyone who wants an amazing toner! (By the way, I think Lush has a similar toner, but I know that the bottle is way smaller than this one)</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever tried rose water I&#x27;m in love with it. I use it as my facial toner and apply it with a cotton ball. I have sensitive skin and the rose water is very calming and soothing. My face feels so refreshed after I use it. I love how it is natural and free of harsh chemicals. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bulgarian and Moroccan rose water for years, on it&#x27;s own, in DIY skincare preparations, and even in cooking.&lt;br /&gt;This is a particularly nice one, with a full, lush fragrance. Sweeter than most, but still has that spark of peppery spice that is the signature of moroccan rose.&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s a perk, some people that are allergic to synthetic scent can tolerate rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve been using my rose water (once or twice a day after a gentle cleanse) for about 2 weeks now and my sensitive skin seems happy. My pores are definitely smaller and my skin seems brighter and more balanced -- not oily or dry. I was looking for a natural product that I could use as a toner and this seems to work great for that purpose without the dryness or irritation I&#x27;ve experienced with traditional toners in the past. I&#x27;m happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the refreshing feel I receive from this toner. It is a product that I would order again as well as recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I purchased this rose water a couple weeks ago and have been using it daily since. My skin is more even, pores less visible and I have a noticeable glow. I will definitely be purchasing again. The only suggestion I would make to Instanatural is to add a plastic cap that controls the amount of water that comes out. I don&#x27;t want to waste any of this awesome product. Thank you for offering a luxurious and effective skincare product!!</li>
    <li> Lovely scent, gentle on skin, good price.  I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells amazing and tones the skin perfectly and no irritation.</li>
    <li> The smell of this was different for me, not that I didn&#x27;t like it, it was nice. This toner works way better than the Vitamin C spray toner from Insta Naturals. Worked well on my pores and was very gentle and soothing on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! I Did my research on rose water and decided to try! I used to have major acne , with religious visits to my esthectician and right product regime they I experienced major improvement , but scares stayed and I am working on improving my skin texture and that&#x27;s the main reason I decided to try this product! And I must say its awsome! I find that this product doesn&#x27;t break me out AT ALL, which is very very rare,for the most part I am so sensitive that even washing my face with tap water breaks me out...but suprisnigly not this rose water! I use it as a toner , after I use my face wash I got from my esthetician , upward strokes on a cotton ball, like a toner, I must say it smells AMAZING, so much that I am tempted not to follow with my regular moisturizer but I deffinitly do because it does dry out your skins slightly, which works for me, since I am oily/combined skin type! Also, I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure rose water, it&#x27;s very important for me because my skin does NOT tolerate to much additives , and again great price to, I haven&#x27;t used any other brands of Rose Water so I can&#x27;t comparesen , but since it turned out to work great for me I will deffinitly be buying again!</li>
    <li> Love this facial toner.  It makes my skin feel awesome and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have never used rose water before but i heard great things and you know i just don&#x27;t go by what others say i am more of a seeing is believing so when i was asked if i would like to try this of course i said yes! Everyone knows i am always skeptical about everything until i try it not once but twice, i have used this since i got it yesterday but not twice 3 times yesterday and already once today after my shower, i kept wondering where that amazing rose smell was coming from until i remembered i used the rose water, the smell was me! I love it i am using it as a fast face wash in the morning and at night after i wash my face just as a toner, i hear it&#x27;s great for hair i read i may try that too! I am using it as a perfume because it smells so good! Thank you for letting me try this i love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I have been using it for about four months, I put it in a glass little spray bottle and spray it in my face, and sometimes in my hair every morning. I don&#x27;t usually like a really floral smell so I was hesitant but I love this! It&#x27;s a light rise smell that goes away pretty quickly. Love the product and will be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing stuff! I love it and will purchase for the second time because  I got from the first purchased is almost gone! Smell so good naturally and feels fresh/cooler on your face skin! Will stick with it for a long time!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this one and I am so happy that i did.  I used it for a toner every night.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  The smell is also fantastic a nice light rose scent that is very relaxing.  I am very excited I tried this one and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as described. I love the smell of this toner, it&#x27;s fresh and light. It not drying like some toners can be it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I like this toner. I got a high discount code for this product. it is good for my face skin. it smells good, and makes my skin smoother.</li>
    <li> Such a great toner. Smells awesome with so many uses. I use on my face after washing my face in the morning and at night. I also use in my hair to refresh the smell after working out.</li>
    <li> As some other reviews have mentioned, Rose Water has many uses in both health and skin care. As a Nurse Practitioner I am well aware of the many side effects of traditional medications and am always looking for natural ways to treat my family if at all possible.&lt;br /&gt;It requires several rose petals to make just one tiny drop of rose water, making it expensive to produce. Pure natural rose water is 100% free from artificial ingredients and perfumes. It can be used right out of the bottle or used to replace water in your face masks. It reduces wrinkles by increasing cellular turnover, tightening skin and shrinking pores. Dry skin can be hydrated by using rose water as a moisturizer. Rose water cleanses the skin, removes dirt, oil and other pollutants from deep inside the skin&#x27;s pores. Amazingly, it can be used on any skin type without causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;As a quick aside, Rose Water is used in Persian cooking to scent or flavor food especially rice, giving it a distinct fragrance. It is also commonly used in small amounts to flavor foods like Baklava, ice creams, scones, cakes, buns and puddings.&lt;br /&gt;One of the benefits of rose water is it can be used to make very nutritious drinks since it is rich in flavonoids, anti-oxidants, tannins and essential vitamins like A, C, D, E and B3. A simple delicious drink can be made by mixing rose water syrup in a cup of cold creamy milk.&lt;br /&gt;Rose water is well-known for its natural healing properties as a good anti-septic, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory product. Rose water is used to treat skin infections including dry scaly skin, oily skin, skin inflammation, dermatitis and eczema. Rose water can be used in treating wounds. For sunburns, rose water can be put on a cotton ball gently patted over the affected area or when taking a bath, add a few drops to the water. Rose water can be applied over insect bites like mosquito bites and almost immediately stops the itch, reduces the inflammation and cools the area. For anyeye pain or fatigue, gently dip a cloth in rose water mixed with chilled water and place  it on your eyelids for a soothing feeling that helps cool your eyes. Acne: Rose water is also an astringent which reduces redness or inflammation of skin. Swollen inflamed pimples can be reduced by gently dabbing rose water on the affected area. What&#x27;s more – acne scars can be diminished and gotten rid of by making and applying a mixture of sandalwood, lemon juice and rose water on them. As a disinfectant: Since it has anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties, rose water can be used as a disinfectant to keep your home or workplace free from bacteria and germs. Use a rose water spritzer which can be made by adding a measurable amount of epsom salt to pure rose water and filling it in a clean and empty spritzer. This mixture can be sprayed on kitchen and bathroom counter tops, shelves, and table tops. Wipe clean with a dry cloth and this will leave a scented and fresh feel.&lt;br /&gt;There are many more uses for rose water...of course it&#x27;s a kick ass toner as well! It deeply removes the gunk from your pores eventually allowing them to shrink and reduced the amount of sebum produced by your oil glands.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had it in my house as a staple for over 20, but this brand is so lovely, with such a light, lingering scent, 100% pure, silky on the skin and tastes sweet and unrefined. It&#x27;s our new household brand with a bottle in every bathroom and 2 in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> This is gold water, I really thought and didn&#x27;t want to give it a try, I have the other toner too. I have to say this one is my absolute favorite it just tones and evens your skin .. Sorry this is my honest opinion. I have just about bought every product of this line and I mix and match my serums and creams. My complexion has changed so much people are starting to notice and ask if I have had Botox and I tell them no there is a company that makes miracles in little bottles.&lt;br /&gt;My sun spots have almost completely disappeared and I&#x27;m 50 years old ,,, thank you for products that really work no lies just facts!</li>
    <li> Pure Moroccan Rose Water is the purest of water that you are honestly getting the best product out there. Not only can use the rose-water as a toner, it can be used as a cleanser, anti wrinkle toner, and all while leaving your skin feeling silky soft and smelling like rose petals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used on all types of skin tones, it’s all natural so it can be used as a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Water soaked into my skin quickly and my skin felt clean, and had the very faint rose scent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Skin is taking a little time to adjust but I expected as much since this winter weather has my skin dried out and I was using a lot of products before that wasn&#x27;t really helping. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using this to see more results! I can already feel and see my skin looking healthier and its a great thing to us if your skin is irritated or red post waxing!</li>
    <li> Nice smelling but did nothing for my skin. Used it daily on my face after my shower in the hopes of not having to use a moisturizer but no such luck. Wish it would have worked!</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with rose water, for the face, hair, body, or just to to make you feel good, I love it , it&#x27;s a must have everyday...cold or hot temperature , will buy it again. It does miracles and they used it thousand of year ago and it still works! Horay for this product.</li>
    <li> First time  I use this product and definitely  i like it. I love that it is alcohol free . I feel my skin hydrated and soft with a lite rose smell. I definitely recommend it .</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day as a toner and love the scent which reminds me of a distant time and place--beautiful, peaceful, romantic.  It is the best toner I have used, leaving my skin soft and lifted.  The fact that it is not tested on animals and contains no harmful chemicals is a definite plus and the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, almost forgot to mention that customer service is great.  They respond quickly to any questions and are quite helpful.</li>
    <li> I have recently started trying to use more natural products. I tried this rosewater to use as a toner and I really like it! I have been using it for a little over a month now. I use it after I wash my face and I feel it gets whatever little bit of dirt or make up is left off of my skin. It smells heavenly! And I must say, the personal customer service Insta Natural provides is a refreshing and welcome surprise! I actually received a follow-up email from the company making sure I was satisfied with the product. I am very satisfied with Insta Natural and this rosewater and will purchase it again. I have purchased two other products (the vitamin C serum and the vitamin B3 serum) from Insta Natural and I am very satisfied with those as well.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water. I&#x27;ll be honest it&#x27;s my first experience with rose water but so far so good. I use it with my morrocan red clay for my facials once a week. You wouldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my skin looks. Product is definitely worth the buy and the buck :)</li>
    <li> So far so good! the smell is great and I can tell this is some very good quality rose water. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I read allot about ros&amp;eacute; water and wanted to see if the hype was true. I didn&#x27;t notice any substantial changes. Not sure if I would reorder. Hydrogen peroxide and distiller water mix works just as well for me.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately had an allergic reaction to it so need to mail it back.</li>
    <li> Love this rose water, the quality seems great. I use it as a toner after I cleanse my face.</li>
    <li> hydrates and refines i can testify that this is super tonifying natural wonderful smelling and great on hair and skin if i was rich i would bathe in this stuff end of story</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and price</li>
    <li> Very good product with superior customer service.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Awesome customer service.</li>
    <li> The rose water smell was too strong for me! Unfortunately I had to return it after one use - it was just too strong!</li>
    <li> I love Natural Rose Water, it&#x27;s such a light scent and feels wonderful to splash on after my shower.</li>
    <li> Great toner. I love it .</li>
    <li> Got product as free sample adore the smell and gas a million uses</li>
    <li> If the cap on the bottle hadn&#x27;t broken, leaking some of the contents out, I probably would have given this Moroccan Rose Water 5 stars.  The product smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, nourished, and moist.  It also worked wonders at removing my mineral make-up.  I didn&#x27;t use it on my eyes, of course.  I wanted to write a review after I had given this a week or two on my face - some things start off wonderfully and after a week I start to break out.  After two weeks it just keeps getting better.  Unlike some of the more expensive lotions and toners, this is free of chemicals and other harsh ingredients that can be tough on the skin or just awful and medicinal smelling.  This feels terrific, is good to your skin, and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately almost one third of the bottle leaked out before I got it.  The cap had broken off in two places in spite of being wrapped in bubble wrap. That might be because the bottle was just rolled in the plastic, and nothing was done to secure the cap.  I don&#x27;t know.  I transferred it to a different container as soon as it arrived.  I am really bummed, though, because I don&#x27;t have as much rose water as I paid for and I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d encourage anyone looking anyone looking for a gentle toner or make-up remover to give this a try.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> The product I ordered arrived on time. I will definitely use this seller again. And the product I bought really is working great. Thank you..</li>
    <li> I actually bought the whole skin care line (rose water toner, facial oil cleanser, vitamin c moisturizer and Dead Sea mud mask) an they work amazingly. With in the first week, I saw a consistent glow, my face looked clean and toned. Soft and not oily. Less to no pimples (dramatic decrease in the amount I had). And what rocks is its all natural. I will continue to buy this product. I absolutely adore it.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with your rose water cleanser the first time I used it.  It makes my skin feel like it did years ago and smells better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  Once you try this, I feel you won&#x27;t want to continue to use the cheaper drug store toners,  I KNOW I DON&#x27;T!  I am sold on this,  and while some of the products I use can be replaced,  this one can&#x27;t.  I just love it!  In just a couple of weeks I can see healthier, smoother skin,  with a reduction in blackheads,  and breakouts.  Great  Stuff.</li>
    <li> used to make homemade scrubs and it smells so good great company and prodcut</li>
    <li> Improved my skin tone</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and feels great, but i would only put it in my bathwater.  I&#x27;m 26 and not prone to breakouts but I broke out after using it for a couple of days on my face.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love this rose water. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and works wonders on your skin.  Highly recommended product as well as the seller.  Great packing and very quick on the shipping.</li>
    <li> I love your Rose Water. Feels nice on my face and the hint of rose fragrance is uplifting as I use it. I have sensitive skin and this is very calming. Does not leave red splotches all over my face. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that, in my opinion, it should come in a pump or spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, and my face has soaked in plenty of benefits. Plus it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this.  The fragrance is beautiful and lasts a long time.  It feels wonderful on my skin.  I&#x27;ve looked for a product like this for a long time and have finally found it.  Will definitely order again and will definitely recommend.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant and calming. I never thought i had sensitive skin, but I think this may be a little to strong for me. I have used this only for a week and noticed that my chin has become irritated. Granted it hasn&#x27;t broken out, it was red and had small little bumps. I also have noticed that the pores on my face is becoming more visible. I may have to dilute it a bit and try it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, smells wonderful-Use it everyday.  Delivery fast!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent toner.  I use it after applying Hyaluronic Acid on my face, wait till it dries, then mist my face with the rose water. And the fragrance is wonderful.  I did try misting my hair before shampooing but my hair is so fine that I don&#x27;t recommend it for people who have very fine and thin hair.  Yes, it did make my hair softer and shiny, but it didn&#x27;t have much body to it  and was difficult to style even with a gel mouse.  Would probably be great for women with thick unmanageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is doing something wonderful for my face because after 30 years of marriage, my husband has been giving me compliments for the last week like, &amp;#34;wow you look really nice&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;what are you doing to make your skin so pretty?&amp;#34;  Never heard anything like that from him before.  Will be ordering more of the rose water.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many toners I have been through,  tried,  and discarded before I even finished the product because they didn&#x27;t stand up to their claims.  This one does.  I have acne,  and I&#x27;m trying to keep wrinkles at bay.  This does it all!</li>
    <li> I just used it only one week. I don&#x27;t see any change. I know the product very good. I will give time and updated</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!  This was a free product for review.</li>
    <li> tightened my pores fast and started healing damaged skin very quickly AND IM A YOUNGIN!&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sRDhzT519zU</li>
    <li> Great product, love the scent and it go onto your skin nicely. Will buy again. Seller has great follow-up and sends you tips on how to use rosewater. Nice customer service!</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell of this and it feels great on my skin. No sensitivity issue either which gets a big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any itching or discomfort.  Quite the opposite.  It seems to soothe and has a very pleasant natural fragrance from the rose.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Smells delicious and makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews about stuff that I have purchased  but this time I feelt that I have to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally in love with this rose water! This special one is perfect for all ski  types, I have dry, oily and sensitive skin and use this one like a toner. I will never change to another one. I really recommend this rose water.</li>
    <li> All InstaNatural products have been very pleasing.  My skin is softer and the wrinkles are not as noticeable.  Definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> InstaNaturals does it again. I purchased the Moroccan rose water facial toner after sampling several complimentary products provided by InstaNaturals. I have loved everything about every product I have tried by this company so far. The best thing is the fact that they use organic ingredients. The ingredients in this toner? 100% pure Moroccan rose water- that&#x27;s it. No alcohol, chemicals,or preservatives that will dry your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product as a toner as well as a refreshing wake up spritz during the day. I keep some in a small spray bottle and spritz on my face throughout the day to keep my skin looking and feeling moist and refreshed. I love the scent of roses,and this product definitely provides that. This is a great all natural product that will help tone the skin and reduce pore size as well. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an organic alternative to their regular skin toner.</li>
    <li> I use this for toner. It does help my face to become smoother along with my moisturizer. I&#x27;ve yet to see it help with my dark under eye circles but it does help relax my eyes.</li>
    <li> Only been using this a couple of days now but so far I really like it.  It removes all trace makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all.  My face feels fresh after using this.</li>
    <li> love ti awesomequality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Rose water before...but WOWEEE!  I love it!  I have extremely sensitive skin, and battle breakouts of poison oak due to where I live. As soon as I got it I dabbed some onto a cotton ball and then rubbed in on some extremely itchy patches that have had a hard time going away. Relief!  I&#x27;ve also enjoyed using it as a skin toner on my face. Overall...the smell is just heavenly!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!! Product as described!!</li>
    <li> This product came as described and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> I really like it. The aroma is very nice. It is gentle on the face and gives soft, fresh and clean looking face.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It feels very refreshing and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> I have some problem skin that breaks out, even as an adult.  This has seemed to really help a lot with reducing and preventing larger breakouts.  I&#x27;m really loving this rose water!  I will definitely continue to use it!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Oh my stars, this rose water is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! My friend gave me half of her bottle, a few months ago to try out. She swore by it, along with many other of InstaNatural products. This rose water not only feels so gentle, and soothing on this skin, but it smells heavenly, and lingers through out the day. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea. This water, along with their Dead Sea Mud Mask, Argan Oil, Retinol Moisturizer Cream and Hyalurinuc Acid Serum are wonderful, my sensitive skin is very in love with them all! Thank you InstaNatural for your high quality, low price gems! I am now a forever, faithful and loyal customer!!</li>
    <li> I was having such a hard time finding a toner that worked for me. Most left my face feeling too greasy or too dry. I love this product and will be using it for now on. It just left my face feeling soft and clean!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. I bought it to replace my toner that was full of chemicals. In that short amount of time I have already noticed big changes in my skin. First off, and most importantly to me, it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. I use it every day. With my old toner, I could see white areas where the skin had been dried out from using it. Using this product, I don&#x27;t see that and the whiteness from the old product is gone. Secondly, I have noticed that any cuts or scrapes I get heal faster since I have been using this product. It is not an overnight change but enough for me to notice that it helps with the healing. And finally, I have noticed an evening out of my skin tone. I love this product and plan to purchase it again and again for years to come.</li>
    <li> I am very fond of the genre.I have used various natural rosewater sprays for years, mostly as a pleasant refresher or pre-makeup spray to lighten foundation application. Since I chose carefully, they were satisfactory to very good. This product is something else altogether. I use it after washing my face and before moisturizer, and it works more like a treatment. It leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and somehow &amp;#34;improved,&amp;#34; as if that was just what I needed. To be scientific I tried the three rose sprays I had on hand with a cotton pad instead of the spray, and they were still just pleasant. So it wasn&#x27;t the method of application that made the difference. This rose water is in a higher-level category of skin care. And it smells lovely. I&#x27;d like to be able to get it in a spray form (though of course I can put it in one of my other bottles).</li>
    <li> As soon as I got this Morrocan rose Water, I used it on my face. I didn&#x27;t feel any inflammation. My face doesn&#x27;t feel oily either. This product smells delightful and feels nice on your face. This manufacture stands behind the quality of this product, offering a lifetime money back guarantee. The price is very reasonable and it is a nice-sized bottle.</li>
    <li> Absolutley loved this product. Did not leave my face dried out and made me feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the Moroccan rose water. It smells nice, it moisturizes and cleans good without drying the skin.</li>
    <li> This smells so good! It&#x27;s very gentle and not overpowering. It feels nice on my skin. Nice product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Moroccan Rose Water as a toner for just about a week now. So far, it has been a welcomed addition to my daily skin routine. My skin appears smoother and I have less blemishes.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Have enjoyed looking into its many uses...</li>
    <li> Great products! Would definitely recommend! Thanks again- Rebecca Schneider</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week now. I use it after I wash my face to remove any traces of makeup. It works great for that. I still use moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> Great for baths, add a little and you will be having a relaxing bath with the scent of roses. Recommend this product to anyone that maybe stressed all the time. Using this is great to help you calm down and just enjoy life for a moment.</li>
    <li> I use this as a toner. I love it and great smell.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> I really love this rose water toner. It smells beautiful and expensive, and makes my skin so soft! The scent is not overpowering and goes away after about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt; I am very acne prone and this seems to help blemishes heal up quicker vs. without using it. It reduces the redness around blemishes, too. It really has multiple benefits which makes it a great product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is also quite sensitive and this causes no irritation or dryness, unlike commercial toners packed with chemicals and alcohol. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.&lt;br /&gt; I do wish the bottle had a stopper with a small hole in it, or even better yet, a pump - but this is just a very minor worry of mine as I&#x27;m quite clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural toner! I really think it would work well for all skin types, but mine is combination.</li>
    <li> rosewater&lt;br /&gt;First off let me tell you I have very sensitive skin to the point I can&#x27;t use soap to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with this product because other toners I have used burned when applied to the face. This one did NOT burn my face but it did cool it and felt soft after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;For making your pores small I feel it did that. It also said it tightens. It might do that but I didn&#x27;t really feel tighter like other product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;How ever I think the best part of this product was the smell. It smells like fresh cute roses on your face.</li>
    <li> I was first interested in this product because it can be used as a toner. I love experimenting with different toners and I had just run out of my previous product. Turns out, this is not the best toner for me at this time. I have combination skin with a particularly oily t-zone during the summer, and I really need a product that&#x27;s alcohol-based (this contains nothing but rose water). This didn&#x27;t remove a lot of makeup for me, personally. (It did remove some, though. I imagine liquid foundation is hard to get off.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my skin is somewhat sensitive and this did not cause any sort of negative reaction. I actually think it was kind of soothing. It dried without leaving any residue. And I think it could be really good for someone with dry skin, or if used during the winter (when my cheeks dry out a lot, as I&#x27;m often out walking the dog in the cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already use rose water for cosmetic purposes, this is competitively priced. It smells wonderful when you open the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try a couple of other things with it, as well. I put some in my bath water (about 8 caps&#x27; worth). It provided a subtle and relaxing scent (you did have to get kind of close to the water to smell it). I think it made my hair smell nice, as well (since my hair was down in the bath water). The scent lingers for a bit, but not all day (so no worries about overpowering your coworkers in the elevator!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I tried that&#x27;s kind of nice is, I have this terra cotta aromatherapy diffuser. You put a tea light in the bottom and then you normally put water and a few drops of essential oil in the top. I just put this rose water in there, instead. It made my kitchen smell lovely (use in a small room like a kitchen or bathroom for best results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not tested on animals, if that happens to be important to you. I would not say this was a product I needed to have, by any means, but I have enjoyed trying some different things with it. I think this would be best for aromatherapy purposes and/or as a toner for dry skin. I plan to hang on to the remainder of my bottle and try it again when the weather gets colder. 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.gs with it.

    <li> I use this as a toner after washing my face to remove make up. Love the smell, not too strong. Face feels more hydrated. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use this daily after I cleanse, before I moisturize and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 22 yr old daughter who has very sensitive skin. She has been using it for over a week as a toner. She loves how soft it makes her skin feel and that it doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin like most everything else she has ever tried does. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> OMG this this is perfect on my skin. Feels so soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is a really lovely product, very gentle on sensitive, rosacea skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Ive been using it for 5 month. Love how it preps my skin for makeup. Love wearing it eithout makeup too. Will continue to buy thid product. The price for this item is decresing which is great!</li>
    <li> The aroma is incredibly pleasant and this works very well as a toner.</li>
    <li> Tightens my pores and is a great cleanser, I&#x27;m going to put some in my shampoo next. This product really works my skin feels so clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I like the smell of it, and it works sufficiently so far. Will update when I have used it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the quality ingredients you get in this bottle. Amazing fragrance. My skins texture is softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> This water very need in the Sumer,don&#x27;t stick on the face!</li>
    <li> The Moroccan Rose water facial toner is refreshing and soothing.  It has a light fragrance of roses, with no oily residue, your skin will feel totally clean.  Another Instanatural product that has become an addiction for me.  Easy to order through Amazon, fast delivery and good communication.</li>
    <li> After trying the argan oil from this brand, I decided to try the Rose water since most rose waters found in stores are not fully potent and don&#x27;t deliver full benefits. This rose water smells absolutely heavenly and natural and tightens, hydrates, and decreases redness in my combination skin. I recommend putting it in the fridge because it immediately de-puffs your eyes and tightens pores when you need it the most in the morning. I find that I don&#x27;t have to use a makeup primer to fill in pores when I use this as a toner, and it also sets makeup beautifully if you spray it on your face. I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for sensitive skin.  Seems to help calm my breakouts as well.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a very good value for your money.</li>
    <li> This product can make your hair shiny, can help with facial blemishes, it can help with sunburn, and if added can give you a relaxing bath. I just love that it can be used for so many things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional blogger that was asked to review this product. I give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The rose water face toner is great.  It&#x27;s natural, gentle and refreshing. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff, it smells amazing and made my skin feel so soft and refreshed at the end of the day. You can use it straight out of the bottle as a very gentle toner, which is what I did for the first few days of use. And it was the perfect addition to my homemade toner recipe as well, which included witch hazel, tea tree oil, and hyalauronic acid. I would bathe in this stuff if the bottle was big enough for sure. You can add this product to pretty much anything, which is great for the DIYers like myself. I highly recommend this product and this company.    I received this free for review purposes, but all opinions expressed are my own and freely given.</li>
    <li> I like the light scent. I love to use it in the morning. It takes off any oils you get while&lt;br /&gt;sleeping, makes your face feel refreshed! This is the second bottle I have purchased!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It smells divine and works like a charm.  I have now ordered more of their products to prepare for the winter months.</li>
    <li> This toner is very refreshing. I have been using it for past three weeks and I see it working very well with my sensitive and combination skin type. It&#x27;s the best one out there. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just starts using this recently.  It&#x27;s been about over a week and I&#x27;m impressed. It smells lovely not overwhelming.  I feel like it&#x27;s cleansing my skin from deep.  I don&#x27;t have much acne but occasional and recently more often than I would like.  This seems to be brining everything to the surface and helping heal much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after cleansing as a toner.  I will continue using this, I found a new staple in my beatify regimen.</li>
    <li> Use every day!!! This is all I would use as a toner. Works wonderfully!!</li>
    <li> Product given by the Company for Testing and Review Purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used a facial toner in years and when asked to review this product I was interested because I heard Rose Water is very good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well, first of all the Moroccan Rose water  from Instanatural smells wonderful, it&#x27;s a smell that you would like to splash all over your body so I&#x27;m glad this too can be used in the bath water to receive a pampering experience.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it in the bath yet but I definitely will and I will also google some recipes to use it with as well.That is how good and beneficial Rose Water is.&lt;br /&gt;After I cleanse my face with my Yes to Cucumbers towelettes, I use the Instanatural Rose Water  as a toner by simply putting some on a cotton pad and patting into my face and neck. My face feels a little tight and then feels and looks refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;And I can see any debris that my Yes to Cucumbers towelettes did not lift properly so I know Rose Water removes dirt and makeup residue while giving my face a clean and refreshed glow.&lt;br /&gt;I really am going to enjoy using this product for a long time. Now, that&#x27;s the third beauty weapon in my skincare regimen:)</li>
    <li> Wow! This is an spectacular product! There are so many uses, I don&#x27;t even know where to start! I have been using it for everything! I put some in a spray bottle to spray on my face AND hair! It left my skin soft and glowing! It made my hair soft and shiny and smelling so good! I used it in my bath water to help calm and relax me...and of course to smell insanely good! It is a large bottle so it will last a while! I am happy to recieve this item to review! It&#x27;s a great product! I love it and will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, great scent and gentle on your face. Cleans very nicely and you can also use a few drops in other creams or shampoos. This is my second time ordering this product and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love and highly recommend this product. It makes my skin feel refreshed, not tight but definitely clean. I also love the light rose scented smell. I will definitely order this again. I get so many compliments on my skin and even complexion. I think having good genes, a healthy routine, and this product is the reason...</li>
    <li> This Moroccan Rose water is amazing. It smells great and It really works to soften your skin and help imperfections not as noticeable!</li>
    <li> This product seems nice, smells good, too. However, it was arrived with 1/3 of bottle leaking since it must not having inner liner. Rid was covered with heat seal shrink wrap, but it was not enough to seal in a liquid.  I did not want to pay full price for 2/3 of a bottle, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week - but I love it. Smells lovely and works great as a toner. Do your skin a favor and buy it!</li>
    <li> This product is good for my rosecia and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Heavenly scent.  Feels light and refreshing on face.  I have also used in hair.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised to see how good this product is.  I have been using harsher toners for about 55 years, but after reading the good reviews on this, I decided to give it a try.  At first it cleaned the surface &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; then I used a second pad and all of a sudden some deep grime my current toner had been leaving behind (eek) showed up. So I used 4 pads, and continued to pull out old grime from my pores.  Wow! And my skin felt refreshed after, not taut and rawish.  The fragrance is lovely.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve stopped using moisturizer after purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I love the light, fresh rose scent of this product. Because it&#x27;s all natural, my face loves it!  I have Rosacea and it&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t aggravate it.  This Morroccan Rose Water keeps away the redness and feels light and clean.  This is a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, not too strong. Feels nice as well, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out (every other cleanser I&#x27;ve used did it, which makes this one a winner automatically); didn&#x27;t cause any acne breakouts (might have made it better?). The bottle is pretty big too.</li>
    <li> Amazing product,love the smell .</li>
    <li> I have started including this in my shampoo routine and have noticed that my hair is much softer and white shinier wonderful product being that has multiple uses very glad to get it at a nice discount so that I could try it definitely worth your time</li>
    <li> My face feels and looks better.  I also love that it&#x27;s not harsh or drying on my skin.  I use as a toner before moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and soothing.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This was my first InstaNatural purchase - and definitely not my last.  Great basic toner.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a wonder product, but it&#x27;s refreshing and helps balance my skin after washing.  If you are interested in rose water as a toner, stop looking and try this.  I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of &amp;#34;rose water&amp;#34; toner, and this was the only that was truly natural.  Great value - beat only by the great scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural  Moroccan Rose Water for several weeks now as a face toner/freshener after cleansing; it leaves my skin feeling soft.  ready for the next steps of serum and moisturizer.  I enjoy the pleasant rose smell; it&#x27;s not too overpowering and goes away in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;This is an InstaNatural product that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase.  Everything I&#x27;ve purchased from InstaNatural has been of high quality and I appreciate the fact that they check with you via email to make sure you completely satisfied with their products and are they are always available to answer any questions and/or concerns.  If you looking for natural products this is a wonderful company with wonderful natural products.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and. Soothing.  For a cooling effect store in refrigerator and wipe with cotton pads.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. I use it in the morning and at night. It has helped with my blackheads. It does dry your skin out at first but it does eventually go away. The smell is nice, a little strong at first but it fades quickly. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of this item. Not only the smell but the way that it made my face feel and look. My face felt clean and had a nice glow afterward. I also put some in my bath water and enjoyed the smell the whole relaxing time!! Glad I purchased this item!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have sensitive skin, and was able to use this product without any negative reaction! Its very gentle on the skin!</li>
    <li> Most amazing Rosewater ever! I love this stuff! The smells is a bouquet in a bottle and its the best natural toner I&#x27;ve ever tried. Love love love!!</li>
    <li> This rose water is awesome</li>
    <li> I have been thinking of getting a toner for my face to use after an intense cleaning. I wanted to try something more natural rather than a drug store toner. This fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s natural and it smells GREAT!!!! I&#x27;ve used it three times already and I like it a lot so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that is great for cleansing and toning my face at night.  I feel refreshed and clean after using this product and could swear the skin on my face even feels softer.  I also tried it on may hair prior to blow drying it (did not rinse it out), and love how it protected my hair from the heat of the blow dryer.  My hair felt soft and was easy to style after.  I purchased this when they offered a special discount, and could not wait to review it.  It is a great product that I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I can not be without this stuff. My skin would suffer without it!!! Smells like, of course, a rose! Its great as a toner, but also great to put in your bath. I put in my child&#x27;s bath every night, and there skin feels and smells amazing afterward. I add a little InstaNatural Argan oil for my sons eczema, and it works better than any other treatment I&#x27;ve tried for him.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Before I use it, I had lots of black heads on my nose. However, during I use this product, it reduced my black heads a lot! Also, it makes my skin brighter! At last, it did not make any skin trouble which is the best part!</li>
    <li> I love using natural products specially when it comes to something that I am going to apply on my face. One of the things I love about this facial toner is that it has many uses.The first thing I noticed about this product is that it does not smell bad I actually like the smell, after I apply it my skin just feels so fresh and smooth and it reduces any redness on my skin which is great since some of the other toners I have tried before would do the exact opposite and would irritate my skin.</li>
