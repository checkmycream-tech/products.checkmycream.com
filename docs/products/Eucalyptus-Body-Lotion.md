<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lotion is good for rough skin areas</li>
    <li> LOVE Thymes products, especially Eucalyptus.  The scent of Eucalyptus is fresh and clean and I always get compliments on it. Most importantly for me is that my skin appearance has improved.  My arms are softer and not as red as they once appeared.&lt;br /&gt;Most definately recommmend even though its expensive, very worth the price!</li>
    <li> Hand lotion and body lotion. Delicious!</li>
    <li> love the scent, so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I keep coming back for more.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for a long time and when I have it on people ask what scent it is!</li>
    <li> The lotion provides body shimmering because of power of  ingredients incorporated.  It energize the body and produces a lasting smell effect, that makes our outdoors likable.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this lotion to no avail, until I thought to check Amazon. I am so happy that Amazom carries this product line and that I could use Amazon Prime for this purchase as well. The lotion smells awesome, it&#x27;s just the right kind of thickness for this dry weather...and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the quantity for this product was the same size as the one I purchased several years ago. It felt like a bargain in this day and age of the ever shrinking product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product from Thymes</li>
    <li> This body lotion is one of the best that I have tried. It has a wonderful, fresh fragrance and leaves your skin very soft. A great product, and I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion with wonderful aroma.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product because it does not smell like eucalyptus. I know what eucalyptus smell like. This product has a very very strong cirtus smell. I read the ingredients, it has lemon peel oil, lime oil, tangerine leaf oil. These oil strongly cover the scent of eucalyptus. Honestly, I did not smell eucalyptus at all.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and aroma but wish it would smell more of eucalyptus which is why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> My favorite body lotion.  I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Really nice fragrance. I also use their home spray before company comes and the house always smells beautiful.</li>
    <li> good experience...thank you</li>
    <li> This is expensive but I treated myself this Christmas and use it sparingly.  It has a scent that I find just perfect.  Not too heavy, light and fruity but I don&#x27;t think \\&quot;fruit\\&quot; when I use it.  Like clean soap.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion...it smells fresh and is not sticky.  It keeps my skin soft and smooth.  Worth every penny.....a superior product.</li>
    <li> Just like its body wash, I adore this scent. The lotion is not watery at all, absorbs quickly, and leaves the skin soft without a greasy feel. The scent lasts longer on clothes so I like to wear it before bed so my pajamas and linens stay perfumed. If I could collect everything from this line in this scent I would, budget allowing.</li>
    <li> Great smell and lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> Are Thymes products cruelty free?</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for moisturizing your whole body.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it mosturize, a little goes a long way, and the smell is divine.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is refreshing, and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little strong when you first put it on, but mellows quickly, leaving a light scent, that smells &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;pefume-ish&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so good. I prefer to use it on my arms and hands only - using shea butter as body moisturizer....</li>
    <li> All of Thymes products are of great quality and there isn&#x27;t one that we haven&#x27;t enjoyed. Each aroma is great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used this particular Thymes product.  I bought it to be used as a gift.  I&#x27;m sure, if it&#x27;s anything like the Thymes Eucalyptus fragrance mist or the Thymes Eucalyptus candle, it will be just wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery! I love this stuff and it&#x27;s WAY more expensive everywhere else. Thank you for making it a pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It keeps my skin soft and I love the smell! I also recommend any other Thymes products.</li>
    <li> The most wonderful refreshing sent and it&#x27;s not greasy. I love it. Keeps your skin soft and I&#x27;m sure you will love it too.</li>
    <li> Excellent body lotion the fragance is up lifting.  Smells great I do recomend this product. I defenetly will buy it again</li>
    <li> I love the clean fresh smell and it lasts all day long too. If folks are ok with the price, then go a head and treat yourself. I&#x27;m not sure if  I will purchase it again. I think the price is a little high for a 9oz lotion. I&#x27;m waiting for the cologne to arrive  so once I start layering it, I might not have to use as much and it will go further.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my very favorite one.  I always  wear it . People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Of course i tell them it&#x27;s Thymes Boby lotion  Eucalyptus</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who requested it. She loves the scent and how refreshing it is.</li>
    <li> Have used the Thymes Eucalyptus products for years. Love the refreshing scent.  Get compliments on the scent all the time after using it.</li>
    <li> this lotion has a slight cooling sensation which has a soothing, calming effect - it can be slightly thinned by using slightly damp hands to apply - spreads more easily and lasts longer that way</li>
    <li> Thymes Body Lotion meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I greet&lt;br /&gt;R&amp;#62;L</li>
    <li> This lotion is a treat for me because it can be pricey… but I love the light smell and it is a great moisturizer.  Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using this this cream every single day for 2 years already, and before i ran out i go ahead and get me a new one. It feels really good, it is fresh and light on your skin. I definetly recommend it to every one.</li>
    <li> I have used this item since 2005 when a sample was left at a 5 star hotel in Vancouver.  I love it!  Everywhere I go, I get compliments  on this fragrance, and it not only is an excellent body lotion,but has an elegant lasting fragrance.  This company in Mpls. MN, manufacturers the finest products, and guarantees everything that they sell.  Only high end stores carry their products.  Since the original stores (boutique) where  I was purchasing this product and others of the Thymes products, have closed, I had to turn to online service.  Shopping with Amazon makes my shopping easy.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I thought it was going to smell like but it still had a nice fragrance. My girlfriend likes the smell so I&#x27;ll give it to her.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for over a yeat now and have not been able to find a better body lotion.  Very moisturizing and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this lotion. This was the second time we ordered more. It&#x27;s soothing without a greasy feel, absorbs roght away, and has a very nice scent. GOOD STUFF!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it really does moisturize my skin.  You will not be disappointed if you try this.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Very fresh and natural smelling. Way better than perfume in my opinion.</li>
    <li> been using for years - love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like smell. Smelt like cleaning solution. Lotion was very good either. Gave it away.</li>
    <li> The best flavor in the world! I get a lot of compliments.  The cologne is nice as well but Amazon did not have the cologne. I went to Hallmark!</li>
    <li> Ever sin&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a eucalyptus fan, but the clean fresh and just healthy scent has totally won me over. The moisturizing ability is amazing! I&#x27;m now looking at other products in the line. Love the soap, a nice, generous sized bar!</li>
    <li> My wife  loves this lotion.  I&#x27;m never at a loss for stocking stuffers at Christmas or here and there gifts.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my hands mostly, but did use it on my entire body after a shower one time. The lotion has shea butter and Vitamin E packed into it, and I look for both in my body lotions. It smells great and seems to stay on my body long after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in my monthly Birchbox for sample.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great!  Plus it has a very refreshing and clean scent.  I always get compliments when I use it.  And when I especially want to relax, I use it before I go to sleep (and them my sheets smell great, too).</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, I was on vacation and found this in Montana just outside Yellowstone National Park. Of, course it was very expensive but I bought it anyway.  When I got back from my trip I looked on Amazon and good old Amazon, there it was and a great price.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase and I also purchased the body wash.  The scent may seem strong at first, almost medicinal but it lightens up into a very relaxing and beautiful fragrance.  If it is still too strong, mix it with an unscented lotion, like Cetaphil and it will be perfect.</li>
    <li> Once purchased my favorite lavander lotion on line and received a sample of the eucalyputus lotion and have been hooked on it ever since.</li>
    <li> Great product, great fragrance and great skin recovery and rehydration.  Somewhat difficult to find but Amazon came through for us!</li>
    <li> I have several very nice fragrances I wear.  Depending on the time of year and on the occasion, I wear Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue, Estee Lauder Beautiful, or Egyptian Musk Oil.  I&#x27;ll receive a compliment once-and-a-while, but nothing like when I use Thymes eucalyptus lotion.  I can apply it after my shower at night, and the next day, co-workers and even strangers in the grocery will comment on how fabulous I smell.  Best of all, it&#x27;s the ONLY &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; that generates compliments from my husband.  A little bit goes a LONG way though.  Definitely worth the cost.  Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delicious fragrance&lt;br /&gt;and very emollient. Would order again.&lt;br /&gt;Glad the price was a less expensive than&lt;br /&gt;the store.</li>
    <li> I found this body cream in a boutique, and absolutely fell in love with it. I just tried it on, and had to go back to the store the next day. I bought five bottles of it! I disagree with other reviewers that it is a bit manly; I receive compliments on it all the time! The cream is thick and keeps the skin moist as well. Yes, a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite body lotion. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Like all Thymes products, fabulous!</li>
    <li> My favorite for many years.  Clean, refreshing and wonderful for the scent and the emollients in the creams are excellent.  I have stockpiled a  little bit just in case the production line shuts down.......  I certainly hope not!!</li>
    <li> All that it said it was.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wrote the wrong review for the hand wash.  Thought it was the body lotion.  It is a hard to find lotion.  Don&#x27;t know why because it is wonderful, goes on very smooth and soaks in very well.  Love the fragrance.  Stays with me for a while too.</li>
    <li> I am a great fan of Thymes products.  Am so happy to find them on Amazon!  This lotion is shear luxury and the lovely, herbal scent is just DIVINE!!!  Give it a try; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> The smell and the feel.  What else can I say?  LOVE IT.  Ive been hooked on this scent for ever and hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Great refreshing smell. I love this lotion!</li>
    <li> Delicious smell, subtle, not overwhelming, not sweet.  Works well for me, would purchase again. Lotion not too heavy, not too watery, perfect consistency.  If you like fragrances more to the woodsy side and subtle, this is the one for you.  Love the Thymes brand</li>
    <li> LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> I love the scent of eucalyptus so this lotion is perfect for me.  It also doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling to it when you use it.  I use it almost nightly and a bottle goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Such a fresh lasting smell, almost like aroma therapy!!!</li>
    <li> love the smell; not real thick so soaks in skin well</li>
    <li> Wonderful clean fragrance, subtle and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have used this scent for years.  Use the lotion, as well as the cologne &amp; body wash.  Nice, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> love this eucalyptus and lavender scents. found it at high end speciality for a lot more $$$. can wear with other fragrances or alone. long lasting on my skin. my husband and I both use philosophy pure grace lotion. I like thymes much better for the scent and lasting power! so glad I found it here. please keep it.</li>
    <li> This is the first Thyme I bought and I like it very much.........I have not been disappointd in any of the scents I have purchased.  They are all different and unique.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Thymes line of products; Christmas is not the same without their wonderful candles scenting the way through the season.  Their body wash and hand soap are still as good as ever.  But the latest batches of Thymes lotion.....growing progressively, but noticeably thin.  THIN LOTION IS NOT LOTION.  Lotion is meant to lubricate, soften and soothe and it has to possess a hardy consistency to get the job done.  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS &#x27;TOO THICK&#x27; IN LOTION.  One can apply too much lotion (so, use less!), and lotion can grow old and congeal (so, use it more often!), but there is no such thing as lotion being &amp;#34;too thick.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ask you:  is it possible for a lotion to go bald?  That must be what is happening with Thymes Eucalyptus Body Lotion...it does not even smell wonderful any more.  SIGH!</li>
    <li> I keep this at my desk for the smell of relaxation and calmness. While it&#x27;s not thick enough to use all over the body during the winter, I love using it all over during the summer. I first got hooked onto this brand when I was at a SPA about 10 years ago. The quality is superb and this brand never disappoints.</li>
    <li> The perfect product to use ( combined with the cologne) for  occasions when a parfum is maybe too much to wear but you need to feel  a fragance.</li>
    <li> It smells so fresh and smooths the skin. Very nice lotion. I use it after the body wash to keep the great smell longer.</li>
    <li> This is probably the nicest smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, and the best part is the scent stays on your skin for pretty much the whole day. It has a really good feel too, not greasy at all. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am not the kind of girl who likes flowery smelling lotions and that is why I love this lotion.  It has a very clean pleasant scent.  It is a substantial scent without being over powering.  I would recommend this product to anyone .</li>
    <li> Thanks, I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this lotionand soap. Most men do not like it.  smells last a good while thru-out the day.</li>
    <li> I have used Thymes products for years and have been pleased with the quality and performance, the scent lasts a long time.  I use either Eucalyptus or Olive Leaf, both are fresh, clean and botanical smelling as opposed to being flowery or perfumey.  I get lots of compliments for how good I smell when wearing them.</li>
    <li> very pricey but also smells great..especially the eucalyptus..its wonderful and really rather sensual</li>
    <li> Thymes&#x27; products are very good quality overall. Consistent body lotion quality and fragrance. I have settled on Eucalyptus because of its non-perfumey, &#x27;green&#x27; fragrance. It&#x27;s light but has a nice body that lingers pleasantly.</li>
    <li> Amazing produce and scent is lovely.  My sister in law loved it when I wore it at her place.  I bought her one, and she is delighted!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 15 years.  It smells so clean and fresh.  I am going to purchase another bottle of the lotion and the body spray.  It&#x27;s that good!</li>
