      <li>There is a see-through cover on top and a magnetic bottom to hold my eyeshadow pans.  </li>
      <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for Kandee, I would not have known about these cute palette pot keepers.</li>

      <li>Thia is not only great for traveling but also consolidating your make up.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and I like the design as well as the transparent cover.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!  Organize my eyeshadows in one location!  Very Convenient!  And, I can see what&#x27;s inside the pallet!  Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that!</li>
    <li> Daughter wanted it for her birthday.  I thought it was a little &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; for what it actually is, but she was happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loves it. The magnetic closure is strong, there is plenty of room for her favorite eye shadow colors. She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love z palettes for de-potting make up from its original packaging to save space and better organize my stash.  Some of the magnets that come with the palette don&#x27;t have the best quality adhesive, but they work great otherwise and you can always purchase better magnets.</li>
    <li> If you have any sort of makeup collection, there is a day where all the packaging starts to drive you nuts. Either because they are clunky, bulky, space ineffective, or hard to use- it will happen. Most YouTube and makeup bloggers recommend these things, and with good reason. You can instantly consolidate much of your makeup into a condensed, neat package. Simply remove the pan of eyeshadow (or whatever) from the original packaging and stick it onto the large magnetic sheet within the Z-Palette. Done.&lt;br /&gt;Now, some makeup packaging is more difficult to charm than others, and there is a plethora of de-potting tutorials online. But once you get those pans loose, you can arrange them in any fashion you like in the palette and then SEE them through the handy window- no useless mirrors here. The cardboard and plastic is sturdy and the magnetic closure strong. The palette opens completely flat, and comes in an array of colors.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I could think of is despite this being a large size, it was still smaller than I expected. I could see how a makeup artist or enthusiast would need MANY of these to make a dent in their collection- which is why so many prefer the MAC palettes (which are both bigger, cheaper and made entirely out of plastic). But the MAC palettes require inserts (to my understanding), and unless your collection is consistent enough to fit in those inserts, the Z-Palette is way more versatile for the average person.</li>
    <li> I totally purchased this after seeing several Makup Gurus on YT talk about them. I totally LOVE these palettes. They are great for organizing de-potted shadows, blushes, pressed powders, and lipsticks that are in pans. Great for makeup artists that don&#x27;t want to carry around 500 different eyeshadows in their original packaging,which takes up A LOT of space. Also great for travel, when you want to carry a few eyeshadows, powder, blush and bronzer. Reason I gave it 4 stars, is I wish there was a small mirror in it, and also that the palette was just a tad deeper, for pans that are deep and also need magnetic tape ( if the pan isn&#x27;t magnetic), but other than that these are GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these palettes for over a year now. I have my Urban Decay, The Balm, MAC, Stila, etc. shadows all tucked in nicely into this easy to organize palette. When not in use, they fit perfectly into my train case. The only negative is that they become slightly grungy from shadow that is shaken loose, and can become bent as they&#x27;re just thick cardboard.</li>
    <li> Love this palette!  Love the zebra strips, I only wish this pattern was available in extra large.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected to get in the mail.  There is a see-through cover on top and a magnetic bottom to hold my eyeshadow pans.  The price you find on Amazon is cheaper than on other websites for the large z palette.  I originally purchased the smaller one, but it is too small if you own more than 9 eyeshadow pans, so the small one is only good for travel.  There is a medium sized z palette, but it&#x27;s barely cheaper than the large one, so if you want your money&#x27;s worth, definitely purchase the large one.  The cover also folds back all the way to allow for easier access to your products.  Bottom line...I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> A little smaller than i was expected</li>
    <li> Wish I had known about these sooner. This is the best way to keep your makeup. Takes up much less space.</li>
    <li> Great for pros or amateurs alike.</li>
    <li> I own 2! I have all my blushes in one and all my M.A.C eye shadows in the other. Love, love, love this product! the only thing is that since this is \\&quot;cardboard\\&quot; it may bend a little in the corners but other that that it priceless to have if you own a lot of makeup like myself.</li>
    <li> Love this palette! It has been such a perfect addition to my others. Just the right size.</li>
    <li> The Zebra pattern I received looked nothing like the photo. The stripes were not thin. The one I received looked more like this one [[ASIN:B004KKQKGO B004KKQKGO]] which I did not like. Returning is too much of a hassle so I&#x27;m stuck with an ugly version of this.</li>
    <li> I love my new Z Palette! I will definitely be purchasing more of these in tbe near future.  The variety of designs is makes shopping fun.</li>
    <li> Love the z palette itself!! Wish I had ordered the strips to go with them so I could have started depotting right when i got it!! if there is paper (name of shadow) on your item, they will not stick to the magnet!!     *******When ordering the Fabulous Pink palette from this site, note that it is $14.00 for a small one (disregard the large palette picture).  Customer service was fabulous with handling this for me!! Love the products and their customer service (beauty.com/amazon.com)~~</li>
    <li> Perfect. Love the print.</li>
    <li> It is small can&#x27;t put much in it best to get the x x large  for makeup filling can get but three in it</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! love, love this palette. the color is vibrant the texture is so smooth and well made. my eye shadow pans from Makeup Geek, Coastal Scents and even NYX fits perfectly. it fits 27 regular pans and even came with circle and square magnets. I only used the magnets for my NYX pans and sense they are a little smaller than the Coastal Scents and Makeup Geek, I manage to fit 28 pans. its a great Z palette and I really do recommended.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the z palettes I own. They really helped me to de-clutter my makeup draws. They were so so crowded with wet n wild trios and 8-pans palettes and with the z palettes I was able to make so much more room! love these things! def want to buy more in the future!!!</li>
    <li> Found THE BEST dupe to this product!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/03/z-palette-dupe-mac.html</li>
    <li> I love my Z palette, I was so tired of having loose makeup items. Saves me on space.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast and pricing was the best I could find!!!! Will be repurchasing again soon!!</li>
    <li> Love these! Great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Item looks great and has a sturdy &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; that allows you to see which eyeshadows or blushes you have inside. It&#x27;s pretty spacious lengthwise. Its not high enough for baked products, but there&#x27;s a different Z palette for baked products. Since I purchase this from Makeup Geek they sent it with a free eyeshadow and a personalized note, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> my items were easier to depot than expected and I love the zebra design on the Z palette. Its pretty big and I still haven&#x27;t filled it up, even though I have enough shadow to fill a few of them. I only put my favorites in there.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the zebra color and pattern and also the size of it, which is exactly what I was hoping it would be.  my only concern is learning how to use it since I have never owned one.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased when I received my Z Palette.  When Makeup Geek heard that they had forgotten my free shadow, they more than compensated!  Very pleased with their professionalism and courteous way they treat their customers!</li>
    <li> The palette has enough space for my eyeshadow. It&#x27;s easy to clean and I like the design as well as the transparent cover. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I love Z palettes! Saves me space in my makeup case and I love it and I recommend everyone, especially makeup artists, to have this in their kit.</li>
    <li> This palette was a part of the Christmas presents for my daughter.  She already owns some, like the pink one, another animal print, a black one, but, she needed the zebra too!  She loved it!  It&#x27;s the large size and she can fit a bunch of eye shadows, I liked it too, I own a large size pink one and they are great!</li>
    <li> This palette works great. I bought it to depot my Mac eyeshadows and now I have more space in my makeup kit.</li>
    <li> I love this z palette! It is magnetized, but only holds pans that are also magnetized. Those hold really well. It comes with magnetic stickers for non-magnetic pans! The stickers keep their hold on both the palette and the pan! I bought a second z palette because I liked it so much! Great space saver!</li>
    <li> I am loving this palette.  I have managed to depot many single eye shadows and a couple of the Too Faced eye shadows boxes and place them in here.  I think this is a great way to save space.  I wished some brands were a little easier to de-pot so I wasn&#x27;t tempted to keep an eye shadow quad because I used up one color, and had plenty of the other three colors.  Since the base is magnetic most pans will automatically stick.  If not, they give you many disks to glue onto your de-potted item.&lt;br /&gt;Square or round or other shaped it doesn&#x27;t matter, these items can fit all in one place.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Z palettes! The zebra one was on sale the lowest out of the large-sized selection I could choose from. The design called to me regardless of that! I wish there were even more designs to choose from. These are great storage for eyeshadow pans, magnets are strong, extra sticky magnets are good just in case I feel like depotting other products, and I&#x27;ve already filled one up!</li>
    <li> This is such a convenient product. Thia is not only great for traveling but also consolidating your make up. I depotted a couple of palettes I had, added a highlighter and some single eye shadows. Everything fit in very nicely and made traveling with my make up so much easier.</li>
    <li> This thing is really great. The only way that it would be better is if it had a slightly tighter seal. Other than that it is SUCH a great idea! I&#x27;ve become much more creative due to the ease of my morning routine now.</li>
    <li> This palette is great for magnetic eye shadows or blushes but it comes with magnets if you need to stock on the back of your cosmetic pans.  I currently use it for my makeup geek eye-shadow pans and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love it very very nice case</li>
    <li> palette is as expected, holds the depotted eye shadows very nicely and is a cute zebra design.</li>
    <li> i got this for myself since i am a makeup artist and it came in handy. im so glad i found it and bought it.</li>
    <li> Love this case.  Was able to get quite a few individual eyeshadows and eyeliners into it so it really helps keep things organized.  Very easy to use and good quality!</li>
    <li> No regrets over this purchase - shipped super fast too !! Thanks Kandee Johnson for the Z Palette tip. If it wasn&#x27;t for Kandee, I would not have known about these cute palette pot keepers. Yay!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing if you are a make-up collector. If you have a lot to depot i suggest ordering extra magnets. I have already repurchased two more.</li>
    <li> Love the Z Palette!  My first one, and I am really happy with it!  Fits any shape and most sizes of your potions and paints-nice to be able to put certain colors together without having to carry all of the pots around!  I will be purchasing more of these little babies!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!  Use it every day!</li>
    <li> The palette is really nice, the fabric is very colorful, and the magnetic circles allowed me to use some of my own eye shadow.  This was my second order to this seller, althought  I was impressed with the customer service I was dissapointed that they did not send the free eye shadow like with my first order. I believe that was the feature that prompted me to order the second one.</li>
    <li> What more can I say? I&#x27;ve saved tons of room by using this palette. I depotted my wet n wild trios and placed them in here. This definitely helps save the space. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like were the magnets that came with them. They do not stick very well to the depotted eye shadows, so i went out and purchased my own from Micheal&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I adore this Z Palette!! The other brands don&#x27;t compare! Strong magnet to hold my products in tightly, great packaging for shipping, shipped FAST, and just plain out adorable design!</li>
    <li> Great quality. I love being able to keep all my favorite makeup products in one palette.</li>
    <li> I love Z Palettes! I always reach for the makeup I have stored in them, and end up forgetting about the stuff I have in compacts in drawers. Z Palettes are an organizers dream! They are made well, I believe they will last forever sitting on my vanity, however I wouldn&#x27;t subject them to a lot of travel or throw them in my purse.</li>
    <li> Z Palette&#x27;s are extremely handy. Love the idea. What no one tells you is that about half of the pans are made of aluminum and don&#x27;t stick to magnets. It&#x27;s not a matter of being high end, either. Wet n&#x27; Wild pans don&#x27;t stick. My Stila pans don&#x27;t stick. Neither do half of my Smashbox pans. Be prepared to tape the backs of some of these babies. Still a good idea. And the Palette is much sturdier than you might expect. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> i use it every day realy good magnet</li>
    <li> I have way too much makeup, so it helps to cut down on storage space. After getting this in the mail, I depotted all my Jordana blushes and other contour powders. I just wish these palettes where cheaper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. For what it does and how much it costs, it&#x27;s excessively hyped. You can easily make something like this for less. Don&#x27;t purchase if you love crafts...just search DIY for this.</li>
    <li> Really nothing bad to say about this one. I love the zebra print. I like being able to make my own customized eyeshadow palette.  The case is cardboard, but it seems sturdy. The magnetic closure is strong and I like the see through front cover. I have since bought another one in the leopard print and will buy more. Would definitely recommend to another makeup addict like me.</li>
