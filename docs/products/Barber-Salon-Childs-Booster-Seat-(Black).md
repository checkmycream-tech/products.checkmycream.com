<li> Just hope the foam doesnt squish down flat after a while since i&#x27;m using it as a booster for adults to get thier pedicures in a retirement community.</li>
<li> This child booster seat is thick and solid and doesn&#x27;t sink from the weight of a child.</li>
<li> Very firm, not cheaply made at all.</li>
