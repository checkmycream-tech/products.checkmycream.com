      <li>My mind set has become infinitely more positive.  </li>

      <li>I love this product, I use it every morning and evening on the bottoms of my feet, my wrists and the back of my neck</li>
      <li>I first discovered this oil at my Chiropractor.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, will last me a long time since I only use it once or twice a day, a drop or 2 on my wrist.  </li>
      <li>I used to sell YL oils, and while I find they are way too expensive (hence the four stars, not five), this particular blend is awesome when it comes to repelling mosquitoes, of all things.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>the scent is just so very faint.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this oil should really be called valor, but I like how it makes me feel.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed  much help with my stress.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very olfactory.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>

      <li>A friend gave the bottle to my husband to help with a shoulder injury, and while I\\&quot;m not so sure it helped him, it certainly helped with a few major tension headaches I have had had in the passed few weeks helping my mom go thru a tax fiasco.</li>
      <li>i only purchase my young living oils from young living but not for that price</li>
      <li>Instead, I looked this major authority figure</li>

    <li> This lasts a long time. I use it on my neck. Also i put in palm of my hands and rub inside my dogs ears. They seem to love it.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this oil at my Chiropractor. She uses it on my neck during my adjustments. I really loved the scent, so I bought some. Personally, I find it has a great grounding effect during difficult times. It really helps me center my emotions and stay calm. It is expensive, but given it&#x27;s potency, a little bit definitely goes a long way.</li>

    <li> Did not do a thing for me or my neuropathy.  Threw it away, it was a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I used to sell YL oils, and while I find they are way too expensive (hence the four stars, not five), this particular blend is awesome when it comes to repelling mosquitoes, of all things.  I found this out when I accidentally got some on my dog after I patted her after having the oil on my hands.  We went out for a walk and I noticed the mosquitoes were not landing on her.  They were there, but just hovering and leaving!  She actually liked the smell of this oil when I held my hand near, and I would never use an oil on a dog that they turn away from.  But, if your dog likes it, it may help keep those pesky skeeters off!</li>
    <li> Valor is amazing!!! I wear it everyday, and when I forget - I definitely notice the difference. I have been using essential oils for years now, and this is one of my absolute favorites!</li>
    <li> This essential oil was recommended to me by a close friend.  I was told that  Valor by Young Living was for courage, balancing of energy, etc.  At first I didn&#x27;t think that it did anything until yesterday when I was a work, a new employee criticized me because she discovered that I&#x27;d made some errors.  In the past I would I have groveled, apologized, and generally beat myself up.  Instead, I looked this major authority figure right in the face and said, \\&quot;I ALWAYS DO MY BEST!!!\\&quot; She continued to criticize and I continued to repeat, \\&quot;I ALWAYS DO MY BEST!!!\\&quot;  Wow, where did that lioness come from?  Internally, I forgave myself for being human, but also told my inner child that, \\&quot;I ALWAYS DO MY BEST.\\&quot;  This stuff really works!!!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I heard it was great to help women through the transitional stages of birth.  And it does just that!  It gives a wonderful sense of power and determination!  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Was just introduced to Young Living oils a few days ago.  A good friend of mine gifted me with Valor in the roll-on bottle.  Have been using it for just 3 days &amp; have already noticed a change in my attitude &amp; feelings.  I am feeling stronger &amp; more confident &amp; my self esteem has improved.  My mind set has become infinitely more positive.  I am a reiki master &amp; intuitive counselor &amp; have found that valor has improved the flow of my reiki energy as well.  I am so impressed with this product that I immediately ordered other blends of the Young Living oils.[[ASIN:B0015KXNO4 Valor Essential Oil Blend 15ml]]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it does all Young Living says it does but I LOVE the smell. I use it as a perfume. I think it&#x27;s calming but, for me, breathing in something that smells really good is grounding and pleasure-ful. I use essential oils daily for a number of things. I&#x27;m very olfactory. :)</li>
    <li> I use this oil often prior to meditation &amp; it puts me in the proper mind set quickly.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This oil is unique and lovely.  It is a strong oil, that&#x27;s one of the reasons it&#x27;s called valor probably!  Strength and valor to us all!</li>
    <li> i only purchase my young living oils from young living but not for that price</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was 3 bottles (5 ml) instead of a 15 ml bottle.  I didn&#x27;t realize it when ordering.  It was okay - just was not clear when I ordered.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Great price!</li>
    <li> I love all the essential oils created by Young Living. They are of the highest quality and get the job done. Valor is one I use daily for invigoration, strength, and balance. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VX2ULI PanAway (Essential Oil Blend) by Young Living Essential Oils - 5ml bottle]]I was in a head-on collision 14 years ago.  My heel came up through my ankle (just one of my injuries)... long story, short.  Even after my many broken bones healed, my foot continued to hurt.  Two years after my accident, my step-daughter talked me into trying the PanAway.  I never, for one moment, thought that it would help.  PanAway has changed my life.  I had to use it every day at first, now 12 years later, I only use it when I&#x27;m doing an excessive amount of walking or when the seasons are changing from fall to winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has truly been a life saver!</li>
    <li> The seal was broken, so I can&#x27;t be sure of it&#x27;s purity. Someone else may have bought this, then returned it.  I&#x27;ll never again buy essential oils this way.</li>
    <li> This is so overpriced it&#x27;s criminal. You can by this from Young Living for $28.62. This person should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> not Right probably a hoarser too</li>
    <li> I love using this.  I have had anxiety about life situations, and now when I use it, I calm down and the butterflies disappear!  This is a wonderful product, will last me a long time since I only use it once or twice a day, a drop or 2 on my wrist.  Wish I had known about this before I was put on pharmaceuticals, that I could not use because they made me feel very strange.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! It&#x27;s one I use everyday for balance. It&#x27;s one oil when I get low I freak out.</li>
    <li> Bought for snoring. My wife says she can tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use this at night now. . .</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times for help during stressful times,,but I haven&#x27;t noticed  much help with my stress.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive for a small amount of oil.  Don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> At the time I purchased this oil, I was going through a period of fitful sleep. Having heard that it calmed fretful babies, I tried it on the soles of my feet and imagine my surprise when I drifted right off! It got me though a very difficult patch.</li>
    <li> It is helping with my jaw problem.  It is soothing and calming for the inflamtion that is in my jaw.</li>
    <li> This combination of Pure Essential Oils prepared in a carrier oil is the best I&#x27;ve ever use! It is high grade, the scent is absolutely addictive. Applied on wrist, hand &amp; knee where I am experiencing pain, swelling &amp; water retention before bed (&amp; at mid-day), it helps with pain, elevates mood and after 15-20 minutes I add the additional oils I am going to use. I use it as a perfume &amp; deep breathe right from the bottle prior to bed to promote restful sleep. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oils for years. Love it this is the only company that I have found have a great grade for their product. I have not found any other company that can match them.</li>
    <li> Valor Oil is exactly as I&#x27;d hoped. Has a great smell, and the price was comparable to purchasing it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> wonderful blend of essential oils, and well, Valor says it all; inspiring aromatic therapy and it just smells so good!</li>
    <li> Sweet and strong smell. I like the oil and the soap.  Another great YL blend. People come up to me to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> I love Valor but that price is outrageous! Caps can be replaced and bottles can be filled with inferior oils. The only way to be sure is to buy direct from Young Living! Do your research.</li>
    <li> I loved this oil when my massage therapist used it. Smells wonderful and relaxes muscles as a bonus! Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but it will last a long time. Was hesitant to buy other (similar) oils from other companies because i know this is what she uses.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it every morning and evening on the bottoms of my feet, my wrists and the back of my neck and I feel great. would highly recommend this and also Valor intensifies every other young living oil you use so that&#x27;s a BONUS</li>
    <li> Smells great, works wonders....This was a gift for my son and he loves it, he uses it all the time...so calming</li>
    <li> I like all of my Young Living oils&lt;br /&gt;Valor was received several days ago&lt;br /&gt;and the scent is just so very faint.&lt;br /&gt;Wonder if it suppose to be this way&lt;br /&gt;or faulty? My other Young Living oils&lt;br /&gt;were ordered not from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I use Lavender and Frankencense daily&lt;br /&gt;and also roll on Deep release.</li>
    <li> Love this product for treating muscle issues.  I don&#x27;t see any benefit emotionally (as claimed by distributer) but that was not my reason for taking it anyway.</li>
    <li> It releives foot pain from arthritis, of couse it is is only temporary.  I rub it on at night and cover with socks to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected.I think young living makes a nice selection of oils. I am still new to using it, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This ins not the first time I have purchased or used &#x27;Valor&#x27;. This time the oil was for a present to a friend with structural issues and she uses it everyday and loves it.</li>
