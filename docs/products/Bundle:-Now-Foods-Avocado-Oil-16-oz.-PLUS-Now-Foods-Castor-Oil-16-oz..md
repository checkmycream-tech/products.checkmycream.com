<ol>
    <li> If you are into making your own body products these are a must. Love the size of the bottles. Use quite a bit. Love the feel of the body butters used with these. Not oily at all when using with your cocoa butter, mango butter and ect...</li>
    <li> Love these oils! Very good for my hair</li>
    <li> Great  quality. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> love these oils for my curly hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected it to be. Working well!</li>
    <li> We use for massage oil and works well. If you add it to your bath water, it is a bit too greasy and leaves tubs slippery. But for the modest price, works well for massages</li>
    <li> Would have been 5 but it leaked out all over the inside of the packing</li>
    <li> These products were a bargain I am using them all over for hair conditioning, skin moisturizing, and bath oils.  They have done wonders for my skin.  I have also used them as a part of my oil cleansing method along with the castor oil coconut oil and jojoba oil.  It is bringing up the impurities and softening my face.  Love these and will buy them again if the bundle remains.  Also the packaging was perfect.</li>
    <li> Came fast nice and thick oils.</li>
    <li> I bought this combo to mix and use as a face wash (oil cleansing). Great product, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> The way  they were packaged, they leaked all over my other stuff...and the same with my coconut oil as well...</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product, I mix the avacado and castor oil and use them as a facial cleanser, I wish I had known about this when I was a teenager! I have combination sensitive skin and this is a miracle product! Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great quality and arrived super fast.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price for both product,  will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works good for massaging body and scalp...will recommend</li>
    <li> Super deal will reorder</li>
