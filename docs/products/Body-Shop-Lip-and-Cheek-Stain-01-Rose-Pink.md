### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Overall,it was the best lip tint I&#x27;d ever experienced!</li>
      <li>What a beautiful stain!!!!</li>
      <li>This lip tint was excellent!</li>
      <li>and it looks really beautiful on me.....</li>
      <li>However, the lip stain itself isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>And boy am I glad I found it!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing for the price, I wear this under most of my lipsticks so when they wear off I still have a nice stain on and does it stay on!!!!</li>
      <li>I would buy this again, for the price I felt like it was a good deal and</li>
      <li>all this is a good quality lip stain.</li>
      <li>I have been on the hunt for a good lip stain for some time now.</li>
      <li>Love this product - have used it for years!</li>
      <li>the wand is a handy applicator</li>
      <li>IT S HANDY  </li>
      <li>But, I love this brand.</li>
      <li>This Body Shop cheek stain looked like a great option, and it&#x27;s sooo much cheaper than Bene-tint.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Ok as a lip stainer however doesn&#x27;t do it for me as a cheek stainer.</li>
      <li>this all being said, I would not use this for lips unless you plan on layering something over the top, and you just want to use this underneath to deepen the color of a lipgloss or something.</li>
      <li>so well people will think I am a hoarder :)</li>
      <li>I love this product and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
      <li>but I would suggest a lipbalm on top which doesn&#x27;t disburb it at all</li>
      <li>This product is and always will be a favorite.</li>
      <li>I could have purchased from the store for a better deal though.</li>
      <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip stain.</li>
      <li>I really, really love this lip and cheek stain.</li>
      <li>so I really appreciate the body shop coming out with a cheap alternative that in my opinion still holds up in quality; I use it on my cheeks with great results and layer it over my benetint(on</li>
      <li>My order was shipped super quick with a nice note inside.</li>
      <li>- i use it primarily on my cheeks but also sometimes swipe it on my lips.</li>
      <li>This has just enough color to look good and if you want more color, just apply another layer.</li>
      <li>This is a good sized tube for $ 12 and it will last awhile.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for layering so you can have it be subtle or bold.</li>
      <li>This product dries fairly quickly yet, you may wash off any mistakes with a bit of water.</li>
      <li>think many stains are highly overpriced</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been in love with this lip stain since high school</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as long wearing as before but the color s still good.</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t apply blotchy and the problem i usually have it where my lips are naturally more moist the stain would be darker, not with this one, it goes on nice and even and this colour is fabulous for all skin colours, I am an NC45</li>
      <li>The Rose Pink shade looks pretty natural with one layer and becomes very bright hot pink with lots of layers.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not the same old good quality it used to be.</li>
      <li>The color is way too sheer...does not even give nice natural rose color to my very pale lips.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it on my lips, as it does give an unnatural magenta color, but highly recommend it as a cheek stain!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear well alone on the lips, it feathers in creases and dries not so prettily.</li>
      <li>i bought this as a cheaper substitute for benetint, and i actually like it better.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a nice rosy pink color.</li>
      <li>This stain is a lot like benetint, except it has no smell and taste(which is wonderful), it is a liquid like benetint and it takes a little longer to dry between coats, doesn&#x27;t last quite as long but much longer than regular wear obviously and isn&#x27;t as easily layered/darkened, and it is more pinkish of a red than benetint(which is a great bonus for me).I</li>
      <li>(I found that using it on fairly dry lips gets a better stain).</li>
      <li>I have tried so many brands of lip stains and they all really dry out my lips.</li>
      <li>I REALLY RECOMEND</li>
      <li>It really stains</li>
      <li>The wand glides smoothly, softly and gives a thin layer of red hue on your lips (which is great because you can apply more until, desired shade).</li>
      <li>It gives your lips a look like they&#x27;re healthy and red, but still looks natural.</li>
      <li>If you want a bolder color you need to layer the stain, meaning: let it absorb into your lips (while you put on your other makeup or something) and then apply another layer, let dry, etc it until it&#x27;s as bright as you want it.</li>
      <li>IS FANTASTIC, I USED IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME,</li>
      <li>Since I am older, I did not want something that looked &#x27;clownish&#x27;.</li>
      <li>When the final layer is dry add some lip balm on top, because lip stains tend to be very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>It is a liquid stain that is very sheer and colorfull, a nicer pink then most.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin, and this product is water based, not oil based</li>
      <li>Very natural tint on both lips and cheeks, and the tube lasted for almost a year.</li>
      <li>This one is pretty decent and definitely superior to Revlon&#x27;s Just Bitten lip stain (I got one and it dried out like an old marker after a few uses!</li>
      <li>I have olive skin, and it gives me a really natural rosy color without looking hot pink like many other creams I try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s water based, will not clog pores, safe for sensitive skin, and does not transfer to clothing (or surgical masks) :) I still miss my old brand a little, because the color of this one goes on a tiny more magenta pink than the other one did, but I&#x27;ll never ever wear a powder blush as long as I can find a cheek stain as reliable as this.</li>
      <li>to add a less red and more pinkish-red effect.</li>
      <li>but, that can be fixed with lip balm afterwards.</li>
      <li>But used underneath something to add additional color, it works very well and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>This stain works ok for cheeks but not good on lips.</li>
      <li>it took me a few tries to get an even application, but now I can do it pretty quickly and it goes on evenly</li>
      <li>I looks natural and does not dry my lips.</li>
      <li>Just like my faithful old brand, it lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it for my lips but as far as a cheek stain goes, a little goes a long way</li>

<li> If you&#x27;ve used a cheek stain before, and you want a thin, NOT gel-based, NOT balm-texture, NOT creamy-in-any-way stain, just 100% pure water-based color, this is for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but if your lips need a little pick-me-up for a few hours then this does the trick!</li>
<li> I was looking for a cheek stain/tint to replace the previous one I had used for years that Sephora has discontinued</li>
<li> The formula is very thin and you have to apply 3 coats before you actually see your lips being tinted/colored.</li>
<li> It dried my lips out really bad.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m so sad about this).</li>
<li> Hope they lower the price if they&#x27;re gonna change the quality to mediocre.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s just disappointing that they seemed to have changed something in the formula.</li>
<li> It dries out my lips and looks terrible after 30 minutes or so..</li>

    <li> This product is and always will be a favorite. I could have purchased from the store for a better deal though.</li>
    <li> The color is way too sheer...does not even give nice natural rose color to my very pale lips.  I will try another lip stain product.  Also, it is drying to the lips and causes them to feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This stain is a lot like benetint, except it has no smell and taste(which is wonderful), it is a liquid like benetint and it takes a little longer to dry between coats, doesn&#x27;t last quite as long but much longer than regular wear obviously and isn&#x27;t as easily layered/darkened, and it is more pinkish of a red than benetint(which is a great bonus for me).I think many stains are highly overpriced so I really appreciate the body shop coming out with a cheap alternative that in my opinion still holds up in quality; I use it on my cheeks with great results and layer it over my benetint(on my lips) to add a less red and more pinkish-red effect.This is a good sized tube for $ 12 and it will last awhile.</li>
    <li> My order was shipped super quick with a nice note inside. However, the lip stain itself isn&#x27;t great. It dries out my lips and looks terrible after 30 minutes or so..</li>
    <li> I bought this in a pinch as a substitute for BeneTint, and this stuff is a close second. Very natural tint on both lips and cheeks, and the tube lasted for almost a year.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many brands of lip stains and they all really dry out my lips. But, I love this brand. I looks natural and does not dry my lips. Since I am older, I did not want something that looked &#x27;clownish&#x27;. This has just enough color to look good and if you want more color, just apply another layer. I do not use it as a blush, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it works in that area. I will say one thing, this lip stain will always be in my make-up kit. If I ever get the idea they will discontine the product, I will stock up so well people will think I am a hoarder :)</li>
    <li> I love this product and won&#x27;t use anything else. I have olive skin, and it gives me a really natural rosy color without looking hot pink like many other creams I try. I also have very sensitive skin, and this product is water based, not oil based so I don&#x27;t break out. You can&#x27;t feel it over the course of the day, and it doesn&#x27;t wear off. I have never had a problem removing it, as some others claimed. I don&#x27;t like it on my lips, as it does give an unnatural magenta color, but highly recommend it as a cheek stain!!</li>
    <li> This stain works ok for cheeks but not good on lips. It dried my lips out really bad. It also left a stain line on my bottom lip where all of the stain had gathered.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a good lip stain for some time now. This one is pretty decent and definitely superior to Revlon&#x27;s Just Bitten lip stain (I got one and it dried out like an old marker after a few uses! But maybe I got a defective one?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With The Body Shop lip stain it took me a few tries to get an even application, but now I can do it pretty quickly and it goes on evenly (I found that using it on fairly dry lips gets a better stain).

    <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this lip stain since high school and it&#x27;s just disappointing that they seemed to have changed something in the formula. It&#x27;s not as long wearing as before but the color s still good. It still gives me the sheer effect I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful stain!!!! This stuff is amazing for the price, I wear this under most of my lipsticks so when they wear off I still have a nice stain on and does it stay on!!!! It&#x27;s not too drying but I would suggest a lipbalm on top which doesn&#x27;t disburb it at all, it doesn&#x27;t apply blotchy and the problem i usually have it where my lips are naturally more moist the stain would be darker, not with this one, it goes on nice and even and this colour is fabulous for all skin colours, I am an NC45 and it looks really beautiful on me.....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok as a lip stainer however doesn&#x27;t do it for me as a cheek stainer. I do still prefer Tart over this</li>
    <li> I like this stain because it does not have that smell, that benetint has. It is a liquid stain that is very sheer and colorfull, a nicer pink then most. I would buy this again, for the price I felt like it was a good deal and the amount I got should last close to a year. It really stains, I just washed my faced and still see it on my lips and cheeks. Because of how fluid it is you will have to use it in layers to get any type of color.</li>
    <li> I really, really love this lip and cheek stain. It&#x27;s perfect for layering so you can have it be subtle or bold. Also great for using as a base lip/cheek before layering on other products. I plan on getting several different colors, I use it so often! (:</li>
    <li> I still like the shade but it&#x27;s not the same old good quality it used to be. The formula is very thin and you have to apply 3 coats before you actually see your lips being tinted/colored. Hope they lower the price if they&#x27;re gonna change the quality to mediocre.</li>
    <li> This lip tint was excellent! The wand glides smoothly, softly and gives a thin layer of red hue on your lips (which is great because you can apply more until, desired shade). This product dries fairly quickly yet, you may wash off any mistakes with a bit of water. Your lips can get a tad dehydrated when applying this product but, that can be fixed with lip balm afterwards. Overall,it was the best lip tint I&#x27;d ever experienced!</li>
    <li> i bought this as a cheaper substitute for benetint, and i actually like it better. the wand is a handy applicator - i use it primarily on my cheeks but also sometimes swipe it on my lips. if you like benetint you will like this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip stain. The trick is to apply it sparingly. It gives your lips a look like they&#x27;re healthy and red, but still looks natural.</li>
    <li> Love this product - have used it for years!</li>
    <li> IS FANTASTIC, I USED IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME, IT S HANDY  AND MY LIPS LOOK GRAT I REALLY RECOMEND IT</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheek stain/tint to replace the previous one I had used for years that Sephora has discontinued (I&#x27;m so sad about this).
