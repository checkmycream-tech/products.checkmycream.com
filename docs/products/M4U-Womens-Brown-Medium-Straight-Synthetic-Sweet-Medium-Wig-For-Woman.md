<li> Yes, as other reviewers commented, its a Raquel Welch knock-off.</li>
<li> Hot and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> and  you cant style it any way other than the way it comes out of the bag,,its just horrid,,,i</li>
<li> the length is fine but the bangs ruin the entire look,,,its crap</li>
<li> In comparison, the small amount of hair that was shed was minimal.</li>
<li> Hard to put on.</li>
<li> It is not a good cut.  </li>
<li> Might have to have a salon thin it some.</li>
<li> I have not worn it out as my spouse says it looks fake.</li>
<li> So disappointed in this wig.</li>

    <li> I am returning this. Shame on this company for displaying a Raquel Welch wig leasing us to believe that this &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; wig would be just as good. The wefting is black and shows right through the hair if you even try to part the bangs like the picture and looks nothing like the picture!</li>
    <li> The wig is great, as was the price..but it took a month to receive it</li>
    <li> So disappointed in this wig. Hard to put on. Needs trim. Too long. Hot and uncomfortable. Be good in winter like hair hat. Not red enough. I have only worn it one time.</li>
    <li> bangs just don&#x27;t hang right....</li>
    <li> The hair is natural, and the colors are as well.  I absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> Yes, as other reviewers commented, its a Raquel Welch knock-off. Even uses her photo. Yes, its more hair than the picture shows. But I love it! The extra thickness is nice although it may be too much for summer. Might have to have a salon thin it some. The color, feel, and sheen are all good. All at one tenth the price of a real Raquel wig. Way to go, M4U.</li>
    <li> I wish it looked as real in person as it does in the picture.  I have not worn it out as my spouse says it looks fake. I&#x27;m not too upset as the price was very reasonable and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> well made, and feels a little heavier and thicker than some wigs I own.</li>
    <li> way too many bangs,,you cant control them i wanted wispy light bangs like the picture and i got way heavy bangs,,the color is fine the length is fine but the bangs ruin the entire look,,,its crap and  you cant style it any way other than the way it comes out of the bag,,its just horrid,,,i am sending it back in todays mail!! what a waist of money and time,,,dont bother buying it if your looking for a nice light bang this is not the wig for you~ its NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE,,,and its darker for sure,,which doesnt bother me but it sure would bother somebody looking for the nice light color pictured here,,,</li>
    <li> Really looks great.  The color is rich, the length is perfect.  I&#x27;ve bought three wigs now and this finally fits what I wanted.  Looks realistic.</li>
    <li> It is not a good cut.  Much longer than it shows in the picture.  Probably will ask hair dresser to cut it.  LOL</li>
    <li> Nice wig.. beautiful color, but a lot of hair. Does not look like picture.</li>
    <li> Overall this wig is quite nice.  It has been hard to find an inexpensive wig that looks pretty and does not betray my receding male hairline.  That is not to say this is a &amp;#34;crossdresser&#x27;s&amp;#34; wig, but should be taken as a sign that the look is natural and compliments both smart business and casual attire.  The color is spot on to the photo and the style matches as well.  A small bit of hair came out during the initial styling, but I have never had a wig that doesn&#x27;t.  In comparison, the small amount of hair that was shed was minimal.</li>
    <li> A very stylish piece for a more mature look.</li>
    <li> looks real and feels great</li>
    <li> Scored here. Needs to be thinned or cut some, but a nice wig, especially for synthetic.</li>
    <li> The wig is nice but not the same color in picture. Not the same lenghth as in pic longer. Didn&#x27;t return cause all the way to China. Not up for all that.</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like this in person.  Didn&#x27;t want to pay to send it back.  Hopefully be able to use it for Halloween one day!</li>
