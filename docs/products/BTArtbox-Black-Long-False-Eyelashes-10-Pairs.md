<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> cant even put them on waist of money</li>
    <li> I liked them it wasn&#x27;t bad for the price.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE MOST FAKE EVER THEY LOOK LIKE NASTY PLASTIC AND COME WITH NO GLUE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;:( DONT BUY THEY ARE CHEAP AND BAD!</li>
    <li> They are a little harder to apply than the traditional lashes from the drugstore. They are plastic so the glue takes longer to apply and dry. They must be manipulated (bent) so they will stick to the eye and not lift off when the glue is drying. If you can get them to stick they are fine but a but heavy feeling due to being plastic. Not for the beginner user, try Revlon lashes first they are easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes, they are very soft, and looks so natural will be ordering some more just wish they wouldn&#x27;t take some long to come back.  These lashes are the bomb.</li>
    <li> Girls If Yu Have Sensitive Eyes Like I Do Wash Them Before Yu Put Them They Still Look Great &amp; They Look Fuller As Well As Darker. My Shipping Came On Time &amp;  I Was Very Pleased With My Purchase But  I Would Definetly Buy Again</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t bring the glue with the eyelashes?? and purchases it with eyelash and glue!!!</li>
    <li> Love wearing these thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> 我很喜欢，但是有点硬！&lt;br /&gt;如果能送胶水就是相当好的了！&lt;br /&gt;因为美国好难买到睫毛胶水！&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like, but a little hard!&lt;br /&gt;If you can get the glue is very good !&lt;br /&gt;Because the United States is very difficult to buy eyelash glue!</li>
    <li> I love them...they are a great deal..they look full and great on..I have paid the amount for one pair and got 30!</li>
    <li> I really like them. It is just what i wanted and i will enjoy wearing them to places. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product came, looks just like the picture. Very easy to put on and they are very soft. Would totally recommend, even for beginners!</li>
    <li> Good product long and pretty full set easy to put on but cut the ends off before putting on.will recmind</li>
    <li> So, I wear lashes a lot. These are my standbys when I dont have my regular Go-To lashes. They are more plastic looking so dont expect natural look with these. They are more dramatic looking too.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing falsies, and I love these! I love the dark dramatic look, you put them on and you look flawless! Of course some can tell their fake but they blend really easy with your own lashes. I actually was able to wear these for 2 and a half days on vacation and they were great! I didn&#x27;t even need makeup. I will definitley purchase these again, super fast shipping and I love the price! Not heavy on your eyes either!</li>
    <li> Package was later than expected but product is as in the description. Always better to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> i have been putting on false lashes for the past 3 years on a daily basis and I wear them FOR beyond 14 hours lol I kno the problem isnt my glue cause It just isnt lol (dolly wink glue the besttttt)these lashes are CUTE but its a struggle to apply them :( lol well I wasnt expecting perfection either i meannnn you get what you payed for ^.^ overall i do like them ~ i use them when i dont have any other lashes to use. yes i use lashes everyday because I have none literally i dont &#x3D;_&#x3D; never did...... *sigh* lol &lt;3</li>
    <li> Not as heavy on the eye lid as I would have thought, but for the price it&#x27;s a good product. I was able to customize them to my liking and kept some as is.</li>
    <li> Just gorgeous and full</li>
    <li> I Just Recieved My Lashes After Waiting For A Long Time . The Box Was Beat Up , They Are Very Plastic And Probably Going To Be Hard To Put On . Ugggggh</li>
    <li> i did not received my item . would have really like a new one but was too afraid to try my luck and it might get lost again.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These things are way to long on the sides And don&#x27;t really curve up they kinda just stay straight forward so you can&#x27;t really see them. Had a hard time glueing them. I mean I guess they&#x27;re good to have around as last resorts but i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hate it no stars felt like paper</li>
    <li> I have placed MANY orders with Hermes distribution and have NOT been disappointed yet! I have ALWAYS gotten my order *lashes* and as a woman who wears lashes EVERYDAY these are at a price Im much happier about. My last order they ran out of my product so it was late. They were VERY professional and timely in their responses and I just received the rest of my order today. They have earned my trust and as a result I placed another order with them today. They ship very fast and usually deliver on time or early. If the lashes come bent from delivery they always reshape with a curling iron. ***Use curling iron CAREFULLY and for 1-2SECOND(s) ONLY***** Im going to YouTube and attach to this post a review for these products that will show you how to work out any kinks you many have and how to apply them quickly with ease. Customer photo is me with the the lashes on :)</li>
    <li> All I have to say for this product that ive purchased is you get what you pay for. I was expecting a good product but it looks way to shiny and its not real human hair.</li>
    <li> I was surprised with the quality of the lashes. I WAS expecting the band to be stiff and the eyelashes to be fake looking BUT...I was wrong! These lashes are amazing! The band is super flexible and the lashes were not fake looking at all they were SOFT! will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> I wear the eyelashes everyday. The eyelashes are plastic long lasting, very light to wear.  I would recommend these items too a friend.</li>
    <li> Hi there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received the false eyelashes. Thought they came with the glue however i love them.Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Perfect dramatic lashes! Exactly what I want! They are a great buy also! Definitely ordering more later! They are nice to wear when going out with some girlfriends or even on a date or at the club! Definitely fits the vibe!</li>
    <li> I love love love these lashes ... the are the perfect length to add a little bit of party to your everyday life</li>
    <li> I just started to wear fake lashes everday I use to only use it for cosplay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is really good if u just trimmed the side and it really full</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t what I was expecting. I&#x27;ll find a way to use them I guess</li>
    <li> For the price its great! its easy for me to put on and i can re use it !! After the 3rd time ( using the same set of lashes ) i just throw them away due to my mascara making them clumpy. you get what you pay for and i been using these for a year now and had no problems! :)</li>
    <li> These a amazing! They are long and full, there might be a tiny bit of a problem with the lash band but it doesn&#x27;t affect them when your wearing them.</li>
    <li> seems durable.i havent tried it but its thick as i expected.they just look a little straight and not that curve-ish. hope it works well though</li>
    <li> The length,size, and volume was awesome and are so pretty on my studying head for beauty. Thanks fora great pair of eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive the ones on the photos. Mine came in more dramatic. It&#x27;s only good for night time. I have uploaded a pic with the ones I&#x27;ve received.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are horrible. They look like they are very shiny like they are made from plastic. The lash strip is so thick that I had to cut some of it off to make them even some what blend with my natural eye line. I brought 3 backs and all 3 of them are going in the trash!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say too much more about this product., my wife love&#x27;s them and that&#x27;s what I was seeking when I bought them, Thank You all so much, I&#x27;m a big hit now, even on her job...</li>
    <li> SO pretty! They were just what I was looking for! Perfect cosplay lashes!</li>
    <li> i wear falsies on a regular basis so i go through quite a few pairs in a given month. these arrived pretty fast, being as they came from china. i like these because i love the more &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking false eyelashes, so if you&#x27;re going for more natural they may not be for you. for me they worked perfectly. the 4 star is because these are kind of cheap, the plastic strip doesn&#x27;t allow for easy bending to customize for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;all in all, i suggest this to anyone who goes through a lot of falsies. compared to paying $6-$14 for one pair that will maybe last a few weeks at the store, this is a great value. will probably purchase again when i run out.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! I would recommend them for a nice dramatic look.. If you are trying to go for the natural look, I suggest you don&#x27;t go with these.. these lashes are more for a club or party scene. at first I had a hard time applying the glue but practice makes perfect. Overall they are great for the price you pay for them :) *two thumbs up</li>
    <li> I just got them today and I am SO IN LOVE!!! They are a little hard to put on I mean I never put fake lashes on but you just have to bend it a little to get then to fit you better.</li>
    <li> Its was great product</li>
    <li> A bit long, but still fun to wear. More for parties than for every day, but definitely worth the money :)</li>
    <li> the lashes are plastic and heavy. They are very stiff and I hate it. I am sorry I bought it and I wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> Im used to wearing $5 lashes that usually only give me 2 wear 3 most and that&#x27;s if I take really good care of them.. These I used one pair 5 times already and there still good.There perfect not super big like I usually do but supper full. Got a lot of compliments!happy over all that I ordered more :)</li>
    <li> They take a while, but were faster than anticipated. These are amazing for the price, definitely not an everyday or natural looking lash</li>
    <li> I do like them. They were long and full. The only thing I did not absolutely love about them was the little extra lines on each side which I will have to cut.</li>
    <li> very long thick and ugly they look like barbie doll eye lashes i threw them out they were just so ugly</li>
    <li> It was very dramatic with a thick band. It&#x27;s hard to use a pair more than once because of the thick lash band but over all a good product.</li>
    <li> They sick. A pair is only good for one use. So you can&#x27;t reiss. Almost impossible to clean.</li>
    <li> These lashes are very, very long. So if you are going to wear them as I have please trim to your liking. They are good for a night or evening but nothing more. I will say that the shipper shipped them out very quickly. And they are far cheaper than the ones you pay for at CVS or Walgreen. Yes so stones they do fall off but use the lash glue and close your eye for ten seconds.</li>
    <li> lashes are so hard and brittle, not worth your money ladies..i ended up throwing them in the trash. keep looking</li>
    <li> the lashes aren&#x27;t what I expected to buy. The lashes were more apart, I can&#x27;t exactly describe it but they aren&#x27;t like the one in the picture and I bought like 10 boxes. Oh well, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> These false lashes are plastic and look really fake. They also didn&#x27;t come with glue (like its shown in the picture).</li>
    <li> these lashes are not it.  they look nothing like the picture, there more pointy and hard and plastic and look baby doll fake not the good baby doll fake but like the dollar store baby doll fake DON&#x27;T BUY THESE GIRLS HORRIBLE!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these lashes for over a year. Barely if ever worn them. They&#x27;re wayyy to thick and loud. I even show my family and they respond the same way i do. I&#x27;ll never order these again. It&#x27;s just ridiculously thick! only save them for special events: club, bar, etc. Daily events these lashes WILL NOT look cute.</li>
    <li> Terrible product...Package was damaged. Lashes came with glue on them. Possibly use for practice, but not for everyday wear. Horrible</li>
    <li> The bands for the lash are too thick and look very fake. This would only be good for halloween or a Avant Gard kind of makeup.</li>
    <li> I love these, I simply halve them in order to create a winged shape. They&#x27;re fabulous, especially for the price. They stick easily, I use revlon adhesive and I&#x27;ve never had them slip or wiggle around/off.</li>
    <li> These came in right on time. When you see them up close they are thicker than ever. I haven&#x27;t worn them yet, but I can&#x27;t wit to put some on.</li>
    <li> Not only did they not come with glue, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to apply them (I bought some glue seperately). Probably less a function of the eyelashes and more of me. Still though. No glue.</li>
    <li> I got my makeup done for my friends 15 &amp; since I was in it, she had a makeup artist do it. She used these lashes &amp; I love how my eyes popped, gave my look a gorgeous touch! However, wouldn&#x27;t wear them on a daily basis. I&#x27;m a 17 year old teenager with an interest in makeup and I personally wouldn&#x27;t wear these for my everyday look. More appropriate for a party.</li>
    <li> Very fake looking. But fun. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for the average beauty queen. Better off sending the money on higher end lashes</li>
    <li> these eye lashes, where a good price deal I thought, once I received them they weren&#x27;t what  thought, they look like BABY DOLL lashes</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t love these lashes but i didn&#x27;t hate them either they are just okay they were inexpensive and a good size .</li>
    <li> These were alright. They are definitely plastic feeling and a bit difficult to bend to form them to your lash line.</li>
    <li> I usually order these eyelashes from different sellers but, these look very nice realistic almost look like human hair not too thick and not thin just right I really like these I still will order other styles but I am sticking with these!!!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. I have to cut the ends but that is it. I have really good glue so I can sleep in mine for about 3 or 4 days. I get a lot of compliments also</li>
    <li> Love these..good quality for price</li>
    <li> Crappy waste of money</li>
    <li> I love these! I try to wear fake lashes a few times a week (if not daily) and I love these!!!! my mom (who never likes my makeup or cares) actually complimented me on these lashes and said they looked good!! I really like them they are not super natural but what do you expect its FAKE lashes but yeah if you like fake lashes I&#x27;d say these are a must have to add to your collection!</li>
    <li> I love these they take forever to arrive but they are cheap and durable! ;-)</li>
    <li> Only who&#x27;s they came with glue but at this price who cares.. they work great kinda hard to put on but the fabulous when u do get them on natural beauty</li>
    <li> this false synthetic eye lashes are good only if you are practicing with your makeup, but I recommend spending a few dollars more and get ones that are more real looking but well like the saying says you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> So,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I pay $4 usd for one pair of lashes from local stores.&lt;br /&gt;So for one, this price is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the reviews and was like &amp;#34;OH GOD THEY&#x27;RE GOING TO BE SO STIFF&amp;#34;.. but nope. They&#x27;re actually really soft and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The international delivery also didn&#x27;t take as long as it said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Def would recommend these!</li>
    <li> They might please all women, but they are great for me. I am a life long wearer of lashes.</li>
    <li> What can I say it enriches the look.</li>
    <li> These are very cute however very long! I had to trim them alil to blend better with my own lashes but thats ok.</li>
    <li> Definitely cheap and plastic-y. They aren&#x27;t very durable, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;m experienced enough with false lashes that I was able to make these work, but I think for a first timer they could be frustrating. I would recommend them to someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing. They are great for costumey stuff, or very dramatic looks. I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> Money well spent and i am still on my first pair I was able to reuse them..how awesome is that :)</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes on eyelashes I&#x27;ll use always comes with long beautiful lashes with no glue on the lashes love it</li>
    <li> They are great! Look great on and for the price i will def. buy again! The color is great and the thickness and length is perfect. I want more!</li>
    <li> the lashes are lovely, shipping was a long time and one of my eyelashes were smashed.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive  but were what I expected</li>
    <li> Like the way they look awesome price for the package. The band is stiff but nothing you can work with</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with eyelash glue. These are for giant eyes. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have small eyes.</li>
    <li> These are a lot better than I thought they would be for the price.  The lashes are plastic however they&#x27;re so full others wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> These lashes are my favorite.  They are extremely reasonably priced and of high quality.  The material in which they are made allow you to soak them in water for a couple minutes to get the glue an wear them many times.  They are very full, however when you advance in age and your eyelids start drooping, they make you look amazing.</li>
    <li> They syck so bad not funny at all the fell so heavy and hard to stay on</li>
    <li> These are great. Compare to store retail price, these lashes are just as good. You just have to purchase your own glue and make sure to trim the sides.</li>
    <li> Bought these to do makeovers and they are pretty nice. They are pretty good for one time use lashes I&#x27;d buy them again</li>
    <li> If you are desprate get it! there is enough to go to war with.I have seen worse.If you are use to the third world they should not bother you.Im going to give them a try.</li>
    <li> very good quality they look natural for a very cheap price all false lashes lovers well be very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to fake eyelashes. But I liked these. They are pretty thick and worked for what I wanted. If I&#x27;m gentle with them I can re-use them a few times. It a bit of time to get and tha package was labled cell phone parts. Go figure. But they did arrive!</li>
    <li> Item damaged in package.</li>
    <li> They were just ok; I purchased another brand in early 2013 that I liked better I however can&#x27;t remember the brand name. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about them, I would order again just to gave extra fir my make up kit.</li>
    <li> First off I ordered them in October, they came right on Halloween so I was happy. The first time I wore them it did look like it was too much, but I got used to them. They last a long time , I still have 4 pairs left. Although it does have a plastic look they still work fine. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments and I have no trouble putting them on. I&#x27;m about to order them again</li>
    <li> Be sure to have enough glue and line them up right the first time. Take your time because if you miss the first time, you might as well trash that lash, clean up and start all over again. Do it when you have plenty of timel if you&#x27;re rushed, odds of mis-placement are higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re thick, fun and flirty, great for night time.</li>
    <li> They are long I Tell ya!</li>
    <li> this eyelashes is a wist of money. it look and feel like plastic, all  most of their product are fake!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good for beginners who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on falsies. They don&#x27;t look very natural, but if you have dark hair and wear eyeliner, they could pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you put them on, cut off the excess band on the sides and make the band flexible by bending it a little bit so it&#x27;s easier to put onto your eye.</li>
    <li> ok so ive bought A LOT of lashes on here and there usually on the down side. but these ones are awesome. a little hard to pit on but with practice there great! worst the $$</li>
    <li> The price is great... But They were NOT anywhere similar to the eye lashes shown in the picture. The part that is meant to be glued on, is extremely UN-flexible and kinked when I tried to play with it to fit the curve of my eye lid. Very poor quality an would not order them again. I guess I got what I paid for.. CHEAP eye lashes.</li>
    <li> They were very poor quality ended up throwing them out.... :(</li>
    <li> i like them i just feel like i have to take an extra 5 minutes adjusting and cutting them to fix and stay on my eyelid .</li>
    <li> Terrible nothing like the picture and they can all smashed up. I will never buy them again,  not even worth the very little money I paid for them</li>
    <li> The thick lashes were horrible ! They look so fake but i kno it false lashes and it is supposed to be fake , but this is seriously horrible .theyre made of plastic and u cant apply it cuz the texture is so stiff</li>
    <li> The picture shows pretty thick eyelashes, and last time I ordered they were just that. The set I got this time was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;the lashes were so cheap looking, almost like plastic. They were very thin and sparse. I threw them away right after opening the package.</li>
    <li> Better then I expected. Their thick but not too thick plus they came super early! (about less than a week after I ordered, said to be here in 3/4 weeks)</li>
    <li> Great product works good!</li>
    <li> This will b my 2nd order I used my last pair but I&#x27;ve reused some of them which allowed me to have them since my 1st order in February</li>
    <li> Real authentic lashes they feel pretty good like my lashes they are really pretty doesn&#x27;t come with glue though great thing I have my own 30 second anti fungus glue</li>
    <li> I wish they would have looked more natural like the ones you would buy from the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Eh, don&#x27;t really like them. Also took forever to get here.</li>
    <li> The eye lashes were all bent and messed up when I got them in mail and it took forever to get them. WAste of money. All of the lashes were messed up</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE!!!!!!! These were the first ones i applied all alone :) . Did have to bend them a little before applying but they look great! got so many compliments on them.  Just have to cut the extra black strip on the sides. other than that every easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Spine of lashes is not flexible enough. Plastic is too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Does not form to shape of my eyelid, so finished look is not acceptable. Looks like it was my first attempt at applying lashes and I had a few drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lashes are very long and heavy looking, which is great if that is the look you want, definately not natural looking everyone will know they are false, even from across the room. I don&#x27;t mind people knowing my lashes are false but these are a little to stageshow for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of lashes is what you would expect for price charged, I ordered hoping that the good reviews were true, but not worth even the one dollar charged.</li>
    <li> I got them to play around with different makeup looks. Very thick to start with. I got really annoyed when I found out AFTER purchasing them that they ship from china. Took 4 weeks to arrive and had NO tracking number. I wouldn&#x27;t order them if the seller mentioned China. I&#x27;ve dealt with the company before and my 1st shipment arrived right away &amp;#34;was shipping from the united states&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;الرموش ثقيلة وماتستاهل الانتظار لشحنها من الصين. لو عندك وقت ولا تمانعين الانتظار اطلبيها.. ابدا مب غالية</li>
    <li> cheap feeling. they are hard to glue and this is coming from someone that wears fake eyelashes a lot. They are a nice thickness and length.</li>
    <li> Lashed are to hard and don&#x27;t stay when I put them on no good waste of money ended up tossing them out</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these lashes. They looked very unreal and people were telling me that they didn&#x27;t look good when I was wearing them. They are not fully a black color as well.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes I have huge eyes so these fit perfectly for them and the volume from them is gorgeous.. especially for the price. Its a deal you should def. not pass when lashes per pack are like $4 in the store. Pfffft, no more. It just takes a lil while to ship.</li>
    <li> Great for the price, not too costume-y and good to wear daily. if you take traveling take little nail clippers or scissors to trim the tab off the ends though. Tried to pull them off and ruined one.</li>
    <li> I really like these eyelashes.  They are exactly as they are described and there are ten pairs.. which is great for the price. Theyre extremely long and look beautiful when applied..</li>
    <li> These eyelashes don&#x27;t really like to stay on. I can&#x27;t get them on for the life of me, and what you see is what you get. The cheat little box, and 10 eyelashes. I really wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them.</li>
    <li> I loved the price of this product but the quality honestly kinda sucked. I can&#x27;t complain too much because they were so cheep but they feel like they are made out of plastic. I did however, like the ability to cut to size and there are a lot so if you lose or damage a pair its not a big deal.</li>
    <li> great quality came when it was suppose to even though it was overseas, package was a little smashed could have used a bigger package that was bigger the box it wouldnt be smashed but for the price you can beat</li>
    <li> I love the lashes they look flawless on me!&lt;br /&gt;Been wearing for years and Dont ever plan on changing Kkkk</li>
    <li> Not wht I was looking for</li>
    <li> Very stiff, very bulky, decent lashes but not the best for regular occasions.</li>
    <li> I had the hardest time with these. I ended up trashing them. You get what you pay for though! Maybe would have been better with someone with more patience then I.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these lashes! They are long and full. They make my your eyes POP! LOVE LOVE LOVE them! They take a few weeks to get to you, but it&#x27;s sooo worth it.</li>
    <li> These are the best EVER!!! Money well spent! I will re order these forever!! Yes some people may think they look fake but hello you&#x27;re buy FAKE eyelashes!! They look fantastic on!</li>
    <li> Worst eye lashes I&#x27;ve even purchased. I guess u get wat u pay for. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!!!! Do not recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> They were ok not really what I was expecting but you get for what you pay for. Some are messed up</li>
    <li> beautiful dark does.not.need.mascara. great for wearing at night to parties or gatherings. i love the texture and very soft product</li>
    <li> These lashes are so pretty on the box, but they are really difficult to apply &amp; they tend to peel of at the inner corner of your eye. However I will use them if I ever run out of my favorite lashes &amp; just need a temporary fix.</li>
    <li> The best lashes I purchased!</li>
    <li> This actually came in today , WAY earlier than it was suppose to lol. They look so beautiful, more to go and party but I&#x27;d rock them whenever (:</li>
    <li> The eyelashes were impossible for me to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i&#x27;m not using the right glue, but eyelashes shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this brand of eyelashes again.</li>
    <li> I been ordering these lashes for months now,and everywhere I go I get great compliments about my lashes....best lashes I ever bought,the ones from the store are good but for so many for a cheap price can&#x27;t beat that...if you love lashes and don&#x27;t like this company&#x27;s lashes something is wrong with you,First when you get the lashes they are stiff but you bend them fold them until the strip gets a lil worn,then apply.they last long,i wore mine for 3days and when you apply use tweezers duhhhh ladies,otherwise they will look super nasty on you...trust it&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s lashes look in the mirror it&#x27;s you.So these are the best ones yet,a good buy good investment</li>
    <li> These eye lashes looked great in the box but were hard to put on they didn&#x27;t stay on very well but they were a great price quick service so it could of been me I wear lashes almost everyday and like for my lashes to look more natural but if you like that look then these would be great specially with the price and quick service.</li>
    <li> did not come with glue.  Did not stay on using Revlon glue.  You get what you pay for in this case.  Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> was not what I thought but will use them to practice application of eyelashes.  I really like the look of these but wish they were real.</li>
    <li> I wanted these for my photography shoot for makeup.......  and thank you........ also these gives me idea about makeup in general...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these false lashes. The price is even better. I have ordered more and will continue to buy these lashes. Very great buy. And they look awesome one.</li>
    <li> In the package, they look like strips of shark&#x27;s teeth, but once you get them on, they don&#x27;t look as bad. I liked the generous lash strip. It is a pretty decent deal for the price and free shipping. I would recommend these for a special occasion or a girl&#x27;s night out, but not for everyday wear or a makeup master.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
    <li> They absolutely suck. Not at all what they said they were like and no glue!</li>
    <li> Love these, lasted me a while!</li>
    <li> My sis buy these all the times, I use these all the time.</li>
    <li> THIS IS PLASTIC&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE A JOKE&lt;br /&gt;RIDICULOUS&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF $$$$$&lt;br /&gt;WON&#x27;T BE BUYING AGAIN, MY MONEY WILL BE GOING ELSEWHERE</li>
    <li> The false lashes are plastic. I didn&#x27;t attempt to apply them, I just threw them away. I suggest paying a little more for eyelashes from Walmart, etc.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the lashes they stay on nice sexy flirty great fit easy to put on look very good on me</li>
    <li> Very pleased lashes go on and look great&#x27; many sizes for different occasions quality is good and lashes are esy to put on</li>
    <li> They wer cheap and style was able to get that dramatic awsome look..  .I would deffenetly repurchase them... and recomend others who love an extra poo on their makeup</li>
    <li> they are amazing. i was expecting them to be a little bit longer but its fine. i love them and they work great</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything too great considering the price but I love these lashes! i find them beautiful and 100% worth the money and then some!</li>
    <li> if you have very big, round eyes and want lots of volume, these eyelashes are for you. Unfortunately i have smaller eyes, so it didn&#x27;t look that great when i put them on.</li>
    <li> i love them i though they were going to be different but no big deal i still like them :)</li>
    <li> I got these in the spring, and I still have half of the box untouched. I don&#x27;t use them everyday, but on days I do use them I usually will cut the lash up in two and just glue the smaller halves to the outer part of my eye to add drama. I get lots of compliments on them and people don&#x27;t believe me when I say I got these online for fifty cents!</li>
    <li> They didnt come with gluee</li>
    <li> Their Not What i Expected Worst Product Ever It Doesn&#x27;t Even Come With The Glue And They Don&#x27;t Last Long</li>
    <li> Love this lashes. Feel like a rock*</li>
    <li> Bought these for our Disney prrincess photo shoot. Turned out beautiful, and such a great deal for a penny! For pics check out our photo shoot at enchantedinaz.com</li>
    <li> Very thick and plastic. I cant imagine them staying on without tons of glue. didnt really like them to wear in a regular bases but fun for costume wear.</li>
    <li> These lashes appeared to be more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and thinner in the photos, but they are quite dramatic. I did apply them and perhaps I will trim them to my liking. They apply well, I used a drugstore brand of eyelash glue. Not bad for the price, but shipping takes a while since it is regular international to the US. (Several weeks) Order them well in advance if purchasing for an event. All in all, I probably won&#x27;t buy these again because they just weren&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> No did not like them were not that I expected did not like the quality was not to my like</li>
    <li> For ametuer at apply fake eyelashes, these are had to get on. It very stiff and the band is thick. These wont look like &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lashes at all, but I bought them so I can practice putting them on. I guess you get what you paid for..</li>
    <li> These came rather quickly, but they&#x27;re very thick! I occasionally wear fake lashes and these I just ccant keep on without them bothering! They do however look great on my girlfriend, she now owns them! She doesn&#x27;t seem to mind them for an hour or so! They were cheap ($) and you truly get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> First off the picture is very misleading, they do not come with the eyelash glue. Also they have to be cut out the the packet and the end of the lasses have to be cut down to use. I am a Drag Queen and I have so may things to do when getting ready for a show. These lashes turned one of my simple task in to an annoying pain. Not difficult but a major annoyance.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great, definitely needed some trimming, but good quality. :)</li>
    <li> I Love these eye lashes they last for a long time and you could reuse them more then once.</li>
    <li> I seriously suggest you don&#x27;t buy these lashes. I ended up throwing them away. They were so horrible and bad. The band was not able to bend to fit my lash line. When I bent it, it cracked and broke the band. They look so horrible they&#x27;re black but shiny and glossy.  There&#x27;s so much wrong with them.</li>
    <li> Very dramatic, but definitely great product. Arrived faster than I thought it would! Not for regular day use I would say, but great for nights out.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a little plastic like, but its not terrible for the price.</li>
    <li> i havent got a chance to wear these lashes yet but they arrived in a timely matter. cant wait to wear!</li>
    <li> horrible and cheap product,  I do not reccomend to anyone to buy.  Very CHEAP LOOKING and feel.  Horrible quality. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Very fake and dramatic. I know they are fake but they ususal don&#x27;t look THAT fake. i like how many they are, just wish they were better quality.</li>
    <li> I also wear lashes so i juss got them cus i ran out bt overall there okay! Easy to apply and long and thick!</li>
    <li> Great eyelashes for cheap!!!!</li>
    <li> I like there is so much for so cheap but you get what your asking for when your buying it cheap...its pretty cheap. Not easy to bend, plastic feel on the eye, applied ton of glue but ends still pop off sometimes later on in the day (even with the GOOD lash glue). I like how thick they are but these would be good for halloween, costume makeup and not to wear when you want to look like you have long pretty natural lashes. I guess they are good for practicing?</li>
    <li> I love them there beautiful, good quality for price excellent buy. Easy to apply, if you know what you&#x27;re doing. A+++++++</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get these eyelashes to fit me or even stay on- for reference I use DUO adhesive.  I&#x27;m an avid false eyelash wearer but these just don&#x27;t cut it for me.  Perhaps with super glue - I&#x27;m kidding of course.  Thank goodness they were so cheap!</li>
