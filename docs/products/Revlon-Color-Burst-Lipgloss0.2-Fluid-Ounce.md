      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>I surprised her when I was able to find it in a few clicks of the keyboard.</li>
      <li>natural color, really shiny and glossy but not sticky applicator brush is soft</li>
      <li>If there is any drug store makeup products that are capable of keeping up with high end products, it would definitely be this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it almost everyday and it can be put on lightly for a subtle tint, or you can put it on more heavily for a more concentrated color effect.</li>

<li> Not a huge difference at all though!</li>

    <li> Just what I was looking for! Very glossy but in the picture the gloss looks a little bit more tan then it actually is. Not a huge difference at all though!</li>
