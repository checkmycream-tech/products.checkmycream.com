<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Never have had a product that makes my hair so shiny and soft. It smells wonderful, too!</li>
    <li> Nice to know that it&#x27;s natural. It gently cleans. But definitely not as moisturizing as it says. There are better natural shampoos/conditioners out there. I would not repurchase again.</li>
    <li> i especially like the conditioner....both are wonderful products.  i am highly allergic to gluten, and these two products pass my test.  no itching, no rahses, no hives. my body would react if there was even the slightest bit of cross contamination.  there hasn&#x27;t been any in this duo set.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair, I guess I have a high level of porosity! My hair has been turning wild since I started using this particular product! Will give 4 stars!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I have a lot of fine-medium thickness hair, and it has slight natural wave to it. I found after cutting my hair that my usual shampoos were weighing my hair down and my natural wave was falling flat. I came across a recommendation for this shampoo and conditioner and love it. I let my hair air dry after the shower without any additional product in it, and it&#x27;s super soft, wavy and shiny. I will definitely be purchasing this in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few negatives:&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; as regular drugstore brands - I found myself using a lot more to get the coverage I wanted. I think this is a normal con for natural products.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t very long lasting or strong, which is a negative for me but might be good for others. It&#x27;s a subtle, pleasant grapefruit scent, but it&#x27;s not like OMG, this smells so good I don&#x27;t want to get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! You don&#x27;t have to use much of the shampoo to get a good clean. It felt like it really cleaned my hair and it&#x27;s an amazing product. The conditioner, I love just as much. Not heavy at all and makes my hair feel very light. Will definitely be buying this again</li>
    <li> Helps repair your hair!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair was so damaged and after a few uses its stronger than ever. I definitely recommend this and will keep ordering it myself!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner duo!!! I&#x27;m natural....and it really hydrates &amp; moisturizes my natural curls.</li>
    <li> I really like how gentle it was on my hair. Left hair incredibly soft and helped to curl hair nicely. However, I noticed my hair get greasy a lot faster and there was some dandruff</li>
    <li> Giovanni Smooth as Silk deep moisture and shampoo is the best, please contact me when and if there is a sale or good price on bulk I have told everyone about this product and my daughter also like it she uses it on my grand daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Made my hair flat sooooooo flat but very silky soft</li>
    <li> I truly LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. My hair (African American) felt extremely soft after one use of this product. I will definitely continue to use these products on my natural hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this shampoo or conditioner</li>
    <li> this shampoo/conditioner set kinda changed the color of my highlights. Turned them brassy (I have a filter on my shower head and spend lots o&#x27; $$ at the hairdressers for great hair) so I would not recommend if you have bleached blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Giovanni products work better than salon brands at a fraction of the price. Good quality natural ingredients and no animal testing, also a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I received the products faster than I expected.  The Giovanni duo set worked well on my hair and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner will order more</li>
    <li> Organic, moisture infusing perfection. If you have sensitive skin, scalp issues, or are experiencing dry hair, this is your A Team. This price and coupling is a great way to test a new product. You will Love it.</li>
    <li> Like the smell and it works well.</li>
    <li> shampoo is stripping if you have sensitive scalp probably due to the grapefruit. The comditioner is a great combing conditioner</li>
    <li> I love this brand of shampoo and conditioner. I have really fine hair and many products make my hair go limp, but this stuff works great. It also seems to reduce the amount of static electricity that usually turns my hair into a scary mess in the winter. I can&#x27;t find this brand in any of the stores in Alaska so I&#x27;m happy to see I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is horrible!  Makes your hair feel incredibly rough and tangled 24/7. Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
    <li> I have Type 4C hair. This shampoo has been amazing!!!! It moisturizes super well and has left my hair much softer. I would recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am African-American with relaxed hair. But as it grows out it gets very thick and hard to manage. I tried Giovanni for the first time and my hair dried much softer and much much smoother. Love it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is my favorite. My hair is dry and thin. The conditioner makes it nice and soft and easy to comb through after the shampoo has cleaned my hair without drying it out further. I like the Giovanni product line very much.</li>
