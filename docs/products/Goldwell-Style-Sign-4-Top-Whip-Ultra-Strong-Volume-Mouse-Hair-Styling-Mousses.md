      <li>Love this product--but only use about a tablespoon in your hand---too much</li>

<li> She suggested blow drying hair a little first then apply</li>
<li> it normally has with my other hair products, yet was soft and natural feeling, not heavy and stiff, as with other brands.  </li>
<li> just a little bit will work and holds at least a full day or two</li>
<li> The Top Whip came in a box that was too small and the nozzle was broken off.</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh har down, holds style.  </li>
<li> Never lets me down.</li>
<li> I had trouble with other name brand products....</li>
<li> No better than any other mousse I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> My hair gets a bit crunchy and stiff, but I don&#x27;t think anything less stiff would work as well.</li>
<li> and it has become a bit thin recently after having to use fungicide shampoo and a steroid oil to get rid of a scalp condition.  </li>
<li> and it is a waste</li>
<li> I bought this mousse at my stylist&#x27;s, but she was out of town for a few months.</li>
<li> holds your hair without being stiff or sticky, and holds with curling iron, comb out and hair spray.</li>

    <li> Love the product, but the bottle always breaks! The tip is very sensitive. It works 1 out of every 5 attempts. This is the second bottle that has done this.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this mousse as my hair is very fine and using this makes it much easier to control my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Linda Burley</li>
    <li> This is a great holding mousse. It gives tremendous body to fine hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best mousse I&#x27;ve found. My salon sells this size for $21.00!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  My hair will not curl with the curling iron without it.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> Goldwell Style Sign 4 works great. I have  short fine, no body hair and use a curling iron every day. The Hair salon I go to used this product on my hair. It  dries/holds your hair without being stiff or sticky, and holds with curling iron, comb out and hair spray. Also the static cling is not nearly as bad. I recommend. Buy cheaper on Amazon  then at the Salon.</li>
    <li> Best mousse out there.</li>
    <li> Good for my wavy hair!</li>
    <li> Goldwell products have been a trusted brand of mine for years. This mousse gives me volume without harsh chemicals that can dull color and damage hair. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The holding power is only a 4 on the scale.  I find that because curl and lift doesn&#x27;t hold adequately, particularly in windy conditions, I therefore use more product.  I also feel it leaves a residue in the hair, almost like it&#x27;s dirty, when it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Goodwill has been my favorite hair product for many years.  My hair is fine and this Goodwill product gives my hair volume and isn&#x27;t sticky when it dries.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this mousse at my stylist&#x27;s, but she was out of town for a few months. Happy to find on-line. Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hairdresser uses this as her go to so I decided to try it. She suggested blow drying hair a little first then apply and then I finish the drying and it gives me good volume and hold wo making my hair feel dirty. I have fine thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Great product overall! Amazon has the best price for it as well!</li>
    <li> This is a great volumizing mouse. I would buy it again! I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because it can get a touch sticky.</li>
    <li> The Top Whip came in a box that was too small and the nozzle was broken off. There was no invoice in the box so I could not return it.  I love the product but I can&#x27;t use it without a nozzle.</li>
    <li> Love this, really helps my super straight hair keep the styles and lasts for a few days too.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and paid twice as much when she bought the same from her hairdresser. She is very pleased with the outcome after she uses this product. Highly recommend!!.</li>
    <li> i have used this product but my hairdresser no longer carried it.  i was happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> amazing for fine thin hair! Love the volume..it detangles as well!! 1 can lasts me about 3-4 months</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it takes a tiny bit. But thats enough to make my hair style well and it holds the style all day.  It&#x27;s rich though so really, don&#x27;t use too much at a time or you will think it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
    <li> The only hair product I use. Gives body to thin hair without being greasy or heavy. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great product and a little goes a long way.  This is my second order and I love it.  My hair is shiny with great hold and bounce!!  Remember to use it  sparingly, otherwise you won&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or stiff and adds volume.</li>
    <li> Really does a great job of keeping my man flow in line. I&#x27;ve only used this product for my hair for the past 4 years. Never lets me down.</li>

    <li> Product is great for my very fine hair and the smell is not offensive as some products are.</li>
    <li> Stiff hold that lasts 4 hours at minimum, longer if you&#x27;re not being active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, fine, very curly to very wavy, frizzy, and it pyramids (flat on top and poofy on bottom). After I shower and towel dry my hair, I put this product all over my scalp, comb out all my hair toward the back of my head, then pin up the top so it&#x27;s poofed out on top a bit; then let air dry while the product &amp;#34;sets.&amp;#34; Once the hold sets in, I take out the pins.

    <li> Nice light feel and strong hold for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> The package came broken and was unable to get the product</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have fine, flat hair.  This keeps all day.</li>
    <li> Thickens my hair without making my hair feel like rope.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years.</li>
    <li> This may be my least favorite out of all that I purchased but it still works well.  It&#x27;s still a great product and I like it, just not as well as the others I purchased.</li>
    <li> It came with the top broke. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have become a fan of Goldwell products!!! The hair spray, top whip and spray wax are great!!  I had trouble with other name brand products....build up especially...and blah hair...so far (using these products for over 2 months) so good!!!</li>
    <li> works great if you want to add body to hair.</li>
    <li> Thi is the best mouse ever.  I have been using it for years and when I try other types of mouse, I don&#x27;t get out of it what this one can do.  i have fine hair, that easily breaks.  I love the texture and how my hair feels after I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have very fine hair and this product gives me more texture and fullness.  Much cheaper than purchasing from the salon!</li>
    <li> This foam compares very favorably with much more expensive ones.  My only complaint is that the plastic foam dispenser was broken when it arrived.  It was badly packed.  I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> This is a good holding mousse, not too sticky. Keep in mind this is a strong hold mousse, so it&#x27;s going to be a bit stiff. But I don&#x27;t mind - and I have fine hair which most mousses weigh down and this one does not! So it gives me good body.</li>

    <li> I have fine hair, this is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh har down, holds style.  Work well in humid climate</li>
    <li> just a little bit will work and holds at least a full day or two</li>
    <li> Great product and a good price.</li>
    <li> Love it, would not use anything else!</li>
    <li> Great product at a big savings from the salon.</li>
    <li> I love Goldwell products anyway but this one takes the cake.  My hair does so good with this.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is very fine and it helps to give it body and easier to control.</li>
