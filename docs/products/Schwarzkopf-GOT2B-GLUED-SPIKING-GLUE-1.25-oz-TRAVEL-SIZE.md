### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This creates perfect spikes, or perfect hair texture.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great product and great seller!</li>
      <li>I found that the Got2B hair glue is great for shorter hair.  </li>
      <li>Great for traveling.</li>
      <li>Great product that you can depend on.</li>
      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>1.25 oz is a great hair spiking glue.</li>
      <li>This works great and the size is approved by the TSA for travel on air planes as part of the 311.</li>
      <li>, you know you have good gel.</li>
      <li>This product used to be super awesome, then they changed the formulation and wrecked it....</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to have found this.  </li>
      <li>This tube was the perfect size for air travel with the new 3-1-1 regulations.  </li>
      <li>It is very strong and keeps your style in tact throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>It looked better</li>
      <li>Love this gel and the travel size means I can style my hair without fear of being arrested by the TSA.</li>
      <li>These will be perfect for my 3oz toiletry bag at the airport and will last me quite a while!</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if you could use a bit of improvement holding your hairstyle together or even if you&#x27;re one of those storm chasers that just wants to look good for the camera during a full blown hurricane then got2b glued is for you.  </li>
      <li>But if you fit into that category then you should be considering plastic surgery - not hair gel.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, it is water soluble.</li>
      <li>You can create a lot of cool looks with the paste.</li>
      <li>I want to try more of the Got2b products, althought there really isn&#x27;t much of a reason to since I&#x27;m in love with this so much.  </li>
      <li>The merchandise arrived quickly after the order was placed.</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s because (let&#x27;s face it) they&#x27;re just beautiful people from the git-go and really stiff</li>
      <li>I have long hair, and sometimes I use the smallest amount between my palms to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; a hairstyle in place for the evening, and to give my ends a nice smooth, piecey look.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and you don&#x27;t need much if you have short hair.</li>
      <li>Great for those with straight limp hair.</li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re hair is exactly how you styled it before you went to sleep</li>
      <li>And it stays exactly where I put</li>
      <li>and now it does what I tell it to do for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Whether you face strong winds or work up a sweat playing sports, your hair will generally stay put the way you worked it in the morning.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really the first time in my life, or</li>
      <li>Holds very well.</li>
      <li>, I think you&#x27;ll like this product as much as I do.  </li>
      <li>the new formula &amp;#34;separates&amp;#34; and a bunch of oily crud comes out of the tube first b)</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m fairly confident it could hold the heat tiles down on the NASA space shuttle.  </li>
      <li>I live where it stays around 80% humidity, and my hair stays a frizzy curly mess most of the time.  </li>
      <li>I do normally as part of living in this</li>
      <li>Much easier to carry than the larger tubes.</li>
      <li>I suppose this is ok if you are 13 years old, but for anyone older than that, it&#x27;s an absurd and undesirable pong.</li>
      <li>at least since I moved to humid south Florida, that my hair has done what I wanted it to and stayed that way in spite of the humidity and the non stop light sweating</li>
      <li>I then let it air dry almost dry, then use my round brush to smooth my hair into the shape I want.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and great seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.  I like to keep this little travel size in my suitcase or backpack.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Purchased the smaller sizes so I can have one to travel with and one at home.</li>
    <li> I occasionally find these travel sized gels attached to the bigger tubes of gel, but the big tubes last me ages. These will be perfect for my 3oz toiletry bag at the airport and will last me quite a while!</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re hair is exactly how you styled it before you went to sleep, you know you have good gel.</li>
    <li> This creates perfect spikes, or perfect hair texture. You can use on long or short hair. I have long hair, and sometimes I use the smallest amount between my palms to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; a hairstyle in place for the evening, and to give my ends a nice smooth, piecey look. This is the best-kept secret ever. Don&#x27;t tell anybody.</li>
    <li> Did not like it. Looks and acts like glue, not flexible enough and sometimes leaves hard blobs on the hair, if not finely dispersed. Fortunately, it is water soluble.</li>
    <li> Great product that you can depend on.</li>
    <li> Schwarzkopf GOT2B GLUED SPIKING GLUE 1.25 oz is a great hair spiking glue. Great for those with straight limp hair. You can create a lot of cool looks with the paste. The smell is pleasant and you don&#x27;t need much if you have short hair. Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Some guys try everything to look like Justin Bieber or Brad Pitt. But if you fit into that category then you should be considering plastic surgery - not hair gel.  And that&#x27;s because (let&#x27;s face it) they&#x27;re just beautiful people from the git-go and really stiff hair isn&#x27;t going to get you a date with Angelina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you could use a bit of improvement holding your hairstyle together or even if you&#x27;re one of those storm chasers that just wants to look good for the camera during a full blown hurricane then got2b glued is for you.  Now I&#x27;m not sure what they put in this stuff but I&#x27;m fairly confident it could hold the heat tiles down on the NASA space shuttle.  Actually, it&#x27;s considered so sticky there&#x27;s a warning label on the back that says: not to be used by children under 12 or anyone who may want to comb their hair anytime in the next couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I think you&#x27;ll like this product as much as I do.  Just remember one thing.  Don&#x27;t accidentally touch your head before heading out on that date with your girl.  There&#x27;s nothing worse then eating dinner across from someone that constantly appears to be saluting you.</li>
    <li> This works great and the size is approved by the TSA for travel on air planes as part of the 311.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> This tube was the perfect size for air travel with the new 3-1-1 regulations.  I wasn&#x27;t without my trusted hair product during my trip.  The merchandise arrived quickly after the order was placed.</li>
    <li> I live where it stays around 80% humidity, and my hair stays a frizzy curly mess most of the time.  It goes crazy, especially since I swim every day and let my hair air dry  usually. What a mess my hair had become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally let my stylist cut my hair shoulder length and put a lot of layers into it.  It looked better but I got this and now it does what I tell it to do for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get out of the pool, shampoo, and put a big glob of this into my hands and rub my hands together, then run this glue through my hair.  I then let it air dry almost dry, then use my round brush to smooth my hair into the shape I want.  And it stays exactly where I put it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really the first time in my life, or at least since I moved to humid south Florida, that my hair has done what I wanted it to and stayed that way in spite of the humidity and the non stop light sweating I do normally as part of living in this climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to have found this.  I want to try more of the Got2b products, althought there really isn&#x27;t much of a reason to since I&#x27;m in love with this so much.  I&#x27;m speechless over how well this holds.</li>
    <li> Love this gel and the travel size means I can style my hair without fear of being arrested by the TSA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian male. For the Asians, you know that our hair is a bit different.  Can&#x27;t just go to any barber.  In the same sense, can&#x27;t just use any hair gel, wax, glue, etc.  I found that the Got2B hair glue is great for shorter hair.  It is very strong and keeps your style in tact throughout the day.  Whether you face strong winds or work up a sweat playing sports, your hair will generally stay put the way you worked it in the morning.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This product used to be super awesome, then they changed the formulation and wrecked it.... a) the new formula &amp;#34;separates&amp;#34; and a bunch of oily crud comes out of the tube first b) it smells ridiculous, like strawberry bubble gum gone wrong and cranked up to 11... I suppose this is ok if you are 13 years old, but for anyone older than that, it&#x27;s an absurd and undesirable pong.</li>
    <li> This was the only place I could find a travel size of this product. Only wish it could be purchased without being an add on.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a solid holding gel, this is it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a TON of different hair products. I hated hair looking greasy or wet. I came across this and I will never use another product. Holds very well. You can have that dry look or if you wet your hands a bit before application you can have a wetter look.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and loves having this size in his travel bag.  Much easier to carry than the larger tubes. would buy again.</li>
