### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Hair gets amazing!</li>
      <li>one is reall good if you need just a hidratation.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I LOVED the Bambu one</li>
      <li>Any way follow the directions and cleans with a good clarifying shampoo once a month.</li>
      <li>A good smell</li>
      <li>I love this product, it made my hair silky and smooth!!!</li>
      <li>I really love this product!</li>
      <li>I tried both Silicon Mix and Silicon Mix Bamboo-Bamboo much better!</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>very good, and it arrived really fast!</li>
      <li>With all that said, once product ingredients and hair health became important to me, this was one product I had to say good bye to.</li>
      <li>but I was really pleased than I ever been.</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Generally,  I&#x27;m okay with fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>Love the outcome results of this product.  </li>
      <li>i love Pharmapacks packaging too</li>
      <li>It was wonderful for detangling and protein deep conditioning.</li>
      <li>I freakin&#x27; love this stuff.</li>
      <li>OMG, your hair combs out great with a roller set or flat iron with this product.</li>
      <li>It restores the original curl pattern and leaves your hair smooth&amp; lustrous.</li>
      <li>Perfect... Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing it gets rid if frizz and leaves ur hair so soft.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong in a good way for me at least and lingers for a week or more.  </li>
      <li>I think the scent is just a fresh sent.  </li>
      <li>Plus Bamboo has better natural Ingredients.</li>
      <li>Regular Silicon Mix kind of resembles Crece Pelo-same color, thickness, and smell.</li>
      <li>but I believe I over paid for this product and would have had more money in my pocket if I would have purchased it at my local store.</li>
      <li>Left my hair more moisturized and softer.</li>
      <li>However, Crece Pelo has better ingredients and left my hair nicer.</li>
      <li>After I purchased online, I went back to YouTube to see more reviews.</li>
      <li>I purchased this based on a positive review on YouTube.  </li>
      <li>they make it secure where it doesnt open up and spill everywhere while in transit to ur house.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the scent</li>
      <li>I need lots of heat t make it straight or to make it manageable.</li>
      <li>This hair treatment really improved the quality of my extensions.  </li>
      <li>Really helped my hair</li>
      <li>I use this on my real hair and on my extensions.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is really good, the Dominicans used it on my hair every two weeks and recommended that I take some home and use it in between visits , my hair was sooo healthy and grew long and thick!</li>
      <li>I recently found some at the local beauty store, started back using it and am very pleased.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is nice and thick, not watery...</li>
      <li>But it made my 5yo hair bundles look new after bleaching, dying and severe amounts of heat.</li>
      <li>Reduced shedding, smooth, less tangling.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel so soft .</li>
      <li>But, this smell was very synthetic (as opposed to an essential oil smell).  </li>
      <li>, it reminds me of an old lady&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African-American with Natural hair.</li>
      <li>Makes hair extremely soft &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m natural and it makes my hair manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>This is not for my natural hair</li>
      <li>Maybe because I used other products with it the first time.</li>
      <li>I used it last week and it had my hair buttery soft.</li>
      <li>And, the itching was not limited to the scalp.</li>
      <li>I normally mix this product with other conditioners.</li>
      <li>If you decide to buy, keep mind it will also dry out ur hair (especially Afro texture natural hair) and cause breakage if u don&#x27;t maintain moisture balance</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me I regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> Really helped my hair</li>
    <li> Okay. I used it around two times. Did not notice a big change in my hair. Maybe because I used other products with it the first time. It made my breakage a little breakage. I plan on using it again to see if I see a change. Will keep posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: oh my gosh. I used it last week and it had my hair buttery soft. The moisture carried me through the week. Amazing. Just sat under the dryer for around 15-20 minutes and I could just feel it working. Curls were popping.</li>
    <li> I freakin&#x27; love this stuff. I have thick coarse American Indian/ Mexican hair. It&#x27;s FRIZZY!!!! I need lots of heat t make it straight or to make it manageable. This stuff helps.</li>
    <li> This hair treatment really improved the quality of my extensions.  It restores the original curl pattern and leaves your hair smooth&amp; lustrous. I don&#x27;t really like the scent, it reminds me of an old lady&#x27;s perfume.  But it made my 5yo hair bundles look new after bleaching, dying and severe amounts of heat.</li>
    <li> I like all the Silicon Mix products.&lt;br /&gt;That one is reall good if you need just a hidratation.&lt;br /&gt;But I LOVED the Bambu one</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. It makes my hair feel so soft . Some do not like the scent, but I like the scent of it. I think the scent is just a fresh sent.  I use this on my real hair and on my extensions.  This conditioner is nice and thick, not watery...</li>
    <li> Love the outcome results of this product.  I&#x27;m natural and it makes my hair manageable and soft. I normally mix this product with other conditioners.</li>
    <li> A good smell but I believe I over paid for this product and would have had more money in my pocket if I would have purchased it at my local store.</li>
    <li> I used this for years on my relaxed air. It was wonderful for detangling and protein deep conditioning. OMG, your hair combs out great with a roller set or flat iron with this product. The smell is strong in a good way for me at least and lingers for a week or more.  With all that said, once product ingredients and hair health became important to me, this was one product I had to say good bye to. If you decide to buy, keep mind it will also dry out ur hair (especially Afro texture natural hair) and cause breakage if u don&#x27;t maintain moisture balance</li>
    <li> I tried both Silicon Mix and Silicon Mix Bamboo-Bamboo much better! Left my hair more moisturized and softer. Plus Bamboo has better natural Ingredients. Regular Silicon Mix kind of resembles Crece Pelo-same color, thickness, and smell. However, Crece Pelo has better ingredients and left my hair nicer.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 1/2 a star, I would. I purchased this based on a positive review on YouTube.  After I purchased online, I went back to YouTube to see more reviews. The reviews are mixed. A few described the smell as &amp;#34;chemical. &amp;#34; At least one reviewer noted a reaction.  Well, this product caused me to itch, too. And, the itching was not limited to the scalp. I was also itching on my shoulders and arms. I noticed the reaction after I turned in for the night. I washed my hair and used this product that morning!  The itching was so bad that I hoped I had Benedryl in my medicine cabinet as I suffer from Hay Fever. But, I didn&#x27;t have Benedryl.  It was roughly around 2am. When I awoke around 8am, the itching had stopped.  The only thing in the product that I think may have caused the reaction was the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed as the 7th ingredient (out of ~12).  I recently read somewhere that when you see the word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; that there can be several fragrances in the product.  Which brings me to the smell. Generally,  I&#x27;m okay with fragrances.  I wear perfume and I have a lot of fragrances.  But, this smell was very synthetic (as opposed to an essential oil smell).  It didn&#x27;t smell bad to me in the tub. But, the smell lingered in my hair and I wore 2 scarves to bed because I didn&#x27;t want the smell to transfer to my pillow and sheets.&lt;br /&gt;After the reaction, I looked at the tub to see if there was a warning.  Low and behold,  the pic below says it all. I threw away the rest of the conditioner. I&#x27;m African-American with Natural hair. I have TONS of hair products and none of them state &amp;#34;...in case of irritation, discontinue use.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing it gets rid if frizz and leaves ur hair so soft. i love Pharmapacks packaging too they make it secure where it doesnt open up and spill everywhere while in transit to ur house.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! Hair gets amazing! I started using this product a long time ago! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it made my hair silky and smooth!!!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good, the Dominicans used it on my hair every two weeks and recommended that I take some home and use it in between visits , my hair was sooo healthy and grew long and thick! I don&#x27;t know if they were putting something else on it to help it grow but I was really pleased than I ever been. My Daughter is a beautician, and I went to her once a week until we moved to two separate states. she was a miracle worker, however, the Dominican beat the competition out using this product on my hair. I recently found some at the local beauty store, started back using it and am very pleased. Kudos Silicon Mix!!</li>
    <li> This product smells like a relaxer. I will never use this. I sent the conditioner back immediately. This is not for my natural hair</li>
    <li> Perfect... Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Reduced shedding, smooth, less tangling. I use this one for my deep conditioning masque 30 min.  Any way follow the directions and cleans with a good clarifying shampoo once a month.</li>
    <li> very good, and it arrived really fast!</li>
    <li> Makes hair extremely soft &amp; shiny. Has a cleaning supply smell.</li>
