<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price; pleasant scent and it adds moisture to your skin, without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the cheapest lotion per ounce I have ever found outside of the dollar store. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, though. This stuff not only smells nice, but leaves your skin super soft and hydrated for long periods of time without that nasty sticky lotion feel. On hot days when the LAST thing you want is damp and sticky lotion taking forever to dry, this is the answer to that. It absorbs quickly and easily, leaving behind only soft skin that smells delicious. I want to eat my legs after I massage this stuff into &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> i love it so much and i can over-use it and not feel bad about wasting it cause i got soo mcuh of it</li>
    <li> My wife started applying this product and the skin became more smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we definitely recommend this product as it works great!</li>
    <li> The first ingredient is water, followed by mineral oil. It has a light, pleasant cocoa scent. It dissipates throughout the day for me. It&#x27;s dirt cheap, about $1 for 32 ounces of product. It&#x27;s not my favorite because immediately after putting this on it dissipates, and it&#x27;s like you didn&#x27;t just put any lotion on. The moisturization doesn&#x27;t last very long either. I much prefer Suave Advanced Therapy (Walmart, $3).</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little thin but it still works.  It&#x27;s perfect in the summer time because you don&#x27;t want the feel of anything on your skin.</li>
    <li> Most people reach for cocoa butter when they are pregnant. I, however, first started using cocoa butter when I heard about the harmful chemicals present in so many other lotions. I used Palmer&#x27;s for about a year, though I didn&#x27;t prefer the cost of it.   A few months ago I had Pityriasis Rosea (an unexplained, rash-like, short-lived skin condition) and I read that keeping the skin well moisturized would help with the itch. I went shopping for more Palmer&#x27;s and decided to browse for other options as well. I picked up Queen Helene, which was MUCH less expensive for the amount they give you, compared the ingredients with Palmer&#x27;s, and found that, like Palmer&#x27;s, Queen Helene did not contain harmful chemicals.  Queen Helene was just what I needed for the pityriasis rosea, keeping my skin so soft and smooth that I was hardly bothered by the condition. I love it so much that I keep using it just as much even though the rash has faded.   I love the fragrance, which reminds me faintly of cocoa and coconut. Very beachy and warm. In contrast, I merely tolerated Palmer&#x27;s fragrance, which was way too chocolatey for what I want on my hands and body.   This lotion makes my skin so soft and smooth, and I feel good because I know it&#x27;s natural and good for me. It&#x27;s also great after sunburns to keep the skin from drying out and peeling too much.   I&#x27;m very satisfied with this lotion!</li>
    <li> This is product is totally affordable and in my opinion worth the money. The only negative aspect i noticed using it is that it&#x27;s watery as many people have pointed out and it doesn&#x27;t last long. I have very sensitive dry skin and after a few hours within applying this product i noticed my skin gets dry again. It also is not tested on animals which is always a plus! :)</li>
    <li> Feels very watery and doesn&#x27;t quite smell right. Quick absorbing and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Love this cocoa butter lotion.</li>
    <li> Cheap and works great, I can use it on my face and have no irritations.</li>
    <li> could not believe how large this product was. I&#x27;m sending it too my sister to help her with her dry skin. I will be purchasing another bottle for myself very soon. It doesn&#x27;t take too much to cover a large area of your body, smells awesome and feels wonderful, not that slick feeling some lotions have.</li>
    <li> It kept on arriving with the tops partially off and lotion all on the outer part of the bottle and into the plastic bags.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and it cannot be beat for the cost. An excellent choice of skin care.</li>
    <li> This item is the best size and will last me along time, its very light n silky its the most amazing smell of coco butter I&#x27;ve ever smelled! It gos on lightly n not sticky</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion every day, softens skin, best of all, non-greasy</li>
    <li> I am a guy who needed cheap lotion to help dry and oily skin. Other lotions never worked well with me, they make me feel disgusting. This stuff feels light weight and lets my skin breath properly. I love it, and at 3$ you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell is concerned, it does have one. Its not the best smell in the world, but I do not mind it. Once it is on my skin I kinda like the smell. I guess it is just a preference thing.</li>
    <li> My wife feel very good, she is dry skin, feel very moisturizing. Can be used for the whole winter. Price change is going on all day。</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Works well &amp; cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I have found cheaper on sale at Wal-Mart or Target but why wait for a coupon, drive &amp; then wait in those lines of people wearing sweats.&lt;br /&gt;The Cocoa Butter with Mango is my first choice on fragrance but both are delightful.</li>
    <li> I just bought this recently and already love it. I&#x27;m somewhat partial to name brands, so a while ago I got Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Repair cream with shea butter. It smelled terrible and got all over everything I touched after I used it.     Queen Helene Cocoa Butter lotion has a much better smell, and my hands feel more hydrated but the product actually got absorbed. I&#x27;m typing this right after using it and there&#x27;s not a hint of grease on the keyboard.     5 stars so far.</li>
    <li> I got this bottle of lotion for 3 or so dollars at the Dollar General. After all the positive reviews I read on it I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Now, I don&#x27;t have extremely dry skin. Just every now and then the skin on my legs feels a little dry and itchy. I was hoping this would be my remedy. Not so. First of all, this product does not have a very pleasent smell. It smells very chemical. Second of all, this product provides little to no moisture or relief to the skin. My skin felt moisturized and less itchy for maybe 2 minutes? I would buy a bottle of St. Ive&#x27;s or SEACRET any day over this.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product been using for a few months its great but the only problem is that it causes horrible acne gives you black heads white heads etc .... &gt;.&gt; buts its great for arms legs and face if you have acne or bad acne i would suggest a different lotion</li>
    <li> When I got pregnant I researched lotions.  I decided to try this lotion even though it had mixed reviews. I&#x27;m not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in large quantity.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like water, doesn&#x27;t actually moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;I need to apply more lotion shortly after putting it on.</li>
    <li> this lotion is great for the price and for my full body. it smells great (light chocolate scent)and is inexpensive. i used to have very dry legs (before i started using african black soap) and this lotion couldn&#x27;t keep the dryness away. however, it still gets 5 stars because my legs were very very very VERY dry, like so dry, my skin would flake off. If you have moderate dryness or are looking to keep skin moist, this is the lotion for you!</li>
    <li> Its very watery and doesn&#x27;t give long lasting  moisture</li>
    <li> I didnt buy this on amazon, it was a dollar at walmart for the biggest size. I love it i have eczema and my skin soaks it right up. Smells like coconuts, not overpowering. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Yes this is ultra-hydrating and some people think it is a great moisturizer. I am here to tell you that if you suffer from acne, this will make it more worse than you can imagine! I speak from experience, and have researched this as well. Although this product is water based, it still contains oil and because it absorbs so quickly-it stays in system for a while. Even if you don&#x27;t use this on your face it can cause you to break out because it does not completely wash off your hands even when you are washing your face. It is a very fine oil that can clog pores and add oil very quickly and easily.    It is a great price, and for individuals with resistant non-acne prone skin I am sure this product is wonderful. For the rest of us, do not let the fact that this is water based  and all natural fool you!</li>
    <li> It smells like my dreams and there&#x27;s enough of it to swim in (well not really, but close enough). This has got to be the best bang for your buck buy on all of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great for refilling those small Queen Helene Cocoa Butter bottles!</li>
    <li> Oily. But smells and feels nice.</li>
    <li> It works if you are consistent with it. I used to be a big woman and I recently lost weight so I had skin discolorations under my arms and where my thighs rubbed together. Plus I was also a tomboy who played outside and accumulated some battle scars on my legs. LOL. So I started using it about 8 months ago and three of my scars have faded and the discolorations under my arms are starting to fade.away.</li>
    <li> This ish makes me super smooth like a baby.</li>
    <li> This lotion dried my skin out. The more I used, the worse it got. I threw it away and won&#x27;t ever buy from this brand again.</li>
    <li> It was&#x27;t the butter consistency that we all had grown to love but it works just as well.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This product is very creamy and not at all irritating.I use it alternately with a aloe product.</li>
    <li> This product is so great to use and smells good.  It leaves my skin supple and well moisturized.  I enjoy using the product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> this used to clearly be my favorite lotion, BUT it no longer has the pleasant smell of cocoa w/ a hint of vanilla.  some new, hard to identify, \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell now predominates--and it&#x27;s not a fragrance i like.  maybe they started putting in less cocoa butter (cocoa beans are now costlier)and added this off-putting fragrance as some kind of artificial cocoa smell.  it&#x27;s a wrong move; the lotion doesn&#x27;t smell nice.    keep the lotion&#x27;s formula like it was in the past.  if you have to charge more, then so be it; it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s expensive already.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or slimy and it absorbs soooo quickly!  It is seriously the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am convinced that this will be my lotion for life.  And the price! - you can&#x27;t beat it.  I definitely reccommend this.  Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Now, first of all I am surprised I don&#x27;t see other people review this product on here.  I found this lotion years ago, and I have never looked back.  It smells great, it&#x27;s very creamy, yet it&#x27;s not greasy, it does its job well.  I have met many-many women that swear by this product.  And the fact that it&#x27;s cheap, makes it that much better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t allready tried it, go ahead and give it a shot, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d ordered this product previously, but this was completely different smelling than before.  It smell like chemicals, rather than cocoa butter.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I remember getting introduce to this lotion to my then boyfriend, not fiance and I fell in love with it! It was silky, smooth and rich in formula. We got it every time we ran out of it. Then one day, we notice it wasn&#x27;t thick in formula anymore. It was watery and it didn&#x27;t leave the feeling of softness after we put it on. I felt dry. Not to mention the size gotten smaller. We was totally disappointed. Stopped using for two out more years and decided to get it again. Still disappointed. Still watery. Still feels dry afterwards. I hate when companies mess with the formula. If it isn&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it...ugh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: you can get this same lotion and size at Wal-Mart for half the cost, even less</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not Cocoa butter smell to me, and is very thin. Works ok but just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> i been using this lotion for some time now and i love it, not only does it smell good but it keeps your skin soft and smooth.i use it on my face and body and my skin glows beautifully, and i cant stop smelling myself when i have it on. i buy the big bottle and it last me months a little goes a long way.a must have.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but the downside to this is that it doesnt absorb right away...so I only apply it when I&#x27;m at home.</li>
    <li> good buy!  Good product!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation that I buy a cocoa butter product for my dry skin. I did not smell it before buying it! Instead of smelling like sweet cocoa or vanilla, it has a strong smell reminscent of some sort of budget, chemical or artificial scent. (It reminds me of a wanna-be tropical, cheap sun tan lotion). Worse still, the smell is strong and persistent--although the lotion absorbs into your skin right away, the smell does not fade right away. A friend asked if she could use some when I pulled out the bottle to put some on, but after she smelled it, she no longer wanted to use it! I will not buy this product again and think I will throw the bottle out.</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff. It even smells like coconut. I&#x27;ve used similar products for years, and this is the very best-by far.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible! I ended up throwing it.</li>
    <li> I feel my body breath with this lotion, not like Palmer&#x27;s lotion that it layer up and leaves you cakey. I love this lotion and I recommended.</li>
    <li> These well made products are just what I was looking for. This is well made and arrived in short order. Thank You!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion and have been using it for several years. I use it anywhere on my body including my face. I found that after starting to wash my face with a plain unscented dove bar and then using this lotion right after my shower, my acne completely disappeared. The bottles are large and extremely cheap (less than four dollars at most stores). I use about a quarter-sized amount (enough for my hands, elbows, face, and feet) every day, the bottles last me at least 6 months and my body stays smooth all day. The lotion is very light, non-greasy, and quick absorbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from having an unpleasant or strong chemical smell I find that it has an extremely mild, natural, and pleasant scent - somewhere between beeswax and white chocolate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Queen Helene Cocoa Butter lotion for about 8 years - never had a problem with it and loved it. Decided to buy it online at amazon. I read reviews that warned of exactly what I found once the lotion arrives: It smells heavily of petroleum and it feels grimy when you put it on. Then it kept making me break out wherever I put it on. Finally I threw it away. On a better note, I contacted amazon yesterday, and even though I threw the product away, they still refunded my money and said they will look into this. I would either buy this or get Vaseline brand cocoa butter at your local store. I&#x27;m turned off to this brand ever since.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, texture and size! It is a timeless lotion that I will use forever.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is soothingly tropical, and the lotion has a wonderful consistency, like a true cream.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic deal... Just putting that out there. I love cocoa butter and although it&#x27;s never super expensive, you CANNOT go wrong with the 32 ounces for about $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;m not a HUGE fan of is the smell. I much prefer the Palmers&#x27; as this one smells a bit sour to me, and doesn&#x27;t have as much of a &amp;#34;cocoa butter&amp;#34; smell (which I like). Nevertheless, money talks (this one is cheaper) and the &amp;#34;sour vanilla&amp;#34; smell does fade as it absorbs into the skin. Besides, I have the 32-ounce bottle at my desk at work and am constantly applying it and none of my co-workers have complained about the smell, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My absolute favorite thing about this lotion (besides the price, of course) is that it isn&#x27;t super greasy. I can put it on my hands at work and still be able to type at my keyboard and use my phone without needing to wipe it off. I do find that I have to reapply it more frequently than some other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t lose any sleep over it due to the low price.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion at a great price!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and a great value!</li>
    <li> This is a good product and the price is certainly right but it is much thinner than Palmers Cocoa Butter Lotion. It does not have the rich cocoa butter smell I expected but if you don&#x27;t care for that smell, you would not mind.  I like Palmers product much better but if I could not get it, I would buy this. I think it is more a matter of preference than quality.</li>
    <li> After trying MANY lotions of all prices, it became apparent to me that none of them were going to last all day. About 7 years ago out of desperation, I went to my nearest drug store and started sniffing all the lotions. I decided that if I had to keep reapplying the lotion, I was going to get something that smelled good. And I need a lotion that has mineral oil. And preferably lanolin as well-this has both. I ended up getting Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Hand and Body Lotion. Bonus, it was the least expensive. Extra bonus, it WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used another lotion that literally sinks in immediately to soften my skin, and isn&#x27;t greasy or clumpy. Or doesn&#x27;t wash off and cause slimy hands in water. I use it all over-body, hands and face, and it&#x27;s great. The Hand and Body Cream is great for cracked heels.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 23 years. Nothing better. No greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Not as this as the formula I remember (most lotions seem to be watered down these days) but definitely a good value.</li>
    <li> The bad news about this lotion is it reeks. I cannot tell you what on earth the smell is, but it smells so bad. I cannot tell if it is a chemical smell, or what? It smells like rubber crossed with a barnyard, or something. It&#x27;s too bad, because it DOES make my skin soft. But, I cannot handle the smell. I&#x27;d rather use a product that works half as good but smells really good. This is nasty.</li>
    <li> I saw the cheap price for the amazon add on and needed lotion--- what smelly wax junk. I am surprised it does not come with a candle wick. This is very cheap industrial lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found Queen Helene to be one of the best moisturizing lotions out there.  After consistent daily or every-other-day use, my already pale skin was very milky white.. this with a lemon treatment help fade scars, blemishes, and uneven color.  Deep scars aren&#x27;t going to disappear, but you can get some good results with a consistent routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also kept my skin more properly hydrated than most other products, which just dry out the skin overtime so you end up having to use it multiple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way for the most benefit is the use it all over the body (not good for sensitive faces) after a shower and a light patted drying.  The skin should be a little damp so the product seeps in more properly, and then preferably let it dry in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use this on my hair, but one of my male friends would use a very small amount (dime-size) on his scalp, resulting in very soft hair.</li>
    <li> Good lotion and a great price</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. My elbows often get so dry in the winter, that they crack and bleed, but I tried this lotion and it worked so well. It smells great, no greasy leftover lotion, and it is the best lotion I have used. (With my dry skin I have tried so many but this is the best)</li>
    <li> The body lotion gave me a rash. I used to buy it all the time and never had any problems. Maybe it was just this one bottle.</li>
    <li> I was a devotee of Queen Helene Cocoa Butter for 25 years since high school. However, I refuse to continue to use this product due to it containing PARABEN. If they would drop this chemical I would buy a case of it in a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1990s, parabens were deemed xenoestrogens&#x27;agents that mimic estrogen in the body. “Estrogen disruption” has been linked to breast cancer and reproductive issues. And in 2004 British cancer researcher Philippa Darbre, Ph.D., found parabens present in malignant breast tumors. As a result, experts in many countries are recommending limits on paraben levels in cosmetic products. What’s more, watchdog organizations worry that if parabens can be stored in the body, over time they could have a cumulative effect and pose a health risk.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter lotion is very effective at keeping your skin moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;Take some time to allow the product to be absorbed properly.&lt;br /&gt;Has a mild odor that is not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good for the whole body!</li>
    <li> My grandchildren have Eczema, this lotion helps sooth  their itchy skin..</li>
    <li> I think that the lotion part of this lotion is probably fine, unfortunately, I&#x27;m not for sure because this stuff smells so bad that I can&#x27;t stand to wear it. It makes me sick to my stomach to smell it on myself or anyone else. Also, the smell of it last long after you wash!</li>
    <li> This feels pretty watery.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for very dry skin, as it&#x27;s very light.  Still, I got tired of using really high quality lotion after hot showers with my apartment&#x27;s hard water, so this does the job nicely.  It does smell very good, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and the price is good for the quality.</li>
    <li> This was very diluted, and did not moisturize well. There are better cocoa butter lotions that really hydrate the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product during my pregnancy and it&#x27;s been wonderful!  I love the scent, and the lotion has lasted a very long time (I use it all over my entire body daily).  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. It smells good, goes in easy, absorbs fast &amp; helps me stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I swim a lot so having a great, quick moisturizer is essential.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve been in business since 1930 so they must be doing something right.</li>
    <li> liquid is thin, compared to another popular brand (that&#x27;s more expensive), but it&#x27;s much cheaper than the other brand.  as for effectiveness, not sure.</li>
    <li> hard to find in stores but here it is and at a great price</li>
    <li> Last few times I bought this it was very watered down.  Is there a new product formula?</li>
    <li> Love how this smells, great price.</li>
    <li> Not too thick, right amount of moisture, smells good, and overall helps with the appearance of your skin over time. I love it and the price is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the palmers but this is just as great! I really love the scent and I added some vitamin e into it and have been using it . it&#x27;s a big bottle and it&#x27;s inexpensive so I give this an awesome review!</li>
    <li> very good soft body cream.  Love it</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer for body and hands, large bottle enough for a year!</li>
    <li> To tell you the truth I don&#x27;t buy this online, but I love this potion so I had to write a review! I have bought several bottles of Queen Helene&#x27;s and it really helps with dry itchy skin. My hands often get so dry they crack and become sore in the summer. But I diligently use this lotion and I haven&#x27;t had that problem. It is not very thick, but it is quite moisturizing without being greasy. And you can&#x27;t beat the price for such a large bottle!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a subtle smell that is acceptable for men and women. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; smell per say. It&#x27;s a mild, gender neutral cocoa butter. I can put it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s great for the whole body. It makes your skin feel soft. I can feel the difference even several hours after putting it on. I used this during 2 pregnancies and I have no stretch marks! The quality is unbeatable and you even get a great amount for a sensible price. For more serious cases of dryness, get the cocoa creme by the same brand. It works great on hands, feet and dry skin from winter time, and massages too!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! So hydrating and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I used this for many years but it&#x27;s become hard to find where I live, none of the drugstores seem to stock it anymore. I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for such a great price!  This lotion smells incredible, a light cocoa butter scent that smells a bit like coconut on me. It is very moisturizing and lasts all day on my dry to very dry legs and arms. I have KP on my legs and for whatever reason this lotion is one of the few that seems to help with it. The bottle is giant and lasts months and months with daily use! Seriously, try this stuff.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this lotion, which has a nice, subtle scent and a smooth finish. I ordered two because she goes through them so quickly, and one was opened in the box. Luckily both were individually wrapped in sealed plastic bags, so no lotion got on anything else in the package, which I appreciate. Very little lotion was lost at least and it cleaned up easily thanks to the way it had been packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I will order these again.</li>
    <li> Bought a small tube of this at a drug store n loved it.checked amazon n sure enough found a quart size,I use it 2 or 3 times a day n it helps the scar from my hand surgery</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much however since they changed it, it has become very runny and it spills all over. I definitely will not be buying this anymore unless they return to the thicker formula.</li>
    <li> if you have dry skin ashy skin or just looking for a quality skin care lotion well this is the lotion for you go get it today</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris, a benign skin condition where the skin on my upper arms not only produces more keratin in the hair follicles, but it can be kind of rough and dry. I was looking up ways to treat it, and one site recommended certain lotions, including cocoa butter. So when I was at the store, I chose the 32 oz. bottle since it was much cheaper than any of the other brand lotions recommended, like Aveeno and the like. I didn&#x27;t expect to like it as much as I do! It&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb, it smells great (makes me think of sunblock lotion) and it makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Use to use this when I was younger. After seeing it on amazon I decided to try it again and i still like it. I have very sensitive skin and I had a bright idea to try it on my face once and surprisingly next day my face did not break out. I like to use it under my feet before bed too. I also like the mild scent.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and have been using it for years&lt;br /&gt;For the size, I find it inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s very affordable, smells great and moisturizes my skin. I started using it after my baby was born. It keeps my skin soft and my stretchmarks don&#x27;t itch anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  Softens my skin like nothing else.</li>
    <li> To watery use to be good stuff thought i.was getting a.steel no they stole from me cuz its not worth it</li>
    <li> Bought this lotion to try out after reading a few reviews.  This lotion is very &amp;#34;Cheap&amp;#34;, I would recommend the Vasaline Cocoa Butter, it stays on longer that this mfg.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  And relatively inexpensive.  For lymphedema on legs, I think petroleum jelly works better.</li>
    <li> I have Sj&amp;ouml;gren&#x27;s Syndrome and Keratosis Pilaris, so my skin is quite picky about what it allows to soak in and what it doesn&#x27;t. The old Queen Helene Cocoa Butter lotion was the only lotion I have ever found that would soak completely into my skin, leaving it soft but not greasy. The new &#x27;formula&#x27; does not. It is very thick, and leaves a greasy residue on both my skin, and that of my mother (who doesn&#x27;t have Sj&amp;ouml;gren&#x27;s or KP.) If you are a fan of the old Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Lotion, you will likely be disappointed by what is being sold here.</li>
    <li> Best body lotion for the $! I mix it with my favorite perfume-scented lotion and put it on my neck. That allows it to last a lot longer. Great for those with sensitive skin, even children. My 3 1/2 year old grand-daughter is very fair skinned and is scraching alot. I had a sleepover (I live 2 hours away) and this was in my bag. So, after her bath I dried her off,  Iathered her in it and dressed her. She said &amp;#34;Gramma, you made the itch stop!&amp;#34;. They were using an expensive brand on her, but this does the trick for so much less. She helps put it on after each bath and before dressing. One of my gifts for her this Christmas is a lotion warmer. : )</li>
    <li> a good all around lotion to use everyday..  it absorbs nicely - smells great and I love putting on after a hot shower</li>
    <li> I have used several lotions while being massaged. This one is by far the best. The lotion doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy, and does not stain my clothes.  The lotion also doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a flower shop.</li>
    <li> i know it is very cheap so good for price i guess. but cocoa butter is supposed to be very thick. this lotion is not thick at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lotion, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the size of the bottle. The scent, however, is very strange.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and good price for the size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Not super thin.</li>
    <li> I used to love this stuff because the cocoa butter smell was great and it worked good. Something has changed since the last time I used it. The smell is chemically now and the lotion is thinner. What happened!!!?</li>
    <li> First, let me point out that this bottle is HUGE.  I know it says 32 oz right in the description, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine just how big it is until you get it.  So it&#x27;s a very good value.  Additionally, I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m cautious about what I use.  This has given me no issues whatsoever, and I use it liberally on my legs, arms, and torso.  I also love the fact that Queen Helene is a brand that doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  Last, it smells just wonderful.  When you put it on, it just smells so sweet and pretty, but it&#x27;s not overpowering and the scent fades so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re overly scented all day.</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate. Dries quickly, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the more oily brands. Have to apply almost daily to prevent the dry skin sensation. Will not buy again, there are better products.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for the price</li>
    <li> Very good price,i have combination skin,very good on normal too oily skin in my opinion,just okay on dry parts .I will buy again</li>
    <li> Feels like water and does not moisturize at all.</li>
    <li> Hmm it smells so damn good. #Flawless</li>
    <li> Omg ok...I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write any kind of reviews but this product is beyond amazing! I have a very dry skin and have used almost every kind of drugstore lotion. My friend recommended queen helene&#x27;s lotion and I am so in love! It is under $5 and works amazing! My skin is buttery soft! The product is not greasy at all and has a faint cocoa butter smell...which is nice cause then you can wear a perfume or body spray with it and it won&#x27;t compete. I&#x27;m telling you have to try this product. It works so well and I will be using this lotion until the day I die! I am sold for life lol. Anyway I&#x27;d give it a six star if it was abavilable!</li>
    <li> Been using this for practically my entire life. I am finally back to using it after a 10 year stint of trying other products. The main reason I decided to get this again was because I needed something that was cocoa based, easy to push out the bottle, and could have just enough product to last me awhile. This fits the bill. I use this with cocoa butter oil and vaseline for ultimate moisture and protection and it really does a great job of soothing and softening my skin, toning it (albeit slowly), and providing the moisture that my skin needs. I don&#x27;t believe this should be used by itself. It has never worked too well for me on it&#x27;s own. But mixed with the aforementioned products, it does wonders.</li>
    <li> Eh. Super liquidy and smells a little odd. It takes forever to sink into your skin. Not my favorite, but I&#x27;ve used up about half the bottle so can&#x27;t be that bad! I put it into a empty hand soap container with the pump and keep it by my kitchen sink after I&#x27;m done doing dishes as a hand lotion.</li>
    <li> felt real good on my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion, but I wish it had a pump.  It is heavy to lift.</li>
    <li> I picked up a 2oz tube of this stuff on a whim, and quickly discovered it worked even better than many expensive lotions I&#x27;ve bought. It absorbs quickly, works really well, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I have a big problem with dry hands and this really helped. The only drawback is the smell, which has a suntan-lotion sort of undertone. Otherwise this product is great.</li>
    <li> Great Product. My skin is noticeably softer and smoother and it smells great. I use it all over my body and a little goes a long way. I just wish it came with a pump, It can be difficult to lift the container when your hands are covered in lotions. The price can not be beat, Before purchasing this I bought the Palmer&#x27;s brand, I paid 3 times more and got 4 times less.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll never need another one. Each one lasts me a whole semester at college. Its kinda amazing.&lt;br /&gt;For the most ashy ppl out there like me.</li>
    <li> Great price. Some Walmart&#x27;s carry it for around $2, but it&#x27;s easier to order from amazon for $3. Especially if you have Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always receive compliments when wearing this. The smell lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat worried about the ingredients. Especially when applying it to most of your body. Oh well, it smells and feels good.</li>
    <li> Me and my husband love it! Great price too!</li>
    <li> Very good price and nice smell</li>
    <li> This is really inexpensive so I ordered it for our business. Unfortunately it has an unappealing medicinal smell.  It was so overwhelmingly chemically I had to wash it off my arms and it gave me a little bit of a headache. One of the bottles also arrived open.  These smelled so bad that no one in the office would use them and I had to throw both of them away.  Something is wrong, I suspect the positive reviews on here might be fake.</li>
    <li> Lotion is lotion, it smells like cocoa butter, it works like a moisturizer. My only complaint would be that it is a little more liquidy than I would like, but other than that it works fine, no (additional) complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It has lasted a long time because it&#x27;s large. It is thin and a tad watery but my skin feels so soft after.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I used it throughout my pregnancy, and got no stretch marks. I use it every day, and my two year old daughter even uses it (it is sensitive enough for her skin, too!). The big bottle is great also because I can use as much as I want and it lasts a long time. It smells good, too! I am obsessed with this lotion.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve always used this lotion. ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE SMELL! not too greasy, and not too watery. perfect consistency to feel moisturized. this has been my go-to everyday lotion for years.</li>
    <li> Great for my legs, it makes my skin very soft. Although it came bursting and spilling onto the plastic and I lost a bit of it, it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Queen Helene isn&#x27;t just the best cocoa butter lotion, it is also the best price/deal on cocoa butter. There are lot of other ones out there that are called &#x27;cocoa butter&#x27; but they&#x27;re mostly other ingredients. If you can&#x27;t find it in a store nearby, it&#x27;s worth ordering it on here. I made the mistake of trying out substitutes plenty of times, and it was always a disappointment. Learn from my mistakes lol :)</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD SUMMER LOTION BECAUSE IT IS LIGHT BUT NOT GOOD FOR WINTER DRYNESS.SO I AM NOT A FAN OF THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I saw this lotion at Wal-Mart and while I had never heard of the brand (I&#x27;m not a big lotion person), I decided to give it a try. At $1.88, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt. And let me just say, I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a chance! It makes my skin softer and smells good, too. But it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell, either, like most lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Plus it comes in a big bottle, so it will last me for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it will do with extremely dry skin, but for me it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> My only downside is it&#x27;s runnier than expected, sometimes I forget and pour it all over.  This absorbs nicely and has a good texture, very moisturizing.  I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t take quite enough lotion to hot dry Las Vegas and had to pick some up at a Walgreens on the Strip, otherwise I&#x27;d have missed this little gem all together!</li>
    <li> Just received a bottle of this and it smells like burnt chemicals. I looked at the ingredients and they&#x27;re awful. I don&#x27;t know if the smell is from the ingredients or the plastic bottle but I&#x27;m throwing it out. I only bought it because it was on sale for a few dollars. Time to look for something more natural with cocoa butter in it.</li>
    <li> Great price, coconut smell. Good for skin.</li>
    <li> 32oz of lotion at this price?! I&#x27;m sold. Great for all applications like moisturizing and other &amp;#34;things.&amp;#34; Hell, with 32oz, you could rub this stuff all over your body. And it does have a faint chocolately smell to it (It is Cocoa butter after all).</li>
    <li> I have tried a myriad of different lotions but this one I love!  It goes on easy and soaks right in, it hydrates my skin all day long &amp; I don&#x27;t reapply it until just before bed.  This is great right after the shower, after being in the sun or anytime.  I have used this lotion for years &amp; I won&#x27;t switch!  It is an excellent product &amp; the price is right too! Plus Queen Helene DOES NOT TEST ON ANIMALS &amp; that is another reason why I like not only this product, but the company that makes it as well.  This is DEFINITELY A 5 STAR PRODUCT!! :)</li>
    <li> i love the smell and live the skin very soft</li>
    <li> Great smell, feels awesome</li>
    <li> I bought the large 32 oz bottle for under $3 at a department store, so it was a good bargain overall. But it doesn&#x27;t provide lasting hydration for my extra dry skin. The transition to cold weather was extra brutal on my arms and legs this year and Queen Helene&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion did little to combat the dryness and peeling. I&#x27;ll use it in a pinch when I run out of my preferred moisturizer - but I constantly have to reapply and that&#x27;s a big no-no for me. Love the smell, love the price - but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Use this through two pregnancies and no stretch marks! Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin hasn&#x27;t been dry at all. The only downsize is it seems very thin which makes me feel as if they water it down, and the smell is awful. When I first sniffed it from the bottle it seemed to smell like coconut but as I put it on the coconut smell was completely overwhelmed by a kind of vasaline type smell. Overall It just wasn&#x27;t what I expected so therefore I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Queen Helene makes the greatest cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever used. Palmer&#x27;s might be more popular, but it does not compare.</li>
    <li> Pretty good lotion, Not the best moisturizer because a bit thin and watery, I do like the coconut smell though</li>
    <li> I love this cocoa butter. It is mild enough to use on my face and everywhere else on my body. Not to mention you get loads of it for such a great price. Will buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion. I use it daily.  And very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Smells great, good price, and makes skin so smooth. But the cap is so inconvenient. I wish it had a pump instead of a cap.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s light, smells amazing, and a little goes a long way so this will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> Good product for price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past, and one of the things that I appreciated about it is the fact that you get a lot of product for your buck. I also like the smell of cocoa butter lotion and have gotten compliments on the smell. I am one who is not super sensitive to scents, but this isn&#x27;t one that I think contains a heavy or overbearing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it never worked to my full satisfaction. I have dry skin, and I&#x27;ve had skin issues so whenever I look for lotion, I want one that will definitely moisturize and absorb well into my skin. Whenever I applied this, I still felt as if my skin was dry after application, so I would increase the amount and at times apply petroleum jelly or Vaseline along with it, so I would not have that constant dry feeling or appearance. This definitely works for some (I have seen my mother use this I believe, but I am not sure if she still uses it), and it definitely is a known brand/product, but with my skin issues and expectations, it did not fulfill what I needed.</li>
    <li> The lotion works well but it&#x27;s first ingredient is water, unlike the description which only lists cocoa butter as an ingredient.</li>
    <li> This is my go to body lotion, especially in the summer because it smells so good.  I was glad that Amazon was selling it at the best price I coud find, and in the larger size bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it just a good cream for my kind of skin, the only minus is that it leaved the skin dry after few minutes, this is not good for those with dry skin type.</li>
    <li> This product is great for the price, however, it feels very much like water going on and within just a few minutes, there feels the need to reapply.  However, I have been using this with 100% shea butter, and it helps get rid of the stickiness from the Shea butter.</li>
    <li> A whole bunch of lotion at a really good price</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. As other reviewers have said, it smells great, doesn&#x27;t make skin feel greasy, and the price is excellent. The smell is great and not too strong. I use it after shaving so my legs stay soft and don&#x27;t get itchy. Keep in mind that it is not as viscous as some other lotions, so be careful not to pour out too much by accident.</li>
    <li> I got 3 bottles (one for each bathroom) because of the size , price and because I really like cocoa butter lotion. However once I got it home and used it I was very disappointed. It has the consistency of water. Imagine putting water into your hand and trying to rub it into your skin without it dripping everywhere. Its a mess and a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Cheapest I found on Amazon. Decent quality.</li>
    <li> Compared to Palmers this Cocoa Butter lotion is awful! It&#x27;s very runny and thin. I felt like I needed to keep applying it through out the day to stay moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great as an after shower body cream. Light and not at all greasy. Smells like chocolate, so it&#x27;s a win win.</li>
    <li> For such little money...you get a lot of product!  This bottle will last me a very long time.  I know not everyone is a fan of the smell, but I rather like it.  I do love the way my skin feels after it&#x27;s on!</li>
    <li> My skin is in heaven.  It&#x27;s a little greasy but it soaks into the skin in a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. Has a mild Coconut smell that reminds me of the islands, and goes on smooth and glides easily. Love it! My one complaint is the price here on Amazon seems high at $3.29 when I&#x27;ve seen it at Walmart for $1.97, but still... all that amazing healing lotion for $3? How can you go wrong?!! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Works great keeps my skin soft longer for a fraction of the cost of more expensive lotions ive used, will keep this subscribed</li>
    <li> For the price and the amount of lotion you get, this is a good buy.  This lotion won&#x27;t heal extremely dry skin in one usage.  I live in Chicago, and we obviously have terribly cold winters here.  This stuff does s pretty good job at keeping my skin moisturized.  Is it perfect, no.  But the bottle is HUGE!  The scent is nice too - makes me think of summer, which is always a plus in the midst of a cold winter.  Overall, I&#x27;d call this a good buy for someone looking for a economic bottle of lotion that does it&#x27;s job at a B level.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying and while noticing a few stated there was something off with the smell, most were 5 stars. I wish I had payed attention to the 1 star reviews instead. It does have a horrible smell...hard to describe, kind of a plastic, chemical, gasoline type smell. I bought two bottles and both have the same scent; they&#x27;ll both be going in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not greasy and absorbs quickly, however I&#x27;ve had to reapply during the day as it doesn&#x27;t moisturize well enough for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a couple of years now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I LOVE it...&lt;br /&gt;1) Lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;2) Smells great&lt;br /&gt;3) Isn&#x27;t to thick&lt;br /&gt;4) Super cheap&lt;br /&gt;5) Makes my skin so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT regret your purchase!</li>
