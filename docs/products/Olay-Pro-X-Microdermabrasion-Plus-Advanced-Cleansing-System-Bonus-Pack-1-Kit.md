    <li> It works fine. The microdermabrasion pad seems to get caught in my hair or eyebrows more than it clears out my pores, but the other brush works nicely.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of comparison shopping before I purchased this product.  A lot of people were going for the Clairesonic but why?  This does everything its supposed to which is cleanse your face using a spin brush.  If used this the correct facial products it works amazing!  I reduced the blackheads that most people, myself included, get on your nose and is amazing as a full face scrubbing device.  I have had no issues and does not eat up my batteries.  Im still working with the original brushes and buffers that came with the device.  Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, provides quick results, multi-functional</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, bought it and less than a month later it broke! This is my second one, already purchased one and figured it was maybe a bad one but realized they just break. Would return it but can&#x27;t since it&#x27;s been used and I threw the box away. Such a disappointment!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Much nicer than my previous model.  I especially like that it has 3 speeds.  This was the best price I found both on and off line.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not seeing much improvement as described. Also the brush for cleansing is a bit harsh for soft skin.</li>
    <li> My face looks brighter and smoother since i started using it weekly.</li>
    <li> I bought this Cleansing system after many reviews and comparison among another cleansing systems. I have to say i made great choice. Not only did it came fast but it came packages just great. Plus you get an added bonus. I used the Microdermabrasion plus advance cleansing system right away. I loved how it left my skin soft, clean. The exfoliating cream is great, it has smaller particles that don&#x27;t feel like sand on the skin. It does a great job. I have not used polisher yet, because i thew it out with the box by mistake. It really feels like mini facial every time i use it. It relaxes you and does probably similar job that you could do in salon for less money. I have never done treatments in salon as i am very picky and don&#x27;t allow just anybody to mess with my face or hair. So this is great i can do it on my own.Being i late 20s i can start to see changes in my skin, i get pimples from time to time, so this helps decrease the occurrence, as well decreases pores/blackheads. At the same time it leaves my skin glowing especially when i put lotion that cam as a bonus . :) I would definitely recommend this seller as well as product. I am thinking of getting one for my mom, i think she would love it.</li>
    <li> This product works great for my husband who is the one who uses it.</li>
    <li> Great product, bonus face  lotion was a great surprise since I ran out a couple weeks later.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t magically make you younger like we all wish, but it cleans and smooths your skin giving it a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> It works great! Easy to use! and handy you could take it everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;my skin never looked better!</li>
    <li> I have only used the brush part so far but will be polishing tonight and I can really see a difference in the way my face feels and when I look at it I seem to have a glowing effect in the color. I am excited to polish it tonight. Well I have used both the brush and the polishing head now and I love it. Not sure how I did without it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and more!</li>
    <li> I used to have the original Olay cleansing system that only had the 2 speeds and one brush head. I must say that the 3rd speed is a much needed improvement, this really makes my face feel clean. The thermal microdermabrasion cleanser, warms up and feels really nice. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>

I use clean and clear&#x27;s foaming cleanser instead and that works excellent with this system.  The brushes wear out pretty fast so you may want to buy replacements up front or look for generic ones at your local drugstore.  But all in all, this has made a big difference in my skin!!  I am glad I bought it, but also glad I didn&#x27;t buy the $100 one out there on the market.</li>
    <li> This cleansing system is very good.  I would like to see more attachments with this product in addition to the cleansing brush.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with the product, it works really well.  I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this.  I use the microdermabrasion about twice a month.. and I use the cleansing every other day!  Definitely would recommend this product.  Does as well as the microdermabrasion you get from going to a spa..</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother for her birthday-she is thrilled with it</li>
    <li> Love it makes my skin feel cleaner and smoother</li>
