<li> your skin is soft and it does not smell.</li>
<li> after using 1 month, didn&#x27;t see any improvement so far.</li>

<li> Ok for scars, but for face better off with simple almond oil or something similar and less expensive</li>
<li> a 48 yrs old female.  </li>
<li> Recently had unexpected open heart surgery</li>
<li> It has gotten rid of some of my previous scarring and so far in my pregnancy have not gotten any scars!</li>
<li> Although you have to use it for a long time.</li>
<li> The scar is flat and the pink part is covered when I wear foundation.</li>
<li> And, as a result of the chemotherapeutic agent that I am taking, I also use this for dry skin elsewhere.</li>
<li> After the wound healed, I did have a raised scar that makeup just partially covered.  </li>
<li> I saw this product on Amazon for scars and did not really believe it would make a differnce</li>
<li> Only takes a few drops to hydrate thirsty skin.</li>
<li> However, after using 1 month, nothing improved:( and I got more strech</li>
<li> Not sure why the packaging reads take only for 3 months.  </li>
<li> As for fading dark spots and stretch marks, both of which I have, I have to rate it one star.</li>
<li> This is great, I had a bad accident and started using it as I had a bad and large scare on my forehead, it is cutting down the scar as I still use it and now find it will heal other things that come on my face and arms</li>
<li> i use it everyday.</li>
<li> So sad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> am not buying again.i have used this for years but my stretch marks is still the same.</li>
    <li> Although you have to use it for a long time. You can see the difference within a week of use.</li>
    <li> My daughters love it! They have had acne for awhile and this has helped them a lot. They also love the smell:)</li>
    <li> I saw the review is pretty good and I ordered this one. it is supposed to ship in 18-26 business days, however, it come much faster and I am so excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to have strech mark from 8 months pregnancy and I thought this will help. I used twice daily and I really wanted so see some improvement. However, after using 1 month, nothing improved:( and I got more strech mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor told me nothing will help with prenancy strech mark, I belevied this product however. I also use this for my scar on my arm. after using 1 month, didn&#x27;t see any improvement so far. It is saying use it for 2 months. I will continue using it and come back with more reviews if any improvement. I finished one bottle already.</li>
    <li> great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> This oil is great.... i use it nightly, using about three to five drops, it sort of sits on the skin, but after about 15 minutes it is absorbed. It is great for problem areas, moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and only need to use very small amount.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. VERY good at reducing scaring after surgery.</li>
    <li> I found Miracle oil and hemp oil to be a bit more benificial. If it works for you! By all means go for it.</li>
    <li> Item came as described</li>
    <li> Lol it&#x27;s been nine months and I gotta say it worked.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Not sure why the packaging reads take only for 3 months.  Will definitely order the bio oil again.</li>
    <li> I use this on mastectomy scars, and it smells good, and feels good!  And, as a result of the chemotherapeutic agent that I am taking, I also use this for dry skin elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Recently had unexpected open heart surgery&lt;br /&gt;Im a 48 yrs old female.  Doctors told me to use Bio Oil to help with my scars...5 months into post surgery and my scars are looking and getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;I also rub it on my face as well.  Its a GREAT product....THANK YOU BIO OIL!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon  for carrying  it...going out shopping was something  i could not do...</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month but haven&#x27;t seen any changes. It&#x27;s too oily for me and I feel like it clogs my pores from time to time. So sad. It is recommended by all kinds of magazines.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent. But raised my blood pressure. Essentual oil of rosemary can do this so use with caution. Headache started shortly after using. Took pressure it was high. So I no longer use it. Wonderful scent though.</li>
    <li> I have used Bio-Oil for years.  Excellent price here on Amazon.  I use it for scars, facial moisturizer and stretch marks.  Works wonders and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, slimy feel.  Absorbs really well.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It has a really nice scent.  Ok for scars, but for face better off with simple almond oil or something similar and less expensive</li>
    <li> Very nice. I even used it on my face.</li>
    <li> This is great, I had a bad accident and started using it as I had a bad and large scare on my forehead, it is cutting down the scar as I still use it and now find it will heal other things that come on my face and arms, this is great stuff, everyone should keep it around as I have found it does more than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my face for a couple of years and notice a great improvement in my skin&#x27;s condition.</li>
    <li> Best product! I will buy IT again your skin is soft and it does not smell. I recommended it&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I had a basel cell carcinoma removed from my face that the dermatolgist said &amp;#34; had roots&amp;#34;, not what one wants to hear. The dermatolgist warned me I would have  a scar that makeup would not cover. I saw this product on Amazon for scars and did not really believe it would make a differnce but I wanted to do something. After the wound healed, I did have a raised scar that makeup just partially covered.  I will never know what would have been the resulting scar if I had not used Bio Oil. I used it about 4 weeks. The scar is flat and the pink part is covered when I wear foundation. Now if it would take away my wrinkles.... .</li>
    <li> Love this product. Only takes a few drops to hydrate thirsty skin. Don&#x27;t know how it works for others, but my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; woman&#x27;s complexion is better and smoother looking since using this product after a bath, or shower, for the past couple of years. I add one squirt to bath water and my skin feels silky and soft; not oily! As for fading dark spots and stretch marks, both of which I have, I have to rate it one star. My abdomen, where I have the stretch marks, is smoother and silkier feeling, but the deep marks are still there.</li>
    <li> smells good. I don&#x27;t see much change in the scars yet.</li>
    <li> i just love the bio oil works good for me.i will surely love to recommend it to everybody..i use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It is working quite well.  I have already placed another order.  great product.  Smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased. Working on my scar!</li>
    <li> This product is awsome! Have used 3 bottles, skin is smoother... Good for uneven tone, stretch marks... Use it all over including face and did not break out from it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff although I go through it pretty fast it works awesome! It has gotten rid of some of my previous scarring and so far in my pregnancy have not gotten any scars!</li>
