      <li>Everyone is right</li>
      <li>I found the eco refill idea very smart and saved me a lot.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great deal and if you have a perfume bottle already, you don&#x27;t need to buy the large, more expensive bottle.</li>

      <li>The color should be a shade of light pink.</li>
      <li>This refill lasts just as long as the original perfume that came in the bottle, and is more eco-friendly in that there&#x27;s less waste by refilling the original spray bottle.  </li>

      <li>This was almost yellow, which, according to a my friend who sells perfume this indicates that it is old.</li>
      <li>It is definitely old and not the same quality.  </li>

    <li> Great price for this item.  Why pay department store prices when you can order through Amazon.com and get the exact same item for less than half.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  Love the fragrance, but wouldn&#x27;t have expected anything less from Thierry Mugler.</li>
    <li> Does not smell exactly like bottle purchased from department store.</li>
    <li> I have been a Thierry Mugler customer since the 90&#x27;s for Angel.  I received a small sample bottle from the company of Womanity.  People kept asking what I had on, so I decided to search Amazon for a reasonably priced refill for my bottle.  Very satisfied with the product and can refill my small bottle for some time to come.  Very light and beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> The color of Womanity is pink. This was almost yellow, which, according to a my friend who sells perfume this indicates that it is old. This weakens the scent of the fragrance. I don&#x27;t care about the color, just the scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a yellow color, meaning it&#x27;s OLD!!!</li>
    <li> My wife (&amp; I) loves this! Always gets great comments &amp; inquiries on what fragrance she&#x27;s wearing. Eco friendly refill for the original bottle purchased &#x3D; $$ saved. (funnel included doesn&#x27;t work so good.)</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t even want to give them a star. I tried contacting the seller so I could return this. Never heard back from them.I am very disappointed I wear this perfume all the time and when I received this bottle the color was yellow. The color should be a shade of light pink. It was OLD and didn&#x27;t have any smell. HORRIBLE. I GOT RIPPED OFF.</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance. It is not to sweet and not overpowering. I just enjoy wearing this for all occassions</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this.  Other reviewers had said it was sometimes the wrong color indicating it is old, but I love the fragrance so much I was willing to try since I cannot get it at my Nordstroms anymore.  I won&#x27;t buy it again from here.  It is definitely old and not the same quality.  Doubt the company is aware since it was in a sealed container.</li>
    <li> It is great that you can refill the beautiful bottles from Thierry Muggler, thie beautiful fig based scent always gets compliments</li>
    <li> When the product came I immediately new it wasn&#x27;t Womanity it looks like pee and smells horribly. My Womanity would stay on forever the smell was gone before I closed the bottle. I wish I didn&#x27;t throw the box away so I could return it I will never buy from this company again.  Everyone is right the perfume is a light pink color.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome,&lt;br /&gt;I am using this perfume for long time and never buy a refil before, i tryed now and i will continue to buy it, cause it is cheaper and smells fantastic as always. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It was my Christmas gift for my girlfriend and it has been her favorite since. I found the eco refill idea very smart and saved me a lot.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this perfume.......</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great deal and if you have a perfume bottle already, you don&#x27;t need to buy the large, more expensive bottle.</li>
    <li> The scent is fabulous, and now that I&#x27;ve got both my mother, an aunt and myself hooked on it, I needed a more economical way for our family to indulge in this perfume.  This refill lasts just as long as the original perfume that came in the bottle, and is more eco-friendly in that there&#x27;s less waste by refilling the original spray bottle.  This is on a &amp;#34;frequent shop&amp;#34; list in our familiy!</li>
    <li> I got a yellow colored perfume but the fragrance is just the same. Its awesome.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t care about the discrepancy in color if it actually smelled like Womanity.  I completely agree with the other poster who compared it to rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> It arrived fast and my cousin was thrilled to get it for her birthday! Happy Birthday to you! And many more!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right color.  Should be a pretty pink and this was apple juice color and smelled like alcohol.  Didn&#x27;t smell like the womanity I&#x27;ve always gotten.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. I am frequently told I smell really good!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this perfume when I was in Puerto Rico 3 yrs ago at the airport. I fell in Love with it and have been ordering it ever since. The bottles for the perfume are refillable so all you need is a refill. It has a wonderful soft fragrance and I always get compliments when I wear it. Thank you Amazon for keeping it in stock.</li>
    <li> The perfume has turned yellow from the original light pink color and that is a sign the perfume is old.</li>
    <li> The product was not pink as intended for the North American buyer, but was absolutely authentic as I registered at the Mugler Circle without issue. GREAT price for the product! (Cuz, you know, people can totally -see- that the perfume isn&#x27;t pink, right?)</li>
    <li> I love this perfum and I am so glad that you carry it on line or I would have to drive 163 miles to get it!!!</li>
