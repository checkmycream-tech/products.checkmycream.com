      <li>I don&#x27;t know if they really smooth my hair....</li>
      <li>and it helps smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really a smooth comb.</li>
      <li>A wonderful comb, not sure about the infusion part</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite comb.</li>
      <li>Works great on my extremely unruly hair.</li>
      <li>What a great idea to infuse argan oil and other oils into the comb.</li>
      <li>Nice comb for general hair use.  </li>
      <li>they hand you in line at elementary school during picture day.</li>
      <li>The price was right.  </li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>But, you have to have a comb, so why not have a pretty one with benefits?</li>
      <li>Wanted to stop using a brush that I felt was making me shed more hair than necessary.</li>
      <li>Great product for thick dry/colored hair.</li>
      <li>After my first purchase, I bought an additional comb.</li>
      <li>and I use the detangler first</li>
      <li>How can I complain when it&#x27;s prevented so many days from being potentially &amp;#34;bad hair days?&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I am going to purchase a few more!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very durable, and</li>
      <li>gentle on scalp &amp; hair</li>
      <li>Really like them and people have noticed that my hair looks softer.</li>
      <li>I have to be very picky about combs.</li>
      <li>It also works really well when used to follow your straightener.</li>

      <li>Good thick comb that does not make hair oily.</li>

      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new</li>
      <li>but this is my new fav.</li>
      <li>It is very soft indeed.</li>
      <li>but I will say the first time I used it my normally coarse hair felt softer.</li>
      <li>I find myself using this comb the most of the three, since it is simple, snag-free as long as I am gentle, and safe for combing my wet hair carefully so it will not dry tangled.</li>
      <li>I recommend using this comb on the mid length to ends of hair (I have medium to long fine hair).  </li>
      <li>My daughter has straight thick strong hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
      <li>and maybe I need to use more to make it less sharp.</li>
      <li>I will run this through her hair after she brushes with her other bush to give a little more neatness and sheen to her hair.</li>
      <li>Love the way it glides through my very thick hair.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair, you will know what I mean.  </li>
      <li>but I live in a very dry area</li>
      <li>combs through my thin hair that tangles and knots easily.</li>
      <li>If I wake up in the morning with my hair a little frizzy or having lost the style I had the day before, it really eliminates the frizzies and puts your style back in place!</li>

<li> Dreadful comb...</li>

    <li> Dreadful comb... The hair gets caught in the flimsy plastic and it pulls!  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> The comb is perfect for my hair. Before I was using one of those tiny black throw away combs they hand you in line at elementary school during picture day. This is a definite upgrade. Although, I&#x27;m not sure I understand the infusion portion of the comb. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair just due to combing. It was the best price point for a comb of this size, so the infusion was not a selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white lettering does wipe off when you wet it, but so far, after a few weeks, I haven&#x27;t had any teeth fall out of the comb.</li>
    <li> It is slightly bigger than I thought.  It works ok but I think the Pro 30 is smoother when I comb my hair.  I had that one for years and it broke when I dropped it one time.  I wanted to try something new and so I bought this one but turned out I like the Pro 30 better.  The teeth are a little bit sharp in compare to the Pro30 and maybe I need to use more to make it less sharp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine wide-tooth comb.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite comb. Love the way it glides through my very thick hair. I usually break any comb that I ty to use but this one is indestructible.  I love it &amp; plan to order a few more, &amp; will definitely get some to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> A wonderful comb, not sure about the infusion part but I live in a very dry area and I do not get static when using this comb. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just love the way these combs look and feel....I have the big detangler and this one.  Smooth and elegant looking....I don&#x27;t know if they really smooth my hair....but I&#x27;m thinking they do, and I believe I can tell a little improvement of the dryness.  But, you have to have a comb, so why not have a pretty one with benefits?</li>
    <li> I have to be very picky about combs. I have very fine hair that tends to frizz easily. After my first purchase, I bought an additional comb. I would like to have three of these combs (at least!) One to carry with me, one for home, one for my desk at work. I like to walk in the mornings, and this sometimes leaves my hair a mess! This comb truly (strangely!) actually seems to smooth my hair and it does seem to add shine. How can I complain when it&#x27;s prevented so many days from being potentially &amp;#34;bad hair days?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this comb. Works great on my extremely unruly hair.</li>
    <li> I am trying to improve the health of my long, thick hair, and have traded in my old plastic ball-tip flat brush for this comb, a detangling comb, and a boar-bristle brush.

    <li> Love the quality of this comb</li>
    <li> Nice comb for general hair use.  The price was right.  I was pleasantly pleased with this comb.  Argan oil is supposed to be good for your hair - so what a great oil.  Argan oil in the comb.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Not too brittle, not too flexible. Just right.</li>
    <li> a comb infused with oil? I must have been ummm confused. It&#x27;s a comb, yes. The teeth are actually a bit narrow and do not assist with detangling. If the teeth were fatter and wider it would actually be a very nice comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;save your money.</li>
    <li> This comb is sturdy and great for detangling!</li>
    <li> This comb works as advertised.  If I wake up in the morning with my hair a little frizzy or having lost the style I had the day before, it really eliminates the frizzies and puts your style back in place!</li>
    <li> I love that this comb is infused with oils. I do oil treatments on my hair sometimes, but when I don&#x27;t this comb already has it infused and it helps smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very durable, and combs through my thin hair that tangles and knots easily. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT comb!  I use it to comb out my hair when I get out of the shower and after my husband used it he asked me to order him his own.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this and a regular comb.</li>
    <li> Combs through my hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I have this comb and the big detangler comb also. Love them both. Wanted to stop using a brush that I felt was making me shed more hair than necessary. I have very fine, thin hair and I use the detangler first and then this comb. Really like them and people have noticed that my hair looks softer. I have traveled with them several times now and the teeth have held up every time. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product for thick dry/colored hair. It does not damage your hair and goes through split ends without creating further damage. It also works really well when used to follow your straightener.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and dry hair.  Despite using conditioner and leave in products, I could never get a comb through my hair until I tried this comb.  It smooths my hair beautifully and adds extra moisture.  I will continue to use and purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love the comb!!  What a great idea to infuse argan oil and other oils into the comb. I am going to purchase a few more!</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb after seeing it in groupon. I was ordering some stuff off amazon anyways. Now I see what all the hype is about. It is very soft indeed. i have no idea if the olive oil stuff works but it was so soft to use compared to my other Conair detangling comb, i&#x27;m just gonna prefer using this. AND I have more motivation now not to go to work as a homeless person and comb my hair without pain.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick Indian wavy hair. All combs i have used to date used to pull at my hair. this doesnt.</li>
    <li> Really a smooth comb. gentle on scalp &amp; hair</li>
    <li> I have 4b type hair.  I bought this comb for daily styling.  I can&#x27;t tell if it has argan oil in it, it does snag my hair a little.  I prob won&#x27;t be purchasing this again bc I think the teeth are to small for my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> This comb is wonderful for smoothing flyaway strands of hair.  It is my go-to comb when my hair is affected by static and weather.  I recommend using this comb on the mid length to ends of hair (I have medium to long fine hair).  If one uses it on the crown there is a risk of flattening any desirable volume.  If you have fine hair, you will know what I mean.  This comb is also good at untangling hair and will slide through your locks with ease!</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job.  What can I say?</li>
    <li> I use it for my beard on occation.  Feels awesome to use and gives my beard a nice shine to it, which surprisingly I&#x27;m digging.</li>
    <li> So nice and feels so good and healthy on my scalp&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t accumulate dirt in the middle&lt;br /&gt;Thats what I like about this comb</li>
    <li> My daughter has straight thick strong hair.  This comb has really helped her sort out the tangles on her own and give her very straight hair a nice neat sheen.  My other daughter has wavy thinner brittle hair.  I will run this through her hair after she brushes with her other bush to give a little more neatness and sheen to her hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb. Good thick comb that does not make hair oily. I had a lot of comb but this is my new fav.</li>
    <li> It is quite large (I should have paid attention to the measurements), but my main complain is the teeth are too far apart.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this a lot yet but I will say the first time I used it my normally coarse hair felt softer. I&#x27;m keeping it in the plastic pouch because I am trying to preserve the infused oils but this is a nice comb regardless.</li>
    <li> This comb is sturdy, the teeth don&#x27;t snap off even when going through tough knots.  If the teeth were a little closer together it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this comb, great for parting hair and helps me with all sorts of styles!</li>
