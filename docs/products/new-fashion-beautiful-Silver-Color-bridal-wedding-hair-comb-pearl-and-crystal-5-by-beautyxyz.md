      <li>Fast shipping, which is always a great thing!</li>
      <li>It arrived and looked even better in person, love it!</li>
      <li>It was exactly as pictured and gorgeous!</li>
      <li>Received this hair comb very quickly!</li>
      <li>It looked great with my grandmother&#x27;s pearl necklace, and everyone had positive comments about it.</li>
      <li>but it is meant as a top comb, not a side sweep.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>this looked so much better in person</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear any of them.</li>
      <li>It is better than the picture.  </li>
      <li>Could not be any more excited to wear this on my wedding day!</li>
      <li>Luckily, the item itself is so nice looking</li>
      <li>The picture shown is very true to what it looks like and the pearls are a light ivory color which is just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>arrived safely and very pretty</li>
      <li>Truly the right touch for me!</li>
      <li>Really, really beautiful and much higher quality than I expected for the price.</li>
      <li>And it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Very pretty</li>
      <li>This was so pretty!</li>
      <li>They denied my request, which was within their right, but a company that cares about customer satisfaction would have allowed me to return it anyway.</li>
      <li>It was so sturdy that we couldn&#x27;t even bend it to look right.</li>
      <li>Beautiful and very sturdy and heavy.</li>
      <li>I received the item in the appropriate shipping window and it was packed with cushioning but it still wasn&#x27;t quite enough as one of the faux pearls was rolling around in the bag.</li>
      <li>I really won&#x27;t have an occasion to wear it again!</li>
      <li>its un real.</li>
      <li>I will probably still use it and just super glue the jewel back on.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>These clips are made to last, if you care for them nicely you can pass them down.</li>
      <li>If you have long, then you&#x27;re looking in the right place.</li>
      <li>A bit heavy but with some hairspray it stayed just fine.</li>
      <li>Stones were clear, not yellowed.</li>
      <li>It looks like it is worth at least twice as much as I paid !</li>
      <li>It is cheaply made, with stones misaligned, and especially the metal swirls, which is very shiny in the pictures, so it hides how rough and uneven they are.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> arrived safely and very pretty</li>
    <li> I bought this comb to make a wedding veil for my eldest daughters wedding in June.  It was such a hit that I ordered a second comb for a veil for my others daughters wedding in October.  I have a much younger third daughter that I might order one for so that all three can have matching wedding combs. It&#x27;s a beautiful wedding accessory!</li>
    <li> Great quality . Stunning !!</li>
    <li> Perfect hair accessory for a fancy dress...</li>
    <li> This was so pretty! It photographed well, all pieces (rhinestones and pearls) stayed in place. It was a good size so it was noticeable even under my veil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to wear for my wedding. It looked great with my grandmother&#x27;s pearl necklace, and everyone had positive comments about it. The best part was the price! A fraction of the cost of a hairpiece you would buy at a bridal salon!</li>
    <li> This item arrived, and it was not the quality I had imagined from the pictures. It is cheaply made, with stones misaligned, and especially the metal swirls, which is very shiny in the pictures, so it hides how rough and uneven they are. I was purchasing this as a hair piece for my wedding, but there is no way that I will wear this. I set it aside and forgot about it, and requested a return, after the return period expired. They denied my request, which was within their right, but a company that cares about customer satisfaction would have allowed me to return it anyway. I&#x27;m never buying from this company again, and you shouldn&#x27;t either. I will post photos of the details.</li>
    <li> I received the item in the appropriate shipping window and it was packed with cushioning but it still wasn&#x27;t quite enough as one of the faux pearls was rolling around in the bag. Luckily, the item itself is so nice looking I will probably still use it and just super glue the jewel back on.</li>
    <li> GORGEOUS. I wore this on my wedding day and it did not disappoint! The picture shown is very true to what it looks like and the pearls are a light ivory color which is just what I wanted. It looks like it is worth at least twice as much as I paid !</li>
    <li> This was beautiful. Stones were clear, not yellowed. It was a little heavy, but my daughters hair is really thick so it held great.</li>
    <li> It is better than the picture.  I cam t believe how cheap it was on here !!  Will be beautiful on my wedding day</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous! Very happy!</li>
    <li> The picture of the comb doesn&#x27;t do it justice it is absolutely gorgeous and I cannot wait to wear it on my wedding day!</li>
    <li> I wore this for my wedding!! It was absolutely beautiful!!! I&#x27;m kinda sad I really won&#x27;t have an occasion to wear it again! It was exactly as pictured and gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my wedding day!</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair comb. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it to a wedding!</li>
    <li> It fell apart within a few days of wearing it. It lasted through my wedding (yay!), but during my honeymoon the decorations came unconnected from the metal comb and one of the pearls fell off.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my wedding day.</li>
    <li> Really, really beautiful and much higher quality than I expected for the price. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t lay right in my hair. It was so sturdy that we couldn&#x27;t even bend it to look right.</li>
    <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t do this beautiful comb justice. The comb teeth are well spaced and stays in even short hair well.</li>
    <li> Used this on my wedding day and I was very satisfied with the finished look in my hair. This arrived in a few days and up to and after the wedding all pearls and pieces are still in tact.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and very sturdy and heavy. Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but it is meant as a top comb, not a side sweep. The angle of the teeth is wrong for a side sweep. I bent them myself to accommodate the hairstyle I was going for and two teeth broke off but I may have been a little rough. A bit heavy but with some hairspray it stayed just fine.</li>
    <li> Received this hair comb very quickly! It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful and I am looking forward to wearing it on my wedding day!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  For the price I paid ($18) this is amazing.  I&#x27;ve looked at other accessories like this for my wedding but they are all $50 and over.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> GOD BLESS U&lt;br /&gt;KUDOS TO UR PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP IT U. PLS DON&#x27;T IMITATE PALMBEACH JEWELRY COS THE RING I BOUGHT FROM THEM IS ORIGINAL FAKE PRODUCT THAT IS EVEN HAZARDOUS TO ONES HEALTH</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful in an up do and comes out great in pictures. The image on here does not do it justice. I would highly recommend. It&#x27;s the perfect touch of vintage and romance.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality and matches perfectly. Truly the right touch for me! Fast shipping, which is always a great thing! So glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! This piece is beautiful and perfect. I am shocked at the quality for the price that I paid. The bridal stores wanted $75-$100 for a comb like this. Could not be any more excited to wear this on my wedding day!</li>
    <li> this looked so much better in person its un real. I was really impressed. its very cute n shiny n will call attention to ur hair n add to ur beauty lol</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful! Prompt delivery. Will be a beautiful addition to my mother of the groom dress for my son&#x27;s fall wedding.</li>
    <li> It arrived and looked even better in person, love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair comb for my wedding. It was perfect. Exactly what I needed for my perfect day. Great purchase. And it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful comb!  Compares to those they are trying to sell in the bridal shops for $150.</li>
    <li> Great Buy, Outstanding product, Excellent packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased every hair claw clip  and comb this seller has for purchase. I love them all!!! The quality of the clips are superb. I get so many compliments when I wear any of them. The stones are placed tightly and not cheaply. These clips are made to last, if you care for them nicely you can pass them down. I&#x27;ve shopped in many states and countries, and this seller has the best of the best!!! If you have long, then you&#x27;re looking in the right place. If your hair is short, then you may want to stick to the smaller of his showcase. Either way you go, you will not be disappointed. Again, I have purchased them all and they&#x27;re all beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is excellent!!</li>
