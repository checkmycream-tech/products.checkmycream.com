      <li>I am so pleased with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>and I am glad</li>
      <li>I am buying more of these for sure.</li>
      <li>it got to the top</li>
      <li>I love how well this worked.</li>
      <li>Looks just like the picture, works good, arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>These bottles are perfect for my Loreal True Match and Revlon Naked foundations.</li>
      <li>Works great, easy pump action.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy set up process.</li>
      <li>They are easy to fill if the product is pourable or in a squeeze bottle.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>Since they are plastic, I would be concerned with cracking (although mine were perfectly fine) and have no idea how the customer service would be trying to get refund or replacement.</li>
      <li>but I shook it a couple times between a series of pumps and that pushed the air out really quickly!</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and fill.</li>
      <li>I use it for my foundation that doesn&#x27;t have a pump it works really well and looks nice</li>
      <li>Product does not come out smoothly, it splatters and drops get everywhere.  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much I purchased another for my Rimmel foundation.</li>
      <li>I originally used this with my Revlon Colorstay foundation, but I&#x27;ve now bought another one to use with my Maybelline Fit Me (Matte&amp;Poreless) as well.</li>
      <li>I just move the sticker with product name from original bottle to this.  </li>
      <li>You can also clean and reuse, which I was concerned about.  </li>
      <li>I own several for my liquid cosmetics and skin care products that don&#x27;t come with pumps (i.e. Revlon ColorStay, L&#x27;Oreal True Match, Neutrogena Healthy Skin foundations, etc).</li>
      <li>Great way to get a pump for those foundations or other liquids that have no pump, keeps things clean.</li>
      <li>started out promisingly, because it was clean &amp; easy to pour my foundation in the container and screw on the lid.  </li>
      <li>I just poured it in and for my face lotion I poured it into a plastic bag first, snipped a corner, and then filled the pump because the lotion wasn&#x27;t as runny and needed some help.</li>
      <li>Great I pored my Maybelline matte pore less foundation  in it.</li>
      <li>Hello germ free facial care :)</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how cute this bottle looks in person.</li>
      <li>Overall, I liked them, but I&#x27;ll have to add glue to that.</li>
      <li>Keeps things neat and clean and so much easier than having to mix each time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also discovered that it works great with CeraVe moisturizing cream, especially since it&#x27;s a pain to have to dip your fingers into a giant container every time you want to use it.</li>
      <li>it came super fast as well</li>
      <li>Its silver packaging sets it apart from other cheap travel sized containers, not to mention it also has a airless pump-top instead of a pour top.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed for my trip to China.</li>
      <li>Lighweight, and works exactly as hoped.</li>
      <li>This bottle cracked and leaked the first time I took it on a plane.</li>
      <li>So much easier!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Shipping is insanely fast as well!</li>
      <li>(I primed it for about 10 minutes without anything moving, the first one took about 30 seconds)</li>
      <li>so I had to pump out quite a bit of air first.</li>
      <li>so I feel like putting it in an airless pump helps preserve it much much longer and keeps the foundation fresh.</li>
      <li>I Absolutely love this for foundations with no pump (Revlon Colorstay) and for large lotions/creams that I want in a smaller size.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this for pumpless foundations or large lotions/creams that I want in a smaller size.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 and one worked just amazingly, the other one wouldn&#x27;t work until I pulled off the bottom and pushed the plunger up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product does what its suppose to do. EXCEPT when it gets less than half way filled the foundation becomes harder to dispense from the pump.</li>
    <li> Like most of the other reviewers, I wanted this for my Revlon Color Stay because the lack of a pump is unhygienic and annoying. I only had somewhere between half and three fourths of my foundation left so I had to pump out quite a bit of air first. I was getting really frustrated at first because it seemed like nothing was happening but I shook it a couple times between a series of pumps and that pushed the air out really quickly! If you&#x27;re having trouble, give it a try!</li>
    <li> This solves my problem for make up foundation that is in tubes. I think it is more sanitary to use a pump. Works nicely.</li>
    <li> No work&lt;br /&gt;No pump&lt;br /&gt;Incompleto</li>
    <li> This bottle cracked and leaked the first time I took it on a plane.</li>
    <li> I use this for Argan Oil and it works well. The container looks really nice, and it seems to dispense well.</li>
    <li> This is the best pump bottle I&#x27;ve ever used. Going on 10 refills and still works like a champ. Lid is great. I dropped it, and it dented a bit, but functionally still amazing.</li>
    <li> These little bottles are cute and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;They feel too fake for comfort, but they get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love how well this worked. I hate getting foundation that doesn&#x27;t have a pump. I just dumped my foundation in it and pumped until the it got to the top and it worked like a charm. I am buying more of these for sure. I will never be without an empty one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy that I purchased this for my foundation makeup. You have to fill it up almost all the way in order for it to pump...still, I filled it up barely even a quarter of the way and it still worked! I just had to pump it a LOT before it started dispensing.  A great way to make drug store foundation easier to use and more sanitary.</li>
    <li> the thing at the bottom that&#x27;s supposed to go up wouldn&#x27;t. Will buy another one to see if same thing happens again.</li>
    <li> this was the easiest pump to use and its also quite attractive compared to most. I put my Revlon foundation it this and it works perfectly! I liked it so much I purchased another for my Rimmel foundation. I will never go pumpless again!</li>
    <li> works great, love this airless bottle for my foundation.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly fine. Bought this a while ago and Im always using it. Thank goodness this one works!&lt;br /&gt;I had to order three more golden ones from another company (due to delivery time restrains) for my mom and aunt and me, none of them worked, literally not a single on of the pumps worked!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had just bought 4 of these ones at the same time rather than using a 2 day free shipping for the crappy golden ones I bought from a different seller.&lt;br /&gt;I have 4 pumping bottle thingys now and I am glad at least this one works.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my trip to China.</li>
    <li> Great I pored my Maybelline matte pore less foundation  in it. It works like a charm. Great for all foundations. U will get evert drop of your foundation without  turning  the bottle upside  down.</li>
    <li> I have different shades in the Revlon Colorstay Foundation. And if you have this foundation you know how hard and messy it can be to get the product out of the container. I transferred my foundation into the container and it works amazing and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Attractive looking bottle. Easy to clean and fill. Looks great on top of vanity!</li>
    <li> Easy set up process. Works great, easy pump action. Fits a whole bottle of foundation. Recommend this for any makeup collector.</li>
    <li> Product does not come out smoothly, it splatters and drops get everywhere.  Otherwise, I would have loved it.</li>
    <li> a little bit taller than i though, but not too bad. with the cap on, it&#x27;s about 5 in. long and 1.5 in. in diameter. it works like a charm.  i use it for my revlon colorstay foundation, since mine doesn&#x27;t have a pump on it. REALLY helps with controlling the amount of product used and for sanitation purposes, so bacteria from your fingers doesn&#x27;t grow in the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I need a bottle to mix a couple of different make-ups to get the look I wanted. I am so pleased with this purchase.  Very inexpensive and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Once the product has been completely used, the airless bottle can be cleaned and reused so it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> Just as expected. The item works great. I transferred my liquid foundation into it.</li>
    <li> I bought four of these and really like how they work. I use them for lotion, primer, and foundation. They are easy to fill if the product is pourable or in a squeeze bottle. I had a hard time with my foundation that is thick.  Here&#x27;s a tip that will help-- use a syringe, the kind for dispensing a child&#x27;s medicine.  It was a little messy but worked great! Shipping was fast as well.</li>
    <li> I put my foundation in this and love it. My foundation is in a squeeze tube and each time I squeeze the tube air flows into it when I let go. That allows bacteria to get insides so I feel like putting it in an airless pump helps preserve it much much longer and keeps the foundation fresh.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product I had this item sitting up in my make up organizer and my liquid foundation completely ran out of the bottle</li>
    <li> There is always this little bottle.  I use it for their colorstay foundation like the other reviewers. It dispenses smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leak and best of all keeps the make up clean. I also have one for an avon cream that came in a jar, so its stays fresher longer. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love this for foundations with no pump (Revlon Colorstay) and for large lotions/creams that I want in a smaller size.  I absolutely love this for pumpless foundations or large lotions/creams that I want in a smaller size. I really don&#x27;t like having exposed packaging like pots or regular bottles with caps for skincare and makeup just because it can get unsanitary and you end up wasting a lot of product because you have less control over how much gets dispensed. I have two of these, one for my face lotion and one for my foundation. The pump is not very difficult to fill,for my foundation I just poured it in and for my face lotion I poured it into a plastic bag first, snipped a corner, and then filled the pump because the lotion wasn&#x27;t as runny and needed some help. The first time you use it after filling it it takes a few pumps to get it going but after that it&#x27;s smooth sailing. I also really like that the pump is clear so that I can see when it&#x27;s running out. When you are refilling just push the bottom back down, I use a q-tip, and refill like normal. One pump dispenses the perfect amount of product as well, one pump of my foundation is exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> I was just about to throw out my purchase until a reviewer commented on my rating.  Thanks for the video.  Now it works great.  Am going to be purchasing these by the case load.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how cute this bottle looks in person. Its silver packaging sets it apart from other cheap travel sized containers, not to mention it also has a airless pump-top instead of a pour top. The pump is what makes this perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this pump to use with my my Revlon Colorstay foundation in it. The pressure seal was created within a few pumps and wa-la I have my own foundation pump. It keeps the air out, which also prevents the foundation from getting too thick or cakey (anyone who uses the colorstay foundation knows that over time, the air exposure makes the formula get a bot thick towards the end of its shelf life).</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture, works good, arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> Use this for my foundation. Works great!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my home made beauty products.  And it&#x27;s a relatively attractive bottle at a great price.  Pump works great.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these.  An elegant alternative for makeup that comes in bottles without a pump.  I just move the sticker with product name from original bottle to this.  I recommend the middle sized funnel in this set [[ASIN:B000HJBFC6 Norpro 243 3-Piece Plastic Funnel Set]] for transferring your foundation.</li>
    <li> brought this for the Revlon colorstay whipped foundation. put the product in and use it for several times, works fine and no issue so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with a Loreal foundation that didn&#x27;t have a pump. It&#x27;s PERFECT! So much easier!</li>
    <li> This works great! I bought it to go with my foundation that doesn&#x27;t come with a bottle pump. I actually bought 3!</li>
    <li> Works fabulously! Great way to get a pump for those foundations or other liquids that have no pump, keeps things clean.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I used this for foundation that came in a screw-top bottle, and a serum that the pump had broken in the container. Will purchase more - these are great quality.</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles to put my argon oil in for my hair. I purchase the large 8oz. bottle and transfer 1oz. at a time into these pumps for convenience and travel. Works great. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This pump was great while it lasted. I poured a bit less than an ounce of a bottle of drugstore foundation inside, and it worked as promised. I&#x27;m maybe a third of the way through the foundation, and it has stopped pumping anything out. I now have to open it and pour the foundation out which I could have done with the bottle the foundation came in. I will be looking for a different pump now.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! It makes applying foundation that much easier. No more wasting foundation or getting it all over the place because it has an open top. I like that no product is wasted or becomes colonized by bacteria.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to keep my oils in for my OCM (oil cleansing method). It is working awesome so far! Keeps things neat and clean and so much easier than having to mix each time. I do suggest that you switch out your oil at least every 3 weeks if you haven&#x27;t used it all by then. I got this size so that I can keep small batches and hopefully avoid waste. The oils I use in my recipe is : castor oil, EVOO, pure emu oil and argan oil. It is holding up well in the bottle. Love it and would order again!</li>
    <li> I originally used this with my Revlon Colorstay foundation, but I&#x27;ve now bought another one to use with my Maybelline Fit Me (Matte&amp;Poreless) as well. Works perfectly with both!</li>
    <li> This bottle was perfect for liquid foundation.  I transferred the content of my foundation that didn&#x27;t have a pump into this bottle and I love it.</li>
    <li> Very good pump. I have two and i have no complaints except that it Could be a little less tall.</li>
    <li> These bottles are perfect for my Loreal True Match and Revlon Naked foundations. I love how you can know how much liquid is left in the container as it pushes up. One of my bottles was defective and will not be replaced. I won&#x27;t be purchasing from this seller but the product itself is a brilliant concept.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  You can also clean and reuse, which I was concerned about.  Will definitely please you if you are concerned about contamination with bottled products without pumps. Bought 2 and will likely purchase a few more.  They are too handy.  I received them shortly after ordering.  They ship wrapped in cellophane and in a bubble mailer.  Since they are plastic, I would be concerned with cracking (although mine were perfectly fine) and have no idea how the customer service would be trying to get refund or replacement. Inexpensive enough to take a chance though.</li>
    <li> These bottles are fantastic! I own several for my liquid cosmetics and skin care products that don&#x27;t come with pumps (i.e. Revlon ColorStay, L&#x27;Oreal True Match, Neutrogena Healthy Skin foundations, etc). They are washable and reusable, easy to fill, and make dispensing a measured amount of what could be messy to pour out a breeze. Shipping is insanely fast as well! Product and seller highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works well, sometimes spurts air</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my Revlon Colorstay foundation (as is everyone else here, it seems) and it works wonderfully. If you&#x27;re sick of trying to foundation out of a glass bottle with no pump, this is a great investment. To be honest, I had no idea how it would work until I actually started pumping it, but after pumping it a few times, the bottom part will slowly raise and push the foundation closer to the top where you can actually pump it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also discovered that it works great with CeraVe moisturizing cream, especially since it&#x27;s a pain to have to dip your fingers into a giant container every time you want to use it. I used a small funnel and dumped a few spoonfuls of the moisturizing cream into the pump bottle, and it&#x27;s made it so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> No leaks and is perfect for the traveler</li>
    <li> I have a DIY serum I&#x27;ve made and I needed a refillable pump bottle that I could store it in. About every 4th pump you&#x27;ll see the bottom rise. It doesn&#x27;t work if my serum is chilled, which would have been an added bonus, but its still wonderful.</li>
    <li> Only works if it&#x27;s full, so isn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Loooove it it came super fast as well</li>
    <li> Lighweight, and works exactly as hoped.</li>
    <li> I use it for my foundation that doesn&#x27;t have a pump it works really well and looks nice</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work.  Not sure if it was user error or the product I put in it.  I put a lightweight lotion in there, and it wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> I had bought drugstore foundation.  It was in a glass bottle so I had a difficult time getting it out of said bottle.  So I purchased this pump and put the foundation in it.  I have had no problems at all with it.  It&#x27;s an excellent product with a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Love it! I used it to store my drugstore foundations.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for foundations with out a pump!  visit my blog for a review at dizzynicky.wordpress.com</li>
    <li> A nice little bottle to store face cream or foundation for travel!</li>
    <li> This pump works so well! I use it for raw honey since I use it on my face with sea salt for a mask and also for face wash. It was annoying to get the honey into the tube, but it pumps it out great. I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work since honey is so think and sticky. I&#x27;m ordering another for my coconut oil since I use it for eye makeup remover and also do not want to keep putting my hands in the container all the time. Hello germ free facial care :)</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 and one worked just amazingly, the other one wouldn&#x27;t work until I pulled off the bottom and pushed the plunger up (I primed it for about 10 minutes without anything moving, the first one took about 30 seconds) It works now, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to pull it apart.  Kind of disappointing, but I did finally get it to work.</li>
    <li> Some of the tops weren&#x27;t glued down, so the silver bit would pop off and leave the bit surrounding the pump. Overall, I liked them, but I&#x27;ll have to add glue to that. Thanks!</li>
    <li> started out promisingly, because it was clean &amp; easy to pour my foundation in the container and screw on the lid.  however, on day 2 the pump stopped pumping out any product, and on day 3 i opened my cosmetics bag to find the entire plastic casing had broken in half, leaving foundation everywhere.  so not cool.  i bought 2, so maybe this one is a defect, but now i have to repurchase my foundation(!) in order to try again.</li>
    <li> Found it not to be the best quality. I am having issues with pumping the product out, unless the tube is turned completely upside down, but even then there is still air in the product so it sometimes comes out a little messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done and protects the product from coming in contact with contaminates, but I was a little disappointed in its performance. It is possible, I did not quite understand how to use it - but I am not having that great of an experience using it. I would not repurchase it.</li>
    <li> The air wouldn&#x27;t come out and all of my product was stuck at the bottom. I had to throw it out because it was really annoying having to have all that product stuck.</li>
