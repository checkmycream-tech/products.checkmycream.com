      <li>I LOVE them; won&#x27;t ever be without them</li>
      <li>Glad these exist now.</li>
      <li>Putting my hair up in a professionally appropriate look is now a snap with these babies.  </li>
      <li>I then purchased them for myself, after she said that they stay in your hair much better than bobby pins.</li>
      <li>and when i woke up in the morning i had beautiful natural curls.</li>
      <li>The twist in easily, don&#x27;t catch or tangle and since there are many points that hold - they spread out the weight of my hair evenly.  </li>
      <li>Wish they had worked, very cool idea</li>
      <li>Love &#x27;em, and the Amazon price for this 3-pack beats anything available in drug stores.</li>
      <li>They hold my (very long) hair very securely in a bun, are quick and easy, and look awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to do.  </li>
      <li>Easy to take out &amp; not pony or bobby pin lines</li>
      <li>They never get tangled in my hair and are easy to spin in and out.</li>
      <li>but I suppose I won&#x27;t lose them as easily as bobby bins.</li>
      <li>Super easy, super hold!!</li>
      <li>even with my fine hair I use two of the spirals.</li>
      <li>These are perfect because once they are in, they are completely hidden.  </li>
      <li>my hair is fine and silky like I can&#x27;t even keep headbands or anything on.</li>
      <li>So I did a little research and found this perfect solution.  </li>
      <li>They are fine to fly commercial too-</li>
      <li>stays secure.</li>
      <li>and they keep the style completely secure.</li>
      <li>Pens are comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>So I just use one of these (or two) to hold my hair securely and snugly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been putting my hair up my whole life and thought these would nice</li>
      <li>As a dishwater blond, I use the light and they just disappear.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love these !!  </li>
      <li>Buns are quick and easy to make and stay put all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These crazy little things work wonderful to hold hair in an updo, and there&#x27;s really lot much of a learning curve in figuring out how to use them. I wind them into my gathered-up bun rather as I&#x27;d wind a corkscrew into a cork — only it&#x27;s actually much easier than that. The pins are entirely hidden in the midst of my hair once I&#x27;ve wound them in and they keep the style completely secure. They work well on a variety of styles, making it possible for me to wear my hair long yet look &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34; when I need an especially professional image. Love &#x27;em, and the Amazon price for this 3-pack beats anything available in drug stores.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love these !!  Seriously, if you have long hair, BUY THIS !!  The only downside is that if your hair is slick because it is so clean, your hair will sometimes slip out :)</li>
    <li> Love these, great for holding hair in a bun, doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, naturally wavy blonde hair and I have a lot of it. The spin pins are the most amazing hair accessory that I have ever used. They are so easy to work with and the amount of styles you can achieve with them are amazing. They never get tangled in my hair and are easy to spin in and out. I do buns, sides up and even use them with pony tails when I pull the sides up first and then have the pony tail rest lower. The price is high for the product in general, but as for the price here I could not find it lower elsewhere for the quantity you receive. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Con:  Not the neatest buns but I&#x27;m not that fussy.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  Buns are quick and easy to make and stay put all day. Pens are comfortable to wear. I don&#x27;t even know they are there. I don&#x27;t have to hunt for bobby pins. Ingenious little hair tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought they were a little expensive for being so simple, but I&#x27;m not at all sorry I bought them.</li>
    <li> I love these hair pins, when i first found them at walgreens i was addicted. I would get out of the shower wrap my hair in a bun and when i woke up in the morning i had beautiful natural curls. These work great for my fine hair through out the day i leave them in never having discomfort. Once they are in it stays put, no worries about losing them during work. My favorite hair accessory. I prefer the two pins vs the three pin.</li>
    <li> I think I wear these more than any other hair accessory.  My hair is waist-length and while the individual strands are thin, I have a lot of them so it&#x27;s a lot of hair that goes up.  My updo last all day and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache with these.  VERY secure, even when swimming or jogging.</li>
    <li> These are the best!!!</li>
    <li> I have a FULL head of 3b curly hair and expected some setbacks but hoped otherwise thanks to a review about these products working best for curly hair instead of straight fine hair. After using them, my hope disappeared once my expectations were exceeded.     The Spin Pins work best for my hair but 2 pins simply aren&#x27;t enough! I&#x27;m alright with a messy bun if it looks relaxed but when it seems like you&#x27;ve been in the wilderness for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had time to fix your hair between bear fights it&#x27;s too messy for me; sadly, that is exactly what I ended up with when using 2 Spin Pins. It may be because I have some layers in my \\&quot;just above bra strap\\&quot; hair, but I have to aid them with other pins to get a decent look. I would purchase another pair or 2 if they weren&#x27;t so expensive!     Overall, I give this 2* because though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone with lots of 3b curly hair, maybe someone with less hair or a different type (wavy or straight) could get better results if willing to risk the amount on the price tag. Only \\&quot;value for price paid\\&quot; would get 5* from me because I purchased the complete Bundle Pack from Walmart for only $8.00 +FREE S/H TO HOME, which speaks better of the retailer than the product. I will continue to experiment since I already made the purchase but am definitely glad I shopped around and got the cheapest price around!</li>
    <li> Works great in my 12 year old granddaughter&#x27;s  very long thick hair. She wears a bun for ballet and daily. She does her own hair and it is a snap with these. Eliminates many bobby pins!</li>
    <li> I use these when I get out of shower to wear a high while hair is wet. Or when I&#x27;m chasing after my 2 year old. A very fast and easy way to do your hair that is an alternative to the mom pony.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I heard about it from a YouTube beauty guru, and wanted to try it out. It&#x27;s like Bobby pins on steroids — less chance of losing it, less chance of screwing up your &#x27;do, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase these.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I have long, thick hair and they really work!</li>
    <li> Work great for my wife.  She reports needing 3-4 of them sometimes given her long and slippery straight hair, but they are barely visible (if at all) and work very well to produce a professional hairstyle she can wear to work.</li>
    <li> These spiral pins are TERRIFIC! I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, and barretts seem to slide out easily. When I travel, I like to twist ny hair up into a messy bun, and these pins are so great -- I can even sleep all night with them, and they keep my hair up off my neck! I had purchased them at our local drugstore before, and now I have a coue of spare pairs!</li>
    <li> I have long hair (about to my waist) and these manage to contain it.  They hold my hair in its natural wavy state and when I straighten it.  I would give it 5 stars, but I believe they are cheeper from other retailers.</li>
    <li> All of the positive reviews were right! These are comfortable even for sleeping, and they really keep your hair in place!</li>
    <li> Great price on a sometimes hard to find item.  Putting my hair up in a professionally appropriate look is now a snap with these babies.  Takes the place on 12 bobbi pins - and much faster to get in and take out!  Love these!</li>
    <li> I use these all the time. I have very long, thick hair and these will hold my hair in a bun all day long. I use one for normal activity, two if I&#x27;m doing anything active.</li>
    <li> I love these things. Have been using them for 5 years. I have thick wavy hair and frequently pull it up in a loose bun and 3 pins hold it in place through workouts, sleep, etc. and don&#x27;t leave a mark like a stretchy band does.</li>
    <li> I think these are a little more \\&quot;golden blonde\\&quot; than actual light blonde, but they are better than black or brown. And, they work! I have VERY thick hair and can get them to hold my hair without a hairtie. I have yet to use them all day without a hairtie, but mostly because I&#x27;m chicken. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package  also includes a basic styling guide to get you started.</li>
    <li> These are definitely expensive but I suppose I won&#x27;t lose them as easily as bobby bins. It&#x27;s easier to throw my hair up without worrying about kinks from a hair ring and on more complex hair styles I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;d set off metal detectors with the amount of bobby pins I have in. I&#x27;ve managed to bend in one somehow but overall they&#x27;re really sturdy. I have thinner hair but I&#x27;d imagine these are even better for thick hair!</li>
    <li> I love spin pins! Wear them all the time! But tend to lose the too. This value pack was a great deal and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these pins! I have been using my set for 3 years now, and they are sturdy and awesome. I bought this to give out to my lighter haired family members come Christmas time, great stocking stuffer! Easy to use (though maybe not if you have arthritis) holds hair in style perfectly, hides so your style looks magickally held in place!</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and hold thick, long hair into any style...a small wrap on top or a large bun or a french twist. I love the brown ones for blonde/brown hair.</li>
    <li> saw these babies on mirror mirror-had to have them. they are great. hold hair in place. no pulling or tugging. ouchless. stays secure. completely hidden. wont move like bobby pins. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these in the bottom of a drawer for a couple of years.  I rarely pull my hair up anymore because it sometimes gives me a headache.  These pins are the answer to my problem though.  I can put my hair up with these two pins and it stays up all day.  No adjustments necessary.  Since I don&#x27;t have millions of bobby pins sticking me in the head, I don&#x27;t get a headache.  It&#x27;s also faster to put up and take down.  (I have shoulder length, layered hair)</li>
    <li> These are the best invention ever for holding together all manner of twists and buns.  I LOVE them; won&#x27;t ever be without them</li>
    <li> Easy to use and do not bend out of shape or deform with heavy use.</li>
    <li> These things ACTUALLY WORK. I never would have believed it but they&#x27;re so simple and easy and hold my fine hair in place all day.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and NOTHING has ever really done the job of holding it up in a bun without a lot of hassle. Until these amazing little things came along. Super easy, super hold!! Buy them, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I had a question at first concerning delivery but am very satisfied and happy with this  purchase.  The merchant is very fair and does what she says she will do.</li>
    <li> Between the fact that I have heavy, baby fine hair that bobby pins fall right out of and the fact that I suck at doing hair, pinning up my hair is next to impossible. I had high hopes for these spin pins, and overall I&#x27;m very pleased. While I found the claim on the box that you only need 2 pins to put your hair in a bun to be completely false, they do actually hold my hair if I use enough of them. I used 4 and my bun lasted all day. Putting the pins in is very easy, but getting them out can be a little complicated.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get these to work for me. My hair just falls down in a few minutes. I eventually use as many Bobbie pins as I did before as I pin up the fallen pieces.</li>
    <li> I love these pins. They keep my hair up all day without looking too tight. I ordered a 3 pack so I can keep them at the office and at home, but I only need 2 to keep my hair up.</li>
    <li> Hard to locate item - just right.</li>
    <li> Wife happy &#x3D; happy husband.  I&#x27;d have bought her 300 of these things if it made her happy...  The end.</li>
    <li> I like these. Holds well</li>
    <li> Spin pins are a wonderful addition to my hair accessories and, to be perfectly frank, I can&#x27;t imagine life without them. My hair is fine, so bobbies don&#x27;t typically work.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited as long as I did to learn about these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, very fine hair that I put into a topknot or bun almost every day to keep it from getting greasy near my face (does that make any sense at all?) I&#x27;m trying to move away from rubber bands / bobby pins lest I ruin what few strands of hair I do have. These are BRILLIANT  for my buns, and even for putting my hair half-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some quick notes: even with my fine hair I use two of the spirals. If you&#x27;re doing a bun, it is pretty important to tuck the ends underneath the bun before twisting, or they&#x27;ll fan out. I usually make an X with the spirals and I&#x27;m sure they cross in the middle with no consequence. Beware that after iterated use, the spirals do slowly stretch out, so a pair won&#x27;t last forever, but that&#x27;s why Amazon Prime exists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t fully explored the curling / wave-making potential of these, but the couple times I&#x27;ve made a bun with 80% dry hair, the resulting waves are pretty beautiful.</li>
    <li> So much better than bobby pins.  Holds well, I don&#x27;t get a hair headache.  Doesn&#x27;t snag, rip or break my hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE these - I&#x27;ve been using them all summer - so fast and easy.  My hair stays pulled up and in place all day.</li>
    <li> I love these!! where have they been my whole life??  If you have long or heavy hair- hair bands do not work all that well, or they break hair.  I have a hard time finding anything to keep my hair up. Before finding these I was using thick tennis 80&#x27;s styled head bands to hold my hair in a bun (they don&#x27;t damage/break your hair), but wearing a thick red or yellow terry cloth band in your hair does not go with every outfit, especially a black tie event.  The other option was hairpins- like a whole pack of them and they would just pop out of my hair and making a path from wherever I had been- Hansel and Gretel style.  Anyway finding these have totally changed the playing field for me.  I love them.  On most days I need three to hold up a good bun, but now and then when my hair is in a good mood I can get by with two.  I highly recommended going with this brand and not trying to be cheap and purchase the no-name brand.  The no-name brand spin pin ends are not finished and will scrape your scalp.  The Goody pins have finished ends are wonderful, but if your are into scalp pain then by all means go for the no-names.  I&#x27;ve been using the Goody pins for a year in half and have had no problems.  They are fine to fly commercial too- the three I had in my bun did not set off the alarm.</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty thick and about bra length, putting it up has always been difficult.  I would end up using 10-15 bobby pins and then they were usually bent out of shape and I would have to throw them out.  Depending on the style I can use as few as 2 regular length or 3 mini spin pins and my hair is secure.  Love them!! I also love that they come in light and dark.  As a dishwater blond, I use the light and they just disappear.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! They hold my (very long) hair very securely in a bun, are quick and easy, and look awesome.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! My daughter is a competitive dancer; and she is required to wear a bun to ballet class - which is almost immediately after school. I tried MANY things before finding these - what a life saver! I can put her hair in a bun before school, and it&#x27;s still there nearly 12 hours later after school and 3 dance classes!&lt;br /&gt;This also works well during competitions, I only need to use 2; makes making a bun all that much faster - and it STAYS!  I&#x27;ve bought several packs of these, and have given them to some of our teammates.</li>
    <li> I got sick and tired of having hairbands break my hair.  These bun pins are absolutely amazing. The buns look nice, and I wear them every day now. I am a big fan!</li>
    <li> Seriously a neat product, had my doubts but ordered to try them and am really impressed!</li>
    <li> I found that it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up. I&#x27;ve been putting my hair up my whole life and thought these would nice but my hair just kept eventually falling out.</li>
    <li> These are much too big if you have shorter or not-crazy-thick hair.  I do not have thin hair, or short hair (it&#x27;s well past my shoulders) and found these are too long and they always poke out or show when I make a bun, let alone a half-up or anything else. I really wish they&#x27;d said something on the page about the different lengths, and what would be suitable for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the shorter/smaller version of these is great for me!  Unless you have crazy long/thick hair, get the shorter ones.</li>
    <li> They are really as good as they tell you! My hair is very thin and slippery and with two of this guys I can achieve a low bun that lasts all day! :)</li>
    <li> These are life savers for those days when I don&#x27;t want to wear my hair loose (which requires time to style it).  They are ridiculously easy to use - very intuitive. Just like screwing a screw in and turning it in the opposite direction to unscrew it. It holds my hair in place for the day and longer. Great for summer when you don&#x27;t want hair frizzing and causing a sweaty neck. I keep them around the house, in my purse, etc. so I can put my hair up on the fly.</li>
    <li> I was never able to keep my fine hair up in a bun before I discovered these pins!  Now my hair will remain up all day or evening.  Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Sadly, these don&#x27;t work in my hair nor my daughter&#x27;s hair.  We both have thick hair and no matter how many I put in, they still do not hold.  I&#x27;m sure they would work better for thin hair, but if you have thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on them.</li>
    <li> Whoever invented these is a genius. They&#x27;re great for a serious updo, not so much for a quick I just need to pin my hair up. They &#x27;re easy enough to use and don&#x27;t leave creases like normal hair pins, and two of these do the job of four pins. The only drawback for me is removing them - I have a lot of hair. I gave a few packages to my stylist and he loves them.</li>
    <li> I have hip length hair &amp; everything else I have tried pulls my hair in one spot or another.  It takes a bit to get the hang of just how to put the hair up &amp; just the right spot to put the spin pins in.  I can run with it up &amp; sleep with them in with total comfort.</li>
    <li> I bought these so I can do an up-do for a formal event (the Gibson Tuck specifically) and these work GREAT!! They were awesome for my tuck, but I also use them for my top knots and buns just on a day to day basis. One of these is like putting in 3-4 bobby pins. I haven&#x27;t even opened the other two boxes yet, just the two is all I have needed so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER going back to regular bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Best. Things. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them when I had a bob, and now that I have super long and thick hair, they are still the best. You will find a million ways to use these, and once they are in, you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling out.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is shoulder length and layered, and these spins pins can keep it in a nice looking bun all day. It&#x27;s certainly not a perfect, ballerina bun (the layers poke out) but it&#x27;s definitely professional and practical enough for a teacher. I like that I can use the pins with or without a hair tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get the pin that matches your hair color - sometimes the ends poke out (especially if you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair) so blending in is good.</li>
    <li> Considering how long women have been wearing their hair in buns and using bobby pins, I&#x27;m amazed that it took this long for this product to be invented. Used properly, it really makes life easier, and seems like such a simple, obvious thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning curve:  I sometimes have to try these 2 or 3 times before I get a bun that \\&quot;sticks.\\&quot; As far as I can tell, my most common mistake is trying to hard to drive them down to the hair against the scalp, as I would usually with normal bobby pins. If you keep them more through the \\&quot;body\\&quot; of the bun, they seem to work better. Also, the packaging says not to interlock them when putting two in in opposite directions. I don&#x27;t really understand the reason for this, except maybe to prevent the less clever from having emergencies where they cant get them out, since the ONLY way to get them out if they&#x27;re interlocked is by twisting in the proper direction, whereas maybe if they&#x27;re not interlocked, you could get them out just by tugging if you had to. I don&#x27;t really know. Just my thought. I mention that because I&#x27;ve actually had pretty good luck with interlocking them, like making a plus sign through my bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, but thick in that I have lots of it, just below shoulder length, and stubbornly straight. Which is my usual problem with buns... my hair loves to send out spikey shoots all over the place, which I sometimes embrace and sometimes not. I can get pretty neat buns with the spin pins, with practice, and usually with a ponytail holder before I twist it into a bun. Without ponytail-ing first, this is great for casual, semi-messy buns. I had my hair in such a bun today for work. I was amazed that, while it looked a bit loose and just a tad messy, it didn&#x27;t get any looser and messier, even through a 9-hour work day, which is amazing for fine hair that likes to slip its way out of everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed. Cool invention. Glad these exist now. Wish they had earlier.</li>
    <li> Seriously. Life changing</li>
    <li> I purchased these hair spin pins, after seeing a woman use them in her hair, in a YouTube video. I then purchased them for myself, after she said that they stay in your hair much better than bobby pins. And she was right!  I have long hair, and need extra support when wearing my &amp;#34;messy bun&amp;#34;. So I just use one of these (or two) to hold my hair securely and snugly. Great Idea! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> The only use for them that I found was for when I already had my hair tied up with a band and a ton of bobby pins. They kind of hold the bobby pins together.. for awhile.</li>
    <li> Love these and they work great!</li>
    <li> My hair is very, very fine and medium length. Normal bobby pins will not stay long in my hair nor hold it in place well. These are amazing. I&#x27;ve used them almost daily for two weeks now. They have stayed firmly in place and kept my hair in place. I have used them with and without ponytail elastic. And though the instructions say not to cross them, I do anyway without any trouble. I highly recommend trying these if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have hair down to the middle of my back. I like to wear it up but it&#x27;s so heavy it always comes undone, and I have to do it over - often in public. No big deal, but these little doodads have changed all that. Twist my hair up like I want it, twist 2 of these in as instructed, and it stays put until I take them out. Long hair? Get some!</li>
    <li> These things work.  They will hold up long, heavy, slippy hair all day with no sliding and no repinning.  Can be a tad difficult to find and spin out of your hair, but otherwise, my search for sturdy hairpins ends here.</li>
    <li> These did not stay in my hair at all, if you have corse hair they might stay? my hair is fine and silky like I can&#x27;t even keep headbands or anything on. Wish they had worked, very cool idea</li>
    <li> These things are awesome. Don&#x27;t get how they&#x27;re not a big deal really. People always are shocked to see them when I&#x27;m asked &amp;#34;how do you get your hair like that...&amp;#34; Then they buy them. Should have commercials with how-to&#x27;s or something. So easy, fast, &amp; actually holds strong! Easy to take out &amp; not pony or bobby pin lines</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and have very long, thick, heavy, slippery hair.  I&#x27;ve broken countless hair pins, clips, bands, etc. trying to tame my crazy hair.  This accessory is so perfect I wish I had known about it sooner!!  For the first time, I can put my hair into a bun in record time.  There are YouTube videos available that show you how to use these if you need a visual.  I am really bad at hairstyles, my long hair is always in a plain ponytail with a scrunchy until I get sick of it and just cut it all off.  Then it grows again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok.  So how I use these:  Put hair up in a ponytail with just a simple little band.  Twirl the ponytail up into a bun.  Twist one Spin Pin in through one direction.  Twist another Spin Pin in another place.  Done.  It&#x27;s so easy to do.  Turn it in clockwise to go in, counter-clockwise to come back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked into these when I started wearing my baby on my back while I did chores and we&#x27;d go out for walks.  It was perfect until she started pulling on my ponytail all the time and trying to eat my hair.  So I put my hair in a bun using some chopstick style pins, but now there are sharp pointy things right in my baby&#x27;s face.  So I did a little research and found this perfect solution.  These are perfect because once they are in, they are completely hidden.  Nothing sharp and pointy sticking out.  The twist in easily, don&#x27;t catch or tangle and since there are many points that hold - they spread out the weight of my hair evenly.  I&#x27;m the type that get headaches when my hair is up because it&#x27;s so heavy and my scalp is sensitive, I guess.  Not with these.  These spread out the weight very nicely.  I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t catch and tangle in my hair.  As easily as it is to twist clockwise in - just grab the closed end and twist it counter-clockwise and it comes right back out again.  No tangling or catching at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I have is that these are small and I&#x27;m for sure to lose them.  I have to get spares and figure out a good way to not lose these!!  They are also quite pricey.  They are metal though - so no more flimsey plastic hair products that just snap in two whenever I try to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these and definitely recommend them!!figure out a good way to not lose these!!  They are also quite pricey.  They are metal though - so no more flimsey plastic hair products that just snap in two whenever I try to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these and definitely recommend them!!</li>
    <li> These work great.  I have thick hair and they still hold in a bun.</li>
