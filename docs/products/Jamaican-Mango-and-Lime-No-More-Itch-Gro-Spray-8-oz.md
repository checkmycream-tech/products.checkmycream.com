<li> If not for the price of the product and the quantity you receive (I used the entire thing in a month a half), it would be one star higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I started my brotherlocks a few months back</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been a constant fan of the Jamaican mango lime line of products for the past 6 years of growing my locs</li>
<li> So I looked up a few products and I ordered this one</li>
<li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with natural, twisted, or locked hair.</li>
<li> Bottle itself was broken.</li>
<li> I was afraid to use it, because I thought it might have been tampered with</li>

    <li> It refresh your hair, like just taken a shower</li>
    <li> It helped relive my itchy scalp immediately. I started my brotherlocks a few months back and the itch was unbearable. So I looked up a few products and I ordered this one and it works!!!</li>
    <li> ...A bird attacked my hair while I passed under a tree! I was quite pleased with the aroma of this product. My scalp didn&#x27;t itch and my hair always felt so wonderfully soft beneath my tangle of braids. If not for the price of the product and the quantity you receive (I used the entire thing in a month a half), it would be one star higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, this was an amazing spray and receives a 4...out of 5.</li>
    <li> This product I recommend  it&#x27;s pricey like 40 squirts and you will be low but it stops itching if u have locks smells good as well.</li>
    <li> Did not spray. Bottle itself was broken.</li>
    <li> This product stopped some of the itch but not all of it when I 1st got my locks. The Castus  Leave in Moisturizer worked  so much better.</li>
    <li> It smells great, keeps scalp moist and supple, stops the itch right away, helps hair growth and it doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty sticky build up. June 2014 will make two years that my hair is natural.  I have fine, thick 4a/b hair. There aren&#x27;t very many hair products that I support, this is one of the good ones.</li>
    <li> This product really works for me growing my locks.</li>
    <li> still trying to get used to the sent. stronger than i imagined. but, does smell good.</li>
    <li> Use it every morning and night and you won&#x27;t itch. Seemed to make my hair dread quicker too. I recommend this to anyone with itchy dreads.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my hair smell and how it takes away the itch almost immediately!! Definitely worth getting if you need something to make your dreads less frizzy or to make them look nice or smell good.</li>
    <li> The product itself works well but I was expecting an actual spray rather than a cream that sprayed out and that you have to rub in. Its way better than other cream I have though!</li>
    <li> When my scalp itches or my dreads wanna stink on a sweaty day, this stuff really helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with natural, twisted, or locked hair. I&#x27;ve been a constant fan of the Jamaican mango lime line of products for the past 6 years of growing my locs</li>
    <li> I like it very much, but I had to discard it, because when I received it, the top wasn&#x27;t on secure and it leaked out into the box.  I was afraid to use it, because I thought it might have been tampered with, I didn&#x27;t return it because I didn&#x27;t want to go through all the red tape.  So I just bought me another bottle in my area, it was a little more expensive, but I didn&#x27;t want to take the chance in applying something to my hair that might have been tampered with.  But as far as the product itself, I like it.</li>
    <li> The best ever. I just started the twists to get lox and I&#x27;m 3 weeks in using this and it definitely helped my hair with no itching and good growth</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and works for anti frizz! Keep those dreads smooth, it actually even works if you dont have dreads. Smooths those split ends! I recommend this product for sure</li>
    <li> great I am glad I can still find this</li>
