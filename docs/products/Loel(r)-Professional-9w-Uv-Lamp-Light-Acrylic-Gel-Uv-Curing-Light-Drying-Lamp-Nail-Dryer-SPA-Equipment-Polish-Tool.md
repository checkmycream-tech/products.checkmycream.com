      <li>Very Goog, excellent product!</li>
      <li>a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
      <li>I purchased this lamp for my cousin since it is compact and she travels a lot and does her own manicures.</li>
      <li>I have purchased my own gel nail polish and have yet to use it.</li>
      <li>plus you can get bulbs at handy store,so its a better value</li>
      <li>great product i got it really fast!</li>
      <li>Works great very lightwight</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nice and secure in there now.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I purchased this.  </li>
      <li>and it works better</li>
      <li>3-4 mins top you over cured them</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>I use it to cure my gel top coat</li>
      <li>It sucked and is cheaply made!</li>
      <li>Loved the UV lamp came in really quick and works perfectly fine</li>
      <li>This one I have to turn the light on ahead while I am preparing my nails to warm up the light.</li>
      <li>and it works fine...</li>
      <li>This little lamp is working just perfect for me.</li>
      <li>My light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>Its a struggle to fit all five fingers in comfortably.</li>
      <li>, the light bulb also fell out.</li>
      <li>In the beginning my product did not work, however shortly after saying it did not work I received an email saying they would love to help me and make sure I was satisfied.</li>
      <li>Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>It literally took me two hours to unsuccessfully cure ONE hand...and it was still pretty damp!</li>
      <li>Get a higher powered one!</li>
      <li>takes a long time to heat up and doesnt really dry your nails the best unless you sit under it for quite sometime.</li>
      <li>It was simple to install the UV light and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This UV lamp light has only 9w so don&#x27;t expect to do it an excellent job like the ones with higher wattage which is more expensive.</li>
      <li>This product works but you need time in order for the prod u cuts to cure properly, I recently purchased something better and gave this away to a child</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cute small and easy to put together.</li>
      <li>This will not cure certain gels that need a 36w</li>
      <li>So if you do not care about time as much  as  just wanting  to do your gel nails .</li>
      <li>with only about 3-4 minutes under this light you are set to go.  </li>
      <li>It is very practical and lightweight for loading into bag.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really complain since I already expect what I am getting for the price.</li>
      <li>This product worked very well for me</li>
      <li>Works really great.lasted me almost going to a year now with it.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for all you have done for me.</li>
      <li>this product has been good so far don&#x27;t know if it will be defective later because I only used it twice.</li>
      <li>Dryin gel is fast and fine dry fast nail polish.</li>
      <li>I have never had the opportunity to use it as the whole complete set with the polish</li>
      <li>is it true that we have to keep 2,3minutes to dry uv gel ,?</li>
      <li>Bought this item for my daughter, other than having difficulty inserting the bulb it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>Used this with a gel top coat and it dried in about 3 minutes!</li>
      <li>but again it does the same result as the 18w or higher watts</li>
      <li>Definitely worth keeping for the money but keep in mind that it will take longer for the polish to dry</li>
      <li>I hope your not doing other people&#x27;s nails other then your own.</li>
      <li>Having had a chances to use it but so far I&#x27;m liking</li>
      <li>I would recommend this item for my professional nail techs usage.</li>
      <li>Works well for curing professional gel nails sets.</li>
      <li>9w lamp works great, a little difficult to get the bulb in</li>

<li> Works well for curing professional gel nails sets.</li>
<li> 9w lamp works great, a little difficult to get the bulb in</li>
<li> The power is too low to cure polish in short amount of time expected (1 minute).</li>
<li> The only problem that I have with it is that it takes a long time for the gel to dry.</li>
<li> but I was careful to select a gel that only needs 9 watts to cure.</li>
<li> I was SUPER excited to receive this, i also ordered one for my mom and they both were such a Disappointment!!  </li>
<li> I deducted one star for a couple very minor things, like there is not a timer.</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t even dry the nails</li>
<li> It took forever for it to dry the gel</li>
<li> It takes 10 minutes to completely dry the nail polish</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 times so far with Nailite hard gel.</li>
<li> Did not work as expected.</li>
<li> To be honest, it&#x27;s a piece of crap and want a refund</li>
<li> For the girl who said this product didn&#x27;t work, that after 20 mins under the dryer to cure gel you are obviously not a professional you just need to learn your facts because what idiot would leave gel nail under the UV light for 20 mins!?</li>
<li> The light bulb was very difficult to put in, in fact it took THREE people to attempt it.</li>
<li> Waste of time and money.</li>
<li> It has one 9w bulb and small in size.</li>
<li> I plug it in and the light bulb popped, very disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> Too late to get a refund.</li>
<li> Sucks</li>
<li> Turned on for like a second then burned out, totally disappointed.</li>
<li> Ugh... Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!!!</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t cure crap finally got to use it</li>
<li> Not happy at all.</li>
<li> This product is VERY poor quality.</li>
<li> Lamp is hard to plug, and it never turned on :(...</li>
<li> I hate losing money.</li>
<li> But I couldn&#x27;t even get the stupid lightbulb to stay in place!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s awful!!!!!!</li>

    <li> great product i got it really fast!</li>
    <li> is it true that we have to keep 2,3minutes to dry uv gel ,?and it will burned too?</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp for my cousin since it is compact and she travels a lot and does her own manicures. This product is VERY poor quality. The light bulb was very difficult to put in, in fact it took THREE people to attempt it. Once we got it in it did work, but stopped working after the second use and it didn&#x27;t even dry the nails, the light bulb also fell out. I called to try to return this product, but they DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS OR DO REFUNDS. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This think is a piece of junk, doesn&#x27;t work at all... save your money and the landfill from this garbage</li>
    <li> Working very good!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Gel polish would not set after 20 minutes under the lamp, who knows why! But the thing did not do what it was supposed to do!</li>
    <li> To be honest, it&#x27;s a piece of crap and want a refund</li>
    <li> I plug it in and the light bulb popped, very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Broke before I could ever use it. Too late to get a refund. Sucks I hate losing money. I would never recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product works but not as well as I thought it would.  Definitely worth keeping for the money but keep in mind that it will take longer for the polish to dry then you probably would expect it to.</li>
    <li> Works great very lightwight</li>
    <li> This product works but you need time in order for the prod u cuts to cure properly, I recently purchased something better and gave this away to a child</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my daughter, other than having difficulty inserting the bulb it works fantastic.</li>

    <li> It works good. The only problem that I have with it is that it takes a long time for the gel to dry.</li>
    <li> For the girl who said this product didn&#x27;t work, that after 20 mins under the dryer to cure gel you are obviously not a professional you just need to learn your facts because what idiot would leave gel nail under the UV light for 20 mins!? 3-4 mins top you over cured them Gosh I hope your not doing other people&#x27;s nails other then your own.</li>
    <li> this product has been good so far don&#x27;t know if it will be defective later because I only used it twice. it worked and heated perfectly but just wanted to know where I can get the bulbs to order or how often do I changes these bulb?</li>
    <li> Very Goog, excellent product! Dryin gel is fast and fine dry fast nail polish. It is very practical and lightweight for loading into bag.</li>
    <li> Works really great.lasted me almost going to a year now with it.</li>
    <li> I was SUPER excited to receive this, i also ordered one for my mom and they both were such a Disappointment!!  you literally have to keep your hand in there like 45 min per finger!! I WOULD&#x27;NT RECOMMEND it all!!!</li>
    <li> This lamp is perfect!  Works great for the price.  I use it to cure my gel top coat and it works fine...2 minutes to cure</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. takes a long time to heat up and doesnt really dry your nails the best unless you sit under it for quite sometime. Its a struggle to fit all five fingers in comfortably.</li>
    <li> Well you get what you pay for. This UV lamp light has only 9w so don&#x27;t expect to do it an excellent job like the ones with higher wattage which is more expensive. I can&#x27;t really complain since I already expect what I am getting for the price. It takes 10 minutes to completely dry the nail polish but again it does the same result as the 18w or higher watts only this one takes longer. (my friend has the 18w LED in a different brand and hers does a quicker job). This one I have to turn the light on ahead while I am preparing my nails to warm up the light.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
    <li> I sent it back, I didn&#x27;t want the UV rays</li>
    <li> Lamp is hard to plug, and it never turned on :(... I almost did twice, but the third time it fell to do it.</li>
    <li> This was a joke! Waited 2 months for it to arrive and it comes and does not work! They lie about when you ordered it and you can not return!!!!! DONT ORDER!</li>
    <li> I have never had the opportunity to use it as the whole complete set with the polish NEVER came. I have purchased my own gel nail polish and have yet to use it. I will give any update when I do.</li>
    <li> Worked one time, second time plugged it in an smelled something burning....quit working after that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I wish it had a timer though</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s awful!!!!!! burned!</li>
    <li> Not optimal for using with big name brand gel polish. The power is too low to cure polish in short amount of time expected (1 minute). It literally took me two hours to unsuccessfully cure ONE hand...and it was still pretty damp! After letting my hand rest over night, the polish  finally cured. I would not recommend this low wattage UV lamp. Get a higher powered one!</li>
    <li> 9w lamp works great, a little difficult to get the bulb in but it&#x27;s nice and secure in there now. I&#x27;ve used this 3 times so far with Nailite hard gel. This will not cure certain gels that need a 36w but I was careful to select a gel that only needs 9 watts to cure. It&#x27;s a great space saver. I deducted one star for a couple very minor things, like there is not a timer. But you get what you pay for and that&#x27;s no big deal. I also wish the cord was a bit longer.</li>
    <li> It does not heat up uv enought to cure the gel for nails</li>
    <li> Having had a chances to use it but so far I&#x27;m liking it&#x27;s cute small and easy to put together.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this.  I also purchased the primer and bonder.  they all work well and good together.  with only about 3-4 minutes under this light you are set to go.  the price is good too.  love it</li>
    <li> Arrived soon!  But I couldn&#x27;t even get the stupid lightbulb to stay in place! The lightbulbb was lose and slipped out before I could even try it out. Ugh... Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cure crap finally got to use it and I wish I never threw the box away!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even want to give it a one star but I had to. My light didn&#x27;t work.  Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Great price,great lamp,love it! Received on time and in good condition. No complaints here this was about third of price from supply stote and it works better plus you can get bulbs at handy store,so its a better value</li>
    <li> Turned on for like a second then burned out, totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> I finally used it and I did not work now I hava to purchase anoter one from another vendor</li>
    <li> It sucked and is cheaply made! It didnt even work theres no button to even turn it on or off. Its like for decoration or something.</li>
    <li> It took forever for it to dry the gel and it was left sticky so everything stuck to my nails</li>
    <li> perfict for gel nail polish</li>
    <li> Used this with a gel top coat and it dried in about 3 minutes! My nails didn&#x27;t chip !! YAY! That happens - NEVER. I always have to redo them, and it wastes so much time and $$.</li>
    <li> Not that impressed. Would not purchase again. Waste of time and money. Did not work as expected. Would rather spend the extra money and go to the salon.</li>
    <li> Does the. Job but I think it&#x27;s intended for tiny fingers.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for me</li>
    <li> You not want this it doesn&#x27;t work at all............</li>
    <li> Works well for curing professional gel nails sets. It was simple to install the UV light and easy to use. I would recommend this item for my professional nail techs usage.</li>
    <li> This little lamp is working just perfect for me. It has one 9w bulb and small in size. You can not fit your whole hand in. I have to just do my thumbs by them selves.  I think it is good for travel or home use. I find that 2 mins per step of a lite coat does great. So if you do not care about time as much  as  just wanting  to do your gel nails . This will work.</li>
    <li> This works just as it is suppose to. Just put your nails under for 2-3 mins and they have a beautiful shine to them.</li>
    <li> Loved the UV lamp came in really quick and works perfectly fine</li>
    <li> Great UV lamp gets the job donee!</li>
    <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
