<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this brand! I&#x27;ve tried the other scents before and can&#x27;t wait to try out the Charcoal!</li>
    <li> Definitely an interesting product and worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I just showered with it and my skin feels soft. It&#x27;s not dry like with traditional soaps and gels. I even used it on my face. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I take activated charcoal pills when I eat and drink &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; food and when a friend turned me onto this Charcoal based soap I loved the idea, but was a little skeptical since I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying it for about 10 days now and I LOVE IT. My skin feels cleaner and softer than when I was using regular Dove Soap bar. I prefer using all natural items in the shower so these have been great. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I struggle with acne so I really love this charcoal bar. I find that it helps with both inflammatory acne (zits) and blackheads, it makes my skin really soft and evens out my skin tone. It&#x27;s also a big plus for me that this product is cruelty-free and made in the USA! Not only does this product make my skin healthier, it also makes me feel good about supporting a cause I believe in.</li>
    <li> Great soap. I have sensitive skin and usually break out with moisturizing soaps. I have not had any breakouts thus far. This bar is a win.</li>
    <li> flo+theo products are so good!!!! this soap really cleans and refreshes, without leaving the skin feeling dry or irritated! i&#x27;m a believer in their products!!!!</li>

I will definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>

    <li> Wow this was really great soap!  The packaging is great, the soap itself is very luxurious.  I was a little worried since it was black, but it produces a nice white lather and leaves your skin super smooth.  Great soap, would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with acne every now and then and other products like Aveeno or proactive really dry out my skin, and while those products clean my face is oily again like an hour later. But with Flo + Theo, I don&#x27;t have those issues. I absolutely love that!!! I have been using it for just a week and can already see a difference. My skin is smoother and almost acne free. I wash it in the morning and my face isn&#x27;t oily for the rest of the day. I will definitely be purchasing from them again!!! :)</li>
    <li> Received my product right away and loved the packaging. Product itself was great! I like the fact that it is unscented and vegan washes you clean and no residue after. I will defiantly be placing another order of this and many more of the products this vendor carries.</li>
    <li> I L-O-V-E Flo+Theo activate charcoal soap!!!! Its so gentle on my sensitive skin while removing toxins.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased many of their soaps before and I am never disappointed :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ladies for creating this beautiful product I love so much!</li>

    <li> Love this soap. I love any product I can use my Prime membership on and the packaging is great. Makes for great gifts.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I cannot recommend highly enough. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to really make my skin feel clean, this soap is good but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s deep cleaning. I think for that I should have gone with  something more coarse or a type of scrub. Overall I do like the soap I would buy it again that is why I&#x27;m giving it five starts. This is the first charcoal product I&#x27;ve used so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I use it for my face and body. It&#x27;s gentle enough and I doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
    <li> The soap is amazing, you feel so clean afterwords, highly recommend it. The carbon helps keep you extra clean</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome. I&#x27;ve been looking for everything activated charcoal because it&#x27;s such a great detoxifier. I travel a lot and always have a hard time having enough toiletries because of TSA standards. This product is great for airport travel because it&#x27;s not a liquid, so I know I&#x27;ll have enough good quality soap the whole time I&#x27;m gone. Besides this just being a great cleanser, it smells amazing...naturally! I love that all of the ingredients are vegan and natural because my skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working great so far on my hubbie&#x27;s face.  He has super oily skin and this soap works like a charm without drying out his face.  Very interesting product.</li>
    <li> I am a certified nutrition specialist and have used activated charcoal in the past orally for many different uses. When I stumbled upon Activated Charcoal Soap I immediately gave it a try. I have completely replaced my face wash and body wash with the Activated Charcoal soap and have been using it for the last few weeks. It leaves you feeling very clean but your skin does not dry out. I had minor acne  before I started using this, and with consistent use my skin is almost completely clear. As soon as I finish typing this review I will be purchasing extra for when I run out.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome!  It leaves my skin feeling so soft and helps with my skin issues (psoriasis/eczema).  I have also given this as a gift to my family that suffers from eczema.  I really like that it&#x27;s hand crafted with coconut oil which also has antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial properties.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap before, and it&#x27;s gentle enough for me to feel comfortable using it to cleanse my face as well!  I&#x27;ve also used FLO+THEO&#x27;s other products (Orange Harvest is my fave!), and can&#x27;t wait to see them listed on Amazon!  Thank you so much for making your products available on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this soap because it&#x27;s so natural! It&#x27;s a very unique product. Plus I love the design of the box. It&#x27;s a great gift idea too.</li>
