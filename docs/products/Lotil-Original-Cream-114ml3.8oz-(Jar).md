      <li>In addition I think the original works even better then the foot Lotil for the foot.  </li>
      <li>The 2 tone sterling silver necklace looks cheap.  </li>

      <li>Lotil amazes me at how quickly it is absorbed into the skin -- rather like water being soaked up by a sponge.  </li>
      <li>My English mother introduced me to this product years ago, I was thrilled when I could get it here through Amazon.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent cream for about every use.  My hands are so dry, but it&#x27;s really helping hydrate them.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hands soon!</li>
    <li> Great price. Best hand cream I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I prefer cetaphil cream both for how well it works and the smell. I wake up with much improved skin with cetaphil over the lotil.</li>
    <li> For dry hands and feet. Nothing else compares...and I have tried many many others. I live in Hawaii, with an active outdoors environment, it&#x27;s a neccesity.</li>
    <li> I have relied on this for years to keep away &amp;#34;alligator elbows&amp;#34; and cracked fingers. It&#x27;s not really an &amp;#34;all-over&amp;#34; cream, but is the best thing for those tough spots that need special protection ... like right under your nose in the winter.</li>
    <li> For dry skin this cream is wonderful. Smells clean. I like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My mother uses this cream for every part of her body, and cannot live without this wonderful cream</li>
    <li> Best product for cracked hands as well as serious eczema</li>
    <li> Only thing that will work on my husband&#x27;s dry, cracking hands in the winter.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion/cream.  It is miles above and beyond any other.  Non-greasy.  Absorbs well.  Nice and thick.  Works wonders for seriously dry skin.  My brother uses it to fill in cracks he gets in the skin around his fingernails, and it heals them up.  I like to use lots and lots of it, and then put on cotton moisturizing gloves, and wear them while I sleep through the night.  My hands are like new in the morning.  My rough skin totally softens up.  I can&#x27;t say enough about Lotil.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite things to buy on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a good deal here, too.</li>
    <li> Lotil rubs right in and is not greasy. Unless I am misunderstanding the ingredient list, it does not have petroleum products. It helps keep knees and elbows soft and is especially helpful in winter.</li>
    <li> Not as great of a cream as I expected, however I do have to wash my hands thousands of times throughout the day. It is soft, but I don&#x27;t feel like it absorbs that well.</li>
    <li> Like getting putty out of a jar...</li>
    <li> Best cream you&#x27;ll ever find. Soothes painful, chapped, &amp;#34;cracked open&amp;#34; hands overnight. Great for rough cracked heels.</li>
    <li> a little too greasy for my liking</li>
    <li> Great for my hands and the foot cream also.</li>
    <li> LOTIL gets 10 STARS, HANDS-UP!  I will not share ALL the products I have purchased and used over the years for hand dermatitis.  My dermatologist has prescribed medications that have failed to heal and seal moisture in three fingers on both hands.  To help with the dermatitis, I was given two Cortisone shots every six months.  Unfortunately, blood pressure increases with the use of Cortisone and puts me into physical danger.  Several years ago, I worked for a major vehicle company and worked daily, in a chemical coolant for the production of parts.  The natural skin barrier on both hands was damaged.  Dermatitis resulted, leaving me with painful, dry, itching, inflammatory and bleeding fissures.  LOTIL, used a few times daily, has improved my condition considerably!</li>
    <li> The skin on my hands cracks in winter.  This cream healed the cracks within three days.  Wish I had known about it years ago before wasting money on other lotions and creams that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> The 2 tone sterling silver necklace looks cheap.  The charm heart silver I have not received it yet. The forkolin 500mg, I will order more. the charmed feeling black murano is OK. The gold plated necklace rhinestone and the heart earrings got lost in the mail. The lotil cream with aloe vera is OK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lotil for years. I get cracks in my finger tips and Lotil is the only cream I&#x27;ve ever found that heals this very quickly. It also makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> Could not stand the smell.  The smell pierces my sinuses and is greatly offensive.  I promptly washed it off.  I ordered Lotil original at a friends recommendation.  I made the opportunity to compare my Lotil with hers and there was a difference.  Her Lotil I could wear and like, but not the Lotil I bought.  Hers was a pastel yellow and the Lotil I received was white.  One of the other reviews also noted the difference in color.  The lot # on the tub was 426101 and the expiration date was 9-2019.  So must be a very recent batch.</li>
    <li> Great hand cream for cracked winter skin.</li>
    <li> If you are. Bit older and have dry or thin skin, this cream is a must.  Absolutely fixes the problem. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My fingertips sometimes get painful splits in cold weather. I&#x27;ve tried just about every product on the market but keep coming back to Lotil. It is simply the best! This purchase shipped from London and still got to me safely &amp; in a timely manner, at a better price than from vendors here in the US. I&#x27;ll be back for more...thanks!</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever for chapped hands winter or summer. Have used this for years quality never changes.would highly recommend</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS DISGUSTING!  IT SMELLS AWFUL AND FEELS LIKE YOU&#x27;RE APPLYING A WAXY STICKY SUBSTANCE TO YOUR HANDS THAT IS HARD TO RUB INTO YOUR SKIN, NEVER AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> Lotil cream makes my hands and elbows very soft and smooth. The large container makes it very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a girly smell.  I thought it was kind of medicine-y but It really works.  I would say it&#x27;s in the top 5 best hand creams.</li>
    <li> Leaves the hands non greasy but somehow moisturised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hair impaired and it&#x27;s great after a shower. Just rub a small amount all over and it keeps my head smooth without being shinny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  A few years ago found it on Amazon; thrilled me as I&#x27;m a Prime member.  It makes short work of cracks and fissures on my fingers, as well as softening my heels.  You can&#x27;t lose with it.</li>
    <li> Lotil is great on all types of skin, even sensitive skin. Love it and we keep it around all winter long.</li>
    <li> I have two thumbs that have been cracked at the knuckle for the better part of 8 years. This cream has healed them. It doesn&#x27;t have the floral fragrances that other creams have but the healing powers of the cream are great. It won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why this works, but it does.  If you&#x27;ve tried every other kind of lotion for dry hands, give this a whirl.</li>
    <li> love,love lotil cream! it is the only cream that will keep our hands from cracking in the wintertime.&lt;br /&gt;it does not really have a fragrance, which is also nice.if you have to wash your hands a lot this is the&lt;br /&gt;cream to use!! my family has used this product at least 10 years and tried other creams over the years,none&lt;br /&gt; worked as well as lotil !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lotil for more than 15 years and it works very well during these harsh Wisconsin winters. But I was not pleased when I received my recent order of 3 jars. It used to have a barely noticeable fragrance, but now it has a distinct, harsh chemical smell like something you&#x27;d polish your boots with. It used have a slight yellow color and a creamy texture, whereas now it&#x27;s bright white, thick and greasy. I have contacted the manufacturer through their website and they are imvestigating. Meanwhile, I can&#x27;t use any of these 3 jars - The smell will not go away. I had to wash my hands to get rid of the odor and use something else. And, of course, trash the jars. $33.00 wasted.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for dry skin. But it smells awful - the smell is kind of like an old person home.  Your hands will feel sticky for 10 minutes or so after using.</li>
    <li> This is expensive lotion and it smells like a chemical factory(I think it is kind of nice) but there is nothing else in the world like it. My mother bought this lotion 15 years ago for my dry cracked mechanic&#x27;s hands at a boutique bath shop and when it worked miracles I tried to find it again with no luck. I haven&#x27;t found it on shelves in the U.S. but this product is worth a trip to England (or at least shipping) if your hands have extreme issues. The second best part is that once you work it in it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Consistent quality with every jar. Helps minimize winter-weather fingertip cracking.</li>
    <li> Now that I have found this product, I have ordered one for my office, kitchen, and bath.  Seriously, my hands and cuticles suffer terribly in the cold dryness of winter and Rx creams of all sorts have done nothing but cost me time and money.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This hand cream is the best, takes the dry and cracked hands out of your life, very cool.[[ASIN:B00025WYKC Lotil Hand Cream - 4 oz jar]]</li>
    <li> The best hand cream out there.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the cream but when I received it the package was broken and I waited a little bit too long to return it I believe</li>
    <li> best cream I ever used.  Leaves no residue, no scent, and really works for dry skin</li>
    <li> this product works so well on cracked fingers, it heals quickly.</li>
    <li> I love Lotil. It really works unlike any other lotion I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for 28 years and guarantee it will eliminate dry skin and you don&#x27;t even need to use it every day after the first few days of starting.</li>
    <li> Only OK didn&#x27;t get that feeling of this is awesome stuff</li>
    <li> GREAT moisturizer, really repairs very dry skin pretty quickly. Absorbed almost immediately. Second winter I&#x27;m using it with good results. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good about this product.  I have severe hand skin peeling some call dyshydrosis.  Outbreaks last four to eight months but have progressed to something happening all the time.  Lotil gives me relief by stopping outbreaks as they occur if I apply immediately.</li>
    <li> my feet looks really nice when I apply it thank you</li>
    <li> This cream is almost Magic. Got a great deal with quick shipping on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using Lotil cream for many years.  No other skin care product compares.  My husbands hands used to crack and bleed.  This is the only product to heal his hands.  I love it for the way it makes my skin look and feel.  There is no need to keep reapplying it.  It lasts a long time.  It smells great too.  I love it.</li>
    <li> No cream works better to repair our cracked fingers in the winter time.  This product is definitely worth the extra money!!</li>
    <li> great product.  easily absorbed into your skin, and lasting moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is odorless and not greasy. It has a waxy consistency and dries rapidly. I have never found a product that comes closer to being the perfect hand cream.</li>
    <li> My husband and his family have been using lotil for years.  It seems a little pricy but a little goes a long way.  This cream is a must for cracked winter fingers and I even use it on my face!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream works great for dry chapped hands</li>
    <li> great cream for dry skin,clean scent,not stickey</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brand of cream before and had forgotten how good it works for us. I ordered two jars and use it every day.</li>
    <li> The best skin cream to soothe and eliminate cracked, dry skin I have encountered. And, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have used Lotil for 20 yrs.every winter. I get the cracked-painful splits on my fingers! If I use this every night-no more splits! This is about the &amp;#34;nth&amp;#34; jar I have purchased over the years! GREAT STUFF from England!</li>
    <li> My family has been using this product for years.  As we get older, the skin on our fingertips get cracked open in the winter and are extremely painful.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found - and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many - that quickly heals the cracks and helps prevent new ones.  I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;d do without this product during our cold, dry winters.</li>
    <li> excellent product if you hands take a beating</li>
    <li> Great hand cream, especially for dry hands in the winter.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that will really cure painful cracks in my fingers, which are worse in the winter.  My English mother introduced me to this product years ago, I was thrilled when I could get it here through Amazon.  Shipping was much faster than the stated time, and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> My father used this and it was the only one he found that worked. I concur. I&#x27;ve used this for quite some time. It is not greasy, and works very well. I haven&#x27;t noticed the odor to be in the least bit objectionable. The only other I&#x27;ve tried that is close is Neutrogena Norwegian formula (in the tube). However, I think this is better. Although it is a bit expensive (although here at about $11 it is a great deal compared to most other places) it lasts a long time--you don&#x27;t need much and don&#x27;t need to apply it often.</li>
    <li> Lotil is great for solving my problem with cracked skin on the fingers. I used to have cracked skin all winter long. Using Lotil twice a day, I never have the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Although it was advertised as being a 4 oz jar, in fact it was only a 3.8 oz jar (that&#x27;s what it says on the jar). This reduction has been true for quite some time; I don&#x27;t know why the Amazon listing hasn&#x27;t been corrected.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but this is the best lotion I have every used on dry cracking skin, or to prevent it!  While using it I don&#x27;t have the problems with my thumb or heal that I normally do in the winter. In addition I think the original works even better then the foot Lotil for the foot.  Use to get it from Vermont Country store, so glad to find it here!</li>
    <li> excellent product and quick shipping</li>
    <li> very, very effective.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it a couple of times on a winter finger crack and it&#x27;s fixed.  It also feels good.</li>
    <li> This hand treatment  has a pleasant fragrance and is a thick, white cream that can heal cracks overnight. It&#x27;s one of the few handcreams I usually recommend when someone is complaining about harsh winter weather or having chapped hands from needing to wash hands very frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dogs, it gets cold and dry here, so I need a good healing hand cream. I usually carry Neutrogena Norwegian Formula in my purse, or Burt&#x27;s Bees Salve, but this cream is what I use in the evening before bed. It helps to keep down the cracked cuticles and even split nails. I have seen it heal tiny cracks over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me years ago, and I have since found nothing quite like it. It does not have a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; fragrance, so guys will not find it offensive to apply.</li>
    <li> Really works wonders on my husband&#x27;s cracked fingers. Will continue to buy in the future, winter or in the summer.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat surprised at the condition of the product when I received it.  I learned about Lotil from using my parents&#x27; supply of it (at their recommendation), and really liked the effect it had on my cracked soles and heels.  the jar I got for myself from you, however, was not quite full when I opened it, and the consistency of the cream was less firm than it was in the jar I found in my parents&#x27; house -- it is actually kind of soupy.  I  went ahead and used it anyway, and it seems to be OK -- but I had a nagging worry about whether something had happened to the packaging en route to me, or whether the jar left the manufacturer in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> works like a gem. will always get this for my winter hands</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Lotil cream for years. It keep my hands feeling soft and smooth and daily use prevents those painful fingertip cracks that can happen in dry winter weather.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works on split fingertips like Lotil. I use it nearly every day, year round.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with dry skin and cracking, which I have for nearly forty years, this is the skin cream for you. My thumbs are especially prone to cracking, whether from our alkaline soil, wood dust, or the dry climate in the Sierra Nevada. Even if the cracks have started, Lotil will soften them enough that they can heal rapidly. I discovered Lotil about fifteen years ago and ever since I have kept it around the house.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream for split fingers I&#x27;ve ever used. Love it!</li>
    <li> I had used this years ago, but something has definitely changed. It has not helped my cracked heels one bit. (I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, though, because I tried the foot cream a few years back and that was no help - just smelled worse.) No more wasted money on Lotil for me.</li>
    <li> works wonders, is quickly absorbed</li>
    <li> My husband is a remodelor.  His hands take a real beating and using Lotil is a must in his day to day routine.  It provides immediate moisturizing and protection.</li>
    <li> By the end of a Maine winter from my hands being out in the cold, dumped in the hot dishpan, and surrounded by the dry inside air, my fingers are cracked -- sometimes to bleeding at the  cuticles.  Lotil amazes me at how quickly it is absorbed into the skin -- rather like water being soaked up by a sponge.  And then it starts to heal.  In only a few days of focused usage, I find my hands healed, and the skin pliable and healthy.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Lotil is effective in healing cracked fingertips and the texture is nice.  Be warned, however--it has a very strong scent, heavily almond overlaid with something indefinably industrial, like motor oil.  The odor is most noticeable when you&#x27;re applying the cream and then it recedes, but it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to odors, you might find Lotil offensive.  However, it does soothe stressed skin.</li>
