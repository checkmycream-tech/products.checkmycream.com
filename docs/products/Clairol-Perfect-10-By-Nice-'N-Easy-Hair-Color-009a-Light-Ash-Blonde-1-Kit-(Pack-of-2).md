<li> I was so glad to find it online, since it is sometimes hard to find in stores where I live.  </li>
<li> It promises grey coverage in 10 minutes but simply doesn&#x27;t deliver on it.</li>
<li> Left my hair color uneven, with outgrowth shading darker than the rest and definitely has red tones.</li>
<li> however I want to Go a bit lighter so its not ideal shade for me, but definitly a darker golden ash blonde not light ash blonde.</li>
<li> I did not receive the expected results.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for 20 years, and it was always a long, smelly messy process.</li>
<li> The down side they have discontinued this color.</li>
<li> Too bad this color isn&#x27;t carried in my local drug store but thanks to Amazon, I can keep using it.</li>
<li> I love the product but unfortunately, my error, i ordered the wrong shade.  </li>
<li> and it t is a little darker than I like.  </li>
<li> I dont know how it&#x27;ll be like after a few</li>
<li> I had blond hair already, its thin long and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The bottle has \\&quot;comb\\&quot; like fingers instead of a dumb applicator tip.</li>

    <li> The color is fabulous....but the tube of &amp;#34;shine conditioner&amp;#34; included, made my 70 yr. old hair look 25 again !!! I buy this for the color, but I stay for the GREAT shine of the conditioner included. Great price too. And, no trip to the store, only to find they don&#x27;t have your color!! The only way to buy your favorite hair color....which I&#x27;m sure it will be when you try it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for 20 years, and it was always a long, smelly messy process. But not anymore!! The bottle has \\&quot;comb\\&quot; like fingers instead of a dumb applicator tip. So I just comb it into my hair, all the way to the roots. I get really high-quality color that sets in 10 minutes vs. 45.    In fact, the whole process (including applying the color) takes 12 minutes--TOTAL. Thank goodness for this product. Clairol, please don&#x27;t ever stop making it!</li>

    <li> I love the product but unfortunately, my error, i ordered the wrong shade.  I used it anyway and it t is a little darker than I like.  I will order again but in a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> Been using this product since it arrived on the shelves. Really works in 10 minutes. Does not damage hair and color is true to picture. Even though can&#x27;t get it in stores, thank goodness for Amazon. On a scale from 1 to 10 - this is a Perfect 10.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I love the Perfect 10 ease of use, natural true-to-color. The down side they have discontinued this color.</li>

    <li> I bought this product wanting to get a good color, and that is what i got! it covers great and looks great.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy application&lt;br /&gt;Color turned out just right&lt;br /&gt;Wait time only 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner was the best I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Chemical smell is very strong and stung my scalp a little bit</li>
    <li> I did not receive the expected results. Left my hair color uneven, with outgrowth shading darker than the rest and definitely has red tones. I would say I am now a strawberry blonde. Dislike!</li>
    <li> This is for 009A Light Ash Blonde, which looks on the box exactly like I want my haircolor to be. I had blond hair already, its thin long and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS- *I color my hair often, but this thing made my eyes water to the point where I couldnt open them, it burned in my nose and my scalp too.&lt;br /&gt;*It is supposed to get rid of red/orange tons in your hair- it didn&#x27;t. My hair looks as yellow as it did before.&lt;br /&gt;*Fried my hair, and I even washed it off early because the top of my head started to look platinum blond..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- It did make my hair shiny- for now. I dont know how it&#x27;ll be like after a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use this color again.</li>
    <li> Nice product, only takes 10 minutes and the color is true to the package color.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love Perfect 10.  I was so glad to find it online, since it is sometimes hard to find in stores where I live.  It only takes ten minutes, and the smell is pretty pleasant.  Some light blondes can be brassy, but Perfect 10 gives me what you see on the box.  Oh, and the especially nice thing is that it was not any more expensive to buy it online!</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and quick time for coloring to set.</li>
    <li> It promises grey coverage in 10 minutes but simply doesn&#x27;t deliver on it.</li>
