    <li> The photo led me to believe I had finally found my long-lost beloved Dove Cream Oil Body Wash in Rosewood and Cocoa. So I ordered. Upon opening the shipping box, I was crestfallen: This was not my old favorite, it was one of the newer Dove body washes that I could have bought today at the store! The scent is OK (strong for my taste), and the stuff will probably do, but I&#x27;m disappointed that the product in the photo and the product in the box were not the same.</li>
    <li> I like it but I doesn&#x27;t give you the silky skin you wish</li>
    <li> all of these Dove body wash are great..typically purchase enough for one year..try to vary the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; along with the price when it is discounted...would highly recommend..</li>
    <li> I love this soap and I originally tried the shea butter one, and got this one because I wanted a different scent. I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this specific kind but it leaves this gross residue on my skin and all over my tub. Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it does not clean very well. I scratched my armpit in the shower early on using this product and there was deodorant caked under my fingernails! Every time I shower with this now I have to do that in order to get the old deodorant off of my skin! So gross! I would recommend using this product maybe every other time you shower if you have dry skin, but otherwise skip it.</li>
    <li> The almond cream dove has a great scent. It smells similar to the shea butter scent. I like it and will order again.</li>
    <li> I like it very much and this is the second order I made.</li>
    <li> Makes skin very soft but the smell is too synthetic for me. Just a matter of personal preference. Others seem to really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash!!! It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t buy this product any more because it&#x27;s inundated with coconut oil, which I&#x27;m allergic to.  In fact, most products of this type have coconut oil in them (why?).  The product REEKS of it, and the dosage is almost tripled in this product as opposed to most.</li>
    <li> It is so creamy and the smell is delicious... I love it..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap.  I&#x27;ve always used bar soap, but after using this one and another body wash by dove, I&#x27;ve used bar soap a lot less.  It smells clean and light and the scent lingers for a few hours after my shower.  I love that.  I take 2 showers a day because I love to feel and smell clean.  This is just perfect for that.

    <li> great cleansing wash, chapped skin comfort and some preventative</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I wanted when I ordered this product I wanted another type I was going to return it when my fiancé said try it so I did I love the way it smells and feels on my skin even though I miss my coco butter and red velvet by dove I really like this new sent and a plus he does too it smells great feels great and leaves you smooth</li>
    <li> Im in love!😍The best Dove soap I&#x27;ve used so far🙌👏&lt;br /&gt; P.s. I didn&#x27;t buy it online but I don&#x27;t think that really matters. Just sharing my opinion not this product</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of Dove Body Wash. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this body wash and it makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
