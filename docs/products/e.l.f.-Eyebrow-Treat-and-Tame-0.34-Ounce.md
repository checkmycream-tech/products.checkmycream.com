### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best eyebrow gel ever.  </li>
      <li>The gel&lt;br /&gt;brush is perfect for conditioning after removal of makeup.  </li>
      <li>It is not the best product</li>
      <li>and that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
      <li>but what I wasn&#x27;t too happy with, is that the tube that held the color fiber is almost dried-out.</li>
      <li>Great product, is my color and everything</li>
      <li>Excellent seller and excellent merchandise and fast shipping strongly recommend  it Thank you .</li>
      <li>love this stuff ;; it works great for me ; glenda murden</li>
      <li>im pretty impressed with elf products</li>
      <li>but I just wish there were more product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product, but the eyebrow fix gel applicator bugs me to no end.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really quick and easy as someone who doesn&#x27;t like to spend tons of time on my eyebrows this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Using more gives a darker result.</li>
      <li>I like my Lancôme better.</li>
      <li>Love the product, just wish the brush was better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>No smudging :) and the ash matches my ashy blonde hair perfectly!</li>
      <li>You can fill in with pencil if more coverage is desired.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for making them look natural and gives them more life.</li>
      <li>I am able to draw out the fine hairs at the end of the brows  </li>
      <li>Use the bristles on top of the brush as well if your brows are light or sparse.  </li>
      <li>The thing I love about this product is that I can dispense with pencil or powder and just quickly swipe this wand over my brows, concentrating on the sparse sections, and I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>I like the light brown part...</li>
      <li>Many eyebrow products are too dark for the majority of women who wear them, but this &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color is pretty much perfect for all brunettes and blondes.  </li>
      <li>Taupe is the right color for most brows.  </li>
      <li>Love it, am going to buy one again pretty soon here.</li>
      <li>My hair is currently a light brown right now</li>
      <li>I have nice full eyebrows, but my hair is blonde and sometimes they get lost after I apply my makeup.</li>
      <li>I have dark brown hair and blue eyes, and this color is absolutely perfect on me.  </li>
      <li>I would have actually been willing to buy a more expensive eyebrow gel, but I knew this color would fit me best than what was out there.</li>
      <li>A good tip is to wipe off the brush a little bit before you apply it.</li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to religiously use this.</li>
      <li>I found this item applies easier and stays on better than similar products I have used.</li>
      <li>I really like this!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s good for.  </li>
      <li>I find that the mascara sometimes picks up too much product, so you may have to wipe some off before applying it.  </li>
      <li>It really delivers.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d say 80% of it is E.L.F. products, which there is a reason why I have so much makeup....</li>
      <li>It gives just the right amount of color to define and accentuate the brows while still looking natural.</li>
      <li>(most of which ended up looking too dark after application).</li>
      <li>That said, you have the choice to use more or less of it.</li>
      <li>I think this particular tube was maybe an older product.</li>
      <li>This is a terrific quick way to do your eyebrows.</li>
      <li>This is a decent item if you want to lighten up your eyebrows without having to bleach them.  </li>
      <li>I bought it in ash, which turned out to be darker than I&#x27;d expected, more of a light brown than dark blond.</li>
      <li>, this works just like the high end,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the ASH color for almost everyone (unless you have black hair, then it might be too light).  </li>
      <li>the clear gel</li>
      <li>The clear gel can get flaky when it dries.</li>
      <li>similar products costing five times as much.  </li>
      <li>The color is a natural looking brown.  </li>
      <li>I like it for everyday use and use a nicer brand for special occasions.</li>
      <li>I barely got any.</li>
      <li>I usually brush it through my brows a couple of time for full coverage.  </li>
      <li>I have thrown away my large collection of other brow products</li>
      <li>I might not buy this again only because of the clear gel that I don&#x27;t need..might find something similar in just the brown color.</li>
      <li>It &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;, but just barely gets enough on the brush (because of being dried-out) to use.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my only fault here, the tube had barely any product when I got it.</li>
      <li>Allow time for the clear layer to dry before applying the color.  </li>

    <li> Taupe is the right color for most brows.  Since I have white, sun bleached,&lt;br /&gt;black and brown colors in my brows, a neutral is the ticket.  With the color&lt;br /&gt;brush I am able to draw out the fine hairs at the end of the brows  The gel&lt;br /&gt;brush is perfect for conditioning after removal of makeup.  Bought several&lt;br /&gt;for friends.</li>
    <li> love this stuff ;; it works great for me ; glenda murden</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and excellent merchandise and fast shipping strongly recommend  it Thank you .</li>
    <li> I would have actually been willing to buy a more expensive eyebrow gel, but I knew this color would fit me best than what was out there. Great product, is my color and everything but I just wish there were more product! I barely got any. That&#x27;s my only fault here, the tube had barely any product when I got it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific quick way to do your eyebrows. I bought it in ash, which turned out to be darker than I&#x27;d expected, more of a light brown than dark blond. That said, you have the choice to use more or less of it. Using more gives a darker result. The thing I love about this product is that I can dispense with pencil or powder and just quickly swipe this wand over my brows, concentrating on the sparse sections, and I&#x27;m done. I can&#x27;t give a report on the white end of the tube, which supposedly promotes hair growth. I&#x27;ll try it, but it sounds a bit snake-oily to me.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for here. It is not the best product but it does what it says. I like it for everyday use and use a nicer brand for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I found this item applies easier and stays on better than similar products I have used. This Eyebrow Treat and Tame meets all my expectations. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped.its nice,but the color was too dark.and it gets a little gloppy. I like my Lancôme better.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really delivers.  Do not let the inexpensive price fool you, E.L.F. is a quality make-up line that puts drugstore make-up to shame!</li>
    <li> The best eyebrow gel ever.  Don&#x27;t let the inexpensive price fool you, this works just like the high end, similar products costing five times as much.  I highly recommend the ASH color for almost everyone (unless you have black hair, then it might be too light).  Many eyebrow products are too dark for the majority of women who wear them, but this &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color is pretty much perfect for all brunettes and blondes.  The color is a natural looking brown.  I have dark brown hair and blue eyes, and this color is absolutely perfect on me.  I have thrown away my large collection of other brow products (most of which ended up looking too dark after application). and now use only this.  It gives just the right amount of color to define and accentuate the brows while still looking natural.</li>
    <li> I really like this!  Allow time for the clear layer to dry before applying the color.  Use the bristles on top of the brush as well if your brows are light or sparse.  You can fill in with pencil if more coverage is desired.  And it lasts all day and night.</li>
    <li> i use this over my eyebrow pencil because i have really thin brows. but i dont like looking like Groucho Marx either so this lightens and softens like a dream. im pretty impressed with elf products</li>
    <li> It is empty nothing inside it</li>
    <li> This is a decent item if you want to lighten up your eyebrows without having to bleach them.  My hair is currently a light brown right now but I have jet black blows...this worked like a charm though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat and Tame consists of two parts.  On one end is the colored eyebrow mascara, which you run through your brows.  I find that the mascara sometimes picks up too much product, so you may have to wipe some off before applying it.  I usually brush it through my brows a couple of time for full coverage.  It lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other part is an eyebrow fix gel that keeps your hairs in place.  I was surprised to see it wasn&#x27;t actually a mascara wand; it&#x27;s actually a small brush covered in clear gel.  It was a bit messy to apply and I found that I could not coat all of my hairs.  If this had been a mascara design, it would be easier for me to cover all of my brow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product, but the eyebrow fix gel applicator bugs me to no end.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be buying e.l.f. Studio Eyebrow Treat &amp; Tame again, and I definitely would not recommend it to a friend. The tinted half seemed mostly dried out when I received it; it was hard to get enough of the stuff on the mascara wand to see whether it worked or not. Also, it was awkward for me to use a mascara wand on my brows, but other people might not have a problem with that. The clear gel can get flaky when it dries. All in all, not a great product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting when i opened it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;....but what I wasn&#x27;t too happy with, is that the tube that held the color fiber is almost dried-out. I have a-LOT of makeup and I&#x27;d say 80% of it is E.L.F. products, which there is a reason why I have so much makeup....and that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a good product! I think this particular tube was maybe an older product. It &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;, but just barely gets enough on the brush (because of being dried-out) to use.</li>
    <li> I like the light brown part...the clear gel I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s good for.  I might not buy this again only because of the clear gel that I don&#x27;t need..might find something similar in just the brown color.</li>
    <li> Love the product, just wish the brush was better.</li>
    <li> I have nice full eyebrows, but my hair is blonde and sometimes they get lost after I apply my makeup. This product is great for making them look natural and gives them more life. A good tip is to wipe off the brush a little bit before you apply it. I have also accidentally touched my eyebrows throughout the day and they were still there! No smudging :) and the ash matches my ashy blonde hair perfectly! I haven&#x27;t found a product yet that matched my eyebrows so well.</li>
    <li> Love it, am going to buy one again pretty soon here. It&#x27;s really quick and easy as someone who doesn&#x27;t like to spend tons of time on my eyebrows this is perfect. I love it and will continue to religiously use this.</li>
