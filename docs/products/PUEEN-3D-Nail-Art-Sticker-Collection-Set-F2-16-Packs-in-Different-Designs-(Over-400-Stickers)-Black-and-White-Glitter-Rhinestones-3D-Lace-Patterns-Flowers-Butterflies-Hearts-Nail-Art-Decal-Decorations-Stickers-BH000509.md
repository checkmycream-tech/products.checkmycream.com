      <li>Fun and easy to use!</li>

      <li>I really like the designs</li>

      <li>Something was no good but almost good</li>
      <li>Some of the designs with black details smeared when the suggested top coat was applied.</li>
      <li>will run you at least 4 bucks a sheet these are well more worth my money.</li>
      <li>The stickers don&#x27;t last very long (maybe 3 days) but there are so many that it doesn&#x27;t even matter.</li>
      <li>thank you very much, I will be keeping my eye on different designs that catch my fancy.</li>
      <li>these are so richly package they make you want to use them and with the low price tag compared to sally&#x27;s or other places</li>
      <li>I think it is fun to change it up every few days.</li>

    <li> Fun and easy to use! Some of the designs with black details smeared when the suggested top coat was applied. Jazz up regular nail polish in a jiff!</li>
    <li> I got these for my niece and she loved them, however there should be more for the cost of them.</li>
    <li> Great price and good for nails and toes...will buy again</li>
    <li> Just as described!  Tons of designs.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these got too hot on their way or what, but I cannot get them off the plastic without them busting to pieces! Even using tweezers, they fall apart. So they were a waste of money. Also, the ones I was able to repair and put on my nail smeared when I applied a clear top coat. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Will purchase again great item</li>
    <li> I really like the designs but they don&#x27;t stick very well.  It may be that I&#x27;m putting them on top of gel polish.  Item shipped fast.</li>
    <li> these are great you get a lot of yellow hues with black and gray I have already used some since I couldn&#x27;t wait to and they were wonderful simply apply a top coat after application and they turn out perfect. these are so richly package they make you want to use them and with the low price tag compared to sally&#x27;s or other places will run you at least 4 bucks a sheet these are well more worth my money. thank you very much, I will be keeping my eye on different designs that catch my fancy. also they shipped with no problems in the wrapping not bent or beat up at all.</li>
    <li> The stickers don&#x27;t last very long (maybe 3 days) but there are so many that it doesn&#x27;t even matter. Just put on another sticker or change the entire set. I think it is fun to change it up every few days.</li>
    <li> Nice cute stickers, in colors of black, white, silver and gold.</li>
    <li> I love nail art... these are awesome! I highly recommend!</li>

    <li> I tried this one. Something was no good but almost good</li>
    <li> Easy to use and love the variety.</li>
    <li> Love these-great brand and great decals. Will def buy again!</li>
    <li> These decals smeared each time I used them, once I applied my topcoat. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great Delivery and fantastic product. It came exactly as described!</li>
