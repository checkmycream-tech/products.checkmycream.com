<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for our son and he has been happy with it. It does a much better job cleaning that the other standard toothbrush. Due to the difficulty sometimes of getting him to sit still for 2+ minutes; this can get the job done. It has 2 settings for strength of vibration and thus-far only have needed the low as that is plenty for us at this time. It holds the charge for 3-4 weeks. The brushhead is actually smaller than the standard toothbrush so getting it around a smaller mouth is not a problem.</li>
    <li> My kids really love their toothbrushes and the timers are very effective at ensuring they brush long enough and in the right places.  The stickers also added a fun element that really helped us since we have 3 kids and didn&#x27;t want them fighting over which toothbrush belongs to which kids.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The music is a plus for kids to know when to do the next set of teeth to be cleaned and automatically turns off after two minutes so the kids will know when brushing is done. The sticker choices is fun because you can customize it based on your kids personality.</li>
    <li> i like the service, this item arrive me very fast&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;gladly recommend</li>
    <li> daughter like it very much.</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothbrush!  I&#x27;ve been a loyal Sonicare consumer for some time now...and saw these online and decided to buy them for my kids.  They are terrific!  Great quality and I can&#x27;t really see the difference between this model and the more expensive one that I have for myself.  When it&#x27;s time to replace my toothbrush...I might just get this version for myself as well!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and actually brushes for 2 minutes</li>
    <li> great toothbrush for kids.  Much more effective than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Works great, but the stickers don&#x27;t stick.  I anticipated they wouldn&#x27;t, so not too disappointed, but if your kids care about the stickers staying on, better hide them and pretend the thing didn&#x27;t come with stickers.</li>
    <li> Great song that chimes at 30 second increments so they brush long enough.  It&#x27;s fun to &amp;#34;get to the end of the song!&amp;#34;  Fun, fun stickers!  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Came in quick and works great.</li>
    <li> Helps get my kiddos to brush the appropriate time.</li>
    <li> Very good production, kid very like it.</li>
    <li> I am an adult with a small mouth and always had trouble using an adult sized Sonicare.  Decided to try the child sized toothbrush, and it works perfectly.  No more brush head gagging me.</li>
    <li> Great price for this high-quality toothbrush. The one issue I have had is that the 30-second interval sounds that signal that its time to move to the next quadrant are much quieter than on the Sonicare Kids brush this replaced, which was disappointing for my child.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this toothbrush! I have been an Oral B Rechargeable Toothbrush user for a very long time! Man, I sure wish I would have had one of these a long time ago. Using this makes my teeth feel like I just left the dental office after a cleaning! I know it is for kids, but hey it works fine for Adults too! Highly recommended! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The toothbrush comes with cool stickers for kids to choose. The only complain is that the brush head which comes with the brush is too big for toddler (age 4).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anyone uses manual toothbrushes for key kids....</li>
    <li> Works well for my 11 year old.  He&#x27;s definitely brushing longer!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the tones help the kids know when to switch to the next section of the mouth</li>
    <li> This is a great Quality Toothbrush for Children love it</li>
    <li> I looked at this toothbrush for my son first on Amazon, but then ultimately bought it at Target because they had a $5 off coupon at that time and an option to buy a 2 year Target replacement plan for $4. I&#x27;ve been buying the cheap, battery-operated toothbrushes for my son, but it just hit me one day that I don&#x27;t want to skimp on my son&#x27;s oral care anymore. I don&#x27;t want to be penny-wise but pound foolish. Both my husband and I are long time Sonicare toothbrush users and are super happy with the quality and effectiveness, so of course we chose the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for our son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in case you&#x27;re wondering, it does not come with the red cape. I say that because when I was at the store looking at it, a woman next to me commented on what cute toothbrush it was that it had a little cape and she might have to get it for her grand kids for Christmas. Even the cashier commented how adorable it was to have a cape. Well, that&#x27;s just for the box and advertisement. Not that it mattered to me...I did take photos of everything in the box for this review so you know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not that it&#x27;s that expensive of a toothbrush, but register it with Philips as soon as you get the toothbrush! I&#x27;m all for registering any product especially electronics with the company for the &amp;#34;just-in-case&amp;#34;! My Philips Sonicare regular size toothbrush stopped functioning 7 months after I bought it (the handle would still vibrate like it was brushing, but it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth at all). I was able to get a free replacement without any hassle because I registered it right when I bought it. If you register it with the company you get an additional 6 months on it, so this toothbrush for my son is covered for 2.5 years until September 2017! And it didn&#x27;t cost me but a couple of minutes of my time (and keep the receipt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with the kids Sonicare toothbrush so far and it&#x27;s passed my &amp;#34;finger squeaking&amp;#34; test even without my having to re-brush my son&#x27;s teeth. My son doesn&#x27;t have a problem with brushing his teeth (maybe because I let him watch Kids Youtube app on my phone while he&#x27;s brushing?), but the stickers are a cute plus for this toothbrush. I would recommend this toothbrush in a heartbeat.eth. My son doesn&#x27;t have a problem with brushing his teeth (maybe because I let him watch Kids Youtube app on my phone while he&#x27;s brushing?), but the stickers are a cute plus for this toothbrush. I would recommend this toothbrush in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Excellent! My son loves it.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this tooth brush, It is easy enough she can use it and she likes brushing her teeth.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! My daughter is now brushing her teeth properly. Standing over her while using a manual toothbrush only frustrated both of us. Now I am confident that she is spending the proper amount of time brushing, the chime helps her know when to switch areas making for a better clean!</li>
    <li> Great Product ! Fast Delivery . Thanks</li>
    <li> very good。。Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;My five year old daughter is very like it&lt;br /&gt;Hope to adult toothbrush also offer a discount</li>
    <li> my 3.5 year old kid likes it. And he likes to brush teeth by himself ever since.&lt;br /&gt;the bruch is for 7+ so you must buy another with smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> Kids love it.  Works way better than a manual brush!</li>
    <li> Not bad, but it only vibrates.  I thought maybe the bristles would move a bit. I have seen others that oscillate that would work better for kids.</li>
    <li> Very fast, the United States to China four days, surprise, surprise!  The toothbrush children like very much, also began to like brushing your teeth, but also the children all like replaceable stickers, nice. Happy shopping at a time.</li>
    <li> No coupon offer, the price is relatively high when the buy in.</li>
    <li> very good toothbrush for kids. My son like it.</li>
    <li> The brush heads that came with the tooth brush were a bit too big so I replaced them with Phillips smaller kids size and they work great.</li>
    <li> Works great and kids brush for the full 2min every night!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush to keep my kids brushing on a schedule because they look forward to it.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the second children&#x27;s sonicare we have owned and really it was just a good deal, nothing was wrong with the old one. But we had it for years and my son was bored with the color.&lt;br /&gt;We also use Sonicare brushes for the adults in the house and couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this tooth brush for kids! I bought it for my 5 and 7 year old. I&#x27;m very excited to see how they do at the dentist this time. They love to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used sonicare products for many years now, and I really like them.&lt;br /&gt;We bought this toothbrush for our son, who will be 4 in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The box looks amazing, and my son was very exciting with all the pictures of the handle stickers (it says it contains 8), and the sticker sheets (it says it contains 2).&lt;br /&gt;When we open the box, NOTHING, just a plain white toothbrush, no stickers, no nothing. My son was very disappointed (he loves stickers and color). I was able to convince him to use the toothbrush, but it is very upsetting that the box advertising make a big deal about colors, stickers and whatnot, and it is just not true (having \\&quot;fun toothbrush\\&quot; played a role in the decision to purchase this product)&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  I forgot to mention that you have to buy the children-size brush-head, the brush-head that comes in the box of is HUGE (large adult size).&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary there is nothing for kids in the \\&quot;Electric Toothbrush for Kids\\&quot; from sonicare</li>
    <li> Each of my kids gets a sonicare when they turn 4 years old... love this product, and it really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for my kids and they are great.  It makes it a bit more exciting for them brushing their teeth.</li>
    <li> 5 year old loves it and it works great cleans teeth very well!!</li>
    <li> I wanna give the DHL 5 stars. They only spend 5 days to deliver this toothbrush from USA to China!  I was surprised by the speed of DHL, and i wish my others items subscribed on Amazon will be delivered by DHL too, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves this toothbrush. We opened the package together and set up it done. She loves the sticker.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought these ages ago... really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two children love them. They brush their teeth more carefully and thoroughly than ever, and that in itself is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;sonic action&amp;#34; or the fact that a kid getting a &amp;#34;grown-up toothbrush&amp;#34; makes them do a much better job,... I have no idea. I&#x27;ll give equal credit to the child *and* the brush.  Either way, this sucker works and works well.  I&#x27;m looking forward to confirmation of this at their next dental checkup. We&#x27;ve got some seriously dazzling white smiles going on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got jealous, so I grabbed a spare brush head and use it now, too. I&#x27;ve had electric brushes before but didn&#x27;t like them. This one is much more gentle and comfortable on my sensitive mouth. This one I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it for your kids, then buy spare brush heads and talk the children into sharing it with you - your family will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and as that description.</li>
    <li> Great for my kids, although the free sticker&#x27;s painting style is a bit strange.</li>
    <li> Philips is always a reliable brand.  My kid enjoyed using this electric toothbursh.  It does a much better job than the regular brush.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My girls love this - wish it ran longer - they also hide the stickers in the instructions.  Overall, I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> The grand children, ages 3 and 5, are brushing longer. They enjoyed personalizing their brushes.</li>
    <li> GOOD !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three.</li>
    <li> My son loves that he gets a toothbrush just like mom and dads. He is three sand is sometimes a bit nervous about the vibrations (when he bumps his teeth with the bottom of the brush it makes a loud noise). I do feel it gets his teeth much cleaner than a regular toothbrush and our pediatrician highly recommended we use an electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> works as expected, lovely little electric brush for little teeth, plays little tones and music when finished, my son cannot go to sleep without teeth brushing anymore, he loves it</li>
    <li> love this toothbrush for my boys (4 and 6)</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, right on time.</li>
    <li> Works great but sticker is somewhat annoying to put on.  However i love that you can change the look so the kids feel like its a new toothbrush. Love that kids turn it on and  know not to stop until it turns off.  My 5 and 7 year old love.</li>
    <li> my 8 year old loves got used to it in 3 days and now loves it!</li>
    <li> Kids love these - especially when used in conjunction with Brush Busters, the Sonicare app.  Excellent product. At this price, wish I bought one of these as they are no less functional than the adult version (just fewer bells &amp; whistles which to be honest, most of which I never have used)...great brush for kids or adults I think!</li>
    <li> kids happy to have an adult looking brush and it is great at training them what 2 mins really is!</li>
    <li> This does not come with the very small, compact heads that a 2-5 year old would need. Just FYI. Otherwise, works as expected.  Worthwhile investment!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not just for kids. It makes a high value basic sonic care tooth brush with variable speed control!</li>
    <li> It is not design for toddlers, too strong. I have a 4 years daughter and she always complain that it hurts her while using it. Saving it for much later for now only use battery operated tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it has ten designs for my kid.</li>
    <li> no problem for kid use.. especially like the timer!</li>
    <li> Cute toothbrush to encourage brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Stickers come with it and you can customize the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for each of my kids - 2 and 4.5 - and they both love them. Especially since they got to pick out their own decals and can tell them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the small brush heads on subscribe &amp; save, so they&#x27;re reasonably priced. This is especially important because the brush head that comes with the brush is way too big for my 2 year old (it&#x27;s fine for my 4 year old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer makes my 4 year old keep brushing until the little song plays at the end, which is great, but I do recommend brushing behind them to make sure they don&#x27;t miss spots if you have kids under 6. And you absolutely have to watch a 2 year old with any toothbrush - this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Sonicare. My husband and I have been using the Clean &amp; White (and another similar model) for about 6 years and have had significantly fewer dental issues. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in that time, so these more than made up for their cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that they wear out every 2-3 years because we&#x27;ve been through 2 brushes each in 6 years and are both on our 3rd. Still worth it, though.</li>
    <li> We have a set of the adult ones of these and liked them so I decided to get one for the toddler. She likes it so far.</li>
    <li> Great value and perfect for our child!</li>
    <li> It is very nice!my daughter glad to brush her teeth with it!</li>
    <li> I know this is for children but I love this toothbrush for myself.  I like the original Sonicare but found their brushes too large for me.  I decided to try this child&#x27;s size one when there was a $10 off coupon so was able to purchased for under $30.  They also have coupons  for the replacement brushes. I recommend for adults and children though I think the handle is large for 4 to 7 year olds.  The tooth brush is just right.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to help with teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like! Thank you amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little big yet for my 4 year old&#x27;s mouth.  (And that&#x27;s saying something!!)  He is growing into it though and he doesn&#x27;t complain about brushing anymore because he thinks he&#x27;s an &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; like Mommy and Daddy when using it.  The stickers are a fun addition as well.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and holds up to the abuse my son gives it at times.</li>
    <li> Did not come with the colored sleeves and the brush head is larger then our adult sonicare brushes ...</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush for kids</li>
    <li> Decent brush recommended by my kid&#x27;s dentist. Teeth are much whiter than when we used regular toothbrush or electrical brush from a supermarket.</li>
    <li> My daughters love using it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good, very fond of children, clean brush teeth than before</li>
    <li> My little girl love it.</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR MY 9 YEAR OLD.. THE TIMER KEEPS HIM STRAIGHT ON THE 30 SECONDS PER ZONE ( 2 MINUTE TIMER). THIS IS OUR 2ND SONICARE .. THE FIRST ONE WORKED  OVER 4 YEARS &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bought two, one for my son and one for little brother. Both have had thumbs up from their dentist. Very happy with.</li>
    <li> I bought this kids&#x27; Sonicare because it was less expensive than the adult version. It has exceeded my expectations. I charged it once, and the battery lasted about five weeks without recharging. This would be perfect for someone who travels because you would not need to bring the charger. For half the price of the adult version, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to purchase this model. The little alarm that tells you when to move to the next part of your mouth is cool too!</li>
    <li> very fast logistic,my son like to use it</li>
    <li> Great product, children like it very much.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, comes with standard sized brush head that has soft back on it. We use it on our 18 month old works great!</li>
    <li> Good product, performs as expected. My daughter likes how it looks and the stickers that came with it.</li>
    <li> I have the adult version perfect for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. My son loves using it.</li>
    <li> we finally bucked up and bought the kids their own sonicare toothbrushes.  we were switching heads but that was a pain.  these are great... i love that you can choose your own face plate and the little chimes to switch mouth zones are amusing. :)</li>
    <li> Best way to get clean teeth! Recommended by our dentist.  Worth it to save on cavities!</li>
    <li> My loves it so much except that the handle is much bigger for little kids</li>
    <li> Kids love it...it is sturdy/well made.</li>
    <li> Normal, typical and pretty good. The main thing is that it gets used!</li>
    <li> Worth it to keep the dentist bills down.  Took the kids (5 and 4 at the time) a little coaxing to get used to it, but no problems now.  Variable speed and time adaptation period is really nice.  The brushes seem to be lasting longer than the manual ones, I think because the buzzing makes the kids less apt to chew on them.  Good thing since they ain&#x27;t cheap!  (But still cheaper than a filling/crown!)</li>
    <li> My kids are 10 and 11. This brush works good, but I&#x27;m wishing I would have bought the Oral b 5000 and gotten 2 sensitive heads. These brushes don&#x27;t move, they just vibrate. The Oral B moves in circles and is a better clean, plus it has a screen for them to look at that counts down the time and has a smiley face if they are doing it right. This brush is good for younger kids, but I think older kids like mine could move up to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Oral B 5000 from their dentist for $75. They make a new one with an app your smart phone, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary for kids.</li>
    <li> this one is perfect to my kid 5 years old, he love the brush. We trust Philips.</li>
    <li> my kid likes it very much! great!!</li>
    <li> Love this. Battery lasts forever and it makes brushing easy to do for my 8 yr old. Not a single cavity since our purchase. My daughter loved that she could customize the brush with various stickers.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  My little one loved it, and it does a good job cleaning her teeth.  My only complaint is that the stickers do not stick well.</li>
    <li> Makes brushing my kid&#x27;s teeth a lot easier every night.  Can tell a big difference in the cleanliness of her teeth since switching from a manual brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter is fond of it</li>
    <li> my grand daughter did not like to brush her  teeth. Now I have no problem getting her to brush and the timer helps her time her brushing love it</li>
    <li> Both my boys love these brushes! They were 2.5yrs and 4.5 yrs when we bought them. The timer is a super nice feature :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use, two speeds and the kids love the beeping alert.</li>
    <li> The performance is entirely satisfactory, but the bells and whistles make the brush.  First of all, an electric toothbrush is the way to go for a boy who doesn&#x27;t like brushing.,  It creates the illusion he&#x27;s not doing anything useful.  Second, just getting to slap a couple decals on it gives him a sense of ownership.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old loves this toothbrush. The dentist recommended it ($70 at the dentist office). Amazon was the cheapest by far of the other places I looked. You can&#x27;t go wrong! We had always used just regular toothbrushes and there is no comparison. The cleaning job this does far exceeds any expectations we had. The way I see it is the investment in a good brush like this will pay for itself time and time again. Let&#x27;s face it...cavities are expensive and can be a traumatic experiance for kids. We absolutely love it!!!! Some cool features: The brush is designed to brush each quadrant of your mouth for 30 seconds each with total brush time of 2 min. (30 sec. Each: Lower right, lower left, upper right, upper left). It vibrates and plays a little tune to notify you it&#x27;s time to move to the next spot. That feature is a great training method so kids get an idea of just how long they need to spend brushing. The kids also get to pick what stickers they want to design the brush with. It comes with 8 sticker options (4 for girls and 4 for boys) making it gender neutral. Make the investment! You will not regret it! One last thing...brush head replacement can be pricey if you go with the Phillips brand so buy generic. They work the same (sometimes better depending on brand) and they are a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This is for my son, but he didn&#x27;t feel like to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for whole family</li>
    <li> My kids brush far longer with this brush than any other. Highly recommend this for kids. It plays music to signal brushing time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought. Almost exactly the same size as my Flexcare Platinum. The brush head is too large for my 4 years old boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is quiet. My son easily accepted it. Thumb up!</li>
    <li> Great product for kids and dental hygiene.  Product was priced perfectly and shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> The cover (which can be changed) does not stay on at all, so that&#x27;s very annoying. Otherwise the beeping indicator to let the child to know when to move the brush to another part of the mouth makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> Fighting those sugar bugs one sonicare brushing at a time.  Love the decals and the music.  We trade off as my 3 year old likes to resist brushing.  I brush until it beeps and then it is her turn. When the song plays she knows the torture is done.</li>
    <li> Great for little kids 2 &amp; 5.</li>
    <li> perfect! my son like it very much</li>
    <li> As described. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> great toothbrush.... my 7 year old loves it....it really helps with getting food out of her braces&amp;#34;recommended by her orthodontist&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> Great for kids.Adult ones are too strong.</li>
    <li> Aside from the &#x27;gadgetiness&#x27; of this brush, my son was happy to have an electric toothbrush like his Dad&#x27;s.  It actually makes him want to brush his teeth (for the most part).  It is aesthetically pleasing in his bathroom and feels well made.  The part I like the best is the audible timer.  I don&#x27;t have to argue or keep track anymore.  It signals him to switch areas of brushing and it eventually goes for two minutes.  I liked the fact it works &#x27;up&#x27; to two minutes of brushing over time. It didn&#x27;t do it immediately.  Two minutes for a young one is eternity, but this allowed him to adjust.  Well done Philips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is my son said he wished the head was a little smaller, but he said it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
    <li> I ordered one first for my daughter when it was on sale, and she loved it.  So I ordered another one for my son.  Within 3 weeks, my son&#x27;s toothbrush stopped working.  It is not charging at all.  I was busy last 2 weeks with my son&#x27;s graduation ceremony and couldn&#x27;t do the return until this week, and it is out of return period.  I am really upset with amazon&#x27;s return policy.  If I purchased the same product at Walmart or Target, I will be able to return it.</li>
    <li> Even on the lowest setting this toothbrush hurts my daughter&#x27;s mouth and gums. I tried it on the back of my hand and it hurt me. Very disappointed, as our dentist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my three-year-old. I leave it set to the lowest setting. I can hand her the brush and let her do her thing. It beeps periodically signaling her to switch quadrants in her mouth. It also beeps when it is done. That way, she knows she has to brush continuously until it beeps, rather than me repeatedly saying, &amp;#34;keep brushing; keep brushing.&amp;#34;  One tip: If the toothbrush is outside of your child&#x27;s mouth while it is turned on, it will most definitely spray toothpaste, water, saliva, whatever&#x27;s on it.  The first week she used it, she went to daycare with splatters all over her shirts. We finally started putting a wipeable bib on her while she brushes to protect her clothes and to make it easier to clean up.  Battery also lasts a long time in between charges. Really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Our 4 year old loves his new toothbrush. We are very happy with the performance &amp; the stickers that make it fun for him.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect solution for my kids (ages 5 and 6). I love the sounds that indicate when to move to the next section of teeth and then seem to celebrate the completion of brushing!</li>
    <li> Head a little too large for a 5 year olds teeth but just buy smaller rounded heads for it.</li>
    <li> I think this kids sonic care brush works better than mine.  It gives you a song every thirty seconds, you can pause it to spit and it continues where it left off.  It doesn&#x27;t vibrate as crazy as the adult tooth brush so my 4.5 year old will use it. Although it took him a few days. He also really liked picking out his own sticker to personalize it.  They have done a great job with this toothbrush. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> my kid really like it.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes were recommended by our dentist. Now, our while family uses them and our dentist has noticed the change in our teeth and gums. My kids like that this one plays a little chime when it is time to switch sides. They also love that they can change the look of their tooth brush. Happy kids and healthy teeth, what could be better!</li>
    <li> We absolutely love sonicare toothbrushes.  This is perfect for kids.  My daughter&#x27;s teeth have always been in great shape when she goes to the dentist.  I would like to think it is due to the sonicare toothbrush.  Our family has had good checkups since using sonicare.  We will continue to and highly recommend sonicare products including this kids toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My 9-year-old daughter likes it</li>
    <li> Bought for my son, it really cleans his teeth well and he loves to use it. He has braces and it seems to vibrate every bit of food from his braces. We asked his orthodontist about this and he said he &amp;#34;Highly Recommends it&amp;#34;. It beeps when its time to change tooth position and cuts off after 2 minutes on its on.</li>
    <li> My daughter said this was her best Christmas gift. Seriously. She rejected l received great gifts too.  We love that it is electric and timed for 2 minutes. Everyone in the family had a sonic toothbrush of some sort. Love them. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The kids love these tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Great kids tooth brush. The kids love the decals that came with it for personalizing their toot brushes. There is no chance now that they will mix up their brush with their siblings. Another great feature is the timer on there that beeps 3 times so the kids know when to switch to the next quadrant.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long, but I am really liking it.  I got the child&#x27;s one because I have a small mouth, and the price was better.  lol.  I like the timer for the four sections of the teeth.  My sister told me that an electric tooth brush does a better job of cleaning the teeth, and it does seem that my teeth are looking cleaner....  Great buy, I&#x27;d say!</li>
    <li> Present for grandson, he really likes it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Both of my children have their own and I really loved that this one came with its own interchangeable stickers so that both of my children could personalize their own toothbrush. I love that it has a beeping noise for when it&#x27;s time to change position.</li>
    <li> My daughter really wanted an electric toothbrush, so we finally ordered this for her. She really enjoys brushing her teeth with this brush. She had fun picking out her stickers (included) to decorate the handle, and I love the fact that it has a built in timer, like the adult version, to keep her brushing for two full minutes. We are still having her use the small brush heads, but eventually she can use the larger one. I wish the brush heads were not so expensive. It only came with one, so I had to order additional for replacement. So far, it is working great. I hope it lasts a while. Having used Sonicare products for over a decade now, I know the handles eventually give out, requiring replacement.  To build healthy dental hygiene habits for an independent child who doesn&#x27;t like supervision, I think it is worth the money (it costs a lot less than adult version) to invest.</li>
    <li> Good sonicare and good price， my son like it。</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this tooth brush except for the little music tone that plays when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants.  I like it because it makes her brush for the full 2 minutes.  The compact head is perfect for her little growing mouth.  With this toothbrush I know she is getting her teeth cleaner than a normal brush and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy one of these than to get a cavity filled.</li>
    <li> Best deal on Sonicare toothbrushes IMO.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the E5300 series for years, but the latest buy only lasted a year, while the two of these I had purchased for my kids were still going strong.  Hence I bought one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you purchase the large brush head replacement.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve purchased a lot of the battery-powered toothbrushes for our kids and they always seem to have durability and operational issues. We finally decided to bite the bullet and buy these (we have two, one for a three-year-old and one for our five-year-old) and have no regretted it in the least. The kids love using these - they are far more durable and user-friendly than a battery-powered toothbrush. They keep a good charge and our kid&#x27;s enthusiasm about these hasn&#x27;t waned in the three months since we bought them. These have been an awesome purchase and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> This is our second Kids Sonicare.  The first one died after about 3 years, which seems to be the lifespan of these things in my experience.  We bought the first one when our daughter was three years old, and we had to help her with it then, but now she is able to use it independently.  I like that it encourages brushing for a full two minutes and beeps after each 30 seconds to signal that it&#x27;s time to shift to a different area of the teeth.  No cavities so far, and I like to think this has helped prevent them!</li>
    <li> Very similar to my adult Sonic Care. My 3 year old was fine with it right away. My only complaint is the brush heads are larger than I expected; I&#x27;m no dentist but the head on mine is smaller than this one. The replacements are pricey too.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for my toddler.  She wanted a sonic toothbrush like her parents have and I stumbled across this when looking at other sonicare toothbrushes.  This is a good size for my 4 year old hands and the price was amazing!  I will be buying for future kids.</li>
    <li> I have this for both my kids, 4 and 8&lt;br /&gt;it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I also have another one,this one works better.&lt;br /&gt;kids love them</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 5 yr old son and he LOVES it! The different color stickers that come with this makes brushing his teeth an adventure. Never have to beg him to brush is teeth again hopefully!</li>
    <li> kids are loving it.  Great xmas present</li>
    <li> Great kids brush also has built in timer to change quadrants in their mouths</li>
    <li> Great Seller.Fast Shipping A++++</li>
    <li> Okay, it&#x27;s a rechargeable electric toothbrush.  At that, it&#x27;s fine, though not the easiest to use.  Changing the brush head should be a lot easier than it is.  It should have a simple snap-on or something like that.  This one slides on and then snaps, and it seems to me too easy to damage the part that the brush slides on to.  The brush itself is plain and simple, without any of the textures or colors that manual brushes all seem to have these days.  But it&#x27;s fine, functionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really cool part about about it (to me, as a parent) is that it beeps to help kids learn to brush.  It has two settings, one-minute and two-minute.  In each setting, it beeps after each 1/4 of the time duration.  The idea is to tell the kids to consider four parts of their mouth (top &amp; bottom, right &amp; left), and brush one quadrant until the toothbrush beeps, then switch to the next section.  After the full duration, the toothbrush turns off, and the child is finished brushing.  Of course, keeping a kid brushing the full duration of that interval is another challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that is (supposed) to make it cool for kids is that it comes with multiple &amp;#34;fronts&amp;#34;, and stickers.  I guess each kid can put their own stickers on it, and snap their own front on the handle.  This is just kind of lame, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt anything, so, whatever.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00G5L867C Philips Sonicare HX6311/07 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Kids]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Sonicare HX6311/07 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Kids came with a replaceable panel, excellently detailed instructions, barrel , toothbrush head, cable/plugin, rechargeable battery and several packs of colorful stickers for the kids. It has musical notes, which automatically  begin to play giving a head&#x27;s up to kids and mom or dad whomever is supervising the brushing of teeth, when the time has come to move on to the next section of teeth to be brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are also warned that for all children under 8 years of age it is highly advisable  to have an adult brush their teeth for them. All in all, it seems that the Philips Sonicare HX6311/07 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Kids is a good deal for mom, dad, other supervisors and when they are of age if they are not already, the kids themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 4.5 Stars, which here is 5 stars</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself as an adult because I was searching for an affordable electric toothbrush to provide better oral hygiene. I was recommended this one by a friend who did thorough research and insisted it wasn&#x27;t any different than &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; toothbrushes except for the fact that it comes with stickers and plays a cute little melody and she was purchasing one for her husband for Christmas. The first time I used it, it was like a night and day difference from a my manual toothbrush. My teeth felt glassy, smooth, and clean just like after a dentist appointment! A couple weeks later, I went to the dentist and they said they could definitely tell the difference and said it was a great investment. I&#x27;m so happy I got one that it inspired my mom to buy one too! The two different modes were helpful because I was transitioning from a manual toothbrush to an electric one, so I used the low setting for the first few days before switching to the regular one. The melody isn&#x27;t like in the video, it&#x27;s more just a couple happy notes. There&#x27;s no reason you shouldn&#x27;t buy one of these for your kids and yourself!</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Thetimer keeps the children engaged in making sure they get all their teeth.</li>
    <li> My grandchildren loved them. All 3 of them are 4 years old. Good incentive to brush</li>
    <li> My grandson LOVES brushing his teeth!  He&#x27;s excited morning and night!</li>
    <li> My boys are 5 and 8 years old... Best money I ever spent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to brush a child&#x27;s teeth.  My son always complained about me hurting his gums.  So finally we decided he was big enough to use one of our extra brush heads on our oral-b electric toothbrushes.  Seemed OK but made a huge mess!  So while I was at my dentist I noticed this sonicare one.  It is perfect.  It has two speeds and He can choose his design.  It has been a big hit and make brushing teeth a lot more pleasant for the both of us!</li>
    <li> Great product - refill brushes are expensive however</li>
    <li> bought this for my eight year old daughter and shes loving it so i&#x27;m i. have to buy another for my son</li>
    <li> My granddaughter likes this toothbrush and uses it.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Toothbrush for Kids has pros and cons as all products to. The toothbrush head itself is just the right size for smaller mouths while the handle isn’t as child user friendly. In my eyes this is perfect for children a little older in age – 10 and up. If there’s an adult around to help I think it would work out fine, but in a way that kind of takes away from the whole idea of using this electronic toothbrush as a way to get kids into brushing their teeth more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interchangeable stickers are great and makes for perfect personalization if you have more than one child. Another plus is the timer letting the child know when they are finished. Getting used to an electronic toothbrush vs. a regular brush takes a bit of time, but it’s all about the novelty for kids which in turn should easily make this fun to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all we’re so far impressed and liking the way this toothbrush is working. I have plans to purchase additional units for other younger family members in the future.</li>
    <li> My ten-year-old Daughter is loving this toothbrush, and I&#x27;m loving not having to nag her to get back in the bathroom and finish brushing her teeth. This Sonicare  has a built-in timer that keeps kids brushing for a full two minutes, as well as a tone that reminds them to switch mouth quadrants every thirty seconds. The handle is a little chunkier than I would have expected for a kid&#x27;s toothbrush, so that might be an issue, depending on how old your little brusher is. It&#x27;s easy for kids to set it up for recharging, too.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is one of the best electric toothbrushes, but they do make you pay for the name (and for the wildly overpriced replacement heads). This kid&#x27;s brush is basically the same as the standard adult model, but with a slightly smaller grip. It&#x27;s got a timer to tell kids when to change \\&quot;quadrants\\&quot; that goes off every 30 seconds, and it shuts off automatically after one or two minutes, as you wish. The vibration is strong and focused, and you can feel that it is getting your teeth and gums a little bit cleaner than without the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Tip: If you don&#x27;t need the odd feature that \\&quot;teaches\\&quot; young kids to brush properly the first two weeks---a dubious idea---simply put the brush in its holder and then hold the top power button down for three seconds. It will beep once and the feature is turned off. You can turn it on again the same way if needed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonicare is indeed a good brush for kids, and if you don&#x27;t feel like shelling out even more than this for basically the same brush for yourself, you can simply switch heads on this one brush. Replacement heads can run up to ten bucks or more if bought singly (?...!!), so buy in bulk and save, at here or Costco, where we&#x27;ve seen them at occasionally great prices. For years Phillips said change the heads every six months, but now they say it&#x27;s every three months, all while raising the price of the heads. That just smells like a ripoff to me, especially since the heads look and feel fine at three months, unless you crush the brush against your teeth, which is precisely what you don&#x27;t need to do with an ET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost of dental care, a good electric toothbrush is a solid investment, especially for kids (paid any orthodontists lately? Might need another mortgage...). And seeing as you can just switch heads for each family member, which takes five seconds, the whole family could easily use just one brush, which makes this a good deal at 50.</li>
    <li> My grandson is three years and two months old and would not use it. The vibration is too strong.</li>
    <li> this is a gift for my son,he likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Sorry 4 late feedback,my boy love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son after a recent checkup showed a cavity. It helps him brush the appropriate length of time and to switch areas for a complete brushing. I like that it doesn&#x27;t rotate or move the brush, it&#x27;s only a sonic one. We had a moving toothbrush but he ended up just trying to let it do all the work. His last check up shows improvement in his ability to clean his teeth and so far no new cavities!</li>
    <li> Works well and the kids liked that they were able to decorate the handle themselves.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with my purchase. I do not know what I was doing without a Sonicare toothbrush. I have three children who all share the same battery but I do plan on purchasing another one in the future so my children do not have to wait. However for the time being it  is worth the initial purchase and really does clean so much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Wonderful first Sonicare for my son.  He is 6 years old and we got compliments from our dentist at his recent dentist appointment.  My son didn&#x27;t care for the stickers (they fell off anyways).  We were more concerned with the quality of the cleaning.  It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Our old Philips Sonicare for kids died, so we bought this new one which works great so far.  I&#x27;m surprised the old one died after just a few years though.  My husband and I have been using the same Oral-B electric/rechargeable toothbrush for at least 13 years and no problems with it.  Hopefully this new Philips sonicare will stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> My 9 yr old was having problems brushing her teeth long enough.  With the sounds on this toothbrush, she brushes longer, and moves it around much better.</li>
    <li> Works great kids love brushing even more than regular tooth brush. Only downfall would be the stickers peel off too easily so now they use it plain with nothing on it.</li>
    <li> My children use these everyday and it keeps their smiles gorgeous. I love my sonicare but it&#x27;s too robust a brush for their sweet, little faces. This is just perfect and since we&#x27;ve been using it their dentist has noted a huge decrease in plaque on the upper molars. It&#x27;s really hard for littles to get back there and the constant fuss over a 2+ minute brush is out of my hands with the built in timer. Good stuff. Would totally buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. The timers are perfect and makes sure she brushes the right amount of time!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this. Our dentist had been urging us to get this. But less than a month later, the motor is so weak and sometimes will stop mid brush. My dentist suggested that there&#x27;s a mechanism to stop from brushing too hard, but this was just barely touching it on the teeth. Awful.. Back to non mechanical toothbrushes for us..</li>
    <li> kid loves it, help clean the teeth easily.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush quit working in less than 2 months.  I expected more from such a pricey toothbrush.  I wish I could say we were using it after every meal and snack, brushing like little hygenists, but I&#x27;d be lying.  If you take off the head to wash it every time, it&#x27;s going to break on you.  If you don&#x27;t take off the head to wash it every time, you&#x27;re going to get moldy, nasty gunk under there.  Lose lose.  Don&#x27;t buy this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> A huge hit for my 3.5 year old big kid!  :)  The brush it comes with is bigger than the replacement heads that are available on Amazon.  Both heads are fine for my guy.</li>
    <li> The battery went dead only after one year. And Philips custom service said it was not uncommon.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are great.  They make you teeth feel noticeably cleaner than the average batter powered toothbrush, which is of course much better than a manual one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son wanted to brush his teeth for 15 seconds.  We had to keep telling him to keep brushing.  With this toothbrush he brushes the entire two minutes that is recommended.  His teeth are much cleaner.  With very little training you child can gain good teeth brushing habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are two size heads for different size mouths and different pulse setting for younger and older teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time and it&#x27;s easy for a child to understand when their toothbrush needs to be recharged and put it on the charger themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the old style kids sonicare (with the red handle) as well as this one.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference between the models as far as effective teeth brushing, but this one is very stylish and has many more fun options for the kids to customize it.  If they were the same price I&#x27;d buy this one.  It&#x27;s a very pretty blue that is well suited for either gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but it will pay for itself in how well it trains your kids to keep their teeth clean and also in the few cavities you have to get filled.</li>
    <li> My grandson couldn&#x27;t wait until the brush was fully charged to use it!  Now he likes brushing his teeth.</li>
    <li> My son is Autistic and has a lot of oral sensory problems. His dentist suggested I try this toothbrush for various reasons after he had his oral surgery and it has worked wonders keeping his teeth clean and healthy!!! It&#x27;s much cheaper than buying a Z-Vibe and much more efficient considering I would have to upset him by going in his mouth twice (to brush teeth and then to work on sensory issues).</li>
    <li> My kid regularly brushes without asking.</li>
    <li> Love the different sticker choices and the quadrant timer.  Seems to make brushing fun.  Teeth feel really clean when using a Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 8 year old after finding out he had a small cavity. He&#x27;s had a check-up since he started using this and the dentist remarked at how great his teeth looked. He hardly needed an annual cleaning and his teeth looked much whiter. There&#x27;s a timer so he knows how long he should be cleaning. And it&#x27;s FUN so he actually enjoys brushing!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Sonicare for many years based on the advice of my dentist. I have purchased a full sized Sonicare for my children as well but they were just too cumbersome for their smaller hands and mouths. When I saw this kid sized version become available, I did not hesitate to try it out.  My 10 yr old son is the user of this Sonicare and it took some time for him to adjust to using it. He was not comfortable with the vibration at first but he has learned to like it. It is very different from manual brushing and I had to keep reminding him not to scrub manually but to let the brush do all of the work. Even as an adult, that switches from Sonicare to regular toothbrush often throughout the day, it is something I have to remind myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is rechargeable, sturdy, smaller and kid sized, brushes are replaceable and has a built in timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids version comes with stickers to decorate the handle base but after just a few weeks of use, this is already peeling off.  It does not affect for overall function or use so it is not a deal breaker for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! There were visible results in 2-3 days!!</li>
    <li> I am an adult dental assistant and i&#x27;ve used versions of these &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; sonicare rechargable toothbrushes for years. We always suggest using an electric toothbrush for children and adults because it makes brushing so much easier and it does a lot of the brushing motion for you. This version is, in my opinion, just as good as the fancier &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; versions for most people. It does basically the same thing as the other versions, but is almost half the price. my last one lasted almost five years.</li>
    <li> If added more brush-head , i think it is better.</li>
    <li> very nice! My daughter was very like.</li>
    <li> Because my husband and I love our own sonicare toothbrushes so much, we bought a childrens one for our 7 year old.  We found the head was actually larger on the children&#x27;s brush than on our adult brushes.  We thought the small head would be perfect for his mouth so that was a dissapointment.  The second thing we did not like was that the timer can be changed to go off after only 1 minute instead of the recommended 2 minutes of brushing.  Again, we love the timer on our own toothbrushes, it buzzes every 30 seconds so you have equal time on each quadrant of your mouth.  I&#x27;m not sure why the button on the child&#x27;s toothbrush has a 1 and a 2 minute setting that can easily be changed and a busy parent may miss that the toothbrush is turning off after only 1 minute!  Because of these two issues I wish we had purchased him the same one that we have.  We really, really love the Sonicare technology and think it&#x27;s improved our dental visits!  We will however purchase the adult version for our younger son.</li>
    <li> This is the second time to buy,Its charging piles General with ora-b .Pretty good.I love amazon.I love the freedom and democracy of the United States, I hate dictatorship of the Communist Party.</li>
    <li> Stickers will not stay on the toothbrush. Otherwise, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is everything you want in an electric. There is a beep and shut off when your child has brushed their teeth long enough for the fluoride to be effective. It is designed to be smaller to fit their mouth and leaves teeth feeling clean and healthy. Also, not sure if this will be true for every kid, but my daughter enjoys it so much that there is no longer any discussion over brushing. That alone is worth double the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter is not even 4 yet but I bought this brush as she has the tendency to accumulate plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does wonders! Her teeth are so shine and clean. It is easy and pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my grandson.  He is three and I wanted him to learn to brush his teeth correctly and long enough.  He likes it - he told me it &amp;#34;tickles&amp;#34; and he is brushing his teeth regularly.  So glad he liked it and will use it.</li>
    <li> My son uses this now. However, when he first got it he didn&#x27;t like the tingly feeling on his gums. The brush plays a tune when the child is done. It&#x27;s useful to help them learn to brush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush for my little one.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old enjoys using her pretty &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; toothbrush</li>
    <li> This toothbrush ROCKS!  It&#x27;s much nicer than most adult brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that you should know when purchasing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The brush head and body are pretty much the same size as my adult Sonicare.  My 3-year-old seems to be fine with it, but I was surprised at the size.  Don&#x27;t expect something little.  In fact, I will probably buy this model for me when mine dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Do not purchase based on the design shown on the handle.  It doesn&#x27;t come like this.  Instead, you get a sheet of several stickers that you can apply to the handle.  I actually chose this one on Amazon over the one for sale at Walmart (same model) because of the design.  Could have saved some money, had I know the design was merely a sticker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My son is 11 and I just bought this Sonicare to replace one that he had had for quite a few years. He keeps telling me how much he loves his new toothbrush. The dual speed is a bonus that wasn&#x27;t on his first brush. The color of this one is so bright and clean...and the optional stickers are great! The perfect toothbrush for kids!</li>
    <li> My kids love these and they are easy to use.  Their sink gets messy and the sealed chargers work great!  No exposed metal to worry about getting wet in this hostile environment.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Soooo Bad, just 3 months, the battery is dead which can not be charged any more. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, great price.  Timer good for little kids.  What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great. I love how it beeps if you stay in same spot for too long. Caution:  if your child has sensory issues, it does take some getting used to. I have found that it is heightening my daughter&#x27;s oral awareness.</li>
    <li> The dentist recommended this for our (six and half year-old) son, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so well received by him. He can&#x27;t stand brushing his teeth and always tries to get out of it or at least delay it as long as he can. But with the Philips Sonicare HX6311/07 Rechargeable toothbrush, he is excited about it. And we know he&#x27;s doing the recommended full two minutes. He got to pick his design and loves the music cues. Highly recommended. Five stars.</li>
    <li> works well for my daughter</li>
    <li> Awesome, both my kids (2 &amp; 4) love their tooth-brushes. The stickers made it fun for them to customize their own tooth-brushes too. The base to re-charge it is nice and small and tucks away on the counter easily. Easy for my kids to use, as well as myself when i go over their teeth when theyre done;) Great for kids who arent too thrilled to sit still through the basic tooth-brush brushing process also. A+ from my kiddos and I!</li>
    <li> My kiddo finally brushes his teeth thoroughly!</li>
    <li> My daughter love this. I love that it has and automatic shut off so the kids know when there brushing is done.</li>
    <li> I am very big on flossing/brushing and it was time to upgrade to a rechargeable brush that allows you to switch out the brush head instead of the kind that uses batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Customizable front plate (stickers included)&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; setting for younger kids&lt;br /&gt;-Audible tone lets you know when to switch to the next quadrant and when time is up (2 different tones)&lt;br /&gt;-Brushing time slowly increases to 2 minutes with consistent use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Although you could have more than 1 kid using this brush, there&#x27;s no storage compartment for multiple brush heads&lt;br /&gt;-While it does gradually increase the brushing time to 2 minutes, the initial length of time is really short. I wish you could bypass this option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are very pleased with this brush and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter&#x27;s dentist recommended this product. Price was great and she loves it. Uses it twice a day&lt;br /&gt;without coaxing. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it very very much, now she is in love with brushing teeth。</li>
    <li> Just had a visit to the pediatric dentist and my son&#x27;s teeth have never had such rave reviews from her.  I love that it starts out with one minute and a low vibration level and works up to two minutes and a higher vibration level.  It&#x27;s easy for my son to know when to switch areas with its beeps, and the song at the end lets him know when he&#x27;s done.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This has helped get our kids into much better brushing habits. I love the system of beeps which tells your child how long to brush. My kids also really enjoyed personalizing their brushes.  After a few weeks with these brushes, I could see improvement in their teeth. Much less &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; left than when they were using manual brushes. Battery life is great. I have three kids and in order to keep the counter in the bathroom sane, I only have a single charger out. They rotate their brushes on the charger and it&#x27;s been great. We&#x27;ve also traveled with these and after a week&#x27;s use it was like we had just charged them.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Meets all expectations</li>
    <li> Excellent product, highly recommended by my dentist friend who is also a mom.  Easy to use for my 3 year old. Stickers to decorate the handle were a hit. Not too loud and very gentle to use. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have one of those freak babies who has a full set of teeth at 6 mo old.  He was jealous and fighting for our electronic tooth brushes.  Additionally the doctor demanded we start brushing the baby&#x27;s teeth because &amp;#34;normal babies don&#x27;t have teeth&amp;#34;.  I wish you could make this stuff up.  Well, the kid wanted our tooth brush anyway and sharing can cause cavities in the baby so...  he loves it! He plays with it in addition to letting us brush his teeth.  Makes things easier for us.  And had i know this thing existed, I probably would have bought it for the adults too, because it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing just cheaper.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush two months ago for our 3 boys to use with interchangeable heads.  Our first kids sonicare lasted over a year... maybe 2 years.  After 2 months, the motor is no longer rotating the brush heads.  I have cleaned the connections and replaced the heads but it doesn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Kids love it, helps them brush longer and more thoroughly.  I would recommend to any parent that wants their kids to have healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> my 7 year old daughter was developing some yellowish front teeth and after using this product for couple of weeks I do see shine and more polish on her teeth. Not sure about long term gum health as wife&#x27;s dentist doesn&#x27;t recommend such products as the gum line weakens with vibrations</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality rechargeable toothbrush.  It has a special program for training  children to brush which starts out at about 30 seconds and increases gradually to the recommended 2 minutes.  It plays a short tune at the end of the time.  I don&#x27;t know the name of the tune but it&#x27;s sort of a &amp;#34;TA-DA&amp;#34; phrase.&lt;br /&gt;You can reset it to 30 seconds if it is moving ahead too fast.&lt;br /&gt;The training is on low speed, then there is a regular speed to advance to when the child can tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a variety of stickers that cover the whole front of the handle so the owner can choose a look, and a lot of small stickers that can be used for rewards, or to decorate the charger (or the vanity mirror or the toilet...)</li>
    <li> I received one of these through the Amazon Vine Program and highly recommend it - so much so, I purchased one as a gift for a young friend, who has become much more enthusiastic about his brushing regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare is a brand I trust, having seen and felt the results for years - cleaner, smoother teeth after use. This junior version is a good stepping stone to the premium version, and is better suited for smaller mouths. My son has noticed the difference after running his tongue over his teeth, saying they &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; shinier, a good indication of better plaque removal. His dentist seems to like the results too, noting in a recent visit that his teeth and gums are in excellent health. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for a pre kindergartner.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s easy to use, times the kids when brushing, and I&#x27;ve noticed that their teeth are so much whiter since they are brushing the right way.  I&#x27;m looking forward to going to the dentist in three months to see if this has improved their reports.  My older daughter wants one and of course I&#x27;ll be ordering it off of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my kids, 10-11-12 and no problems yet.  Peace of mind knowing my kids have the same kinda clean I have with mine.</li>
    <li> Grandchildren use every day without being told.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought these for my kids sooner. The dental hygienist is so impressed with how clean and minimal tartar they have now that they use these.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is an excellent toothbrush that really cleans the buildup of plaque your teeth and the gum areas. Probably the best you can do for your teeth outside of regular dental cleanings. I&#x27;ve used their Flexcare model for several years, and this children&#x27;s version works exactly the same. It&#x27;s not too strong or powerful for my 6 and 4 year olds either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as noted by other reviewers, the brush head included in this product is an adult sized (standard size) brush head. See my photo: the left is an adult brush head from the adult Flexcare toothbrush and the right is the brush head that came with this children&#x27;s version. Huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully we purchased the smaller sized brush heads because we intended for our kids to share the toothbrush (interchanging brush heads constantly). Be warned you&#x27;ll need a smaller brush head for more children under 10.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love that Sonicare has these electric toothbrushes for kids.  My son loves it, and it&#x27;s made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> So happy that sonicare has a kids version to keep my childs teeth much healthier.</li>
    <li> kids are brushing their teeth longer now with this than before, and loved being able to &amp;#34;customize&amp;#34; it with a sticker. The head that comes with it is too big for my 2 and 5 year olds so I had to order the smaller head size as well.</li>
    <li> Grand kids love to brush, my daughter thanks me</li>
    <li> The kids LOVE these rechargeable toothbrushes. Won&#x27;t buy any &amp;#34;bargain&amp;#34; brushes again since the sounds, timing, and customization are perfect for kids.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I both have Sonicare toothbrushes &amp; my son was having trouble brushing, so I got one for him too.  He is almost 5 years old &amp; is plenty capable of using it.  It took a couple of days for him to get used to it, but he loves it.  It plays a tune when it is time for them to switch sides and shuts off after they get in a full two minutes of brushing, so it definitely helps make sure they don&#x27;t rush through it.</li>
    <li> This brush seems too powerful for my 1.5 year old but he will grow into it. It&#x27;s worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my eight year old nephew. He really enjoys brushing his teeth now :-)</li>
    <li> This toothbrush for kids really works wonders.  The timer helps too.  My kid&#x27;s teeth are always clean with the consistent use of Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This will be our 3rd one of these. My kids are under 10 and each have one. They have not lasted but a year, then the warranty expires. The metal prong typically breaks off losing it&#x27;s vigor and or the button doesn&#x27;t work after about a year worth of usage. My kids are 10, 8, 6, 4 and they all have them and thus far have never had any cavities when going to the dentist 2x a year for checkups. I wish they lasted longer and didn&#x27;t break as often as they have, otherwise they are perfect to clean. Oh and if you plan on using them for kids, they will probably not brush their front upper teeth because of the tickle it gives off with the ultrasonic pulses, so teach them proper hygiene and use with this to get it not to tickle. Can be used for other things too my wife says. but she wouldn&#x27;t let me know.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to be a kid to get great value and a catchy tune from the Philips Sonicare HX6311/07.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;My kids love it.&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I want to replace mine with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the right size for any size mouth and easy enough for any age to use it.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is great for kids.  I have a Sonicare for myself so I decided my kids should too.  The sonic technology is really awesome.  It really helps kids clean their teeth better because lets face it most little kids don&#x27;t do a very good job.  I also really liked the stickers that came with it my boys had fun choosing which one they wanted.  This tooth brush makes brushing fun for kids.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has children and wants to chase those cavity monsters away.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush.  She says, &amp;#34;it tickles my teeth!&amp;#34;  It seems to work well, easy to use, good charge, and works with my daughters orthodontics.  It comes with stickers for fun designs.  They just keep falling off though.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal but thought I&#x27;d review it anyways.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> New and well sealed! I love it! And my kids love lt too!! I will be back, thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this,  the price is worth it.  Your child will be proud to see how white their teeth are and us parents are just as happy to see how CLEAN they get.  My 6 yr old runs to show daddy how clean and white her teeth are every single time she brushes.  It&#x27;s so great.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush however, the head that it comes with is adult size not youth size.  I ordered at the same time, &amp;#34;kids small tooth brush heads 2 pack&amp;#34;.  The replacement heads are definitely kids size but the head the brush came with are adult size.  I would have given a 5 star rating if it would said that the heads are not the small kids size.</li>
    <li> My daughter has finally stopped asking me &amp;#34;how many seconds should I count to&amp;#34; when brushing her teeth. I showed her how to brush each area of her mouth when the music sounds off. She is more than happy to brush her teeth and no more fighting about it. Great product and purchase! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> toothbrush is ok but the brush head is way too big for small child&#x27;s mouth and as of yet I cannot find the smaller ones - I think they have been discontinued.  So not very good for small children</li>
    <li> My kid likes it. Well see what the dentist has to say on his next visit.</li>
    <li> My son enjoys his new toothbrush and appreciates the audible buz that tells him to change regions.</li>
    <li> my daughter is like it very much</li>
    <li> Only thing that could make my child excited to brush his teeth!  Works as described. Recommended by our dentist. Brush size was perfect for 8 year old. Brush head replacements pricey, but good quality.  I love how it beeps when it time to switch sections and shuts off when complete. My child never brushed his teeth for long enough before.</li>
    <li> my daughter like it very much, and also love to brush her teeth.</li>
    <li> My daughter, Cassandra is eight years old with no cavities, she loves brushing with this toothbrush. The two minute timer is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4-year old grandson and he loves it. It&#x27;s not only attractive but gets his teeth cleaner than a manual brush or a less expensive battery-operated unit.</li>
    <li> Kids love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Great value, especially when paired with the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> I am 5 years old. The toothbrush is helpful and helps my teeth be clean and shiny. I love to brush my teeth with it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush gets 10 stars according to our 10 year old grandson.  We have been saving it for his summer visit.  He is used to another brand, but likes this much better.  The Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush for Kids is very easy to maneuver in his mouth and is ergonomically built for smaller hands.  The brush is a unique shape in order to hopefully clean every nook and cranny in each tooth.  Charging it was a simple matter, and the charge is still going strong.  The timer feature is great, as most children do not know how much time has elapsed during brushing.  He likes the idea of &amp;#34;making it his own&amp;#34; with the different stickers, and the handle is currently wearing the Surfer Dude design.</li>
    <li> I got this to brush my 2 year old&#x27;s teeth. I think it does better job that regular brush, but it would be cool if it played tunes or lit upto keep him interested for full 2 minutes. It would also be nice to have setting adjustment as to soften the speed, so the brushing is not so harsh against his gums.</li>
    <li> perfect! I purchased it for my little kid .</li>
    <li> very good！my daughter was very like it ！</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how fast this came in. My son loves this tooth brush so much. I love the different designs you can choose from. I am mostly excited that I don&#x27;t have to put the timer on every time he brushes his teeth now since the toothbrush itself has an actual timer in it. This was well worth the price I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It was perfect size, shape and style for my kids. I got one for my 3 year old and 8 ur old</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter uses this and works hard to make sure she does a great job brushing. Her teeth are white and she has never had a cavity.</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of electric toothbrushes over the years (Sonicare, Oral-B, Panasonic), but I didn&#x27;t realize that Sonicare made a nice quality electric toothbrush for children.  I&#x27;ve bought my daughter a variety of inexpensive battery operated toothbrushes, such as SpinBrush, but they seem so harsh and don&#x27;t have the benefit of having a built in timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3 1/2 year old daughter has been using this toothbrush for over a month now, and I&#x27;m highly pleased.  She is brushing for a full 2 minutes now, compared to the 20-30 second brushes that she did prior.  It was always a fight to get her to brush her teeth before, but she enjoys using this Sonicare toothbrush for kids.  My only complaint is that the brush heads are expensive, but that is typical with this type of product.  However, if this toothbrush prevents even a single cavity, then the added cost is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added tip:  Do not put any brand of electric toothbrush on the charger on a daily basis, even though the manufacturer recommends it.  They really only need to be charged once every few days.  All rechargeable batteries have a limited life cycle of approximately 300 charges, after which the battery starts to deteriorate rather quickly.  By only charging the toothbrush when it actually needs it, you will greatly extend the life of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been much easier to get my daughter to brush her teeth with this cool toothbrush.  At first we were still brushing her teeth and we would make a game of listening for the beep to switch quadrants.  She is now starting to brush on her own and I feel confident that even with her developing skill, she is still getting a good clean.</li>
    <li> My kids love the stickers and love to use his new electric brush. Never try other brand before, but quite satisfied with Philips Sonicare line. Plan to get another one for my other child. Not recommend sharing because they fight.</li>
    <li> Great for my 9 year old. It comes preset to gradually go longer, to give the child time to get used to it. As with other electronic brushes, you have to get used to brushing with a closed mouth, so it won&#x27;t spray everywhere. My son&#x27;&#x27;s dental hygiene has improved alot since he started using this brush. My dentist noticed the improvement as well.  It might be too rough and hard to handle for smaller children.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect tooth brush for my kids, I ordered a second after it arrived and I saw how great it was. It&#x27;s making brushing much more fun and effective for my 3 and 5 year old</li>
    <li> This is a good Electric Toothbrush for Kid.My daughter loves it and it came with stickers that she can choose the one that she like. It&#x27;s clean her teeth very well good size for kid..</li>
    <li> Really Awesome!!! No more toothbrushing arguments! The musical timer makes it easy for kids &amp; fun! They love using it!</li>
    <li> My son loves it, it stops when 2 minutes are up, so he doesn&#x27;t have to use the timer anymore, plus easier to brush with.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very fond of using it, the advantage is that the use of lithium-ion batteries, charging fast, full power can be used for a long time, it is recommended!</li>
    <li> These are so much better than the cheapies at the stores.  I noticed the difference right away.  I bought extra small heads and am saving the bigger heads for when my daughter is older.</li>
    <li> Great product for kids!</li>
    <li> My son is more willing to BRUSH!</li>
    <li> Wish we would have gotten it years ago, has saved a great deal of money at the dentist already and helped with the brushing poorly problem. I will make sure my boys always use Sonicare from now on.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Easy to get to back teeth and feels like a little massage for the mouth.  Has several fun colorful sleeves to personalize.</li>
    <li> Our son finally turned 6 and received his first Sonicare. He had been using the disposable themed electric toothbrushes, so this was an easy transition. Make sure you read the instruction with your children so that you both know what the beeps and pauses mean. Other than that, it does the usual excellent job that is expected of a Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two models of this brush, one being green and this being blue. From what I could tell, there is no describable difference in performance, only in head and price. This unit accepts the newer style push on head found on most of the higher line of Sonicares, albeit slightly smaller in size.</li>
    <li> the  sticker  has  fallen off  before  the  first  use,  have  not  been  able  to get it  to work.</li>
    <li> Cheaper at Walmart. ($29) It&#x27;s a real nice toothbrush, kids likes it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very similar to the adult Philips Sonicare I use. My son loves using a vibrating toothbrush, but many brands are not rechargeable and cannot replace batteries. This is at a perfect price point for a rechargeable toothbrush that he can use for years to come with only the additional cost of heads.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush for kids</li>
    <li> So we&#x27;ve used these for about a month, and my kids&#x27; teeth cleaning habits seem to have improved.  Another &amp;#34;no-cavity&amp;#34; visit to the dentist for one and will see next month how the other one fares.  To be honest, these brushes are not that expensive.  Where you spend the big bucks is for the replacement heads.  No good solution for that as we are buying replacements for 2 adult-size brushes as well and it really eats into your budget.  However, these really do make your teeth feel cleaner and so far none of us have had cavities since we started using them.</li>
    <li> Now if they just straightened my teeth! This thing is the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good as always, but the stick stands loose, hope Philips can improve it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush.  My both boys (2 and 4) are very eagerly letting us brush their teeth for them, and enjoy the little melody at the end of the brush cycle.  Great toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son after using the battery operated cheap ones for a couple of years. I hated frustrating with holding the button down with the cheap ones and replacing the batteries every month. You get what you pay for. The funny thing is that after you finished replacing the batteries every month this one is really not much more expensive at all, and I am certain it does a better job on top of it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothbrush for our children.</li>
    <li> Kids love them , only issue stickers don&#x27;t want to stick</li>
    <li> The child is very like!Whether the pattern or music is great .</li>
    <li> however my kid didn&#x27;t like it, just treat it as a toy.</li>
    <li> Bought several already, it would be perfect for the kids as the new year gift!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My daughter really likes it.</li>
    <li> My son loved it, and it suitable for children to use, making them more like brushing</li>
    <li> My little guy loves this toothbrush I like the way it  plays a little tune ever 15 or 30 seconds and then it gets longer and longer the more you brush. Also really like that there are 2 settings one for 1 minute and  another for 2 minutes so the you can get them use to it little by little!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, Frustration Free Packaging]] for years, and I love it. I don&#x27;t know why I never thought to get one for my kids, but they&#x27;ve used any number of rotating head and/or battery powered toothbrushes, from [[ASIN:B003CR89FG Arm &amp; Hammer Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Kids My Way Toothbrush, 1 each]] to [[ASIN:B002DGCRNC Colgate Kids Sponge Bob Powered Toothbrush, Extra Soft Bristles, Colors and Styles May Vary]] to [[ASIN:B00BOB89KW Tooth Tunes Jr Kidz Bop Good Feeling Singing Tooth Brush]]. While all of these toothbrushes were adequate, not a single one of them was able to do what this Sonicare has been able to--get my daughter to adequately brush her teeth for a full two minutes. In fact, more often than not, we&#x27;ve had to send her back to the bathroom two, three, or four times to get one full brushing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonicare Electric Toothbrush for kids is awesome on several levels. For one, it has a built-in timer that plays a very brief tune during the brushing time to let kids know when to switch from one section of the mouth to another (the timing is divided into four equal segments). While you can start a child right off with the timer at two minutes, you can also set it to go into training mode. In this mode, the first brushing is timed at one full minute (4 15-second intervals), with successive brushings adding time until it gets to a full two-minute session each time. As my daughter used to brush her teeth for 15 seconds total and then cry when we told her she needed to re-brush, this has been something of a godsend for us. We don&#x27;t have to argue with her about how long she did or didn&#x27;t brush her teeth because the toothbrush does it for us. My own Sonicare has a similar timing feature, but the difference is that on the kids brush the alert to switch quadrants in the mouth is a little bit louder and a little bit longer, so it&#x27;s hard to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I actually like better on this toothbrush than what I have on mine is the way the brush head attaches. On my older Sonicare, the brushhead inserts into the open end of the handle. It can get pretty nasty in there when water gets down into the handle, and some head changes have had me gagging and questioning whether I want to keep using it. With this toothbrush, the head has the opening while the handle has the part that sticks out. This means water can&#x27;t accumulate inside the handle because it would run down the outside instead of pooling on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also loved that she was able to choose her own design for the toothbrush. The sticker pack came with 8 different choices for the main part of the handle, with a bunch of smaller stickers that can be used elsewhere. We haven&#x27;t made use of the smaller stickers (she wants to find the perfect place for them), but she loves that her toothbrush has a \\&quot;tooth fairy\\&quot; on it. I just love that she is loving brushing her teeth--twice a day, no less!</li>
    <li> We constantly have to nag our 10 year old to brush her teeth. I was hoping this product, being an electric toothbrush with stickers, would be novel enough for her to actully brush her teeth without the aforementioned nagging. It actually worked for the first week or so and i was so happy. But then she got bored of it and now we&#x27;re back to normal :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself is good. I like the training program and how it sets up a timer to tell kids to switch brushing quadrant. Physically,I feel though that the product may be slightly too large for younger kids. Also would like to note that once the battery dies you need to throw the whole toothbrush away since the battery cant be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my recommendation is get this toothbrush if you have a kid whole loves stickers and is younger than 8. Because higher than that i dont think the novelty of stickers and electric toothbrush is enough to keep them brushing.</li>
    <li> My son really like this tooth brush. We got him to brush before in our daily routine, but this just makes it fun to do. The only thing that he doesn&#x27;t like is that it is to big for him to handle. But he still uses it religiously. The other is that it is disposable once the battery dies or is no longer able to hold a charge, other than that it is perfect for our son.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my younger boys (8 &amp; 5) did not like the way the Braun toothbrush felt vibrating their mouth. This one is different than the red sonicare kids, it does not come with two heads. The brush seems to be more tolerable to my 8 yr old than the Braun but I&#x27;m not sure it cleans better. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how his next check up goes. The heads are much more pricey than I anticipated. I have yet to buy a head for my 5 yr old, good thing my other 3 use the Braun. Over all I prefer the Braun. The rest of us use the Braun and have almost no plaque at our dental visits. Hope this brush proves to be as effective.</li>
    <li> Was marked as the newer model. Slightly lower cost than what I bought last year, but it turns out it was because it only comes with the larger kids toothbrush size and is intended for 1 child. Other kit came with adaptor for storage of 2 brush heads.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush for the kids - we originally purchased one to try and loved it so much we bought a second one so each child could have their own.  The handle is easy to hold while brushing my kid&#x27;s teeth and holds a charge forever!</li>
    <li> This works good, kids really enjoy using it.  The only problems I&#x27;ve had are that the faceplate sticker peels up a little (I think that I probably don&#x27;t have it on there perfectly straight) and also I haven&#x27;t found any way to adjust the timer on the brush as far as when it shuts off.  I generally have my kids brush their own teeth and then I go in after and &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; them up (read: &amp;#34;actually&amp;#34; brush their teeth), so it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience to have it play its little ditty and turn off when I&#x27;m still brushing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter and it is perfect. She loves it &amp; I really like the timer, which helps her stay focused long enough to finish brushing.  Plus, it cleans the teeth really well.</li>
    <li> Hi! My name is Amy.I give the Sonicare a 4 star because it is fun with stickers,but I think when it starts to brush your teeth it&#x27;s kind of too powerful.</li>
    <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and love it. My kids are 5 and 3 and recently became interested in my Sonicare toothbrush, even asking to borrow it. Needless to say, as a fan, I was thrilled my kids loved it. I was hesitant to spend the money because kids can be so fickle, but they love their Sonicares! The toothbrush has really fun stickers that come with it so they were able to customize their own brush, and the brush itself beeps in cycles to let them know when to move to the next section of teeth. Each beep is a fun sound, and then it ends with a little song. After only 2 days, both of my kids are brushing their teeth for a full 2 minutes! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Start the kids out right! Luckily they were curious enough about my sonicare to be eager to try it. The stickers were a great idea to help identify who&#x27;s toothbrush is who&#x27;s. No more fighting to get their teeth brushed. Perfect.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly as usually.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 2.5 y.o. and brushing was always a strugle with a regular brush.  Decided to buy this one because I have similar and she was always intrigued by my vibrating brush.  Now that she has this brush she brushes for much longer period of time, enjoys it and I feel like her teeth get 10 times cleaner than they were before with the regular brush!  Highly recommend, especially if you are having some issues with your toddler brushing his/her teeth!</li>
    <li> We have been using Sonicare for years, and dentist appointments have gone from the last thing I wanted to do, to actually being a good thing.  We had not looked for a Sonicare for kids.  We just assumed they would grow into the adult Sonicares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great that Sonicare thought of it, and junior always wants some shaving cream on his face so he can do the same thing the adults are doing.  Now he can brush like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stickers that allow you to personalize them are a really nice touch.  To tell my wife&#x27;s from mine I put a big T on mine with a Sharpie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to know the teeth are actually getting clean and that he is brushing for a full 2 minutes!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had a mini-renaissance on electric toothbrushes at my house this past year, with our latest acquisition the Sonicare Rechargeable Toothbrush for Kids. How did it stack up compared to other Philips models? Did we have any problems? Did we like the stickers? Read on to find out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SET UP AND APPEARANCE: I personally think this is one pretty toothbrush. The accompanying stickers are actually neat; surprising since you don&#x27;t usually think of Toothbrush makers as the trendiest bunch in the world. You have to charge the brush after you unpack before use; this will take several hours (they recommend overnight). It was in the Set Up stage that we ran into our first problem: There&#x27;s a weird white plastic panel meant to fit onto the front of the brush. You&#x27;re supposed to apply whatever sticker you like and then pop the panel into place. For the life of me, I could not get that panel to fasten onto the brush. It just doesn&#x27;t fit. The panel does not seem to serve any purpose at all, other than a place to apply stickers. Strange. On another topic, I feel for the price point this brush should come with an extra brush head, especially since it&#x27;s a kid&#x27;s product and things do happen, like brush heads disappearing down a drain or what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE: The brush, like many Sonicare products, starts off with a \\&quot;low\\&quot; brush speed that increases with each use until a person is accustomed to the brush action. In my opinion, the brush is too forceful even at the beginning stages (I also feel this way about the last two Sonicare products I&#x27;ve tested; the one I&#x27;m using now rattles my head). My little charge tried it once, freaked out, then refused to use it again. It is only with much coaxing that I can get her to turn it on for a minute or so, then she shuts it off and uses it like a regular toothbrush (she loves the way it looks, however).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTROLS: Though there are only three, the control buttons are not intuitive and you will have to read the manual carefully to figure out how to use the features. There is a nice built-in timer that chimes when a two-minute brush cycle is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: I am very convinced of the superiority of electric toothbrushes in general, and in terms of cleaning power I think Sonicare an outstanding brand. Plaque levels especially are much easier to control. I feel it is absolutely worth it to get an electric toothbrush for your kids, as it will probably save you (and them) much grief down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, a great idea, if you can get your kids to use it. I don&#x27;t think the brush force is a hazard in anyway, I just think, especially for younger kids, the vibrating brush might be intimidating. The speed really should start out slower and gentler. I think for the price point extra brush heads should be included. I think someone needs to rethink that plastic front panel. I think all my thinking will cost Philips one star and earn them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING: Bnual carefully to figure out how to use the features.

    <li> My daughter loves her new toothbrush. As an adult sonicare toothbrush user, I figured this one would be great for her teeth and I was right! She and I both noticed a difference between her previous (cheaper) electronic toothbrushes and this one.</li>
    <li> Our toddler is 2 and does love the &amp;#34;tickle toothbrush&amp;#34; as do we.  I choose the Sonicare over OralB because I thought it would be more gentle for little gums and this combined with their Compact Kids Brushhead (sold separately) is just the ticket.  We are, without a doubt, able to much more effectively clean her teeth in the short time she permits us to do so.  I was a bit disappointed that the handle wasn&#x27;t any smaller than our adult size Oral-Bs, in fact it is a bit taller so it is not as easy for her to manage alone as I had hoped (she gets time to brush after we do the first round)</li>
    <li> I really like it. Replaced an older one we had. The only complaint is that the alert tone at 30 sec intervals is really quiet compared to the older model and hard to hear.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works fine. My son has been using it for nearly 3 years and likes it.  The two stars is for the short life.  Our second replacement one just broke down, again, after a little more than one year&#x27;s usage.  Why can&#x27;t it last a little longer? For this price, it should have lasted much longer than my oral-B.</li>
    <li> my son love it, it will help him to eliminate dental plaque.</li>
    <li> This is so much cheaper that the grownups version.  Heads are interchangeable. Why didn&#x27;t I get this for myself?!?</li>
    <li> My 6 year old son loves it.</li>
    <li> This works well and has a smaller head which is good for tinier mouths, but the handle is a bit thick for one-handed use for tiny hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of swapping out stickers is a big hit, but I am sure it will look a bit grungy after a while, I will post updates as we use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a Sonicare this is at a good price point and a great way to start good oral hygiene in small kids.</li>
    <li> This product is a minor update to the [[ASIN:B002CVTVUA Philips Sonicare HX6311/02 Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] that Phillips released several years ago. All the same features are here, from what I can tell, and the changes are only cosmetic. The revision is so minor that it doesn&#x27;t even have its own model number. Only the number after the slash has changed (from 02 to 07).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the silly camelCased marketing terms (KidTimer, KidPacer), it&#x27;s the same product as the older revision. Two power modes let your child ease into the brushing experience. For new Sonicare users, they may feel some tingling in their gums. This goes away after a few days as the gums adjust to the new sensation. The KidPacer (QuadTimer for the adult line) stops and beeps to tell your child to move on to another section of his or her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Sonicare line and own 3 other toothbrushes (I keep one at the office, home, parent&#x27;s home when I visit). My dentist recommnends Sonicare as well. Their kids line offers the same quality construction and ease of use as the adult lines. The charger base is interchangeable and usable with other Sonicare products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare for years and love the ease and cleanliness I get as well as the stellar dental visits after what seems like so little effort. I know some don&#x27;t care for the high frequency vibration but once you get used you it a manual brush or even motorized brush seems to do so little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has had several poor dental reviews and is devastated to hear the news each time. She was anxious to give this brush a try. It took a little getting used to but she now finds it essential and even takes it for sleepovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have given the stickers positive points, I have to say I was not impressed. It seems the idea was originally to have optional faceplates as the sticker area is recessed and they provide one white faceplate. Once applied, the stickers sit in a recessed area that seems to need a clear cover as the stickers tend to peel and curl on the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter wanted me to say that she wished the brush had a startup timer So she could put on tooth paste, hit the power button, and it would tick/beep a countdown till startup so she had time to get the brush in her mouth before it started buzzing away and flinging toothpaste all over the place. Of course as an adult the easy solution is to turn it on after you put it in your mouth. She likes being able to see the button and finds it difficult to press once it is in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great brush with built in timer to encourage zone brushing and a full 2 min of time. Brushing is effortless, just float the brush over your teeth and gums and your dental visits will likely get you great reviews from your hygienist</li>
    <li> I have two children, and they&#x27;ve been using the previous model of this toothbrush, [[ASIN:B002CVTVUA Philips Sonicare HX6311/02 Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], for almost two years. We originally started with Sonicare for Kids at our dentist&#x27;s recommendation, and since we made the switch, have had nothing but positive comments from our dental hygenists about how well the kids are brushing. Sonicare makes it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this new version of Sonicare for Kids is almost identical to the previous model. It&#x27;s blue instead of red, and comes with eight new faceplates to let your child personalize, but it has the same physical body, uses the same charger and toothbrush heads, and - as far as I can tell - has the same motor inside as the previous model. It gives you the option of two different levels of vibration, and features a two-minute timed brushing cycle with beeps every 30 seconds to remind you to switch the brush to a new quadrant of your mouth. If your child has never used a sonic toothbrush before, I highly recommend starting at the lower level of vibration - it&#x27;s very tickly till you get used to it - and using the training setting, which starts out with shorter brush cycles and gradually builds up to the full two minutes of brushing over a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Sonicare hasn&#x27;t made too many changes to their wonderful toothbrush, there are a couple of minor differences worth mentioning. First, the beeps that let you know when it&#x27;s time to change where you&#x27;re brushing play much, much more softly than on the old model, and that&#x27;s a change that I love. On the negative side, while the former toothbrush came packaged with two different sized brush heads - one smaller sized for kids age 4-7, and one larger sized for kids age 7-10 - this new model came with only the larger sized head. That&#x27;s probably okay if you have an older child, but if you have a younger one, I highly recommend trying out the smaller sized \\&quot;Compact\\&quot; head,[[ASIN:B00G5L89JM Philips Sonicare HX6032/94 2 Piece Kids Brush Head, Compact]]. My 11 year old son has been using the larger brush heads for several years, but I greatly prefer the smaller heads for my 7 year old, because they fit in her little mouth so much better.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is marketed for kids. It comes with a removable faceplate upon which you can choose different stickers. I worried when I saw the stickers that the wet environment would mess them up, but since they go UNDER the clear plastic removable front panel, they have held up fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the brush is pretty similar to any other sonicare brush. I have 3 others. All my family members use them and I have them in different bathrooms just so we can be more inclined to brush our teeth more than when we are upstairs in the morning and night. The brush DOES have a setting for a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; sonic experience for younger kids who may find the other setting too much. My kids never had that problem. It also has a little electronic &amp;#34;musical&amp;#34; noise after each of the 4 timed periods. You are supposed to concentrate on one quadrant for 30 seconds, then move on to the other three. So after 30 seconds, you get a little jingle. Then after one minute, you get a slightly longer jingle...then after 1:30 a longer one...then one more sound and the thing shuts off. I am not sure the sound will entice my kids to WANT to go get the toothbrush, but it does help with making sure you hit each part of your mouth with sufficient time. I have another sonicare toothbrush without any sound...and I really miss it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it for myself actually. The brush head is nice an small (which I like) and it holds its charge WELL. I really only charge it once every few weeks. You can keep it in the charger stand, but we really don&#x27;t have room for that so I keep that in the linen closet until we need to charge overnight. It also has a nice little cap that keeps the head covered when you aren&#x27;t using it. Overall, it think it is a very nice brush.</li>
    <li> These are great.  We ordered three.  They come with a bunch of different stickers to each kid customized their own. Same attachment as ours so we can all buy the same head.  Work well and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what I was getting until it arrived.  The images you see all come with the toothbrush, it&#x27;s just a sticker of your choice, which was a relief.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was getting something cheap when I bought this at over 50% off.  It is a  solid toothbrush for my kiddo.  I missed out on the sale for my son!  I&#x27;ll have to keep watching.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for kid</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome!  Makes brushing my three year old&#x27;s teeth so much easier. And I used the larger toothbrush head on myself, and it did an excellent job cleaning my teeth. Only caution is to be sure to purchase the small sized toothbrush head if buying for a younger child as it does not come with this package.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; toothbrush is that it is not designed for kids, at least not when it comes to dental hygiene. A four year old&#x27;s mouth is not the size of a 40 year old&#x27;s mouth. An adult-sized brush does not fit well between the inside of the mouth and the teeth of a child. The heads on this brush are identical to the Philips heads for adults. This brush may have bells and whistles and a bunch of stickers, but Philips is not concerned whether your child&#x27;s teeth are cleaned properly.</li>
    <li> Ever since my husband and I got Sonicares for ourselves, our kids (9 and 7) have been asking if they could both get one too. I know from how much cleaner my teeth have been during my last two dental appointments (less staining from coffee/tea and a lot less plaque behind my lower front teeth) that these toothbrushes work, but I was worried that our kids weren&#x27;t ready to use them as instructed. (Okay, I&#x27;ll be honest. I didn&#x27;t want toothpaste flying all over the bathroom if they didn&#x27;t keep the brushes in their mouths.) Anyway, my kids both got one of these for Christmas, and they are working out just fine. No toothpaste flying out of their mouths--yet. The best thing about this product is the timer that beeps every thirty seconds, telling the user to move on to another quadrant of the mouth. I had to explain to the 7 year old how to divide his mouth into quadrants but he got the hang of it quickly. Not only does this timer ensure that all teeth get a good scrub, but it also keeps kids engaged while they wait for the beep. They just don&#x27;t have time to mess around because they&#x27;re too busy waiting for the beep! Another cool thing about the Sonicare for kids is the decorative clings. These easy-to-apply stickers are fun and ensure that my kids won&#x27;t get their toothbrushes mixed up.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very happy with the brush and fondly uses it twice a day. So far the experience has been great.</li>
    <li> Great! Sonicares all around in this family</li>
    <li> My 7 and 9-year old loved theirs!</li>
    <li> Love!  My daughter is brushing MUCH better now.  Has stages to get your child used to brushing.  Starts out with light pressure and 1 minute of brushing and gradually increases to a bit more pressure and 2 minutes.  Can start out at higher level if you want.  Beeps periodically to tell child to move to next quadrant of mouth and plays a tune at the end to congratulate them for doing a great job.</li>
    <li> Good size head for small mouths, fun colors, easy to operate. Our 18 mo old can brish his teeth by himself with it (though we supervise and mom and dad take a turn brushing his teeth too ;)</li>
    <li> Works well.  Grandkids actually are asking to brush their teeth!</li>
    <li> Item way as expected.</li>
    <li> Kids love them, worst really well</li>
    <li> Bought in August of 2014. My son is very excited about his new tooth brush, Actually wants to brush his teeth before bed. The brush was recommended by our family dentist. I think it works well and I like that it chimes a little tune every time he needs to brush a different row of his teeth. 1 less star because the sticker was a little pain, but not to bad, I also wish they were changeable plastic pictures or decals instead of stickers, so my daughter and son could share one brush by just easily changing the shell and the tooth brush heads.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are the best ones available and if you are not using one you need to get with the times! My kids all have them and they get great check ups since they like brushing with the sonicare.</li>
    <li> I buy this for son , but missing brush head. Very disappointed！！</li>
    <li> Good children like brushing toothbrush</li>
    <li> my daught likes it so much .</li>
    <li> Delivery system is good!&lt;br /&gt;Form US to Nanjing just four days !&lt;br /&gt;Surprise to me,in the past ,this always be two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:Hope more and more goods can be deliver to China directly!</li>
    <li> This is great for kids. I even use one on our 2 year old and have noticed a huge improvement. It shuts off automatically so kids know how long to brush. It has 2 speeds and that is nice for the little guys.</li>
    <li> shipped so fast.MY daughter likes it very much.</li>
    <li> My 13 yr old son has braces and needed a little something extra to keep his teeth clean. He decided not to add a sticker on the front so it looks just like a smaller version of my adult Sonicare. The timer reminds him to brush the full two minutes without sounding childish in tone. The smaller brush can get around all of his brackets and behind his teeth. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> son loves it, brushing is not a battle anymore.</li>
    <li> Works great and is cute.</li>
    <li> works great keeps her brushing</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. My kids are happy to brush their teeth and I love how it lets them know when to move to the next section of teeth.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old son uses this along with regularly flossing per his Dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  The toothbrush does not start at full power but over time increases to full to allow teeth and gums to get accustomed to.  It comes with different sticker face plates that are easy to stick but unfortunately start to peel off over time.  Not a big deal at all.  The brush time is 2 minutes and makes a sound every 30 seconds to remind you to change the part of the mouth you are brushing.  For instance, top teeth, bottom, front, inside.  When the battery runs low it flashes and beeps.  The charging standing is easy and convenient and quickly charges the toothbrush.  When charging, the light flashes and stays solid when charged.  This is a fabulous toothbrush that my whole family uses.  And, I was surprised that the warranty extends to 2.5 years if you register.  Now that&#x27;s a company stands by their products considering that if you brush 2x day that&#x27;s over 720 brushes for the year!  You do the math.  Another great thing is that the brush heads that fit the adult brushes fit this model also.  Only con is the brush heads are kinda expensive but last 3 months or more.  I recommend when brushing do not press too hard on the teeth, let the brush do all the work.</li>
    <li> Works great. The kids love it after using it a few times.</li>
    <li> These really should come with the small kid size brush heads. The heads that it comes with are too large for my kids and to buy the smaller heads, you are looking at about $20-$25. No one wants to spend that kind if money after paying $50 for the toothbrush! Otherwise, it works well and is nice. The stickers never stay on though, and while the idea of personalizing it is nice, it would be better if they just came in a kid friendly pattern and they ditched the stickers.</li>
    <li> The kids love using these toothbrushes. The actually brush without being asked a million times!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. I replaced my Oral-B sonic complete because it stopped working. I am an adult and it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use those colorful pictures in front - they are removable.</li>
    <li> It is GOOD! My daughter love it.</li>
    <li> Good quality and good price.</li>
    <li> Just right for my kids and powerful enough to clean their teeth thoroughly.  They love the stickers and the ability to change the face plate.  A must have to keep the dentist away!</li>
    <li> My young daughter loves the toothbrush.  She likes it so much that she is brushing her teeth on her own.</li>
    <li> It was for my grandson he loves it thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to use as a travel brush because it is a little smaller than my regular Sonicare and if I lose it traveling it would not be hugely expensive to replace. So I tried it out and I like it much better than my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Sonicare that cost a fortune. This brush has separate buttons for on/off and brushing mode. So I don&#x27;t have to push the on/off button multiple times to cycle through the modes. The handle is covered in a rubbery material that is easier to hold on to when it is wet and the on/off button is raised so I don&#x27;t hit it accidentally. So this has become my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Sonicare.</li>
    <li> My kids love them.  I think the stickers could stick a little better but overall great product.</li>
    <li> just as good as the adult version</li>
    <li> While this is a great toothbrush to help kids brush better, the only downfall is the cosmetic design. The face plate is a terrible idea. Great in thought, bad in actuality. Toothpaste, water, and who knows what else gets into the crevices of the faceplate and starts to build up and eventually create gunky moldy buildup. Same goes for the rubber type body ie: the top of the toothbrush where you connect the head. My 10 &amp; 8 yr old sometimes aren&#x27;t the greatest at completely rinsing off their toothbrushes. I think if they were designed with the sleek hard plastic like the adult brushes then there wouldn&#x27;t be a problem with nasty buildup. Even when they do rinse their brushes completely it still get build up.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I think they are great! I just may buy my kids the adult toothbrushes and trash these.</li>
    <li> I like Sonicare. But the brush head that comes with this is for 7 years old or older. I had to purchase a smaller brush head from Walmart (way cheaper than any other places).</li>
    <li> This item is way overpriced.  I just found it online at Philips direct for $50.00 with free shipping.  That right there saves you $25.00.  Just search for this item in google to find it.</li>
    <li> this was a replacement for an older model that broke after 3 years. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the stickers come off pretty easy</li>
    <li> My wife and I swear by Sonicare, but had been buying those $6 spin brushes for my 2.5 year old. He kept either destroying the bristles or the batteries would die quickly, so those spin brushes were very wasteful. For the cost of a few of those spin brushes and replacing some batteries you can buy this brush and NEVER have to replace batteries, or throw away a perfectly good motor and handle etc. and it does a much better job cleaning. In other words, it pays for itself quickly and is not as wasteful. The brush heads are a little more expensive than buying a new manual brush, but you get what you pay for with this.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest tooth brush ever. I held off for years because it was so expensive. The price came down this year and I bought two for my kids. They enjoyed decorating them. The brushes work great. I did buy smaller heads for my 8 year old (Philips Sonicare HX6032/94 2 Piece Kids Brush Head, Compact)  but the heads that came with the brushes work great for my 11 year old. The brush gives a pulse to indicate they have to switch to a different area of their mouth. It also helps keep them brushing longer.</li>
    <li> I love it, the kids love it.  Their teeth are doing fantastic.  Can&#x27;t wait for the next dentist appointment to report that the kids are brushing their teeth for a full 2 mins 2x a day!!!  (now the toothbrush makes sure they brush correctly and for the right amount of time… not me standing there… ha ha)</li>
    <li> This got my 3 year old to brush his teeth thoroughly and patiently. The timer on the brush gradually prepped my son to brush to two minutes. My son no longer fights with me when it comes to time brushing his teeth. Worth every penny. Best of all, I got this toothbrush at a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> it is good for me and my son.</li>
    <li> Just as good as my adult Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush makes brushing easy for young children.  My kids get compliments from their dentist for their hygiene.  Would recommend for all ages for quality teeth brushing hygiene.</li>
    <li> I am an adult, but I purchased this electric toothbrush after my dentist told me that I was brushing my teeth too hard, causing the enamel to wear.  I have an unusually small mouth, so this size is perfect for me, and it is easy to reach the back molars.  When I take x-rays, I have to use baby plates.  I recommend this toothbrush to anyone who is a child or who has a small mouth.  The music can be turned off, but I like it!</li>
    <li> I am an avid sonicare user and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this for my son! Works well and makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting his teeth very clean. It beeps so my son knows when to move to a new section and he knows to &amp;#34;brush until it sings&amp;#34; so he gets his full 2 minutes of brushing. The battery is rechargeable and comes with a charger. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Awesome Electric toothbrush for the price!! I bought these for my kids they have absolutely loved them. I am at peace now as I feel my kids are taking better care of their teeth!! I love the 2 minute timer on it!! Not brushing their teeth long enough can no longer be an excuse as they have a timer keeping track for them!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 2 year old</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. $20 cheaper than same product being sold by our dentist.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush always make my childs teeth clean.</li>
    <li> i can,t personally rate this product as I had it sent to my granddaughter in Australia but she loved it so that,s all I got to go buy</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter&#x27;s first trip to the dentist wasn&#x27;t so pleasant.  We found out she had 2 cavities.  The dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare and so glad we purchased this.  It used to be a nightmare to get her to brush her teeth but since buying this, she actually wants to brush her teeth.  I love that it plays music when she has to switch to another side of her mouth so I feel certain that she is doing a good job brushing her teeth.  Little sister and her share the same toothbrush but switch the heads.  It saved me a little bit of money just buying them 2 different heads for the same toothbrush (little sis has a smaller head replacement so they can tell the difference).  At the last dentist check, no cavities...so this toothbrush is working!</li>
    <li> DHL shipping is very fast, good quality, very cartoon stickers, noise is very small, child very like!</li>
    <li> good sonicare for the money!  My kids&#x27; dentist said their teeth look cleaner since we started using it!</li>
    <li> Got 2 of these for elementary aged kids with braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job cleaning the braces, which tend to get clogged up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as my adult one, but it works for now and helps my niece clean her teeth better.</li>
    <li> way better than expected</li>
    <li> I bought this for Walmart, so, I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like buying from the online seller. I was frustrated that they said that you could get a warranty, for which I paid 3 extra dollars, but didn&#x27;t mention you have to save the receipt (purely mentioned, register it online - which I did with Philips but, they too I think require a receipt). At any rate, this isn&#x27;t the only problem. The thing appears to just vibrate (but not actually move perceptibly), and either it&#x27;s a really terrible design, or it&#x27;s broken and just vibrating but not actually enough to actually say, clean a tooth. We knew it was different from the Oral B we use (but idiotically were attracted to the stickers, as our son is too - who loves it despite it&#x27;s brokenness) - but, it&#x27;s a major disappointment to see it not have ANY side to side motion. It&#x27;s like putting a vibrator bullet in your mouth and hoping your mouth gets clean. I think the actual tooth brush vibrates more than the head....      UPDATE: So, I think my review just got worse somehow - because I contacted the Philips online chat (they have no email, how indecent) - and, the agent flat out lied to me saying that the brush is not intended to move laterally AT ALL - not even a little bit. I took a video showing how the brush didn&#x27;t appear to do anything - not even buzz significantly - and he said that was the intended design. I found the video here of it ACTUALLY moving and am intending to go in for Store Credit at Walmart to get another one. I&#x27;m not sure how to get them to take it out of the box to verify that it is working so I don&#x27;t keep having to returning this until I find one that HAS NOT BEEN DROPPED. According to another article, Philips tooth brushes are extremely prone to breaking if they are dropped in handling (i.e, good luck with this at Walmart - I would imagine online shipping would be worse). It&#x27;s one thing to get a broken tooth brush; it&#x27;s another to have the company deny it. I am also pissed at Walmart for telling me the registration was purely online and required no receipt (but I guess they can look it up ex post facto). Fun times. Unfortunately my son loves it, broken as it is. Therefore I&#x27;m stuck with this brand because he won&#x27;t put the Oral B in his mouth any more :(</li>
    <li> kids love it...best price I found was on amazon</li>
    <li> I bought this tooth brush for my 10 year old, he loves it, it is really cute, comes with different patterns that he can change on the toothbrush and it works great, he love the two minute timer that tells him when to stop brushing. He likes the way it feels in his hand and its easy for him to hold onto. All around fantastic toothbrush for kids with soft toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> We like it but our 4 year old twins are still afraid of the buzzing of the motor so they are still using the traditional manual brush for now.</li>
    <li> These are great for kids. My 4 and 7 year old enjoy these toothbrushes. They are also very effective at brushing teeth. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;For my 4 year old i ordered these small brush tips (see picture):&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CVTVV4/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> The delivere speed is really fast !</li>
    <li> works great ... id buy it again</li>
    <li> Quality made product. My daughter loves.</li>
    <li> These have been great for our children.  An outstanding product at a very good price.  Each came with a charging base and a set of stickers for the kids to decorate them as they like.  The only problem is the stickers do not stick that well, but that is a very small issue for something my kids enjoy using.</li>
    <li> Love the timer on this thing.  My son really seems to like this toothbrush and spends a lot more time brushing because it tells him when he is done.</li>
    <li> A great deal compared to the &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; Sonicares. Uses the same heads. Note the warranty is only 2 years (with 6 months added if you register online).</li>
    <li> Perfect toothbrush for when our grandson visits our home! He enjoys the brushing of the teeth, and the brush does a thorough job of cleaning.</li>
    <li> Just Luv the care for little kids teeth and gums</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than the adult model and works just as well. Not just for kids.</li>
    <li> the kids don&#x27;t like t ouse after one day morning.So I cannot getit more than three star.</li>
    <li> very good for my 4 years old son. he is afraid at first time , after 3~4 days  he feels is ok.</li>
    <li> Very helpful for squirmy 3 year old.  We waited to give wait until her gums were pretty set.  Since she sees us using our Sonicares, it was a welcome gift.  As with most young children, it is still touch and go at teeth brushing time but the product is stellar.</li>
    <li> We bought two and after two months one died.  I purchased another and it died so replaced it. At that point the second of the original died.  So in less than 4 months, out of 4 toothbrushes, we have one still working.  Never again.</li>
    <li> We were replacing the same model bought some 6-7 years ago.  This is a great toothbrush for our kids, easily recharged and holds its charge when we&#x27;re travelling for at least 3 days.  Easy to keep clean.  Replacement toothbrush heads are too expensive but worth it for the kids oral health.  We had trouble with the charger a few years ago and called Phillips customer service....they promptly sent us a replacement at no charge.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for my 7 year old.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush!:)</li>
    <li> EDIT/UPDATE: AMAZON ISSUED A RETURN. SO I AM BUYING ANOTHER ONE, AND TRYING AGAIN.   Original Review: This item broke 3 days past the return eligible date--33 days after I bought it! The on/off button won&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t figure out how to contact anyone to request a return. All links lead to \\&quot;not eligible for return\\&quot; dead ends. No customer service email or phone number can be found. A replacement should be offered to me, but I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to request one.</li>
    <li> My kids love their Sonicare toothbrushes. Very gentle and easy for them to use. My 4 year old loves to brush her teeth with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My 5 yr old grand daughter loves it.It is helping her brush properly and it is fun.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush!  My kids love it, they both just got perfect check ups for the first time.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this. It works great for a three year old. If you have a child and they don&#x27;t like getting their teeth brushed, this brush is the answer. It does a lot of work in a small amount of time.</li>
    <li> We have several Sonicare toothbrushes in our house but my 10 year old didn&#x27;t like it because it was to harsh. To be fair, I can&#x27;t tell if this is any less powerful than the normal Sonicare but he thinks it is and that&#x27;s all that matters. What sets this apart from it&#x27;s adult oriented brothers is that they come in colors, have stickers you can put on them, etc. The best part though is the sounds it makes when you need to switch from the current quadrant of your mouth you&#x27;re brushing to the next... it sounds like a 1UP sound at the end, and has cool transition sounds in between. I&#x27;m slightly jealous every time my sons makes his sound and mine just pauses indicating to change quadrants.</li>
    <li> perfect for my 2.5 year old. brushing her teeth was becoming a nightmare with a toddler, so we decided to get her a motorized toothbrush. at first, we started using cheap disposable motorized toothbrushes, but the heads were way too big for her and the batteries did not last very long. the motors were not great either - when she would clamp down on them the slightest bit, the heads would stop rotating. i decided to bite the bullet and get the sonicare (the adult versions of which we use and love). our toddler is doing well on this! i had to buy the child-sized heads separately which is a reason i&#x27;m knocking it down one star....as i understand it, a previous model used to come with the child-sized head.</li>
    <li> Fab toothbrush. Works exactly as described. Leaves teeth really clean. Brush heads are expensive but I guess worth it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is fantastic!  My five year old is learning to brush his teeth properly and for the recommended two minutes, thanks to the &amp;#34;reward&amp;#34; sounds it makes.  We liked it so much, we bought one for our three year old.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. My daughters wants to brush her teeth by herself.</li>
    <li> We LOVE these toothbrushes. We have 4 kids, 2 1/2-8, and they all have their own. Amazon has the best price on them. I&#x27;ve even bought a couple replacements for when these go bad- The toothbrushes usually last about 2 years. I&#x27;d much rather pay for a good toothbrush than another cavity.</li>
    <li> It functions as executed, however I only gave it 4 stars because the brush head is a little large for a child. I ended up getting the smaller replacement brush to better fit my daughter&#x27;s mouth.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist. He now loves brushing his teeth and we don&#x27;t have to constantly tell him to brush longer</li>
    <li> This is the most terrific kid&#x27;s toothbrush. My kids are 2, 4, and 5.5 and they all adore this brush.  Before this brush I tried a manual small kid&#x27;s toothbrush as well as the adult Sonicare toothbrush for my 2 yo &amp; no matter what tricks I tried, he screamed bloody murder, his teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean and he was getting nasty cavities on his two front teeth. This Kid&#x27;s Sonicare toothbrush has been pure MAGIC for him! He hasn&#x27;t squirmed or cried once and his teeth are finally getting clean.  He loves brushing himself and doesn&#x27;t fight when it&#x27;s my turn either. LIFESAVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kid&#x27;s sonicare toothbrush has two vibration settings, one lower than the other, and both lower than the adult Sonicare toothbrush. The adult toothbrush&#x27;s intense vibration is too much for little mouths, but the kid&#x27;s version, while less intense, still provides a terrific clean, far superior to a manual toothbrush, and without any complaints from the kids! It sings 4 tunes, one for every quadrant, so the older kids know when to move the brush to a different quadrant &amp; the younger kids are just entertained and can anticipate when brushing is coming to an end, giving them peace of mind that it won&#x27;t last forever. My 2yo grins at every new tune every time.  Win Win! Love Love!!</li>
    <li> For my daughter with tartar build-up.  Works great and she likes the 30 second interval timer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much easier to clean than the older model that Mom and Dad use.  The pacer is loud enough to get the kids&#x27; attention and they are doing a better job of brushing their teeth.</li>
    <li> i loved it but due to the transportation, the box is broken</li>
    <li> Came as expected and on time.  Takes about a week to get used to.  My daughter has decorated it with stickers that come with it.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works excellent. Just as good/same as the previous model. Only reason I bought this to replace it is because my daughter left her old one at my mother in law&#x27;s and I&#x27;m not going back there unless interdimmensional beings invaded New York and the key to stopping them is at her house. And even then I&#x27;d have to weigh out my other options. My daughter loves brushing her teeth with this brush. Also there&#x27;s a bunch of stickers included to design it with.</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! A little powerful so might need a wash cloth the first couple uses</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes.  Recommended by our dentist.  Love the selection of stickers.  My only wish is they came with both size kids brush heads.  The standard size is too big for my 4 yr old and 6 yr old.</li>
    <li> Love my sonicare and love my kids&#x27; sonicare.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to purchase both.  Brushing has become less of a battle at my house because my sons love this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My child loves this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush for kids and adult version for adults.&lt;br /&gt;Kids even 5 years old can use it and understand the beeps to move to the next quadrant.  Great dentist checkups too.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has been a blessing for me. I had gum surgery followed by radiation treatments, so my gums have been tender and sore for months.  Now that they are almost well, I really wanted to start Sonicare brushing again.  I also bought the Sonicare 2 piece kids brush set HX6032/94.  These brushes are soft and are working well for me on the mildest setting.  I really like the simplicity and size of the handle and will continue using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Son really likes his new tooth brush and looks to be working as he teeth are already whiter.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothbrush for my 4 year old. It is really the same size as my SonicCare but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this! She is 5 yrs old. Our dentist recommended we get these toothbrushes for the family and thanks to this deal we were able to do it. There were 8 stickers for her to choose from to put on her brush as well as what look like a special snap on piece that seems to be an accessory you can snap off and interchange if the child wants to change the sticker pattern. It works extremely well on her teeth and she has mastered the whole process on day one because it was easy to use. Excellent deal Sevice and product so we are very happy</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. Great product!</li>
    <li> My kids are enjoying these toothbrushes. They do a much better job than with a manual brush. The timer helps them brush for the right amount of time. So thankful for this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush but due to weight, I wish it weren&#x27;t so long. It&#x27;s hard for younger kids to balance all that weight and length.</li>
    <li> This makes a LOUD and HORRIBLE noise.  Wish I could return it.  Will never get used.  It&#x27;s too annoying to listen to.  I have an adult Sonicare electric toothbrush and it&#x27;s not LOUD and ANNOYING like this one.  this one was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> A bit powerful for a 2.5 year old, but we still use it, just not for a long time.  The description states it comes with different stickers to customize, ours did not!!!</li>
    <li> this is a good product, it makes my daughter&#x27;s teeth more bright and health.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old had a hard time brushing her teeth with the regular kid toothbrush so I thought I bought her a kid&#x27;s sonicare. We are glad we did! It takes a little bit to get used to, but it does have two settings. It also beeps, when time is up ( 2 minutes) - this can also be turned off. You can buy original replacements that are smaller than what came with the rechargeable toothbrush</li>
    <li> My 4 yr old is getting used to it but loves that he has the same brush as mommy and daddy. He didn&#x27;t like how it beeped every quarter so I help him brush and countdown with him so he knows when to expect it and he&#x27;s ok with it now. Love this brush and definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> works just like the adult ones do.</li>
    <li> Kids love brushing their teeth.</li>
    <li> NO COMPLAINTS!!! Received it like I would have if i purchased it at a store. Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrushes. My kids don&#x27;t care for regular toothbrushes anymore. It makes it easier for them to brush all quadrants with the musical reminder.</li>
    <li> Works very well and kids enjoy using it.  Easy to clean and goes a couple of weeks on a single charge.  I just hope the batteries last longer than those in the Sonicare versions for adults....those tend to require very frequent charging after a couple of years of use.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrushes, both my boys have one. I gave four stars because the replacement heads are really expensive</li>
    <li> seems good, not yet tried.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush it came very fast ordered saturday was here on monday love amazon specially the prime service, My 4 years old love his new brush he chose a skin for the face plate right away he is loving it I myself own the Sonicare Diamond  head in black and I wanted my son to have the best of the best in tooth brushes and this is it. He is also loving how many extra stickers he got to go with it. Happy kid, happy teeth, happy mom.</li>
    <li> Love for my kids teeth. They enjoy brushing their teeth more. Size is perfect for little hands. My 12yr old is even using it still.</li>
    <li> my 3.5 years old girl love it.</li>
    <li> Encourages my daughters to brush. They adore it. Works precisely as should, though we ignore the &amp;#34;chimes&amp;#34; that remind them how long to brush their teeth. They self-regulate that just fine, and in fact want to go longer than their premade chimes. They do sound truly odd, by the way. They are not pleasant songs or bells, more like an insane warbling digital chicken. My daughters believe it is hysterical.</li>
    <li> timer reminder works well for the kids; the vibration is pretty strong for a child&#x27;s brush imo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush for kids 4 and older. Good value.</li>
    <li> Good product, but over priced for what you get</li>
    <li> I got two of these for my kids. They both love it. They love the beeping feature to tell you to switch and also that it turns off by itself. Don&#x27;t go for the cheaper alternatives - you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Works great, as advertised!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, my son loves this toothbrush, and now I know he is brushing as long as he is supposed to and getting a much better cleaning than the battery powered spin brushes. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> There are so many well written reviews that state all the reason I like this toothbrush for my kids.  I&#x27;ll just add my five starts and leave it at that.</li>
    <li> This works great for my 8yr old son.  He is now brushing longer and hitting each quadrant.  The battery lasts a long time.  I think it&#x27;s been over a week and still going strong without a charge.  I plan on buying another one for my 4yr old.  The toothbrush plays a small tune for them to move on to the next section.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Kids love them, brushing became fun</li>
    <li> my daughter like it~~~</li>
    <li> Nice Product and my kid like it.</li>
    <li> This is a quality electic toothbrush for kids.&lt;br /&gt;We use it for my 5 year old&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just a toy, it really is a nice electric brush, however its not as powerful as an adult brush and that is a good thing because it is gentle enough to kids teeth/gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again</li>
    <li> This brush is very well</li>
    <li> Easy to use, cleaning teeth, the effect is very good</li>
    <li> very nice ,I love it! t&#x27;s a good deal of discount period to buy</li>
    <li> good,  except sticker not tight</li>
    <li> My boy very like it,he is loving this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Son loves it.  So do we.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 6 year old , Getting him to brush for any duration of time used to be a major task , Now it is easy , The 2 minute timer is great , his dentist was impressed as well  Great Buy , Will be buying a sonic care for me and the wife this X-Mas.</li>
    <li> My daughter love it . She told me she wants to use it three times a day.</li>
    <li> 8 year old seems to like it, my 4 year old i thinks its a little much for him right now. good brush though</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Sonicare electric toothbrush in about 2 years. Unfortunately they all seem to start out great but then they run slow, the speeds stop working properly and so on. So far we like it and it works great but I don&#x27;t hold high hopes it&#x27;ll last us more than a year. I also found it cheaper at Walmart. At least there you might be able to return it after some time. It brushes my kids teeth best which is why I continue to invest but I wish it&#x27;d last longer since we pay for replacement heads, too!</li>
    <li> The cost of a cavity is triple the cost of this tooth brush.  It&#x27;s more than worth it so I don&#x27;t have to brush my kids teeth for them.</li>
    <li> My kid is 3 years old, he&#x27;s too young to use it, but I still like it for the price.( It&#x27;s much cheaper than China)</li>
    <li> Works great! The kids love it and it&#x27;s a fine price for 2-pack.</li>
    <li> The stickers made it fun for the kids to set up, and good for my kids to distinguish which brush belongs to who. The timer and beep function lets them learn the correct duration for brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> My son likes it. Use Phillips sonic care since 2011 for whole family.The best tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. The adults in our home use this model.....we don&#x27;t need all the bells &amp; whistles. As long as you can live with the sounds played 4x to remind you to switch to brushing a different part of your mouth (meant for children). So impressed with the high number of vibrations/minute.</li>
    <li> Took a bit getting used to for the 3 and 4 year old however the older kids love brushing ( that&#x27;s  the idea) and their teeth look great. Picked up a few adult brushes as well and yes is does make a huge difference.  One less cavity more than covers the cost, my kids have none and I hope to keep it that way.</li>
    <li> very good,my son like it very much</li>
    <li> I have a seven year old that we are trying to teach to brush their teeth the right way, so when I saw that this had a teaching mode that beeped when you needed to move to a different section of your mouth I thought it was brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a battery operated toothbrush for years and think that it does clean MUCH better than just a standard toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-The head of the toothbrush is smaller so it fits better than some inside their mouth and is easier to get to the back teeth which are sometimes harder to reach&lt;br /&gt;-The timer, and learning mode definitely helps to teach your child how to brush their teeth and not rush through it.  LOVE THAT!&lt;br /&gt;-The stickers were lots of fun and a big hit in personalizing the toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;-my 7 year old doesn&#x27;t fight like she used to to have her teeth brushed and is doing it on her own.  I do still supervise just to make sure that she is doing it right, but as with many things she enjoys that she can do it by herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-While the head of the toothbrush is exactly the right size for kids, the handle itself is quite bulky and sometimes had a hard time getting the hang of holding it and moving it around for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;-The stickers can be hard to line up so an adult may need to do this :(&lt;br /&gt;-  I also wish that this would have been battery operated instead of a rechargeable electric toothbrush.  While on the one hand I like that you don&#x27;t waste batteries, on the other hand the last thing I need is something else to sit on the counter and have to plut into an outlet in the bathroom which is already cluttered enough.  Especially if you have more than one child.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  After getting this and then talking to my sister, I found out that there are some battery operated tooth brushes that also have built in timers to help kids learn to take their time brushing their teeth.  I don&#x27;t know if they clean as well as the sonic care, but they are significantly cheaper.  That being said, if we have good dental checkups from here on out because she is brushing well then the price of the Sonic care will definitely be worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been toying with the idea of getting an electric toothbrush for my daughter for awhile, but she absolutely hates the polishing portion of her dental checkup. She doesn&#x27;t like the vibration. So to test the waters I bought her one of those cheapy electric toothbrushes at the grocery store. It was okay. Sometimes she complained that it ticked and vibrated too much, other times she was fine with it. She was definitely hot and cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, though, I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s not the same kind of vibration as those rotating brush heads and she likes it much better. Given the choice, she always picks this Sonicare over the traditional toothbrush (and the other electric). We&#x27;ve made up lyrics to the little song it plays at the end (&amp;#34;Now I&#x27;m done brushing your teeeeeeth!&amp;#34;) and she likes to sing that when done and the little beeping timers for the four quadrants are more fun than a traditional beep in the adult Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two things I&#x27;m not as keen on. First I LOVE the sticker idea and my daughter does too, but our sticker didn&#x27;t stay stuck. It&#x27;s possible because my daughter had to do it herself and it took her about 8 tries to get it on straight that it lost it&#x27;s sticky by the time it was lined up properly. So adults, make sure you help. I wish there was a second of the sticker she picked because it&#x27;s peeling off, but it&#x27;s the one she really wants (the tooth fairy one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is that it&#x27;s big. It really almost seems like the same size as my adult version - brush head included. My daughter, while she&#x27;s 5, is VERY petite and it&#x27;s a lot in her tiny little mouth. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll grow into it, but it&#x27;s pretty large and cumbersome for a little mouth and little hands. She doesn&#x27;t like doing it herself and prefers me to use it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No word from our dentist yet if it&#x27;s made a difference in her teeth and gums. That remains to be seen. I&#x27;ve always had good results with my Sonicare so I assume her teeth will also respond well.ts with my Sonicare so I assume her teeth will also respond well.</li>
    <li> This will be the third Phillips electric toothbrush we have and I&#x27;ve loved them all. I have an adult sonic are for my self and my kids used the toddler electric toothbrush that was perfectly sized for them. This brush (and brushing head) is best suited for school age kids from about 5 years old. Props to Phillips for putting the timer there so the kids know there no rushing the process. You brush until it goes of. This also comes with stickers which I didn&#x27;t have to use but could be a good reward factor for kids that love that kind of thing</li>
    <li> Great item, it has given my child the little nudge he needed to be a regular brusher and it is a great product.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter told us she loved the toothbrush and that it made her teeth tickle.  We know Philips Sonicare is the best you can get.  Double Win!</li>
    <li> This appears to be the same toothbrush, only a different color; however, it has some differences. The original kids brush comes with two brush heads, this comes with one (Proresults style for ages 7+). The original comes with three design &amp;#34;panels&amp;#34; which are almost impossible to install incorrectly, this one comes with one plain white panel and lots of decals. The decals are not as easy to stick on the white panel. The original comes with a charger stabilizing base, which was wonderful...this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is comparable to the original red one but you get a lot less bang for your buck. That being said, it is still a Sonicare toothbrush and, thus, its cleaning potential is next to none. Feel confident that your child will have clean teeth and a good-looking brush.</li>
    <li> Kids love them (5&amp;7) fighting over who goes first. I will see what the dentist says before I give them a 5.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning my son&#x27;s teeth.  He has braces and it forces him to brush for two full minutes.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Well made, reliable, easy and fun to use for 6yrs old!</li>
    <li> My kids both really like these toothbrushes. The timer tone is a fun little song and they both have had good trips to the dentist since owning these! I also like that they could personalize their brush with the stickers so when we go on trips we don&#x27;t have to worry about getting them mixed up. These are a good buy to save some money at the dentist! (Don&#x27;t forget to remind your children to turn the brush off before taking it out of their mouths! It has a powerful movement and makes little mirror splashes if it is on!)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My kids (6 years old twins) adopted this toothbrush immediately and the bip every 30&#x27; really help to educate on how to brush efficiently. I&#x27;m very happy about the product but I only regret the sticker does not stick well.</li>
    <li> Our family has been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years. When I needed to replace mine, found this one and saw the price, I wanted to try it. The brush head is not that much smaller than the regular head on the Sonicare (Type E?) and it doesn&#x27;t have that gross screw off top that traps all the yucky gunk inside. It works beautifully and at HALF the cost? Hey... Why spend the money? This works EXACTLY like my regular Sonicare does. Don&#x27;t waste your money... BUY THIS ONE!!</li>
    <li> The brush head is too large for a 6 years old child...I need to buy a smaller one.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 6 year old.  He just had a lot of cavities filled and his elf on the shelf gave him this toothbrush when he arrived this year.</li>
    <li> Item was as described, received on time will buy again</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush for anyone.  Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;Kids&amp;#34; label fool you.  This toothbrush as a two-minute timer that indicates every time 30 seconds has passed so that you can change positions in your mouth.  It comes with four or five plate designs as well as stickers so everybody&#x27;s toothbrush will look different.  My expensive Sonic Care heads fit on this kids toothbrush.  This is what I will buy when I need to replace my more expensive one.</li>
    <li> My kids really like these.  They enjoyed decorating them themselves, and it is very useful that there is a timer on them.  My 7-year-old likes to brush for 10 seconds and then ask if that is enough.  Now I just tell him to brush until it turns off, and there have been no issues.  Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is our 2nd Sonicare toothbrush for our daughters.  The dentist and hygienist both remarked that our girls&#x27; teeth were very clean during the last 2 check-ups.  The quick little song (indicating to move to the next quadrant) is very fun for the kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little tip - we&#x27;ve had some trouble getting different colored replacement brush head packs. We use a small Rainbow Loom elastic on the bottom of the brush heads to tell them apart. We replace the loom elastic (which doesn&#x27;t interfere with brushing, esp because we can easily take it off) every other day.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love an electronic toothbrush! Best clean feeling ever. This was a replacement for my daughters old Sonicare. Love all the new design stickers they offer.</li>
    <li> I really like the sonicare for my daughter, it works great if I use a compact brush head in place of the one it came with. The head included says for children 4 and up but is the same size if not slightly larger then the one that comes with the adults sonicare.</li>
    <li> I used to use the toothbrushes with batteries but they would go dead on me at the most inopportune times.  The timer helps make sure that my son is brushing long enough.  I still have to supervise him to ensure a thorough job (he&#x27;s only 6) but this takes some of the work out of it for me.</li>
    <li> My kids (6 and 8) love their toothbrushes.  2 levels of intensity allow for ease of transition and the 2 minute timer is very convenient.  My kids enjoy brushing their teeth more now and feel more invested in taking care of their dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> My daughter was developing receding gums and my son didn&#x27;t brush long enough.  Both problems are now solved.</li>
    <li> Great kids toothbrush. Ordered two for 6 and 8 year old. Kids are not gentle with them, yet they are still working great. That&#x27;s all I could ask for.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her tooth brush. Really nice price as well.</li>
    <li> The best kids toothbrush on the market! My 4 year old actually wants to brush his teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush for kids who hate brushing.  In the one minute training mode, it quickly cleans their tiny teeth with precision.  The smaller kid friendly heads last a long time.  For siblings there is a customizable sticker set so you can tell the brushes apart fro one another.  Battery lasts over a year and working great.  Excellent product.  Ages 3 and up.</li>
    <li> So much better than the Oral B version. My 2.5-year-old giggles when I brush her teeth now.</li>
    <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t make my 5yo want to brush any more than a regular brush...but it does help him do a better job.  And when we brush for him it&#x27;s easier as we just hold the brush against his teeth and slowly move.  It&#x27;s hard to well brush another&#x27;s teeth otherwise!  The things you learn as a parent...</li>
    <li> This time we two.  The first one lasted about 4 years.</li>
    <li> Really helpful in getting my son to brush for the full two minutes</li>
    <li> Love this as usual!  And love all the choices of stickers for the face - so fun for my 3 yo!</li>
    <li> I got this for a toddler who LOVES it.</li>
    <li> We have been using the regular Sonicares for adults for a while now and decided to get this for the younger kids in our house. The pulse rate is can be chosen between high and low (for less vibration). The major difference is in the size of the brush heads and the body diameter and weight, making it more comfortable for kids to handle it. These also pause with a beep reminder every thirty seconds to remind the user the switch quadrants...until all four quadrants are cleaned and then stops at two minutes, unless of course, you push the start button once more. This comes with appliques for girls and boys so they can customize the look of the faceplate if they wish to (a pink one and a blue one). In short, this is a full Sonicare just sized smaller in every way to make it more comfortable for kids aged four and up to use. Having said that, even adults who prefer small brush heads might want to consider this version. Also great for travel, since this is lighter and smaller. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought each child one. Worth the initial investment to make it a pivotal part of their daily routines. Sonicare has good warranty, based on previous experience on older model and&lt;br /&gt;product. Will keep buying replacements as needed with time.</li>
    <li> it is good to ues and fit for child.</li>
    <li> cute and functional. has helped my daughter learn to brush her own teeth, and the timer works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our 6-year old son and we think it has encouraged him to brush his teeth better. The timer has taught him that he needs to brush his teeth for 2 mins. He also thought it was cool that he got to choose the design of his toothbrush (as it comes with a pack of stickers with different themes). We&#x27;re positive that our dentist would give us a good feedback regarding the condition of our little boy&#x27;s teeth when we see him next time.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my two boys ages 7 and 9 after I had been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for about a year. My dental hygienist said my teeth were very clean and asked what toothbrush I used. After getting such a good checkup I bought them for everyone in my house. It helps the little ones brush long enough and the sonic action helps clean areas when they don&#x27;t do as good of a job with getting the brush to touch every part of their teeth. The stickers are nice and it is easy to keep clean and charged.</li>
    <li> I love the two minute timer on this brush. I also love that my daughter and son can customize the toothbrush with different stickers that are included. My daughter still refuses to brush her teeth longer than 45 seconds BUT, at least the brush does a good job getting the extra stuff that she would have missed on her own with a manual brush. The only small complaint is that spricklets get everywhere should the brush leave the mouth while the motor is still running. I&#x27;m talking - EVERYWHERE.</li>
    <li> I use the adult version, the kids are using this one. It fits the old toothbrush heads, if you still have some lying around. The life of this product is around two years.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush,  2 mintues&#x27; brushing ,with music every half minutes, and stop automatically, my son likes it very much, his teeth are much cleaner than before.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 6 year old. It is very easy to use; and the changeable stickers make it fun for kids. I would def recommend to other parents.</li>
    <li> This works great for my seven-year old who hates to brush his teeth, because it times him.  There&#x27;s a tone for each quadrant of the mouth so he knows when to move the brush.  I followed other reviewers&#x27; advice and bought the small child sized brush heads separately, as the one that came with it is a bit large for little ones.  The second we got it, my son was excited to decorate it with the faceplate and other stickers that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is easily rinsed clean and lasts several days without a charge.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on those cheap things. This is the right unit for young kids to get them to brush thoroughly and long enough.</li>
    <li> The brush head is a HX6042 model, which suits for kids older than 7. I have to buy HX6032 brush head seperately.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush for kid.  It does an excellent job of keeping teeth clean and musical tones reminds kids when it is time to start brushing the next area of their mouths.  My wife and I tried it out and found that the Sonicare brush did a better job of cleaning our teeth than our old electric toothbrush.  The improvement was so significant that we replaced our old toothbrush with a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> First let me say that in my opinion Philips and Braun are the 2 best toothbrushes on the market.  Our dentist prefers sonic as he feels the manual Braun/Oral-B can take off some of the enamel on the teeth particularly with kids.  Most importantly the kids love brushing their with them and we no longer need to set up a time for them.  Our kids are six, just so you have an idea of the users of this model.  They love the number of stickers that are included to change the design of the faceplate.</li>
    <li> My son loves it and it&#x27;s really helpful for children cleaning their teeth. Now the smell of his mouth is finally good.</li>
    <li> My kids love these, I love these!  Only need to charge every 2 weeks and my kids brush longer, better!  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> My son likes it and can use it very perfectly.</li>
    <li> GREAT toothbrush!  Love that it &amp;#34;times&amp;#34; brushing and plays a song so my son knows when he can stop!</li>
    <li> Very well built.  Like the style and size for my 7 year olds hands.  The removable plate with different designs on does not stay on very good and I also wish it wouldn&#x27;t shut off so quickly.  My 7 year old likes to dilly dally while brushing sometimes and she seems to think she&#x27;s done after it makes that funny beeping noise.  She has to do it for two cycles......</li>
    <li> Dentist noticed immediate results and was amazed at how clean their teeth were!  Smend some time training them in on how to use them properly!</li>
    <li> Makes my son love brushing his teeth!</li>
    <li> My son likes to use it.</li>
    <li> Really happy with the toothbrush.The only thing I&#x27;d like to be included is the travel box. Apart from that toothbrush is great for my son</li>
    <li> My five year old grandson asked for an electric toothbrush for his 5th birthday. The true test - two months later his parents report he is still faithfully using. The toothbrush times the amount of time to brush each area of the mouth; so many seconds to start and then increasing as the child gets older.</li>
    <li> Tested yesterday, very good product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son, to help make sure he brushes his teeth long enough.  Previously, he would just try to get finished, as quickly as possible.  With this brush, not only does he brush for at least two minutes, he will sometimes go longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is designed to beep every 30 seconds, which is meant to indicate it is time to switch to the next quadrant of your mouth.  The idea is nice.  However, who brushes their teeth in quadrants?  I think most people would divide their brushing into 16ths.  You&#x27;ve got the 4 outside sides, the 4 inside sides, the inside bottom front, inside top front, the 4 chewing surfaces, the outside top front and outside bottom front.  If you break up the 2 minutes (120 seconds) into 16 parts, it would be 7.5 seconds per section.  I think this would also make it easier for kids to not feel like brushing is taking so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, it is a good toothbrush, and my son really likes it.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these for my kids without much thought and ended up returning them for these two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This is just an adult sized toothbrush with some stickers... It is in *no way* a child&#x27;s toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) After reading more about ultrasonic toothbrushes vs oscillating at the National Institutes of Health web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282870) I decided that the ultrasonic toothbrushes are not for me.</li>
    <li> Pack not included&lt;br /&gt;- 8 Handle stickers&lt;br /&gt;- 2 Bonus sticker sheets&lt;br /&gt;- manual&lt;br /&gt;Urgent : Please check this order and contact back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> easy to use and much better for cleaning teeth than the normal ones</li>
    <li> My son loves this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> We got this for my 7-year-old. She loves it! She likes to decorate and customize stuff so she immediately loved the fact that her toothbrush would have it&#x27;s own &amp;#34;style.&amp;#34; As parents we love the fact that she is using a great toothbrush that&#x27;s made for kids and has a timer to remind her to brush long enough. We kept the other electronic toothbrush she had been using next to this one, but so far she has chosen this one every time.</li>
    <li> This has made an incredible difference for my son&#x27;s teeth! No matter what I tried he just did not do a good job at brushing his teeth. After using this for 1 week his teeth are noticeably whiter and he actually enjoys brushing his teeth! The timer is great. I just cannot say enough about this tooth brush. I spent so much money on spin brushes and rinses to help him take an interest in his teeth, when the answer was the Phillips Sonicare all along!  I only wish I had bought this sooner-I could have saved a lot of money and aggravation!</li>
    <li> I am hoping that at next dental visit, my kids&#x27; dentist will say that we are doing a good job keeping the kids teeth clean. I like not having to purchase disposable batteries.  My kids seem to like the brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter when she got her braces on.  She likes using it and her teeth have stayed nice and plaque free!</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  No problems switching from a standard toothbrush to this one.  Since they like it, and use the full timer, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Needed a sonic brush for an &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; kid who has sensitive teeth. The regular sonicare was just too aggressive. Was just the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> My husband and have Sonicare toothbrushes, and my kids have been wanting one, but I always thought they were too young.  I was very excited to find that there was a kids sized one available.  As soon as they arrived in the mail, the kids were off decorating.  They&#x27;ve even got the smaller stickers on the chargers so they know whose is whose.  I love that now they have their own brushing timer.  They never brushed long enough before, and always got upset when I told them it had to be longer, but they love the toothbrush noises that tell them when they are done.  I hope that lasts!  The size of brush in the box seems good for my nearly 7 year old, but too big for my 4 year old.  I bought the &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; size replacement, and that is perfect for him.  My only problem is that now we have 4 electronic toothbrushes in one bathroom that has just 2 outlets.  I had to get an adapter with additional outlets, but four wires into the wall is a lot.  It would be really nice if they could be plugged into each other so it is more a line of chargers with just one cord to the outlet.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush for my 6 year old son.  He was pretty good about using his Waterpik Ultra, mouthwash rinse, and brushing, but I felt he brushed for too short of the time.  I liked that this brush had a brushing timer and the quadpacer feature.  Now, my son uses the brush for two minutes while getting prompts from the brush to switch brushing to different areas of his mouth (the quadpacer prompts could be slightly stronger to be more noticeable).  My wife and I have been using a Sonicare Essence brush for several years now, so we were familiar with the brand, the quality, and benefits of Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notable features are:  a. the vibration strength selector, which can be set to lower strength for younger kids, and b. the ability to use smaller brush heads - HX6032/64 - for younger kids (4-7 years old) and bigger ones - HX6042/64 - for older children(7-10 years old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included stickers were a nice touch.  My son liked them, and he decorated both the brush and the stand, plus he decorated his Oral-B CrossAction electric toothbrush and that brush&#x27;s stand...  Well, there were plenty of stickers included.  We had to first attach the included white plastic panel to the front of the brush and then attach a decal to that panel.  I am not sure what the purpose of the white panel is or why could not it be attached at the factory.  In general, I prefer as few parts as possible on a toothbrush to prevent places where water can get in and mold can grow, and I feel like it can grow under that plastic panel.  The sticker on the handle took a couple of days of smoothing corners before the corners stopped curling, but it is fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe with Sonicare is the cost of the replacement heads.  They seem to always be more expensive than Oral-B&#x27;s, and there are no generic replacement heads available like there are for Oral B.  For example, a 3-pack of Oral-B replacement heads costs $19 ($6.33 each).  Sonicare replacements for this brush cost $19 for 2 ($9.50 each), although, currently, with a $4 off coupon, they are $7.50 each, which is still more expensive than Oral-B replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the brush for the features, and my son enjoys it.  I dislike the cost of refills.  As an option, I would look at Oral-B 5000 which is more expensive, but occasionally has discounts that bring the price to as low as $71.  The extra $26 over the price of this brush, in my opinion, can be easily justifed considering that the Oral-B brush has more features.  Additionally, the Oral-B refills are cheaper and the Oral-B&#x27;s battery can be replaced once it wears out, which is not the case with the Sonicare.rush cost $19 for 2 ($9.50 each), although, currently, with a $4 off coupon, they are $7.50 each, which is still more expensive than Oral-B replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the brush for the features, and my son enjoys it.

    <li> After my daughter got her first cavity at the age of 7...we decided to switch on over to the sonicare.  We find that the music helps her brush longer and take more time to brush all the parts of her teeth. I dont know why we didnt think of buying these earlier for her.  We both use the oral b brand and find it to clean much better than a manual.  We are very happy with the purchase.  My daughter had no issues going from manual to electric . There is a gentle brush at first and they can work their way up to the normal brushing power of the toothbrush.  The only downside is when it is time to leave in the morning and she hasnt brushed her teeth yet, i cant really say &amp;#34;hurry up&amp;#34; since she says it hasnt beeped or played the music yet.</li>
    <li> There is always the manual vs electric debate. These days the better question for kids is 8 dollar electric vs 60 dollar electric. If you have used this, you would never brush twice with the cheaper electrics. These Sonicare leave your teeth feeling clean--something that somehow just isn&#x27;t possible with cheaper options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides feeling clean, the folks at Sonicare continue to improve their kid models, making the more user friendly and more kid excited. There isn&#x27;t just a boy sticker and a girl sticker, there is 10 options! It also helps kids feel older when they have a REAL toothbrush instead of something that plays a Jonas Brother&#x27;s song. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an investment. It will pay for itself over and over (well below the price of ONE cavity) and it helps teach kids the importance of brushing the full 2 minutes and perhaps brushing twice a day. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you. Please feel free to ask any questions you have.</li>
    <li> I like the regular size brush and months later still works without complaint!</li>
    <li> Makes brushing so much easier!!</li>
    <li> Great for kids learning to brush on their own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, i love it ,i think my son love it too.</li>
    <li> my little boy loves brushing his teeth now. loves it. I love it too. I bought the grownup version, but my kid thought it looked better with some of his left over stickers.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the replaceable battery powered toothbrushes for my son. This one is light years ahead of them.</li>
    <li> My 3-year old loves her new toothbrush. It took her a while to get used to it, but now, she&#x27;s gotten much better at brushing her own teeth. Not really much to say about this toothbrush. Take it out of the box, have your kid stick the included stickers all over it and decorate it, and then you&#x27;re on your way.&lt;br /&gt;There are two settings for time, which is convenient in a way, but kind of unnecessary if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Nice electric toothbrush, keep tooth health.</li>
    <li> very good , Daughter is very fond of brushing their teeth。</li>
    <li> Goods is very good! Easy to full is very poor!</li>
    <li> Love it. Wish it came with a smaller brush for my 3 year old but I can order it so there is a quick fix.</li>
    <li> The Kids Love It!&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for each of my two young kids and now brushing is a breeze. No more timers to worry about and I know that they&#x27;re getting a much better cleaning in half the time. The stickers are great. I should have switched to a real Sonicare for them years ago - it would have saved me tons in crappy tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> My kids LOVE these brushes... not anywhere as &amp;#34;noisy&amp;#34; as their old Oral B rotating heads ones... the timer is easy to hear and they liked being able to customize their brush with the variety of stickers. Now there&#x27;s no more &amp;#34;was that two minutes?&amp;#34; from me... they brush until it turns off.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush for kids!</li>
    <li> Very suitable for my children</li>
    <li> We have three of these toothbrushes. Our oldest (15yrs) my husband and I have adult sonicare toothbrushes. The three child sonicareadult are for a 9 yr old, 6 yr old and 3 yr old. Despite it saying 4+ yrs, she loves the toothbrush and the girl designs and stickers that come with it. I purchased the small headed refills for the 3 yr old to fit her mouth better. I now have a extra for my boys until the refills come in for theirs. All children love the toothbrush and the results are unmistakable. The kids teeth looked good with regular brushes but now look amazing using these. It surprised me the difference in just a couple days made. Love these brushes.</li>
    <li> Kids love them...perfect size for their hands and easy to hear the chime when it is time to move to another section of teeth! Here&#x27;s to no cavities!</li>
    <li> Purchased March 4 and today (May 25th), it no longer works, no matter how long I charge it.  I am very disappointed with this toothbrush and am sorry I wasted my money on it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this toothbrush.  My 4 and 6 year olds have always brushed with an electric toothbrush, but they have been the ones you buy at the grocery store.  I was worried the Sonicare toothbrush would be a little much for them.  Specifically, I was concerned that the vibration would be too much to handle.  You can set the vibration to ease them into the weird sensation.  It was a seamless transition.  They do a much better job with brushing now.</li>
    <li> He now wants to brush his teeth himself and liked the stickers.  Looks like it vibrates super fast.  Will have to wait and see what the dentist says.</li>
    <li> We were struggling to brush the teeth of our 18-month old son. He simply wanted to chew on the toothbrush but not allow us to brush his teeth. A dental hygienist friend recommended we purchase a child&#x27;s electric toothbrush because even if he is chewing on it, the vibrations will still clean his teeth. It was a brilliant idea. The toothbrush comes with changeable &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; stickers so you can customize the look the toothbrush. My son also loves that his toothbrush looks just like ours so he gets excited to brush his teeth along with us. So, it is definitely worth it and a great way to get your little one to participate in brushing habits along with you.</li>
    <li> My son loves it very much</li>
    <li> I have the previous models for my older children and they have been great! Purchased this for my youngest and I love the look of it much more than the older model. He really liked all the stickers for the handles too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the stickers are so difficult to get on straight. Once on, after a few weeks they started to lift. No they just don&#x27;t look as nice as the old model where the design was just part of the plastic plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that they changed the music to be a little quieter and the toothbrush stops when 2 min are up and resumes if you pause it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall love the toothbrush and the dentist agrees that electric toothbrushes are really important to maintain good dental health!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter because she loved my Soniccare Diamond. She loves this one more because it is easier to hear the 30 second interval changes. Would absolutely purchase it again</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for my 11 year old daughter.  It has a timer on it for 2 minutes to assure that my child is brushing long enough.  Its quiet and really works great.  My daughter loves the way it feels in her mouth, the way it cleans, and the way it leaves her mouth feeling after brushing.  My daughter&#x27;s teeth look very nice and clean.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my daughter is using it with her braces as the dentist told me to but she won&#x27;t turn it on. she says it is to strong and hurts on her braces.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but help kids brush a little better. Kids have to be trained to brush teeth correctly and this timer helps kids know how long to brush an area.</li>
    <li> I guess it is good because my grandson is using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed by the design and engineering of this model. The motor stopped working after 2 weeks of using the brush. I purchased this brush because of the quality of the adult Sonicare, but the kid&#x27;s model is flimsy.</li>
    <li> I got a sonic care and was sharing with my daughter, she would change out the heads. It got old and tedious and I kept using hers or vice versa! When I saw this I put it in my cart straight away and I am so happy I did. My daughter loves the sticker and personalized her tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for our 6yr old. It seemed that no matter how we showed him or how well he followed instructions his teeth just were not getting clean enough. So we decided to spend the money and give this a go and we are pleased we did. After just a week of getting used to how to use it, his teeth look whiter, brighter and no buildup on tooth line, (where teeth meet the gum line) the big plus is he loves to use it. We like the features it has for little ones. A good buy for us.</li>
    <li> Although this is not the first electric toothbrush, my daugther was using the Oral-B design.  She has no problems using it last night for the first time.  So, I guess everything is A-OK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always concerned that my kid is not brushing well enough and really getting a good clean. This toothbrush has put those fears to rest. The Philips Sonicare really packs a powerful clean. It has multiple setting which is nice. I started my daughter off at the lower setting to get her used to using an electric toothbrush vs a manual one than bumped her up to the higher setting. The timer beeps are cool because we both know exactly how long she needs to brush. Honestly the major selling point for any 6 year of course the stickers and decals provided to customize the toothbrush to their satisfaction. This toothbrush is so impressive Im thinking of ditching my rechargeable toothbrush for a Sonicare brush!</li>
    <li> It really does help with plaque.  Our 6 year old had a bit of complaint about the tickling at first and the noise could be intimidating, but she got used to it in several weeks.  It has 2 settings, and I would recommend starting kids off on the lowest setting...you press the button on the left side.</li>
    <li> I got these electric toothbrushes for my grandsons and they loved that they could personalized each one.  They work very well and with the timer, makes sure they are brushing for as long as needed.  No need to worry about batteries, the plug in are very handy.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome for kids, everyone should have one</li>
    <li> Sent to China is very convenient, refueling</li>
    <li> We bought this to help improve brushing for my 3 yr old. She is so wiggles so much it&#x27;s hard to keep her still to get a good quality manual brushing and get to those hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly the vibration didn&#x27;t bother her; she is very sensitive to textures and sensations in her mouth. The brushes that came with it was a little big for her, but no problem. We just bought smaller brushes. She loves brushing her teeth just like mommy, daddy and Sissy. Teeth look beautiful and no stinky breathe from improper brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with cute stickers for boys and girls. She liked being able to somewhat personalize her toothbrush. Helps make battle of daily hygiene with a headstrong kiddo a more pleasant experience for all!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for kids and does a fantastic job of keep little ones teeth clean!  I have an adult version of this toothbrush, and bought one of these for each of my children (ages 4 and 7).  They love that they can change the faceplates to customize the brush!  The musical chimes do a great job of reminding them to brush each quadrant and to brush for the full two minutes.  The brush does a superb job of cleaning teeth.  The rubberized brush is okay for protecting kids teeth especially for younger kids who don&#x27;t have perfect control of the brush.  The brush holds a charge for a long time.  Also, if you have the adult version of these brushes, the charger base works for this brush as well.</li>
    <li> Great product for kids...!!!</li>
    <li> My grandson is enjoying brushing his teeth ever since Christmas! His teeth also look cleaner to me. His dental check up will tell.</li>
    <li> Bought this electric toothbrush for my daughter. KidPacer delivers fun and engaging musical tones. Removes more plaque than a children’s manual toothbrush. KidTimer helps to increase brushing time.  2 Kid-friendly power modes deliver a gentle, effective clean. Fun interchangeable stickers for customization. Sonicare dynamic cleaning action drives fluid between teeth.</li>
    <li> Our kids love their new toothbrushes. Esp personalizing them with the stickers that come with them! This cleans their teeth very well!</li>
    <li> Perfect for toddlers and very young children. Gradually introduces them to doing a thorough brushing. They love using them. Pricey, but well worth it. No problems with either of the two I purchased, even though they&#x27;ve been dropped several times by the children.</li>
    <li> Our grandson loves his new &amp;#34;super cool&amp;#34; toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush. Everything we expected for our six year old.</li>
    <li> at first they were a bit freaked out by the vibrating, but now it&#x27;s fun to brush for them and that&#x27;s a very good thing</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 6 year old. Works as described. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wait until is gone. I recommend this brush to any child. My son is three. He didn&#x27;t like brushing his teeth much. Since I got sonicare, brushing is the most popular activity is in a morning and at night!!!! Love it. Works great! It&#x27;s very good quality as all sonicare products. I wish music could play longer, but I guess it&#x27;s long enough to make my baby happy and his teeth clean. Thank you.</li>
    <li> because i can bursh my teeth with it!</li>
    <li> My 6 year old likes it very much!</li>
    <li> Very cute!  But a little strong for my 7 yr old</li>
    <li> Growing-up, I really hated brushing my teeth. Now that I am older and have had a few cavities filled, I understand the value in instilling good dental hygiene onto my children so that they don&#x27;t have to suffer through some of the nasty dental problems I have had. I decided to switch from a manual toothbrush a few years ago to a good quality electronic one, and have had amazing results This brush has made brushing fun and easy for my daughter, while also doing an extremely good job as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter had some serious ear infection problems when she was little before getting tubes put in, and all of the antibiotics and steroids that she had to take while a baby caused the enamel on her back 4 teeth not to form properly. This, apparently, is rather common and led to her having cavities in those teeth. Since having those fixed, she has also been concurrently using this toothbrush, and on her most recent visit to the dentist, I am happy to report that her dental health is the best it has ever been. I believe that this toothbrush has something to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a father who didn&#x27;t do a particularly good job brushing his own teeth growing up, I am happy to report this this toothbrush makes brushing fun for my daughter, and also does a hell of a job keeping her dental health at a very high level! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Sonicare has been the brand of toothbrush in my house for more than a decade now, so I can&#x27;t give it less than 3 stars just because the brand is great; however, this particular model has nothing to differentiate it between an adult version except for the cute stickers to liven up the faceplate.  It is exactly the same size as my adult model and even the brush head is the same size, whereas my daughter&#x27;s previous model of children&#x27;s Sonicare had a significantly smaller brush head that she and I both preferred for her 2yo mouth.  The only reason that one was replaced is because it totally quit working within 6 months, which was a first for me with this brand.</li>
    <li> Great Toothbrush!  My son loves it, the stickers, and brushes longer.  I love the quality and knowing his teeth are being taken care of in a way a regular toothbrush can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My son absolutely loves brushing his teeth with this toothbrush! He likes to watch me and brush the same way. It&#x27;s great! I did what another reviewer did and used a smaller toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Kids love them.  they also enjoy the stickers.</li>
    <li> I use this for my 18 month and she loves it. There is a little tune that plays every 15 seconds so you know when to switch areas, then a long tune when it&#x27;s finished. I obviously brush her teeth for her, so I just have her lay on her back on the counter and she does a little wiggle dance when the tune comes on. As for the functionality, I really don&#x27;t see a difference between this and the original Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Awesome tooth brush for 1/2 price current model!  Comes with several different removable stickers to customize face plate.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush. Used by my developmentally delayed child. Does a quick and effective job.</li>
    <li> Works very well and holds a charge for days!</li>
    <li> Wish it came with two heads...</li>
    <li> My son is like it very much.He is 4 years old,he can use it himself.Now he&#x27;s like to brush his teeth everyday.It&#x27;s easy for him to brush his teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for my 10 year old son. And DHL transportation is very fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very nice toothbrush but stops automatically before I&#x27;m done.Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> Good but brushing power is low.</li>
    <li> very well,and my daughter love it</li>
    <li> Great product overall but can be improved. Performance is excellent so far and the kids love it. Plays sounds at intervals to indicate moving to another area to clean and a final musical note for end of cycle. The stickers are a great for kids to personalise their brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestions for improvements would be smaller brush head for kids. They come standard with a brush which is a bit too big for kids under 4 years old and even my 7 year old says its a bit big. The wire on the charging station is very stiff. When unpacked it remains in a coiled state and can flip the base, had to stretch and try to straighten out the kinks to make it steady. Also looks unsightly hanging down all kinked and twisted. Could do with a very flexible cord that would hang straight. The base is also mains powered and warns against immersing in water. I do believe that it is safe as long at it doesn&#x27;t go into the sink but with kids around care needs to be taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great brush and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> GREAT toothbrush, but the head it came with was the same size as adult heads.  I like the compact replacement heads much better for my 7 year olds little mouth.  Love the toothbrush though!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nephew (5 years old) and he loves it!! The video also helps him to understand more about the steps on bushing his teeth.</li>
    <li> my child likes it. I am  a dentist and recommend sonic brushes for all my patients</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 5 year-old.  Has a timer, and Sonicare makes good products IMO.  Now he can be like mom and dad, and the oscillating head helps make up for some of the shortcomings of brushing of a child.  We still check on him every once and again to go over missed spots, so is easy to teach with.</li>
    <li> My 5-year-old brushes teeth all by her self (although sometimes I still have to stand over her).  But 5 months in and the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch is broken.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s typical, but it&#x27;s unfortunate and costs Sonicare one star for a &amp;#34;kid&#x27;s&amp;#34; toothbrush.    Update - Philips replaced the handle under warranty and the replacement is still chugging along.  Philips gets their star back!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandson and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this brush, but the stickers start peeling off right away which is a shame and annoying.  However the point of the brush is that it&#x27;s a toothbrush and it does a GREAT job and she loves it (4.5yrs old)!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for little teeth and gentle enough too</li>
    <li> My kids tend to despise anything that takes away from their &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time.  Brushing is no different.  While they aren&#x27;t ecstatic about the inconvenience of having to brush, they accept it a little more with this cute fun and effective toothbrush. So far, worth the money....now we just need it to last! 3 months and counting....</li>
    <li> Our son loves this toothbrush and we love that it times off after 2 min!</li>
    <li> Love all the sticker choices and it definitely makes brushing time easier. When I opened the box I let my son pick out which stickers he wanted and he decorated it and that made it fun for him.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say ENOUGH great things about this Phillips Sonicare Rechargeable toothbrush!!!&lt;br /&gt;My dentist years ago insisted that I buy an electronic toothbrush because he claimed the &#x27;sonic&#x27; motion helps to loosen gunk and that he&#x27;s found that patients who use them, tend to have less plaque build up when they come in.  I wanted to buy one for my kids at the time but he said he thought the adult ones were too strong for kids.  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I was that they finally started producing these for kids!! It has to tell you something when you see these being sold AT dentist&#x27;s offices that are specifically for kids!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have the option of using a toothbrush head that  is smaller for younger kiddos and a slightly larger brush head for kids who are 7+.  Please keep in mind to NOT use adult sized brush heads for kids as their teeth and jawline are much smaller so you won&#x27;t be able to get in the teeny little kids nook and crannies in their mouth and you especially don&#x27;t want to brush away at their gumline while you are brushing their teeth.  Also you may want to consider sticking with brush head replacements manufactured by Phillips Sonicare instead of off market brands that copy the design. There are numerous complaints about the off market brands not fitting the electronic handle part correctly so you can&#x27;t get a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the fun part for kids!! :-)  In the kit, you&#x27;ll receive a stick on plastic faceplate with various stickers and &amp;#34;skins&amp;#34; that you peel and place on the faceplate to decorate your own personal toothbrush!!  We were on a budget so I had purchased one from our dentist for our kids.  They are 3 years apart so it was perfect that they each had their own brush head but would share the electronic handle and take turns.  When we received one from the Vine program, it was made just as sturdy with updated sticker design choices and a great aqua blue color handle.  Our first original one kicked the bucket after about3+ years so needless to say, these last and last considering how much they get used!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion...if your kiddos go on camping trips, sleepovers and such, we leave these at home and have manual toothbrushes to take on trips. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these and it&#x27;s worth every penny to add this to your kid&#x27;s oral hygiene regimen!! Our dentists are always impressed at how little plaque our kids always have!!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 items but I don&#x27;t see 8 cool dpesign stickers + 2 bonus sticker sheets for a fun and customized brush in both of them</li>
    <li> Bought this my 4-year old. He really likes it. He brushes his 2 minutes and then turns it on to brush some more. Loves to say his teeth are all white and clean.</li>
    <li> I knew I could just contact the seller and return or replace. But we needed it before a certain date. we did have a week also left but not sure whether the replacment could make it.  And sometimes it doesn&#x27;t worth the trouble, calls/emails, trips to ups store, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someone had bought it and for some reason returned without the stickers. But can&#x27;t you check more carefully before you sell it again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love amazon.com but this was not the first time I got returned items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is ok. My 9-year-old likes it while my 7-year-old thinks it is too ticklish to use.</li>
    <li> A must have for my child as it gives a more thorough cleaning than manual brushing alone.</li>
    <li> Good product for very good price.</li>
    <li> nice! my son loves it very much!</li>
    <li> my son wanted his friends electric toothbrush brush, we ordered one for him.  Now he has his own and loves brushing his teeth (before was a battle).</li>
    <li> I really like rechargeable sonic toothbrushes, I just wish the replacement heads were a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> The hygenist has continually recommended this type over manual brushes. Both of my kids love these, and that makes brushing less of a chore! They come with decorative stickers to personalize their brush and there is a video on YouTube that explains how to brush their teeth properly. It breaks up their mouth into 4 quadrants and pauses/beeps when it is time to move to the next section. Even my younger daughter can now do a thorough job brushing her teeth independently. The battery charge seems to last for quite a while. We highly recommend thid product!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Bought this to help with my sons cavities. It&#x27;s great cause it beeps after they&#x27;ve brushed their teeth for a few minutes so it helps my 5 year old to brush his teeth for long enough.</li>
    <li> My kid loves it. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk!  Got a brand new system from my child&#x27;s orthodontist and after 2 months it stopped working!  I called Philips to ask for a new one or help figuring out the issue and all they could offer me was a discount code to buy a new one.  Yikes. The last thing I am going to do is buy a NEW one after the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one broke after 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> keeps my sons dental checkups easy.  He is happy to use and I know that he is getting his teeth brushed correctly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, kids love it.</li>
    <li> The kids love these things and they work really well. They play a certain sound for each section of the mouth, so the kids know when to change and how long to brush each quadrant, plus it shuts off by itself when the job is done. So glad we purchased these!</li>
    <li> GOOD，my son like it ！</li>
    <li> Kids absolutely love these. As do we since they now have cleaner, whiter teeth! Love that it has a built in timer and plays a sound when it&#x27;s time to move on to another section!</li>
    <li> Great kids toothbrush!  I love how it has the timer so that my daughter knows when it is time to switch quadrants in her mouth and it lets her know when she is done brushing.  She loved the fact that she could make it just how she wanted it and had the ability to switch out the stickers.  I also felt this was a really great price for a Sonicare.  I have used a Sonicare for about 10 years now and I will NEVER go back!  It makes such a difference, especially for the kids.  Just looking at their teeth after their first brushing with the toothbrush, you will see a lot less plaque and buildup.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Excellent! I bought it for my daughter as a Chrismas gift. She loves it very much.It&#x27;s far more quiet than mine.</li>
    <li> wish I had this years ago for my son, he&#x27;s brushing now and WAY healthier</li>
    <li> We bought this for our son after his dentist found multiple cavities. We went back and forth about buying it because of the price. Our main concern was that our son wasn&#x27;t spending enough time brushing his teeth. We decided to give it a chance. My son loves it. He says, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s super duper cool.&amp;#34; I like it because it alerts him every 30 seconds so he will move the brush to a different section of his mouth. When the two minutes are done, the toothbrush sings a little song. Even though it is an expensive toothbrush, I am definitely glad we bought it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Much better than all those battery operated cheeper once. I&#x27;m glad that I found this and my son loves it too.</li>
    <li> I bought it twice.&lt;br /&gt;good.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> We bought two toothbrushes for our sons, they&#x27;ve been excited to use them ever since. Great quality, and the price is awesome! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  My kids however are iffy.  Moves at such a high rate of speed and tickles their teeth.</li>
    <li> The five year old I bought it for loved it. Her mother thought  it was excellent. Her daughter loved brushing her teeth with it</li>
    <li> My daughter enjoys her new toothbrush, unfortunately I think the head is too big.  I&#x27;m having to look for smaller brush heads since it&#x27;s hard for kids to brush the back of the front teeth.  Recently, I took my daughter to the dentist and I was told she had plaque on the back of her front teeth.  I would recommend smaller heads to be made for this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> clearly and help training my daughter brushing tooth.</li>
    <li> I really felt kind of silly for considering a forty dollar toothbrush for my two year old. He started getting teeth around 5 months old and had 20 teeth by 18 months. He&#x27;s always enjoyed brushing his teeth. Usually he is willing to sit and brush them twice, as long as it means getting a second dot of toothpaste and playing in the water. I figured we didn&#x27;t need to do anything extra because at least he *was* brushing his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the older he got, the more he wanted to run off and play. Thirty seconds was no longer enough time to brush his teeth because he didn&#x27;t have only 4 teeth anymore. My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush so that 30-60 seconds worth of brushing would result in a LOT more cleaning being done. I was really skeptical, assuming he&#x27;d bite or chew on the toothbrush or otherwise find it too big to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He adores it. The handle is big but easy to grip. The toothbrush head is very small and soft so it&#x27;s comfortable enough to brush his tongue. It&#x27;s quiet and vibrates gently but powerfully. He has started to sit down and want to brush two times again. He will let me brush every single speck of every tooth and then I let him do it himself as his reward. He really hates being told what to do but when it comes to this toothbrush, he follows the rules, hell if I know why exactly. &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t bite it, say ahhhh, stick out your tongue, turn it off...&amp;#34; whatever I say, he does. When we&#x27;re done brushing, he&#x27;s back to his normal self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is my only beef with this toothbrush. There is no clicking or securing so the tiniest brush up against it sends it falling over (knocking over my glass tray of perfume, my jewelry dish, nail polishes, whatever is out...) I wish it had a recessed area that circled the bottom of the toothbrush so that minor wobbles wouldn&#x27;t result in it falling over so often.</li>
    <li> My son loves his sonicare. The quad timer lets him know when he is supposed to switch areas and he also knows when its all done. It does an excellent job at cleaning teeth.</li>
    <li> Exactly what is needed for a kiddo who is just plain lazy with their hygiene. This makes it easy on parents as long as the kid douses it</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes having a toothbrush that looks like &amp;#34;mom and dads&amp;#34;.  However, I was disappointed that the head of this toothbrush is actually bigger than the Sonicare Diamond Clean adult heads!  Surprisingly, it still fits in her mouth fine, but I bought the kids one thinking the head would be smaller.  From now on, I will buy the diamond clean replacement heads for her toothbrush since they are smaller and cheaper than the kids replacement heads.  I will say, the kids head are softer than the adult one.  My 7 year old loved that she could decorate her own toothbrush.  I was certain the stickers would fall off right away, but much to my surprise have stayed on better than anticipated.</li>
    <li> My 4ys old love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 3 year old son to help prevent plaque build up in between Dentist visits. He has been using it for 1 month and his teeth look very good with no visible plaque build up where it had been (on bottom front teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a face plate and pack of stickers for boys and girls to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush goes for 1 minute and every 30 seconds or so it sings part of a song. At the end of the 1 minute the brush turns off and sings the entire song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this over the adult brush for kids because it isn&#x27;t as intense of vibration, so gentle for them to use.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy for my child to use and teeth look cleaner than ever. The sticker options are a fun feature too.</li>
    <li> my son loves his toothbrush.  Awesome price amazon!</li>
    <li> my 3 years boy loves this toothbrush, as a result, he loves to brush his tooth now.</li>
    <li> my son like it very much.</li>
    <li> Had to find one to match her sisters&#x27;.  It works great.  Too bad she hates brushing her teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very well. My baby like it, and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> After few day of use the brush is not charging and it doesn´t work. Very expensive product to have so poor performance.</li>
    <li> My son loves this tooth brush. The stickers that come with it doesn&#x27;t stick too good though.</li>
    <li> looks good, my son loves it, and he like to brush teeth now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. My little girl love it very much. And the sticker is so cute that everyone enjoy using it. It&#x27;s the very one disign for the children.</li>
    <li> My little son like it very much!</li>
    <li> fit for my 5 boy years old, but the brush head is a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Sonicare hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads are hard to find. I don&#x27;t find them in retails shops. Amazon sells on Subscribe and save. Product works well for my 3 year old with timer and setting for younger and older kids, so its not to hard on them.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 8 year old grandson...he love&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my son. He likes it better than the Oral B that he has been using.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush and excellent value!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes around for kids in my opinion.</li>
    <li> my kid like the colour and convenient</li>
    <li> Wonderful, works like a charm!</li>
    <li> My 6 years son love it !</li>
    <li> The kids immediately started saying how smooth their teeth felt.  That&#x27;s a pretty big compliment coming from kids as young as 7.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It works as well as the adult model.</li>
    <li> works great, my 10 year old loves it.</li>
    <li> My kids enjoy using this toothbrush.  It makes music while they are brushing so they know when they can stop.</li>
    <li> my kids love these toothbrushes -- finally i can see the difference in the clean on their teeth.  I would have paid double these toothbrushes are worth it.</li>
    <li> My sons&#x27; love their new toothbrushes, anything that keeps them engaged and brushing their teeth is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 8 year old daughter who has always used a disposable electric toothbrush for kids. She did not like the sonic one and  after about a month I got her an oral-B electric. The problem with the sonic is there was too much vibration and it gives a very &amp;#34;tickly&amp;#34; sensation. i purchased adult brush heads and am now using the sonic for myself. Works great, just too &amp;#34;tickly&amp;#34; for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I recommend this sonicare. My kids love it. Also it helps a lot to motivate my kids to brush theirs teeth</li>
    <li> MY KIDS BRUSH FOR 2 MINUTES!&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes work great AND keep my kids brushing. Dentist is so much easier now!</li>
