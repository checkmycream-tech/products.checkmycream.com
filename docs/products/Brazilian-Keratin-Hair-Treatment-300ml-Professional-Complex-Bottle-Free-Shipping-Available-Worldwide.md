      <li>worth the price compared to salon treatments, My hair is great and did not get damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s stayed just for a month and my hair is wavy , it looks very sooth at first month and then nop ...........&lt;br /&gt;if I could give it zero I would for sure ... it&#x27;s very expensive even though has plenty of it ,,&lt;br /&gt; does&#x27;t work I&#x27;m not happy so disappointment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::::::::::::::::::&lt;br /&gt;Updit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used it 2d time&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t stayed longer 3 weeks and it gotting to get back&lt;br /&gt;as my normal curly hair ..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still not happy it&#x27;s not cheap</li>
    <li> I did a ton of research and went with this product.  For all I know. all the others I didn&#x27;t purchase may work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, from my experience. this product worked just as well as the professional treatments I&#x27;ve had at salons without the high price!  I am very pleased.  I have medium wavy hair that becomes super frizzy and out of control on the top of my head particularly when I&#x27;m near the beach or before it rains.  Of course due to the humidity.  This product does not completely straighten the hair, which is not what I wanted anyway as I like the body.  It smooths the hair for frizz control making it more manageable.</li>
    <li> I biracial (black and white) and have had a difficult time with my hair ever since I can remember. When I was younger I tried relaxers but hated the damage done to my hair. Heat has also taken its toll on my hair and made it difficult to grow since it would break off before it had a chance. I got a Brazilian blowout once in a salon and fell absolutely in love! I couldn&#x27;t believe that I had finally found the solution to my lifelong hair problems. But having payed $350 for my stylist to do the treatment I knew there was no way I could keep them up. I found this product and it works just as good if not better than the treatment I received in the salon (I think this one last longer but doesn&#x27;t give quite the amount of shine the salon one did initially). I would recommend this to anyone with curly, frizzy, coarse, or generally unruly hair. I will never be without this stuff again! It&#x27;s not hard to do and I honestly think I do it better myself than my stylist because I&#x27;ve had way more experience blowing out curls (my own) than she could ever have. Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I thought I would since this is the third time I have used this product.  First, I must say that I have never had my hair professionally straightened or had a professional apply keratin to my hair, so I can&#x27;t compare the results, but overall my feedback is pretty positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wavy in some spots, straight in others.  It is also really frizzy overall even in the straight parts.  It tends to look weighed down if I use products to combat frizz so I typically straightened it by blowing it out and using a straightener, but heaven forbid if there was humidity or a drop of rain fell on my head it would just spring right back.  Plus it took forever to blow dry properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I wanted to try a keratin treatment so I started researching them, and was totally appalled by the cost of salon applications.  I decided to try doing it myself and found this product, with a number of pretty good reviews, so I thought I would give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is pretty outstanding, and this product lasts a long time; the 300ml bottle is still going strong after my 3rd application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemical Smell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it really strong; I don&#x27;t use a lot of chemicals around my home and am sensitive to strong smells; the fumes burn my eyes during application and blow drying.  Anyone else with chemical sensitivities would probably have the same experience.  With this application I solved the fumes problem by blow drying and straightening my hair outside on my balcony; lots of fresh air and no fumes lingering in my house after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied it took me 3 hours from start (shampooing) to finish (straightening).  The second time it took 2 hours, and this last time about 1.5 hours. I haven&#x27;t figured out how not to over-saturate and make sure that all of my hair has product in it; my hair is typically quite dry because I color it regularly so itsoaks up the product quickly especially at the ends.  I usually apply from roots to half way down and pull it down after, then apply more to the dry spots.  I didn&#x27;t find it any harder than applying hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying/Straightening:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the longest and stinkiest process which is why I did it outside.  It&#x27;s also the sweatiest... big fun doing this in the middle of summer!  I blow dry my hair totally straight and try to get rid of as many fumes as I can, then do the passes with a straightener; usually 8 passes.  I do also use the straightener to touch up when needed, especially after I get up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two times I washed this out after about 20-24 hours (bottle says 72 hours but their product insert says you can wash it off the next morning so I compromise)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results the very first time were that my hair was a bit wavy but had no frizz.  The second time it was almost completely straight with a few curled up spots.  Both times it was very easy to blow dry (took minutes instead of hours) or touch up with a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it has never lasted longer than a couple of months.  I use the appropriate shampoos and conditioners for keratin treated hair and usually only wash my whole head every few days.  My only thoughts are that because I work out a lot I do wash the roots daily, and I also get it colored every three weeks which probably strips the product off more quickly.  I don&#x27;t know if leaving it in longer would make a difference or not but I may try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, especially for the price I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I used it almost a month ago and even though my hair isn&#x27;t completely straight my hair is a lot less frizzy! I even have enough to do a second time too! Will def buy again!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great- tames frizz and cuts down on drying time! Ships super quickly!  This is the second time I have purchased this product! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with very fine but frizzy hair. My hair tends to tangle and damage easily, so I was looking for something that would give me a smooth, blow-dried look without all the hassle and flat ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is fine and delicate, I was nervous that this treatment might be too intense, or might make me look greasy or damage my hair somehow. The warning not to over-saturate the hair concerned me, so I used a very light touch, only using enough just to barely coat the hair. I was also pretty timid with the flat iron - I didn&#x27;t realize you&#x27;d actually be able to see big puffs of fumes coming off your hair, I thought my hair was burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after being so very cautious - big surprise - the treatment didn&#x27;t take. My hair was back to being frizzy and unmanageable within a couple washes. Since I had read all of these glowing reviews by people who have much more unruly hair than me, I knew it was because I didn&#x27;t do the treatment correctly. I contacted to the company and they assured me that it was safe to repeat the treatment, and it wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the second round I went gung ho. I ditched the brush and just used my gloved hands to apply the product to my hair. I applied it quite liberally, from root to tip, but I made sure to comb very thoroughly to remove any excess product.&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to rest my flatiron frequently so it would stay hot enough (my iron only goes to 400 so that may not be necessary if you have a hotter iron) and ironed until I stopped seeing visible fumes from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of washing in the morning, I waited a full extra day (so about 36 hours). This time the results were GREAT!  It did not make my hair look limp or greasy like I feared, just super soft and shiny and manageable. My hair is not pin straight, but a quick blow dry and flat iron pass makes my hair look perfect and shiny and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month (washing with sulfate-free shampooevery other day, sometimes every day since I get greasy very easily) and my hair is still smooth and manageable, but I can tell it&#x27;s starting to wear off a bit. I imagine I will have to do another treatment in a month or so (so about 6-8 weeks total) which I think is fine for the price. My hair is quite long and I think I have enough product left for one more treatment (so 3 total).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I realized I miscalculated when I did the treatment, so this really only lasted for about 5 weeks. A little bit disappointing, but I guess 4-6 weeks seems typical for an express keratin. On the plus side, I did a third treatment and I think I still have enough left to do a 4th. Definitely still worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had a keratin blowout done at the beauty salon using Global Keratin that was 150 bucks for one treatment..when I saw it was so easy I decided that I was going to do this myself. I then tried Coppola formula and it was OK but expensive... I got the tester for this product and I like it better that the top two. My hair has also grown so much longer in the process because it virtually has elminated my split ends and breakage. Ill often do it all over and then at times just  brush it lightly over any frays and my hair stays super sexy and sleek..the hair Ive always wanted even though I color and dye it. Just looks gorgeous. Doing one now for my sister and going the 10 oz..this is fab stuff!! brush on... and then major hot iron it and then over night wash out... I use sulfate shampoo and conditioner and then olive oil it to keep it moist. Found the Global Keratin shampoo and conditioner really nice... use Loreal its OK and use Ion from sally which is better than ion and not as good as global...that was for the heads up!</li>
    <li> 1) almost as good as salon quality keratin (salon only better in that Keratin is not best for DIY)&lt;br /&gt;2) good price for what you get. can get many uses (at least 5 or 6) from each bottle. Yes, i have a lot of hair, i am east african decent. so volume, think curls, and tangles are all there.</li>
    <li> I have super thick, course, frizzy and wavy hair. This product works great and there&#x27;s enough for several treatments which saves a lot of $$$. I recommend applying it in a bathroom with plenty of ventilation because it will sting your eyes.</li>
    <li> Although it was a little difficult doing this on the back of my head, it took me half the time than at the salon and a quarter of the price! Not to mention I have plenty of solution left! Love this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Salon Keratin treatments for about 3 years now-I love them but moved out of the area.  I wanted to keep my smooth straight hair. I know there is controversy about formaldehyde in Keratin treatments.  The product my salon uses does NOT have  formaldehyde.  And my hair is so straight, strong and beautiful for 3-6 months  (it last longer in the cooler weather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product to save money and thought  all the treatments were about the same.  First the product does have formaldehyde so wear gloves and make sure the room is well ventilated.  Second, the product lasts about 4 weeks instead of 3 months (it is summer and it&#x27;s a little more humid here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I was able to make this product work for me was after some experimentation.  I followed the directions on the bottle but my hair was frizzy at the ends after 1 week.  I had better luck using it like my salon used their product: I washed and towel dried my hair then added the product and comb it through.  Make sure you get all the excess off.  Then I blew my hair dry with a nice round brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lasted 4 weeks.  If I can find a salon that I like I&#x27;ll get a professional treatment every 6 months to a year but this is a cost saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the formaldehyde and the fact you have to use it more often, I give it a 3 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Looks good after doing it but don&#x27;t last much.</li>
    <li> Excellent really works like magic. I love it. Honestly 5*. It&#x27;s the very best product available today. Would buy again in 4 months</li>
    <li> If you follow the easy instructions, it will make your hair smooth, frizz-free and feel So Soft.  It was  wonderful to feel and see my hair so smooth and shiny.  Many applications in that one bottle and shipping was free!!!! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> My salon wanted $200 for a Keratin treatment, not including extra products and a 20% tip.  I spent $100 total to buy this product, a cape, clips, and a flat iron that went up to 450 degrees (FYI $29.99 Remington pearl plates).  The product says &amp;#34;reduced odor and fumes&amp;#34;.  Well if that&#x27;s reduced, I don&#x27;t want to know what the previous version was like!!!  I had a window open in the bedroom (bathroom doesn&#x27;t have one) and fans going and my eyes were still watering and my nose was running like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the obnoxious fumes, the product works! My hair is naturally wavy with lots of frizz.  I needed something to tame it and soften it.  From start to finish, it took me about 90 minutes.  My teen was going to help me, but I don&#x27;t think she could have handled the smell.  I waited 36 hours to wash it with sulfate free shampoo/conditioner.  WOW! so soft after and much easier to straighten with a flat iron.  My hair looks really healthy, so now I just have to wait and see how long the treatment will last.  I may have used 1/4 of the bottle, if even that, so there must be at least 3- 4 more treatments in there.  Great deal for sure!  In the meantime, I will be on the lookout for some protective eye gear and a mask!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  The instructions were easy to follow, and my hair is much less frizzy and straightened out much easier with the flat-iron.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I will definitely be buying this again! I am so pleased with the way my hair looks and feels! I have thick, curly long hair and have tried the salon blowouts in the past, honestly I feel like the one I did with this product is by far the best I have ever had. I let my hair air dry and it looks like I have a heavy wave, it is much more relaxed than what it usually looks like. It has been about 2 weeks so I don&#x27;t know how long it will stay, however with this bottle I can still get another blowout in! So exciting!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the accuracy of when I would receive the product however as far as the product goes, I am not completely satisfied. I followed the instructions to the letter and was guaranteed that the product would straighten my hair for 5 ot 6 months. My hair is in better condition however I still need to blowdry my hair straight and then still use a flat iron. This product has not cut down the time it takes to straighten my hair at all. But like I said, my hair is a lot softer and easier to manage. I do like the product but think it was a bit too expensive if I am not getting the results it promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather get my keratin treatment done at the salon but these are still good results. They don&#x27;t come with a clarifying shampoo so keep note of that. Fine when you don&#x27;t wanna shell out the cash for a salon treatment, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> Five stars! This product works just as well as more expensive products. It worked in 24 hours. It arrived promptly. There is enough for several treatments. Use a sulfate free shampoo and results will last at least two months.</li>
    <li> ****BREATHING ISSUES**** This treatment is amazing.. it has definitely saved my hair from so much damage. Without this I would be in huge trouble... BUT!!! is anyone else having breathing issues? I&#x27;ve been doing this treatment for over a year now &amp; I&#x27;ve developed really bad issues with what feels like my lungs. I feel like I have decreased lung capacity. I&#x27;m going to the Dr&#x27;s next week but just want to know if anyone else can relate. I have not been wearing a mask while doing the treatment which I know I should but i&#x27;ve obviously learned my lesson! If anyone is having the same problems email me jk_struble@yahoo.com. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> My hair is short and fine so this is a great alternative to paying big bucks at a salon to have my hair keratin treated.  Easy to use but does take some time.</li>
    <li> This product, in conjunction with its shampoo and conditioner, makes my frizzy-prone hair very straight.  It sure beats the heck out of those expensive hair straightening treatments I have had over the last several years.  The time for the treatment is a real plus since when I was going to hair salons, the process was lengthy and very odorous.</li>
    <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on my daughter&#x27;s kinky hair, I wanted a cheaper option.  I took the plunge on this product after reading  all the rave reviews.  I could not be happier with the results!  It&#x27;s been two weeks and after two washes, with sulfate free shampoo of course, the hair is silky as the first day of treatment.  If you have bi-racial kinky hair, try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my steps to wonderfully soft hair with all the links to what I used to get started:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used 3/4 of the bottle on two heads.  One us shoulder length and the other is mid back length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash with clarifying shampoo -link below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow dry ( brushing straight in the process)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour solution in a bowl ( a color brush and bowl is what what i used, similar to the pros. -link below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Section hair into 8 sections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a tiny section and brush solution only 1/4 way down ( a little goes a long way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a fine tooth comb comb solution down to ends making sure the excess is combed out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The step above is very important because if you leave too much solution in hair, it will feel sticky after your treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all sections are completed, blow dry on low until dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This step took the longest.  Flat iron tiny sections, running iron over section at least 8 times or when the smoke is almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 hours my daughter had beautiful silky  hair (slightly sticky). I did  my second daughter&#x27;s hair the next day using less solution and her came out perfect, no sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait three days to wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that after the first wash, again with sulfate free shampoo, and iron their hair was smoother.  I didn&#x27;t wash again for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malibu Hair Care Un-Do-Goo Sulfate-Free Clarifying Shampoo 9oz&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time when I didn&#x27;t want to pay the salon price. It came before the estimated ship date so that is a plus. My hair is EXACTLY if not better than it has been after other keratin treatments (not Brazilian). I went from 20 min of blow drying to 10 and I didn&#x27;t even have to use the straightener. It&#x27;s so smooth and soft and looks beautiful! The only thing I recommend is don&#x27;t get it to close to your eyes because they will burn. I am still giving this 5 stars because the eye burning can be avoided! Definitely would say buy this product!</li>
    <li> Do as it tells you to anditworks out fine.Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.Good stuff,like it.Just make sure your in an airy room.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I usually used a flat iron as my curls are so tight they are too hard to manage. I thought my hair was going to be totally flat after using this product. I probably didn&#x27;t follow instructions and use the flat iron enough because my hair still had curl after using the product. However My curls look fantastic. They are no longer tight. I now use the keratin treatment to simply relax my curls. I now love the look of my hair curly!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting miracles with this at home treatment. It was a long process with the repetitive washing and drying and straightening. I tried to keep my bathroom ventilated, but the chemical smell was so intense I had to keep stepping outside for air. when combing the product though, a decent amount of hair was lost due to tangles, I think. While straightening with the product in, I was worried the entire time that I was going to end up with no hair. You can just tell throughout the application that this is really bad for your hair. My hair was softer afterward, but not for very long. Did a lot of damage to my ends. I give 2 stars instead of 1 because I pretty much knew what I was getting into when I bought this out of desperation for my dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I have done many Keratin Treatments on my hair . I have tried every product I am a hair professional as well . Ladies don&#x27;t hesitate my hair looks great ! I have thick ,  curly coarse  hair and color treated as well as extreme high lights no problem it is so soft and shinny it is unbelievable .</li>
    <li> I am very very happy with my results. I have thick curly hair that does not curl in a uniform matter. There is no frizz and when i tie my hair when wet and let it dry naturally i let down and it looks soo great, a very natural look. When i blow dry  (my hair i have very long btw and only used half a bottle) it only takes a few minutes. Ive saved around 450 dollars( 2 treatments)! And received the same result if i had done it at a salom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve tired this treatment on my two cousins as well. Both have very short hair, thick, curly. and frizzy hair. One cousin was very pleased the other not so much, only because she was expected different results ( she wanted her hair to be straighter). I advise anyone who is shopping around for keratin products not to expect you hair to be pin straight but more natural looking with no frizz and very tamed. After the second application my cousin was more pleased. This may be an option for someone who has extremely damaged hair, a month after the first application to do a second, as she did. This keratin is really the best out there and also placed at a great value. If someone who purchased this product and is not satisfied it&#x27;s probably because they did not apply correctly, or had different exceptions. but trust me i&#x27;ve tired them all and this is your best option out there.</li>
    <li> It works very well, straightens hair very nicely. The product has a pleasant smell, less fumes than the ones ive used previously. i usually leave it more then a day, seems to work better. I will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> For the last five years I&#x27;ve tried to find a keratin treatment that works past the first shampoo. Finally found it. I have extremely curly hair but with the help of blow dryers and flat irons I can straighten it. That is, unless humidity rolls in or I start to sweat then my hair puffs up into one giant  unruly fur ball. This isn&#x27;t good since I spend my weekends on the beach in New Jersey where humid weather is the rule, not the exception.  Last week I tried Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment and I love it! I have already washed my hair twice and already the results are better than any of the prior keratin products I&#x27;ve purchased since they have all been reformulated. But on top of that, I went to the beach and even walked the dog on a foggy morning. My hair is still silky smooth. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was much easier than the old fashioned keratin treatments that used to work. Further, the smell is not bad but, I did have my windows open during the entire process just to be cautious. Finally, I left the product on for the entire three days before washing it out since my hair has been so stubborn in the passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you for this product. I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I bought it after lots of research and reading reviews on it. The first couple of weeks, my hair was baby soft and heavy, just like the hair in shampoo commercials. :) Plus it was so shiny you could probably see it from space. 5 months later, it is still quite a bit more under control than it was, mostly the one remaining benefit is that it&#x27;s slightly straighter and very manageable. The extra &amp;#34;heaviness&amp;#34; is gone, but I compensate for that with argan oil, the same stuff they use that makes your hair look stunning when you first wash it out. I am not sure whether there was damage or not-- if so it was minor. In some ways I miss my big poofy curls, but the treatment really got them down under control and that&#x27;s what I asked for. ;P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are familiar with Brazilian treatments, you probably haven&#x27;t forgotten how intense the fumes can get. Well, this is no different. The. fumes. are. intense. Wear a mask. I&#x27;m not joking. I will do this treatment as rarely as possible because I don&#x27;t want to expose myself to them more than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. It does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I read quite a bit of the reviews before making this purchase.  I had always had Keratin treatments done professionally, so I was very apprehensive about doing this myself.  It worked!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really should have paid more attention to the warnings about putting too much product on my hair because it did end up sticky afterwards.  I didn&#x27;t wait quite two days before I washed my hair and immediately I could feel the difference in the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is silky, smooth and very manageable.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this product online. Keratin treatments in the salon run about $300, and that price seems excessive. This product seemed like a great alternative. I applied this product to my hair a couple month ago, and followed the instructions to the letter. Overall the application process went smoothly. It took around three hours. The problems I did encounter were these: The product is not supposed to touch the scalp, and it&#x27;s hard to apply this product to the roots without touching the scalp. My scalp would tingle when the product touched it. In addition, the fumes were harsh. I had a fan going but the fumes stung my eyes and hurt my throat sometimes. This product does contain formaldehyde! In any case, I finished applying the treatment, and I thought the results were nice. My hair was smooth and straight. However, within a week, my scalp started itching, and I had small painful red sores on my scalp and worst of all hair began to fall out heavily. The hair loss has gone on and on. My hair falls onto my clothing, onto the floor, it comes out heavily when I brush and tons of it comes out when I rinse my conditioner out. I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist twice and she is treating me for the problem and agrees that the keratin treatment caused the issues I&#x27;ve been experiencing. I&#x27;ve lost a great deal of the volume of my hair, and I&#x27;m really scared. If the hair loss doesn&#x27;t stop soon, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to get a wig! I&#x27;ve done research online and it seems some people have this reaction to keratin treatments and some people don&#x27;t. Perhaps I am just allergic to it. But one doesn&#x27;t have any way of knowing in advance whether or not they are allergic to this formulation, and that&#x27;s why I say that using this product is risky business. I wish I had never used this product. It&#x27;s done a lot of damage.</li>
    <li> I had used a hair treatment back in November that I bought in the store.  It basically ruined my hair!!  It took the color out of my hair &amp; I ended up with this kinky, ratty looking hair!!  It was awful!  So, I decided to try this Keratin Treatment.  This treatment worked much better.  Wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product sooner!!  It did make my hair, softer &amp; shinier!!  My hair is much straighter now.  I still have some of the kinkiness in my hair.  I wish it would&#x27;ve taken it all out, but it didn&#x27;t.  I still am happy with the results.  Still better than what it was!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product after reading all the good reviews, but unfortunately it did not do it for me. It straightened 40% of my hair. I was not happy I wasted so much money in it.</li>
    <li> Before treatment:  long, slightly wavy hair with some frizz, very tangly after shower.&lt;br /&gt;After treatment:  long, straight hair with no frizz, hardly any tangles after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this treatment on Monday night.  It didn&#x27;t totally meet my expectations but I did not follow the directions precisely and did not take advice from some of the other reviewers.  I only ran 5 passes with the flat iron, my hair was so hot, I was afraid it was going to burn it and my hands were getting really hot too handling my hair.  With that being said, my hair feels very soft after the treatment, it has less frizz and seems to be straighter.  It&#x27;s not as shiny or straight as I expected but I still like it because it feels and looks better.  I couldn&#x27;t stand not washing my hair so I did end up washing it on Wednesday morning.  I have not ran the flat iron back through it yet but I&#x27;m sure that will make a difference.  I was hoping that I would not have to use the flat iron at all to have super straight hair but I&#x27;m sure it will take less time since my hair seems straighter after the treatment.  I still have enough to do at least one more treatment.</li>
    <li> Thanks for immediate responses.. customer service great to our needs. I have a salon I appreciate the direct attention and assistance</li>
    <li> Love it!! One washing post treatment and I am very happy with the results.  My daughter had a big halo of frizz surrounding her thick very wavy long hair (mid-back) that is now replaced with loose waves and no frizz. The result was better than when she had it done in a salon.  My Advice: Set aside the time and be prepared, from start to finish it took us about 4 hours.  Get the proper application tools. (Clarifying shampoo, small plastic bowl for solution, application brush, plastic gloves, clips for pinning up hair sections and paper masks).  Although I opened the windows and had a fan in the window, I wore a mask, if you do this right the solutions will “smoke”.  Use a flat iron that gets hot enough, if it does not smoke the solution the iron is not hot enough.  I used an iron that said up to 460 (not an expensive iron bought from *roupon ) but was smoking hot. I ironed each piece about 12 x, used small sections of hair, was methodical and clipped along the way.  We waited about 36 hours and the result is frizz gone, hair feels soft and loose waves.  I will update and let you all know how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions and my hair is still smooth and straight from product. I will definitely buy this again...won&#x27;t use a different product ever</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars because I had to have 2 treatments (after a month of the first one) for the desired results. My type of hair is coarse/curly. If your type of hair is not African American or extremely coarse then it works. Now I get complimented on my pretty curls. If it is suppose to last around 4-6 months, and I had 2 treatments for it to work then I need something a little stronger.</li>
    <li> I have been using keratin treatments on and off for the past six years. I took a bit of a hiatus and got tired of my crazy, frizzy hair so I decided to do a treatment on myself. I hate using products with formaldehyde but it works well so  I thought I would give this a try since I was told it has only 2% in it. I applied this on my balcony because i would never do this inside, and once I applied it, I could barely finish. It was so toxic and caustic that I had to walk around and take deep breaths. I should have just washed it out then and there but kept through with it. It has been several weeks since the treatment, and yes for the first couple weeks the hair is shiny and beautiful, hence the aldehyde, but I suspect this product has much more formaldehyde in it. For several weeks now my chest feels tight and my throat is very scratchy and irritated. When I wash my hair, it seems to activate the aldehyde as it makes me cough. I still had several treatments left in the bottle but ditched it. I&#x27;d rather deal with bad hair, or at least use a product that does not cause such irritation or poses such a health risk. Hair is not worth the health risk.</li>
    <li> I used this on my own hair and my daughters hair. It is great. My hair didnt turn out as shiny as the girl pictured but I am blonde, so maybe that affects it. It did work as described though and was easy to do. Our hair is soft, easy to brush and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love it :))))&lt;br /&gt;I was so scared to try it based on one review which said her hair was fallen and she had some sort of scalp burn/irritation, but several great reviews made me go ahead and try it because I was struggling with my hair, having my hair be done is my every day nightmare. The frizz is killing me and the dryness as well, it took me forever to blow dry it in perfect way, I was always the last to be ready between my sisters, especially living in area where it is humid all summer and raining most of winter. I have tried salon keratin once but it is expensive to do it again, I was using other brand from over the counter that gave me partial relief from frizz for couple of weeks but because I know that keratin is the only thing which can solve this problem I started my search to find effective yet not much expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as directed, I watched couple of YouTube videos. For me the product smells good didn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my eyes or lung, I was very careful and I used mask when dry it, I did blow drying and flat iron parts in the balcony just incase. I left it for 48 hours or so before washing it, I am AMAZED with the result, truly didn&#x27;t expect I will get such a result , hair extremely soft, no frizz and soooooo easy to blow dry. I am so happy it works for me I was really afraid I will be disappointed. My sisters also want to try it too.&lt;br /&gt;How long it will last, I don&#x27;t know yet. Will update my review when I know :)&lt;br /&gt;I still have enough product for another treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE after one and a half months:&lt;br /&gt;Well the above mentioned results lasted for exactly one month, afterward my hair is starting to have its original character though the waves are still larger as post treatment but the hair quality is fading no longer is as soft and shiny as after the treatment . I was running today and there was some drizzle I noticed my hair also started to frizz. Honestly I had once professional salon keratin treatment and my results didn&#x27;t last long as far as I remember it was like this time. I&#x27;m not sure if it is just my hair quality.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep the five stars for these reasons 1- I didn&#x27;t find any different compared to the salon hair treatment the results in my case were even way better than salon experience 2- it&#x27;s affordable and a bottle is enough for up to three time use in my case 3- I never ever had such feeling of softness and shininess and I never ever could go out once in my life without doing anything to my hair. For these reasons I will keep using it</li>
    <li> I wanted to try and smooth my hair a bit before a long vacation, to try and shorten  my blow drying time, etc. I hardly noticed any change. It took a lot of time to apply the product. It smelled bad, stung my eyes, and I hardly noticed a change. So, for me, it wasn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used every Keratin product out here and by far this one is the best!!!! The reasons I give it such high markings are, it not only straightens, it is less costly than others out there. The other big plus is that the fumes are half of the others. There still are fumes, but not as bad. The 300mi bottle will provide 3 treatments for medium length thick hair, which I have.</li>
    <li> there can be no better product out there!  I have had several professional keratin treatments that were very nice but because of the ridiculous prices I decided to try an at home one.  This was the second at home treatment I tried and it is better than any I have had before !! I had dry damaged thin, sort of straight hair where parts of it were like straw and would not lay flat- after the treatment- I have shiny hair of a teenager, stick straight, soft and amazing, it could not look any better and I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> My hair looks beautiful,  shiny and health your product is amazing and my hair is so lite and straight magnificent.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  It worked great and feels very similar to when I got a professional blowout.  I will be reordering again.  Definitely got a little fumey and burned my eyes during the blow dry part but overall great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Took a good 2 hours from start to finish.  Now I&#x27;m just hoping it lasts for a few months.</li>
    <li> I just did this treatment. I am not new to brazilian keratin and have used several brands to do my own over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am Caucasian with some Irish and I have horrible hair. It is extremely thick, coarse, curly, and frizzy. I think I have 3B curls although I am not 100% educated on the curl classifications, the bottom is very kinky and the top is more wavy like maybe a mixture of 2b and 3a, but still very thick and coarse. It does not curl uniformly and when i used to style it curly, i had to use so much oil, cream, gel, mousse and whatever else to tame it, not to mention keep products available for touch ups and frizz throughout the day and it never looked oily or weighed down, but boy did i spend some money on products. Once i discovered keratin treatments i was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, on to this treatment ... Oh my hair falls just a few inches past my shoulders when straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would come with a clarifying pretreatment shampoo but it did not, so I used dawn dish soap with a  little baking soda to really strip my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I blow dried it about 90 percent and applied on sections as directed, using a fine tooth comb to remove  excess product. I was pleased that the application process had a mild odor and didn&#x27;t burn my skin although I did wear gloves some got on my skin and i washed it away. Once I finished combing it in a noticed a mild tingling in some areas where the product accidentally touched my scalp... but it was less than what some hair dies may cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit for 20 minutes and then blow dried it with cool air  ... i was surprised at how quickly it dried as this usually takes a while. I flat ironed in small sections using 400 degrees. I have two irons and used them both, alternating so they had time to retain their heat. One of them is a paul mitchell professional iron, the other is a ceramic iron I bought from a beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were fumesbut really not bad at all compared to some other brands Ive used. I have asthma and I didn&#x27;t have any lung irritation with this. However, I was very careful to keep my face away from the fumes and did step out of the room to rest and breath fresh air frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results so far are as expected. I have shiney, soft, straight hair. I plan on leaving it for 72 hours and will update my review after I wash and style it. I have sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have washed my hair 3 times since the treatment (I wash my hair every 2-3 days), and I only apply shampoo to the roots and gently run my fingers through the hair to clean it. I used my own sulfate free shampoo the first wash, the last wash I used the aftercare shampoo from this line which works just fine. I condition with another brand of conditioner that I like which does have keratin. I apply some serum and then I blowdry and flat iron. It takes me about 20 minutes to go from wet hair to finished product which is pretty amazing. I can then wear my hair straight for about 3 days, only needing to touch up with the iron in the mornings for styling. (it&#x27;s a little frizzy before I style it, but once I style it it stays sleek and smooth) My style holds for the day, and I am a nurse so I work hard and I sweat and it stays smooth all day long. I am very happy, and I have enough product to touch up the treatment as needed, not to mention redo it when it wears off.</li>
    <li> After trying a few different keratin brands sold on Amazon, this one is by far the most salon quality.  Glad I found it, does the job well.  If you follow the instructions you can have salon quality Keratin hair that will last a few months.   Ocean water and spa steam will take it out of your hair quickly .  The fumes can be a bit much while flat ironing but the treatment lasts and works well.</li>
    <li> I was paying $450 for Brazilian blowouts and I was looking for a cheaper alternative. I bought this product and used it for the first time recently. It is the same product they use in the salon and I got excellent results. I have shoulder length hair and only used half the bottle. Since my hair is very frizzy I kept the treatment on my hair for 3 days and now my hair is shiny and frizz free. I will definitely buy this again. I am so glad I can have smooth hair without paying such a high salon price! I have had salon Brazilian blowouts before so I know how to do the treatment. I think you can find instructions on YouTube if you don&#x27;t know how to do it, but it is not difficult to do it yourself. I also liked the smell of the product, but it does create fumes, so use it in a well ventilated area.</li>
    <li> I have very fine curly hair. This product has taken about 80% of my curls out and left my hair with a gorgeous sheen. I am a graduate student with a two year old daughter, therefore I was looking for a product that would simplify my morning routine and this definitely has done that. My hair used to be manageable until I moved to Florida and the humidity turned my hair into a frizz ball. This product has restored manageability and made my hair beautiful again.</li>
    <li> I have my keratin treatments done, but I tried this on my daughter and it has worked very well--even without pretreatment. We left it in for 4 days and her hair is softer, dries faster, and looks much healthier. A good alternative to the salon treatment--I would say it&#x27;s about 2/3 as effective as the salon job. I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts (going on 2 weeks)</li>
    <li> I was surprised this product worked as well as it did.  In order to get the long-term benefits limit the number of times you wash your hair.  Wait the 3 days between washings, it pays!</li>
    <li> I thought this product after reading the reviews, I am a white girl with wavy hair, keratin treatments in salons. Has worked for me In the past, However I wanted to save some money.... I followed instructions, Even watch some YouTube videos... After the second wash my hair was curly again with a frizz.....Ugh...... I already open the product so cannot return..... This item simply did not work.... So it doesn&#x27;t work for everybody so don&#x27;t get your hopes up high.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THIS PRODUCT. IT WILL MAKE YOU BALD AFTERWARDS AND  THAT IS BASICALLY ALL IT DOES FOR YOU.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my long curly hair and it worked perfectly.  I used an application brush to apply the product and followed the instructions on the bottle.  My hair turned out smooth and shiny with supple waves.</li>
    <li> This product:&lt;br /&gt;Damage hair&lt;br /&gt;Smell very bad damage your eyes applied outside.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Misleading information is not a complete treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I sent the request for return never received it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on price and ratings but i am not sure if it did work or not,,,, i wanted my hair pin straight. My hair is soft and long and wvy and i did alot of things to it so its pretty damaged,,, i purchased this product baed on the ratings and i don&#x27;t think i got what i was looking for which is pin straight hair,, it just feels softer but less frizziness and i also apply yuko phi ten bella treatment which makes it soooooo soft and alot less frizzy with no sticky or greasy touch,,, its not a blowout treatment or a real brazilian keratin,, i guess i like it coz my hair stayed natural looking ,,, i would give it a 4 star i guess just for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this is the third time i do it and this time i left the straightener a few more seconds and more passes so i got a wonderful result that am so happy with, i still have a few more times in the bottle,, this is actually quite good and i started liking it</li>
    <li> It has a strong chemical smell</li>
    <li> This product has left my hair in absolutely fabulous condition! It was a little time consuming for me as I have bra strap length hair and type 3C curls. About 3 hours from start to finish. It was very much worth it! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have gone to a stylist for 3 years now to get keratin treatments ( every 3-4 months) and they make  my hair softer and more manageable.  I can always see a big difference.  I used this product last month and it was easy to apply.  After I washed it out, my hair felt the same as when I pay $120 to my stylist to do it.  I have very thick hair and even with putting plenty on, I still have over 3/4 of the bottle and would say I&#x27;ll get another 4 treatments.  I&#x27;d give it thumbs up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really work great !!!! My hair growing it&#x27;s shiner nice and straight I will recommend this for every women if want shine and straight hair.</li>
    <li> Have had a professional Keratin treatment two years ago and loved it, but cost too much to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought the Brazilian Keratin Treatment (300ml) and it achieved what it promised.  It felt like the professional treatment I had, which cost quadruple the cost of the bottle plus the Sulfate free after care shampoo &amp; conditioner I got with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside, I live in the Netherlands and ended up paying custom duties, but still the total cost of the products and the duties is still a lot lesser than what I pay in my salon ... I think, I still have a good two or three treatments in the bottle ... so, this is costing me WAY CHEAPER ... and did not have to wait the 24 hours no-wash that my hairdresser recommends when he does my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST LOVE THIS ONE ... though, I am being cheap (or Dutch ... hahaha), wish you can ship them to me from within the EU ... and I save on doubling the cost of my order.</li>
    <li> I am very Particular with the product I put in my hair and who is doing my hair.  But I have to say this product is amazing!! I will recommend this to my friends and family.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It does what it says: smoother hair, softer curls. I don&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair anymore, air dry only and it looks great!</li>
    <li> If anyone has ever had brazilian straightening done, they will know that the fumes from the chemicals can really sting your eye. Brailian Kerain Hair Treatment did sting my eyes, however, it did the job pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually performed the straightening on myself so it was hard to reach in some places, but I can tell you that the results were pretty good. On a scale of 1 - 10, 10 being that it could have straightened my hair completely with no damage, I would give this product an 8 because it did not leave my hair as completely silky smooth straight as I would have liked it to. However, it did a pretty decent job.</li>
    <li> Similar salon treatments are so expensive.... using this is like getting 5 salon treatments. This was my first time using it myself... the next treatment will be even better :-)</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but this product deserves it. I&#x27;ll give a full detailed account of my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR:&lt;br /&gt;I am Polynesian-Italian, so I have incredibly thick, medium length, wavy/curly, course hair. My hair takes forever to style, is stubborn, always needs a ton of styling product, can never just get up and go. I had been getting blowouts professionally, but stopped about a year and a half ago because the price is just too high. Since then I&#x27;ve been trying ones to do myself, ranging between Cappola to Organix, but everything &#x27;til this has been a disappointment. I was skeptical to buy this because there were so few reviews, but most of them were good, so I held my breath and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROCESS:&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair with clarifying shampoo THREE TIMES; blow dried my hair on medium heat; sectioned my hair and added the product (I didn&#x27;t have a brush so I just used gloves and poured the treatment into a small bowl)-this part was a little tricky at times because my hair would start to dry a little after adding the treatment and I was unsure if I added too little. I went over those spots, but if you do NOT have incredibly thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that for fear of over saturation; I brushed my hair with a fine tooth comb constantly to even the distribution; let it sit of 30 minutes; blow dried again on medium heat; straightened (in the bathroom with fan, open window, plus an extra fan I brought in blowing directly on my face) about 1 in. x .5 cm of hair at 450ºF and STRAIGHTENED EACH SECTION 7-10 TIMES  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend 10 times if you don&#x27;t have strong hair, but like I said, I&#x27;m Polynesian-Italian, my hair can withstand anything. From start to finish, the process took me about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;I waited 4 days to wash. During the time my hair looked normal, not oily or greasy. It felt smooth and mostly soft, but if you ran your fingers through it, it did have a slight filmy texture. This was completely bearable, I went to work before washing it out and I didn&#x27;t look grungy at all. After washing, I let it air dry, which is a scary thought because if I do this, I usually look like Tina Turner. It took awhile for my hait to dry because it&#x27;s so thick, but the results were incredible. My usually unmanageable hair dried almost entirely STRAIGHT AND SOFT. The ends had a slight poof to them, but almost NO FRIZZ. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This has cut so much time out of my morning routine. When I style my hair now, I do have to do a few touch ups with the flat iron, but his usually only takes 5-10 minutes at most (before straightening took 1.5 hours!!). I also have enough product to do the treatment again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The 2 day free shipping was great, however when I received my bottle, it had opened and about a teaspoon of product had spilled in to the shipping package.&lt;br /&gt;But to put it into perspective, receiving messy package immediately annoyed me and so I expected the results to be nothing to mediocre at best- which luckily wasn&#x27;t the case. So despite this happening, I still rate 5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;There were fumes, my eyes did get a little irritated and watery-but this is expected. The same thing happens when you get it done in a salon. When my eyes became too itchy, I just took a few minutes to step out. No scalp burning/tingling. I have asthma, so I tried not to breath it in as much as possible, and had a fan blowing directly at my face, but overall this did not bother my lungs at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost a month since I did the treatment and results are still about the same. My hair does have a little bit a wave coming back, but it&#x27;s minuscule and actually looks good. I use WEN conditioning cleanser and an inexpensive shampoo from Fred Meyer, both sulfate free. I only use shampoo about once a week, otherwise WEN each shower. Wash my hair about 3 x per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this a super long review, but I&#x27;m a skeptic who doesn&#x27;t believe inmost products. This really does work. I will keep using it. I&#x27;m incredibly satisfied with the results. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends, sister and mom.most products. This really does work. I will keep using it. I&#x27;m incredibly satisfied with the results. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends, sister and mom.</li>
    <li> It got rid of the frizz as I&#x27;m growing my hair out from coloring it too harshly with blonde. My hair is so soft and easy to manage!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different products to both control frizz and make my hair soft. The ONLY thing that ever worked before was Physique&#x27;s straightening cream- and they went out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have looked many times at getting my hair relaxed but the reviews were always so mixed or the process was much too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon finding this product, I decided the price was low enough to try and most everyone seemed to have good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair: THICK! I always get comments about how thick my hair is when I go to get it cut. However, the actual strands are fine and break easily. Very frizzy. Wavy. I am of Italian, English, Finnish descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Process: It took me about 5 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair 3 times with Suave Clarifying Shampoo. My hair did feel very rough while it was wet, but once I had blow dried it (which took forever) the roots didn&#x27;t feel so rough anymore, but the rest very so dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put in the product. At first it smelled great, but the more I put on the more the fumes started to burn my eyes and give me a headache. My bathroom is NOT well ventilated at all. I suggest you brush the Keratin on with a hair-dye brush or apply directly with your hands. I first tried to pour it on and it fell right off. I think I may have not put on as much as I should, but I was scared to over saturate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow drying took about half as long as the first time. You HAVE to do it in a ventilated area though, unless you do it with your eyes closed and have something to breathe through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it sitting for awhile. It recommends 20 min, but I think I left it around 40+. When I straightened it, I had almost no fumes left. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I did something wrong, but just to be safe, I straightened each bit about 7-10 times anyway. I did it more by feel than by smell. If the hair felt kinda stiff with the keratin, I ironed it more. The &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; never stopped coming from my hair,but there was barely any coming from my hair at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how straight it was at this point. I realized then how uneven my hair cut was, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It recommends leaving it on over night, so I did. It was about a full 24 hours before I washed it (using new Sulfate-free shampoo I bought). The first thing I noticed was after rinsing the shampoo out of my hair, it was SO SOFT. It felt like I had conditioner in it already! Once I conditioned and got out of the shower, I chose to not used any of my normal products (Argan Oil, leave in conditioner). I decided to let it air-dry and see what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An hour or so later I was AMAZED. It wasn&#x27;t pin straight, but it was STRAIGHT! I&#x27;ve never had air dry straight hair in my life! And the frizz is 90% gone. I think I&#x27;ll always have some due to my hair breaking from constantly being put up in a bun day after day. But still! It&#x27;s soft, manageable. For the first time in my life, I can literally do NOTHING to my hair after a shower and I can wear it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> it is a very good product, my hair looks like I went to the saloon to get it done the only thing I dont like is that the product is very very strong you need to be very careful with your eyes and skin and use a mask to cover your nose while applying it.</li>
    <li> I have used several Keratin Treatments before, I got this to try based on the good reviews and the price point as well. So far I still on my second day and have not washed it. It felt great putting it on, not a lot of fumes when I was drying/straightening and actually smells and feels great on my hair, no itch or oily feeling ( I have to say I am used to doing these treatments myself, so I don&#x27;t put a tone on my hair as it burns it out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review when I wash my hair tomorrow and see how it feels after first wash and how much it lasts up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Update 12/07/2012&lt;br /&gt;I am writing the update after a few weeks, my hair has been looking very healthy ever since I did this treatment, I use, in conjunction with it, a leave-in keratin treatment, just to give it a boost as I wash my hair 3-4 times a week after exercise. I have pretty long, thick hair. I will not tell you my hair has lost all the waves and don&#x27;t style it anymore :) it is not a miracle treatment, but it has definitely cut down my styling time from 1 hr. to 20 min as I only have to blow dry and run a quick flat iron. Although, I style my hair 3-4 times, it still looks very healthy and I am getting a lot of great comments on it. Previous treatments has left my hair pretty oily and greasy but not this one. It is not just a straightener IT IS GOOD FOR YOU HAIR !!!!!</li>
    <li> I use another producs and this one is not that good like the review said.dont last that long and u have to wait 3 days</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great. I&#x27;ll be buying that product again for sure. I recommended it for few friends and they were very happy with it as well. Quick shipping b</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the right brush to straighten my hair with but it straightens well. I wore a mask in case and when blowdrying those FUMES that everyone talk about become apparent. Like my throat did slowly start getting agitated. So I stepped out or put my face in the bathroom closet. Might try softliss next.</li>
    <li> Affordable and easy to do at home. This item works great and lasts long. I am pleased with it. You get about 2-3 uses out of just one bottle.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review two months after I did my first keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly long hair; about half way down my back. I started off using the Nexus clarifying shampoo. I rinsed my hair with it twice and then attempted to brush it out, which took forever, the best I could. I followed the directions that came with the package. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to do everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are pretty decent. It&#x27;s not quite salon quality but then again these aren&#x27;t salon prices. I actually think I would have had better results if someone else could have flat ironed the back of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to chemically straighten my hair, because I have this weird half african american, half middle eastern hair that is super thick and curly, but not nappy. I tried chemical relaxer when I was younger and it had literally no effect whatsoever. However, after this treatment my hair feels unbelievably soft, de frizzed and is WAY straighter. I&#x27;m actually still in shock haha. I will update this review after a few weeks to see how it holds up, but so far I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;One tip is to make sure you really do flat iron each piece a bunch of times. It felt like way too much flat ironing at the time, but now I can tell the pieces I kind of skimmed over versus the pieces where I did the recommended 7-12 irons.</li>
    <li> Thank you for making a product that works!  I was searching for a salon in my area that does the Brazilian blow out but could not find one.  I had 2 keratin treatments done at salons and was dying to get one again.  I found this on Amazon and bought it.  I was scared to try it, my hair is very thick and course,  I also did not want to damage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI depending on length of hair plan on a good 2 hours to complete all the steps.  I did it one night and it was hard to get the back really good, but I managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps wash with clarifying shampoo 3-5 times&lt;br /&gt;dry hair&lt;br /&gt;apply solution to hair ( this was also difficult I felt like I put too much on, like hair dye but a bit less, use a comb and comb it through)&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair with solution on it&lt;br /&gt;Straight iron hair 5-10 times to seal it in.&lt;br /&gt;wait over night then wash.  You can keep it in longer too.  I washed the next morning.  It was great silky smooth like the Brazilian blowout I have had done.  I have washed it and gone swimming and it is still great! love it.  I have a ton left to do it again as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also found it hard to know if I went over it to much or too little 5-10 times they say per section.  It was also difficult to get the back done well  Watch for fumes it did make my eyes water, does not smell bad at all though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price compared to salon treatments, My hair is great and did not get damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Okay I still love this and I have done it to my hair twice and still have enough for another application.  I did find that it last about a month, I do wash my hair daily with sulfate free shampoo.  You also have to make sure you straighten it enough which I think is why my may not last as it should.  I have very thick hair and feel I probably miss areas.  Still a great deal!!</li>
    <li> This product is ok for my hair. I used a different one before this and it cost me $20 which also had the same affect. For the price I&#x27;d think it would be better. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it because a little goes a long way. I didn&#x27;t have to use much which is great because it&#x27;ll last me a log time. You definitely have to maintain it with the proper products to last longer.</li>
    <li> Really helps reverse the damage done by double processing. I use to rejuvenate the texture of my hair. It has cut drying time and changed the texture from straw-like to silk-like. It improves shine and softness even if you don&#x27;t want your hair stick straight.</li>
    <li> A lot of work and only lasts about 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a Brazilian blowout in a salon once after my sister and mother recommended it. Unfortunately, it did not take, and i was annoyed as it was rather expensive. I was also surprised because my hair is very thin, medium long, and is not curly,  which is \\&quot;optimal\\&quot; for the Brazilian blowout to work. I was very wary about buying this product. I wanted the super smooth, pin straight hair, but thought this might also be a let down. I however convinced myself because of the reasonable price. I followed the instructions (minus buying the special shampoo and conditioner), and my hair is not only pin straight, it is also super soft and shiny. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants smooth, straight, and soft hair. And, if it doesn&#x27;t take the first time, there is PLENTY of product left over to do it again... Shipping was also super fast. All in all, i am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Just put an application on my hair, so don&#x27;t know if it will last 12-weeks or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is definitely straight though and it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes or skin.</li>
    <li> I have blonde curly/wavy hair.  Humid days are ridiculos and spring rain is super bad!!! I have tried all the other brands but I will continue to buy this one.  It does everything it claims.  Makes my hair smooth, frizz free, healthy and overall a great product for bad hair. I maintain my treatment by using a conditioner wash to remove products (no shampoo) I buy from sally&#x27;s beauty...it&#x27;s cheaper.  I also condition as normal.  My last tip is to treat with pure olive oil at least once a month.  Warm in microwave, put on your hair then cover with shower cap until oil absorbs. Leave on overnight or for a few hours.  Wash out with conditioner...oil removes oil.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair, and although I am not a professional, I am very hair savvy. I applied the product as directed and noticed that the solution was drying very quickly so there were a lot of spots that I was not sure whether they had dried, or if I just hadn&#x27;t used enough solution. I applied more at the ends that looked dry and by the time I was done with my entire head, half of the hair was already dry (which now makes sense why they say wait 20 minutes AFTER the solution dries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in fairly rough conditions towards my ends because of some bleaching I had previously done, but I had cut off the damage and only \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; blonde was left. I used my straightener on 410 degrees and I did the least amount of passes, seven, I noticed my ends were getting REALLY rough. They looked like a hay broom. My hair is very strong and I have always been able to do many treatments to it, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is because I applied more solution to the ends. I left it overnight and washed the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: My hair was pin straight. I really wanted straight, non-frizzy hair, which is what I got.... on my \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I had to cut about 2 inches of my hair (and I have shoulder length hair to begin with, so I was NOT happy), since my ends were SEVERELY damaged. The formula says it&#x27;s good for damaged hair because it repairs it, but the damage to my hair is pretty intense and irreversible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cutting my hair, my ends still feel rough and I HAVE to use the blow-drier to fix the ends up so they don&#x27;t look like hay. It&#x27;s good though, because it only took me like 10 minutes to style it, but the point of me doing this treatment was to fix my hair up a bit so as to not use heat to cause damage.... STILL caused a lot of damage and STILL have to use heat to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this treatment on my friends hair who have great, thick, non-damaged hair and theirs turned out alright. I love the results on nice hair, but not so much on hair that has already been processed often with hair dye or bleach. But I may have overdone my ends... So I will keep trying it until I get it right!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a month of daily conditioning and washing once a week, the treatment is still holding up. I&#x27;m noticing just minimal frizzing and I have about an inch of regrowth that will need to be treated soon. I would say the treatment will last another month and then will need to be redone. So, 2 months of nice hair is definitely worth the price. Since I have short hair I will be able to get 3-4 uses out of this bottle.not so much on hair that has already been processed often with hair dye or bleach. But I may have overdone my ends...

    <li> I have never had a Brazilian Blowout a salon, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I was impressed with this product based on the price. I followed the directions (mine came with directions on the bottle plus a sheet of directions stating they were updated - the only difference on the updated directions were that you should pass over hair with straightener 5-12 times instead of 7-12 times). I slept with the stuff in my hair, and the next day before I showered I decided to straighten my hair one more time for good measure. I washed my hair with sulfate free shampoo (I use Organix) and conditioned it. After showering, I dried my hair. Normally it takes me about 10-15 minutes to dry my hair and about 20-25 minutes to straighten it.  After about 10 minutes of drying, my hair looked like I had dried AND straightened it. It was very soft and silky and looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been just over two weeks, and while I can&#x27;t just let my hair air dry and wear it out (it definitely has some wave to it still), I still am enjoying being able to dry my hair and walk out the door. My hair feels healthier and is much quicker to style. I just hope I get another month or two out of it before having to do another treatment. (By the way - my hair is a couple inches past my shoulders a little less than half the bottle, so I still have enough to do another one - to me, that is a great deal for the money!)</li>
    <li> I have used keratin treatment 3 times,it&#x27;s good but in the long term hair fall occurs.and after opening the treatment bottle when we use it after 3 months it does not produce the same result as it gave before.so it&#x27;s very good for saloon usage,and for individual usage it&#x27;s fine too.</li>
