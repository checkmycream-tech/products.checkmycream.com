      <li>recommend to buy this flat Iron.its the best.</li>
      <li>Best flat iron I have had yet.</li>
      <li>It straightens my hair very quickly and because of the ceramic, its leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
      <li>it was packaged well, came in good condition and exactly what is pictured.</li>
      <li>The product is good if you have straight hair, but i have curly hair</li>
      <li>For many years I have used  the Paul Mitchell flattiron, for whatever reason the original flatiron was discontinued.</li>
      <li>I have read many of the reviews for the FHI, so I was really excited to receive my package.</li>
      <li>This is a great flatiron, much better than my Global iron.  </li>
      <li>anyways in order for this to work correctly and for girls with really curly hair wanting to experiment straightening their own hair heres and easy way.</li>
      <li>(  The Paul Mitchell flatiron made my hair shiny, silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t tug and pull on your hair; it just glides through each section so smoothly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it one more go, since it&#x27;s great in every other way!</li>
      <li>It may work better when used with the FHI hot sauce, but I just used it with biosilk and John Frieda Frizz serum.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>I wear a sew in and this flat iron curls and straighten my hair better than others that I own.</li>
      <li>I love it so much i just put in an order for the FHI 1\\&quot;;</li>
      <li>Now I am just as happy with it as I have been with my other Fhi.</li>
      <li>Lucky thing</li>
      <li>One thing that confused me is how the instruction book says it works best on damp, towel-dried hair, but I did not find this claim to be true.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I chose the FHI Heat Platform Professional!</li>
      <li>If my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry, it just took longer to straighten, having to go over each section many more times.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a flat iron that worked as good as my first FHI.</li>
      <li>pros - definitely salon quality, heats quickly, adjustable temperature dial, doesn&#x27;t catch or pull on hair, straightens pretty quickly, leaves hair looking super smooth and healthy  cons</li>
      <li>It wad well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any steam vents to direct the moisture in your hair away from you when you straighten, so it just ends up making your hair more frizzy.</li>
      <li>its 100% worth while to purchase.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, the grip is good and it works well.</li>
      <li>This works really well, is easy to handle and fast to heat up.  </li>
      <li>so far, a very good buy for the price (especially the lower amazon price) and professional quality.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist recommended this straightener and because I was in the market for a new one, I decided to spend some money instead of just buying another Revlon which was working just fine.  </li>
      <li>i use the tancho wax stick for the front of my edges to lay them down works pretty good.</li>
      <li>The first FHI Platform pulled my hair and caused breakage so I exchanged it.  </li>
      <li>Was looking for a hot flatiron to straighten my wavy hair</li>
      <li>I love it with one exception - the metal panels are not attached well enough to the body.  </li>
      <li>is much better and very smooth slide on my  hair.my hair is coarse and very long .i</li>
      <li>I love my FHI flat iron.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>I purchased this flat iron after hearing rave reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work well or not.</li>
      <li>I just love my flat iron !</li>
      <li>I love my FHI flat iron!</li>
      <li>nice product - it was too large/ heavy for my 14 year old daughter to handle comfortably, but that isn&#x27;t the fault of the device.</li>
      <li>which i know i&#x27;ll enjoy just the same</li>
      <li>It takes to much time to straight my hair..</li>
      <li>your hair soaks it up fast.</li>
      <li>It also helps reduce the frizz and keeps my hair straight all day.</li>
      <li>although I haven&#x27;t found much of a difference between it and my HAI (stopped working after about 4 years)</li>
      <li>Or if I&#x27;m straigtening my straight yet frizzy hair for a sleeker look.</li>
      <li>Heats up really fast.</li>
      <li>also sometimes it takes two passes to get a section totally straight.    </li>
      <li>I dont know what I&#x27;d do without this product, for real.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who has very curly and frizzy hair like mine.</li>
      <li>but the fact that FHI offered a 1 3/4\\&quot; at a reasonable price won me over.</li>
      <li>not only will this flat iron will straighten your hair but it straightens it quickly and easily as well as it adds shine to your hair.  </li>
      <li>You have to have it on a high setting just to get your hair straight, and the high heat breaks your hair off.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without my Fhi!</li>
      <li>These products are the best for people with serious straightening needs- any temperature less than 450 degrees does not touch my hair.</li>
      <li>anyways i have spent tons of money on lots of highend products but these products i mention are inexpensive and get the job done easy.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe I had received a defected model because I did not have this problem with my older model FHI.</li>
      <li>wash your hair,deep condition for 30 to and hour with shower cap over head, then wash deep conditoner out, section your hair off in 4 sections, use nioxin thermal bliss heat protectant with a moisturizing oil and blow dry, each section hair should come out pretty straight, then spray your hair with motions oil sheen and rub it good throughout your hair, get any serum im liking the luster pink glosser along with keracare press creme and put those two products on each strand of hair</li>
      <li>I liked how it is comfortable to hold (compared to the Hana elite iron I tried before) and the wider plates work well since I have extremely thick, long curly hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing different from the other one I own.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why this one which I paid a little more for, just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
      <li>but they seem to have solved this problem with the new platform series.  </li>
      <li>Even when your hair is super dry, it doesn&#x27;t straighten well.</li>
      <li>This flat iron is a good quality product, especially for the Amazon price, which is much less than FHI&#x27;s website.  </li>
      <li>i have really curly hair and use to get my hair done on occasions  professionally because no flat iron would be hot enough for my hair texture to make it straight.</li>
      <li>My first Fhi lasted all this time before eventually dying of a similar electrical cord issue to the Chi- shuts off as the cord spins around.     </li>
      <li>what made a big difference was using the FHI hot sauce along with it.</li>
      <li>I am natural and these make my hair look as if I have a relaxer when I am done!</li>
      <li>Spent an additional 14.00 for shipping and this is not the true manufacture maker.</li>

    <li> I plugged it in, turned it on, adjusted temp, and nothing happens. Did it a few times. Gave it a rest. Tried again. Read instruction again. Nothing different from the other one I own. It is official. It is malfunctioning product. I don&#x27;t even know how to return a product on Amazon.com. I never had the need to do so. It is such a burden and wastes time in a life of a extremely busy person... me.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a good quality product, especially for the Amazon price, which is much less than FHI&#x27;s website.  I liked how it is comfortable to hold (compared to the Hana elite iron I tried before) and the wider plates work well since I have extremely thick, long curly hair. I had an FHI iron that I purchased in 2004 that was kind of noisy -it would creak when I pressed the plates together- but they seem to have solved this problem with the new platform series.  One thing that confused me is how the instruction book says it works best on damp, towel-dried hair, but I did not find this claim to be true.  If my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry, it just took longer to straighten, having to go over each section many more times.  I even tried it on my niece who had very fine, thin hair, and it didn&#x27;t work well on her hair when wet either.  It may work better when used with the FHI hot sauce, but I just used it with biosilk and John Frieda Frizz serum.  Another thing I noticed it that it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay at 450 degrees for long while straightening.  The temperature seems to drop a little while your hair is going through the plates, but then if set down for as minute or so, the red light will start bliking again to show it reached the desired temp.  My hair never seems to stay straight for long, but that may just be my hair and the high humidity levels in Florida.  Overall, I would recommend this product.  Before purchasing, I read many reviews and ordered a Hana elite 1.5\\&quot; from another online store, because I was curious to try a new brand, but after being disappointed and wasting $14 in return shipping, I got this FHI and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Fhi hair straightener for almost 5 years (I switched over from the Chi due to repeated issues with faulty electrical cords). My first Fhi lasted all this time before eventually dying of a similar electrical cord issue to the Chi- shuts off as the cord spins around.     The 1-3/4&#x27;&#x27; was a step up in size from the 1 1/4&#x27;&#x27; I have been using for 5 years. I agree with other reviewers that initially the product pulled my hair a little bit but within the first 2 weeks of having it this no longer occurs- my thoughts are that it may have been a result of my unfamiliarity with the larger size. Now I am just as happy with it as I have been with my other Fhi. These products are the best for people with serious straightening needs- any temperature less than 450 degrees does not touch my hair. I cannot live without my Fhi!</li>
    <li> easy to use.not heavy. i have CHI falt Iron but FHI is much better and very smooth slide on my  hair.my hair is coarse and very long .i recommend to buy this flat Iron.its the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great flatiron, much better than my Global iron.  I would highly recommend anyone to use this great tool!</li>
    <li> I love my FHI flat iron. I wear a sew in and this flat iron curls and straighten my hair better than others that I own. It wad well worth the money.</li>
    <li> fhi is the only flat iron that can get my hair straight. i have really curly hair and use to get my hair done on occasions  professionally because no flat iron would be hot enough for my hair texture to make it straight. this flat iron goes up to 450, im a 450 heat type of girl lol soo.... anyways in order for this to work correctly and for girls with really curly hair wanting to experiment straightening their own hair heres and easy way. wash your hair,deep condition for 30 to and hour with shower cap over head, then wash deep conditoner out, section your hair off in 4 sections, use nioxin thermal bliss heat protectant with a moisturizing oil and blow dry, each section hair should come out pretty straight, then spray your hair with motions oil sheen and rub it good throughout your hair, get any serum im liking the luster pink glosser along with keracare press creme and put those two products on each strand of hair, when you press your hair it will come out feeling silky with a sheen. all of this might sound greasy but if u have thick curly hair like me this aint greasy at all cuse your hair soaks it up fast. i use the tancho wax stick for the front of my edges to lay them down works pretty good. anyways i have spent tons of money on lots of highend products but these products i mention are inexpensive and get the job done easy. i will list the products below.  1)deep conditoner anyone will work.  everytime you flat iron.      use these two before blowdrying so hair doesnt get messed up from heat  nioxin bliss thermal protectant hair spray  pantene oil moisturizer its in a brown bottle  use after blowdrying when straightening  motions oil sheen   luster pink glosser  keracare press creme     for edges  tancho wax stick have to buy on this website.     anyways i hope this helps whoever.   fhi 3/4 iron good for people with lots of hair and straightens faster. fhi 1 inch good for getting roots and edges better. i have both but if you can only buy one and have thick hair buy the big 3/4 one the 1 inch is basically used for my roots and for curlying my hair .</li>
    <li> I love my FHI flat iron! At first i was nervous about making such an investment in a flat iron, but i got it in the mail, went home for lunch, bumped my ends and received compliments all afternoon. I love it so much i just put in an order for the FHI 1\\&quot;; which i know i&#x27;ll enjoy just the same</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed with the FHI Platform.  I had purchased a FHI a fews yearrs ago and was very satisfied with the performance and the results.  I dropped it on a ceramic title floor and chipped it.  The chip caused the plate to flap and my hair would get caught in the flap.  After trying other brands (SEDU, CROC) I returned to the FHI.  The first FHI Platform pulled my hair and caused breakage so I exchanged it.  I thought maybe I had received a defected model because I did not have this problem with my older model FHI. Amazon happily and quickly sent me a replacement and I had the same problem.  Major pulling!  I returned it.  I&#x27;m still looking for a flat iron that worked as good as my first FHI.</li>
    <li> It takes to much time to straight my hair.. The product is good if you have straight hair, but i have curly hair and i did not like the results i got from using it..  Its definetly not professional styling iron,and will rate it 2 out of 5 stars..</li>
    <li> This iron totally damaged my hair. You have to have it on a high setting just to get your hair straight, and the high heat breaks your hair off. It doesn&#x27;t have any steam vents to direct the moisture in your hair away from you when you straighten, so it just ends up making your hair more frizzy. Even when your hair is super dry, it doesn&#x27;t straighten well. I use the Jose Eber wet to dry straightener now and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. It takes me maybe 15 min to do my hair. And I have long wavy hair. It also helps reduce the frizz and keeps my hair straight all day. I dont know what I&#x27;d do without this product, for real.</li>
    <li> pros - definitely salon quality, heats quickly, adjustable temperature dial, doesn&#x27;t catch or pull on hair, straightens pretty quickly, leaves hair looking super smooth and healthy  cons - i have long hair, and i&#x27;m used to a 2\\&quot; straightener (rather than 1 3/4\\&quot;), so it takes a bit longer than i&#x27;m used to. also sometimes it takes two passes to get a section totally straight.    so far, a very good buy for the price (especially the lower amazon price) and professional quality. the real test will be how long it lasts before the heating element wears out. for the price, i&#x27;m hoping to get two years of regular use out of this one, but i&#x27;ve never used an FHI before, so we&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I chose the FHI Heat Platform Professional! I was waivering between it and an infrashine. I have used an infrashine before and it is great but the fact that FHI offered a 1 3/4\\&quot; at a reasonable price won me over. I was crossing my fingers hoping the FHI wouldn&#x27;t let me down and it didn&#x27;t! I have semi- curly, color treated hair. Not cute curls, an annoying poofy wavy mess! With my old iron it would take me about 45min now I can get it done in 20min!!! I followed the advise of other reviewers and I use Chi 44 Iron Guard Thermal Protection spray with my FHI. I also got free shipping and got it in 2 days!!! I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new flat iron to use. I&#x27;ve had this flat iron now for over a year. It was within my price range, I liked the look of it, and I liked that it had a dial to adjust the temperature. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I straighten my wavy hair in the morning. Or if I&#x27;m straigtening my straight yet frizzy hair for a sleeker look. As soon as it is straightened it will go back to its normal frizzy state in about an hour. I&#x27;ve had other flat irons before that have worked great and never had any issues with. I don&#x27;t know why this one which I paid a little more for, just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very good product although I haven&#x27;t found much of a difference between it and my HAI (stopped working after about 4 years) what made a big difference was using the FHI hot sauce along with it.</li>
    <li> This is my third iron and I love it.</li>
    <li> I am African American. I am 25 and have very thick, dry 3C/4B hair type. I purchased this flat iron after hearing rave reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work well or not. I love this flat iron. I washed and blow[[ASIN:B000WCV7BW FHI Heat Platform Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Styling Iron 1-3/4\\&quot; with Nano, Fuzeion Technology]]ed ( for maximum length)my hair. I then applied CHI silk Infusion and Parnevu to my scalp ONLY!. I parted my hair in 4 sections, then I took about 1inch to 2 inches of hair and began flat ironing it. It worked beautifully. I took pictures, but there isn&#x27;t anywhere to post them. I am HAPPY with my purchase!! Thank you. I totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am happy about this product and the seller... it was packaged well, came in good condition and exactly what is pictured. It works good. Sometimes it smells like it is burning but it works well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that sometimes your hair can get snagged under the plates. Other than that, the grip is good and it works well. Heats up really fast.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly and frizzy hair which is a hassle to straighten. I have gone through numerous straighteners and none of them worked as well as this one. It straightens my hair very quickly and because of the ceramic, its leaves my hair very smooth. This straightener does have ceramic plates and isn&#x27;t like the others that have ceramic &#x27;paint&#x27; over it that wears off. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for almost two years now and I even accidentally left on over night! (I know, extremely dangerous) but, I turned it off for two days and when I turned it back on, it still worked like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who has very curly and frizzy hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I have read many of the reviews for the FHI, so I was really excited to receive my package. Well I was sadly disappointed. I think my earlier feelings of doubt were a warning sign! This flat iron made my hair extremely frizzy. I am a one pass girl and I set the temperature no higher than 350. For many years I have used  the Paul Mitchell flattiron, for whatever reason the original flatiron was discontinued. 8(  The Paul Mitchell flatiron made my hair shiny, silky and smooth. The FHI may have worked for some but not me!!! To be truly informative, those women like me, who happen to be biracial, or those with curly Afro textured hair may find the FHI to be a dud!!!  Ladies beware!!!</li>
    <li> Definately gets my hair straighter than my old iron that only went up to 300 degrees. The wide paddles take much less time on my long hair. Only draw back is they r too big for my bangs so I still use my old small one just for them.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth every penny!  its 100% worth while to purchase.  not only will this flat iron will straighten your hair but it straightens it quickly and easily as well as it adds shine to your hair.  i love this product!  and will definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my FHI flat iron for one and a half years. I love it with one exception - the metal panels are not attached well enough to the body.  This may be a personal problem, but my curling iron / flat iron cords often get tangled with hair dryer or other stuff on bathroom counter, and as a result sometimes slide off onto the floor.  Dropping curling/flat irons has never been a problem in the past -- nothing has ever broken -- but with this FHI the metal panels have broken away &amp; they just dangle by the cords that heat them.  This happened about half a year after buying, but I&#x27;ve been able to manage by sliding the panels back in place &amp; holding the flat iron carefully so they didn&#x27;t slip out again.  But finally, after 1.5 yrs, one of the cords that keep the panel dangling has split. I&#x27;m hoping this time around I won&#x27;t drop the iron.  I&#x27;ll give it one more go, since it&#x27;s great in every other way!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item, was a knock off and did not work. Spent an additional 14.00 for shipping and this is not the true manufacture maker. Not to mention I&#x27;m still waiting for my refund and was never notified that I could send it back. Lucky thing I went on Amazon to order something else, or I would of missed the return date. Overall I give it a minus 5....Also in order to summit this I was forced to give it one star!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Was looking for a hot flatiron to straighten my wavy hair and this is PERFECT! Works great on virgin hair!</li>
    <li> I just love my flat iron ! This is A great product right now for the hair so I&#x27;m really happy with it !! Is the best!</li>
    <li> These work wonders! I am natural and these make my hair look as if I have a relaxer when I am done!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have had yet. I would recommend this to anyone and it is a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> This straightener is such a higher quality product than other ones I&#x27;ve owned. You can even tell it&#x27;s not damaging your hair as you use it. I like that it doesn&#x27;t tug and pull on your hair; it just glides through each section so smoothly. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a few months now and I can tell that it&#x27;s going to hold up and last a long time. The cord is long and I find that it doesn&#x27;t tangle &amp; wind around as much as other straightener cords.</li>
    <li> nice product - it was too large/ heavy for my 14 year old daughter to handle comfortably, but that isn&#x27;t the fault of the device.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this straightener and because I was in the market for a new one, I decided to spend some money instead of just buying another Revlon which was working just fine.  This works really well, is easy to handle and fast to heat up.  One word of warning; it&#x27;s obvious but this is super hot and I burned myself on it so be careful!  I guess that means it works.</li>
    <li> Lasted 1 year then stopped working! I guess it&#x27;s pretty common for the eletrical part to burn out or something. Otherwise, it is a WONDERFUL flat iron.</li>
