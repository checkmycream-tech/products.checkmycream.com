      <li>I picked this product up because of two reasons: 1) it did NOT say anywhere on the package that is \\&quot;wasn&#x27;t safe\\&quot; for chemically treated/colored/highlighted hair, and 2) the product said that it contained Argan Oil, which I&#x27;ve always had great results with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was sick of frizzy hair from my blow dryer, decided to try this out. It is less frizzy, that&#x27;s for sure. But I&#x27;m most impressed by how much it reduces the time it takes to blow dry. It really does take minutes off the normal time! Remember, if you have thin hair, and you&#x27;re using this while your hair is still damp, use a little more than the \\&quot;small amount\\&quot; the bottle tells you to use.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, way too curly to keep a style that I would like. I use about a quarter size amount rubbed between my two hands and I rub all over my hair, then comb though. Blow dry as I would like.  This is the only thing that will help me keep my curls straighter. I might have to use a straight iron to tame some of the ends that are longer (just below ear length).  My hair is soft, this is not sticky, too hard, too anything. I works!  I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair, just too curly. Good product!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how great this made my hair look until I ran out.  I&#x27;ve got thinner hair but a lot of it and using this before a blow dry with a round brush  keeps it straight and smooth for days.  As everyone has said it&#x27;s hard to find on shelves (I found mine at a random beauty supply store in Queens) but glad I saw it on here!</li>
    <li> I put a full handful of the product on my head and blow dry my waste long frizzy hair. It got straight but not silky. I went to the Marina and my hair was a frizz ball within 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Make hair looks more good after flat iron or dryer</li>
    <li> Revived my hair! So happy I found this stuff online!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! !!! I AM so happy Amazon sells it since I think it&#x27;s been taken off mass market.  Most leave in conditioners either feel like regular conditioner you did not rinse out of hair or too greasy.  This one is perfect it goes through the strand of your hair,  not too greasy, leaves hair soft, no obnoxious smell. I first bought it at walmart- then when I ran out I bought two more , then drats I could not find it again until a week ago as fluke, walgreens had a loose one for sale so I snapped it up.  Atleast I can get it from anazon now.  I hate it when a favorite beauty product gets taken off mass market!  Amazon saves the day again!!!</li>
    <li> it does not work is not worth spending money on useless product&lt;br /&gt;street dust sticks to the head and the hair becomes worse</li>
    <li> This works well when I&#x27;m blowing my hair dry straight. It smells citrus-y and yummy. It&#x27;s a clear gel, not too sticky.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! GREAT GARNIER PODUCT, GREAT FOR BLOW DRYING, GREAT SHINE AFTER USING IT. HELPS HAIR STAY STRAIGHT LONGER. REALLY GOOD ON NATURALLY CURLY HAIR. SO IF YOU WANT TO GO STRAIGHT GIVE IT A TRY.</li>
    <li> For a $5 hair care product, this is definitely the best!!  I have used other straightening creams, cheap and salon expensive ones, and this definitely works for me.  I have dry, thick, and frizzy hair.  I wash my hair with Tresememe shampoo and conditioner.  I use the flowing products on my wet hair: straightening cream, Infusium 23 leave-in conditioner, and a John Frieda anti-frizz serum.  When I used the other straightening creams, and then used a flat iron to straighten it, my hair was still dry and frizzy.  Of course, the dryness and frizziness got worse as the day went on.  I brought this product on a whim.  I didn&#x27;t know about it.  I already was using a salon brand product, and the suave and John Frieda straightening creams that were sitting on my book shelf weren&#x27;t working either.  The first time I used it, I saw and felt the difference.  My hair was soft, manageable, and remained straight throughout the day.  My sister even noticed the difference!!!  I wash my hair every other day because of the dryness. When I did wash my hair after using this project, but did not add any products to my hair and let it dry naturally, I noticed that my hair was still soft and manageable.  I will continue to us this product, in combination with the other products, and hopefully it continues to give me the same results.  I definitely would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have waiting all my life for a product that keeps my hair from frizzing in the rain.  I have found it.  My hair is smooth all day long rain or shine.  The price is much better than most of then on the shelf.  That was actually why I tried it.  It was cheaper than the others, it was a new product I hadn&#x27;t tried yet so I gave it a whirl.  And to my delight, it works!!</li>
    <li> I like that it straighten my hair without having to use the flat iron. Just a small amount is needed.</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy hair and was hoping this would help me get it straighter. All it did was make my hair look greasy even though I only used a small amount. For me this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Okay, its not for me,&lt;br /&gt;but I am told that this is the best stuff and my wife complains that its sometimes hard to find locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;according to her, the Amazon price is the best she has seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so no only is it the balm, its also a bargain!</li>
    <li> I love garnier products. The sleek and shine line works really well for wavy/frizzy hair. For me a little bit gies a long wsy. I would recommend to all</li>
    <li> This product is really nice.  It is really good for keeping your hair shiny and straight for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product sparingly but it does protect the hair from heat.  I like Garnier&#x27;s products for my hair and they are easy to find at the store and more affordable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young woman, with fine blonde hair who lives in a very humid and hot area.I ran out of my Sleek and Shine oil, and decided to give this a shot. It really does cut time off of drying your hair, and leaves it straight. I can safely let my hair air dry with this, and not worry about my cowlicks making an appearance. However, it doesn&#x27;t help with frizziness once you leave your house. If you&#x27;re like me and carry a brush, then it&#x27;s no problem. If you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d recommend combining this with a light frizz spray.The best part of the product is that it&#x27;s easy to reshape every morning. Just quickly blow dry it flat and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for a hair product that will make my hair less frizzy when I blow dry it. I&#x27;ve tried Bedhead products, John Frieda products, and even straight up argon oil. While those products have helped a little, they are sometimes overly priced. So the other day while I was looking in the hair care section I stumbled upon this product. The price really helped my make my decision and I tried the product that night. It worked out great. It didn&#x27;t make my hair too oily or weigh it down, and the smell of it was great and not too over powering (which is awesome because being pregnant makes me really sensitive to smells right now) and it made my hair look great after I did a round brush blow out! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 wks now and its still doing great things for my hair. I reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this product.  I use it when I am blow drying my hair but even when I am letting hair air dry.  Either way it&#x27;s a good after-conditioning product to help tame frizz and help hair shine.  Great for normal and dry hair types.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing this product. Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Blow Dry Perfector is supposed give you the \\&quot;perfect, bouncy blow dry that lasts 24 hours\\&quot; with easier blow dries and frizz resistance. Sounds great... tame frizz, smooth and shiny hair... easier and faster blow dries. But this product isn&#x27;t great, it&#x27;s terrifying! My ends felt dry yet they were coated in an almost-stiff substance. I&#x27;ve never had to use so much shine serum to smooth out my hair. And the breakage! At first I thought I was being too hard on my hair but I wasn&#x27;t doing anything different. The only thing I did differently was use this product and I got a dozen or so 7-8 inch strands of broken hair all over my bathroom counter, and countless others tangled and broken in the bristles of my brushes. Horrible! Save your money and purchase a quality product. This one will break your hair!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair greasy and weighed down. Also I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  it is not heavy on my hair, even if i get caught in the rain!</li>
    <li> I am so amazed and happy to have found this AWESOME straightening balm!  I have spent so much money over the years on extremely expensive high-end salon products to keep my very long, thick,  fine hair looking sleek and straight at the beach and in the humidity of coastal climates and in rainy weather.  Garnier Blow Dry Perfector Straightening Balm, Sleek and Shine, is hands-down, the best product on the market!  And, the price is so inexpensive...it&#x27;s unbelievable!  I am still in shock how incredible it made my hair look after just one use!  I have really long hair...almost to my bum...and it tangles really easily.  So, after my shower, I put a nickel size amount in my hands and massaged it into my damp hair.  It smelled so great and decided to put a tiny bit more on the ends of my hair...and then dried my hair with my blow dryer.  At first, I didn&#x27;t see anything happening...then after about 3 minutes...I could feel my hair becoming sleek and soft as it became dryer from the heat.  When I finished drying my hair completely...about 15 minutes...I saw the immediate results of this product!  Amazing...Absolutely Amazing!  Garnier...you rocked this product!  My hair looks and feels beautiful!  Thank you and please never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> like other Garnier product this is great quality product. Whenever my wife uses it her hair look so slilky and shine is amazing.</li>
    <li> I use this product to flat iron my hair and it works perfectly. I am so glade I decided to get this straightening balm. The reviews were a little misleading, and at first I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it, but I am so glade I decided to give it a try. So worth it:-)</li>
    <li> The best product for a healthy looking straight hair blowout.  Resists humidity for at least 2 days. Can&#x27;t find it in the drugstores or supermarkets.</li>
    <li> A little dab of this before you dry your hair really helps keep the fly aways down.  It gives my hair a sleek look that I love.</li>
    <li> It did straighten my hair but needed the help of Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector Straightening  Mist for great result.  Also, it&#x27;s a bit heavy, so use little.</li>
    <li> i was never a fan of blow drying my hair, but i might do it more often now because this product really works, i cant believe it left my hair straight with just a little amount of it and made blow drying easier and faster.. i love it, after i blow dried my hair, i use the garnier perfector mist and straighten my hair with the straighter to make my hair looked it was done at the salon, i love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it not only before I blow dry my hair, but when I am done styling it too because I love the smell of it. It goes highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This might work for others, but it just made my hair seem dirty.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of products in general though.</li>
    <li> Perfect ! Is the word I use to describe this product. It really helps with the frizzy hair instanty. I love the fact it does not make your hair heavy.</li>
    <li> This stuff was uncomfortably sticky when I put it in my hair. I&#x27;m not sure how that is supposed to benefit it since it created some unnecessary breakage. I don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> It helps moisturize my hair, but I don&#x27;t see how it keeps my hair straight tho. My hair is dry so it doesn&#x27;t give greasy problem. Personally I think good hair conditioner gives better result than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the glowing reviews on here.  I will be throwing the tube away after just one use.  My hair turned into one big fuzzball.  I&#x27;m afraid I will go back to using Crack hair straightening lotion.  That&#x27;s the only stuff that straightens and smooths my thick, curly hair.  It sells on Amazon for $11-12.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and notice a great increase in hair smoothness and general cooperability. Smells good too! .</li>
    <li> This product works well on my relaxed colored overprocessed hair. It makes the blowdry easier and my hair looks smoother and is softer.&lt;br /&gt;Busterinky@aol.com</li>
    <li> I use this with the 3 Undo Dryness Conditioner.  I have seen a great improvement in the condition of my hair.  My only small complaint is the fragrance,  it&#x27;s pretty strong.  Luckily it is a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> This did not straighten my curly hair at all. It made it soft and not as frizzy. But every other product does the same thing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t flat iron my hair to save my life.. I can&#x27;t also always contact my beautician to flat iron my hair either..So when I can find a product that I can put through my hair to control frizz and to straighten my hair, I&#x27;m going to hop on it.. I&#x27;m of mixed heritage, my hair doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to do from time to time, but in the many times I have used this product I have no complaints and it smells good too which is always a plus.. I have always loved Garnier for my hair care needs..</li>
    <li> This product does a great job, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> Being an African American, straightening your hair can be a challenge.  I believe that this product make straightening your hair easier.  I like this product since it take the hassle out of straightening your hair.  To get the maximum results out of this product, you need to first blow dryer your hair and then use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> This product did make my hair dry faster, but I feels it also caused them to be more frizzy that they would be otherwise. It&#x27;s fine for heat protection, but dies help much for a sleek look.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I put a little bit on my wet hair after washing and before blowing it. It does really control the freez without making your hair weight down. Use a little, not too much. A little goes a long way. I have medium long, straight and thin hair.</li>
    <li> It seems good for my hair but I am not sure it really does more than protect from the blow dryer</li>
    <li> My daughter tried to steal it from me because she really liked the way it worked. Straighter, flatter hair, even after using volumizing shampoo. Garnier Fructis products are awesome for African-American hair.</li>
    <li> I would watch out for this product, it causes hair to break.  You can read about it on other sites.  I am surprised that it is still allowed on the shelves.</li>
    <li> It contains chemicals that are potentially toxic and can cause you cancer. Maybe that&#x27;s why it is 3$</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a recommendation from a very reliable friend.  I was not disappointed.  This has become a daily essential for me.  It truly allows me to have so much control over my fine, thin hair.  And it gives me the ability to skip a day or two between washings, and still be able to style my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair, especially after washing. This product actually worked ; it calmed my hair and made it look stright, in fact I didn&#x27;t have to use a flat iron. So yeah, it is a great product which works excellently. The price is really affordable too for what the product does.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife she loves it , uses it every other day and leaves a great shine and softness</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to feel like you just stepped out of a Salon, this is the product for you- I love how my hair feels and drys, with this product. Love it. I am a loyal fan of this stuff now.</li>
    <li> ...this product makes it a little easier. To start off, I have an a-line bob, baby-fine Asian hair that&#x27;s nearly impossible to volume-ize. I have been using this product for about a week after purchasing from my nearest CVS, originally wanting the get the Pureology Antisplit Blowdry. Seeing that this was a fraction of the price, AND was on sale for $5-something, I went in for the dive. I love the scent. It&#x27;s not too oily like a serum would be, and for me, speeds up dry-time which means, less damage for my hair. My hair stays smooth and stays \\&quot;bobbed\\&quot; when I used this serum. Usually my hair would lose its \\&quot;bob\\&quot; and flips outwards by the end of the day. But through wind and sweat, it stays perfect! I&#x27;m super satisfied, it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel like straw!</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product but I did not work for me, I have to put a lot on my hair any blow dry feels good immediately and after 20 mins my hair looks dry and have no shine as they said . I want something to last for a couple hours so I am looking for something new. I have straight long hair and love to keep it straight but with a shine. It may work for other people so you can given it a try OK.</li>
    <li> this product is great, i have wavy hair and it takes all the wave out as i blow dry it, and leaves it soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I just read the reviews for the kit and I was like WOW!!!!!! Is that the product that I just used for my blow dry???? Whew that was a close one. With that just said. I just started blow drying and straightening  my hair and this product works.  I use other products besides this one to tame my out of control thin frizzy hair.  I have dull thin hair and overall this product is a very good buy.  My hair feels soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Helps frizz but not a cure</li>
    <li> I am delightfully surprised.  It stopped my natural, curly hair from reverting back to spirals when I touched water to the strands to test it out.  When I touched water to other flat-ironed strands that didn&#x27;t have the balm on them, they instantly began to curl up into spirals.  This was new to me, since I used to use a relaxer cr&amp;egrave;me (which made my hair only slightly less straight with water but not curly) but stopped years ago and I am only now pondering returning to straightening at least some of the time.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to straighten for an hour then have the style ruined/altered due to it becoming very curly.  Using the Flat Iron Perfector afterwards totally erased any signs of the tiny crinkles that I used to have when I used a relaxer followed by flat ironing without a heat protector per se or a straightening balm.  So, I would use those 2 Garnier products...and maybe an extra heat protector.  A great alternative since I refuse to use a relaxer which is harsh and sometimes causes sores on the skin aside from damage to the hair.  The curls are cute (to me) but they tangle/damage and my hair dries out since I use more products.  Straight hair should require less attention and less frequent washing since I wouldn&#x27;t use a flaky itchy gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 star off is because this did not make my hair stay 100% straight all day.  It started to look a little frizzy and crinkly or wavy within 3 hours of me smoothing on a couple of drops of water.  However, it hadnt exactly reverted and 1 swipe with a flat iron made it look like new.  FYI: The 1 star off issue was before I bought the flat iron perfector.  The FIP may correct the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I get a C shape or a loose S shape to my hair length if the strand is wet.  A spritz on top of this caused it to really curl up.  No water and no added products outside of the recommended on the package, and you might have all-day straight results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update and 1 more star off: at first I was using this via gliding it along a flat iron a couple of times (without pressing down) to dry it.  After using it as directed - via a blow dryer - I see that my hair becomes stiffer than the other method, and the flat iron perfector spray also adds a little rigidity.  The next day my hair is pretty much huge even though mostly straight...a re-flat ironing scenario...if not using a pomade or something.  Using the shampoo and Conditioner really helped to stop the C shape and reduce the frizz! Also it made my hair look shiny but that went away when I flat ironed with Red Pro but I did have shine with the Conair Tourmaline Infinity Pro.  My hair still became big and I don&#x27;t like the added stiffness of the blow dry and flat iron products.  So, I will try the Loreal smooth intense and sleek it products but use up the Garnier S &amp; C.ng this via gliding it along a flat iron a couple of times (without pressing down) to dry it.

    <li> I usually use Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier on my curly hair but lately started looking for something for blowouts now that the humidity is dropping.  I have used this product three times this week and am pretty happy with it.  Is my hair straight and totally smooth?  No, but it&#x27;s a lot better than it was before.  I may need to play with how much I use.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!! it keeps my hair smooth and frizz free in July/august in NYC! The heat and humidity are unbearable around here in the summer, esp. in the subways but this def. helps and for a great price!!!</li>
    <li> Does not leave my hair heavy or oily.  So far has stood up to frizzing.  Will be keeping this product around, works much better then many of the pricy balms.</li>
    <li> This product works great and is easy to use. It leaves my hair soft and straight for days: so luxurious! I did expect my hair to be sleek right after the blow dry, but I still exprienced some fly aways with my finer, shorter hair. Some Garnier Sleek and Shine balm fixed that for me. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I recently found this Garnier product in my local Target and decided to purchase it.  I had read previous reviews about another similar Garnier product called \\&quot;The Blow Dry Perfector Kit,\\&quot; and was completely horrified by all the reviews I read.  I thank my lucky stars that I did not try that product out myself, otherwise I am quite convinced that I would be bald.  The vast majority of the people who used \\&quot;The Blow Dry Perfector Kit\\&quot; had a terrible experience which resulted in having the product completely ruin their hair.  That being said, this product is something new that actually delivers promising results -- not fried, broken, or damaged hair, but instead, it helps with giving you sleek, smooth, frizz-free hair.  Not to mention SOFT hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is baby-fine hair that has a wave to it, and I don&#x27;t have very much of it at all.  I have bleached highlights in my hair &amp; its shoulder-length.  My hair also tends to frizz in the humidity, and I wrestle my hair with a blow-dryer and flat iron daily to get it completely straight.  I picked this product up because of two reasons: 1) it did NOT say anywhere on the package that is \\&quot;wasn&#x27;t safe\\&quot; for chemically treated/colored/highlighted hair, and 2) the product said that it contained Argan Oil, which I&#x27;ve always had great results with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have such thin hair, I decided to first try out a pea-sized amount (well, more like the amount of 2 peas).  I ran this product through damp, towel-dried hair.  It had a creamy consistency and looked almost like a lotion for your hair.  The scent was pleasant, not over-bearing in the least.  I then blow dried my hair and was very pleased with the results.  It made my hair very smooth without that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or heavy feeling.  Since I have such fine hair, too much of any product seems to make it greasy/weight it down, but this hair creme certainly did not.  I do think, however, that if you were to use TOO much of this product, that it might become greasy.  It also made my hair feel very soft/supple, and it also seemed to completely tame the little frizzies &amp; fly-aways that I have throughout my hair, or especially wherever I part my hair.  Again, please note that this product is NOT the same as \\&quot;The Blow Dry Perfector Kit\\&quot; that had all the horrible reviews (which contains two bottles/products) -- this is simply a leave-in styling aid that is like a creme/lotion made for your hair.  This product is definitely worth a try!made my hair feel very soft/supple, and it also seemed to completely tame the little frizzies &amp; fly-aways that I have throughout my hair, or especially wherever I part my hair.

    <li> It did not smell that good. It didn&#x27;t make my hair any softer or protect from heat very much. It kinda made my hair feel dry yet oily. Also when putting it on some of my hairs would break off. Maybe this would be better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have colored treated hair or straightens their hair everyday. It doesn&#x27;t protect well for that kind of level.</li>
    <li> I like how this product.  It improves the look of my hair.</li>
    <li> Well I use it before blow drying, havent noticed a significant difference. I used it after straightening, it brings my hair curly again, but its nice curls. I will keep it. Also smells like oranges for those of you that were wondering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Blk and Hawaiian so I have crazy curly hair. Every now and then I like to straighten it out. This product works so well with my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make it feel heavy or greasy like some products I&#x27;ve tried. It smells great and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Does very little on my wee ones ringlets (3cm diameter approx), even when blow dried. very disappointing. Don&#x27;t know if the summer humidity interfered. Generously given 2 stars since no harm done!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair every day. Not too heavy, not too light. It works better than more expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried, so now this is all I use.</li>
    <li> This product won&#x27;t completely straighten your hair but if you have a tough time straightening your hair with an iron this could help you prepare it. It makes my hair really healthy and shiny looking and I really like it so far</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, definitely using it from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t put more than a dime amount for longer hair like me or put it excessively around your routes, just like any other hair product.&lt;br /&gt;Use the right amount, and it makes your hair BEAUTIFUL,&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that when I use it with the garnier straightening spray, it comes out even better!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading so many good reviews and was hoping it would cut down on my blow dry time and provide smoother results for my wavy hair (I have VERY fine/thin hair that is a combo of wavy and straight-ish and frizzes easily, but is able to be strightened with some work). I don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m doing wrong, but I can&#x27;t seem to get this to work for me. I&#x27;ve tried using varying amounts and still don&#x27;t see where it does anything for my particular hair. It doesn&#x27;t speed up my drying time at all, and I feel as if it almost makes my hair frizzier and leaves it with a weird texture, not at all smooth and silky. It also didn&#x27;t hold up to humidity whatsoever. I&#x27;ll stick to using Moroccan oil serum because it does help with speeding up dry time and providing nice texture (so long as you don&#x27;t use too much serum). Just wanted something that would help straighten it better so it wouldn&#x27;t be completely necessary to use a flat iron anymore.&lt;br /&gt;However, I DO like to use this when I wear my hair in it&#x27;s natural waves. Since it does have some argan oil in it, it helps a little with the frizzies, but I especially like it because it helps straighten out the waves a little so they&#x27;re more \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;. It helps softly define them and when I use it in combination with my leave in conditioner, I can leave it air dry and get nice results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not expensive and there&#x27;s alotta people who love it, so it&#x27;s worth a shot. If nothing else, most stores will let you return something if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> The best thing I can say about this product is that it smells good. I&#x27;m not really sure it makes blow drying any easier or better. Maybe it has thermal protection? I&#x27;m just waiting for it to run out. I don&#x27;t plan on buying this again.</li>
    <li> Used it on wet extension, allowed it to air dry and didn&#x27;t have to blow dry it and it still remained straight! Only thing I did was brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older lady who has a perm.  I didn&#x27;t quite like the tight curls and I used this.  I love it.  It subdued my hair just a bit like I wanted and it was soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. I can&#x27;t find a product that will keep my hair straight and silky.</li>
    <li> I use this on my curly hair in the summer when humidity is at it&#x27;s highest... I apply wet then blow dry... It&#x27;s REALLY sticky &amp; thick but works great</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and although it has a fairly ok smell, It doesnt help me much when I am blow drying my hair.  My hair on most occasions end up frizzy at the ends . Im not sure if this might be due to the type hair (afro kinky)</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair sooooo smooth! It helps to dry quickly, keeps all the frizz away! I have a lot of hair, thick and wavy! With this product, I can even leave it air dry, and it looks beautiful and with volume controled!</li>
    <li> This blow dry balm is great. Its silky (actually feels like silk when you rub it between your hands) and quickly absorbs into your hair without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it works very well for blowdrying hair straight, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you can&#x27;t use it on wavy hairstyles. I use it each time I blowdry my hair, whether I&#x27;m styling it wavy/curly or straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried many blowdry lotions or balms, but this one works great and I now use it in place of a shine spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great-pretty consistent with other garnier hair products. Fresh and slightly fruity.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just an idiot, but I thought this would protect my hair. I must have read &amp;#34;perfector&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;protector&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s not what it says. Nowhere on the bottle does it say it will protect your hair. It&#x27;s very misleading, because you would assume that something to blow dry your hair would also protect it. My horrible split ends can tell you that this is not the case. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the heck was going on with my hair, and then finally it clicked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a real hair protectant! Toss this bottle in the trash because it doesn&#x27;t do anything except make your hair super waxy after a few hours.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m the type of girl that&#x27;s new to using makeup, styling my hair etc. I took a chance in buying this product bc it had good reviews. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item bc once I blow dried my hair my hair felt smooth and smelled nice. I have thick hair and its between straight and wavy. Before I blow dry my hair I use the tresmme heat protector spray and then apply a small amount of garnier straightening balm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m biracial and I have course hair! Before using this product, I could never get my hair strait and it drove me insane! Then I used this product and it made my hair completely flat! Not to mention it smells good! It works better if you put it in after you wash your hair, the results turn out better!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything bad to say about this product. It does what it says it does but I have straight hair anyways. It does give my hair a sleek and shine look without the straggly hair pieces that like to pop up and say &amp;#34;hello.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I hate reading reviews and thinking that these people must work for the company but I am just an ordinary woman that has decided to go natural and needed something to manage my hair without perming it. I used this after washing my hair and it has worked wonders. I would post a picture here but I don&#x27;t know how to do it. Anyway, I could not believe this was so affordable and did such a wonderful job on my pretty coarse hair. I would highly recommend if you too are on the natural journey!</li>
    <li> this item is OKAY it doesnt do exactaly what i thought it would do but i guess it gets the job done OKAY !</li>
    <li> I have natural african american hair so I thought I would try the product for a slightly straightened effect. It dried my hair faster than usual but left my hair with a coarse and harsh texture. I won&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This product works very well I blow dry and or straighten my hair everyday and having curly hair it makes it way eaiser.</li>
    <li> Just makes hair straightening so much easier! Unfortunately hard to find anymore!</li>
    <li> I love love this product!!!! I am bi racial (black and white) and after getting my hair wet it is usually very frizzy. So I picked this up at target for like 3 dollars and I used it after treating my hair with extra virgin coconut oil and shampooing and conditioning with olive oil brand shampoo and aussie 3 minute miracle. After this process I used this product to blow dry and it turned out beautifully probably about 70% less frizzy and this made flat ironing sooooo much easier!!!! I will be using this religiously from now on.</li>
    <li> this keeps the frizz down to tame my hair enough to make it look awesome.&lt;br /&gt;but also gives it that sleek pushed back look. Great product</li>
    <li> Appllied it to towel dried hair and blow dry on low heat while combing the hair for 10 min. It doesn&#x27;t give perfect straightened hair like flat iron, but soft, manageable, somewhat straight hair. I liked it, it saves time compared to flat iron(20 - 30 min for my hair) and its easy to blow dry than flat iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my teenage daughter and she loves using it after showering and just before she is ready to blow dry her hair it keeps the frizziness away, she said.</li>
    <li> Works great but it smells funny. This is a common thing with Garnier, I find. Their products are fab but have funny smells. This product is smoothing and de volumizing, which is good for me. I&#x27;m a wavy on the verge of curly hair type. For me, I had to use a LOT of product. More than an average person, I&#x27;d say. Thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t cost much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I thought this was supposed to be a larger version of the stuff that came with the Garnier Perfect Blow, but it seems to be something else entirely.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say. it&#x27;s not great of a product. it&#x27;s super thick and makes my hair feel nasty.</li>
    <li> The only blow dry protectant that does what it says it will do.  Protect my hair.  I&#x27;ve used other products and found a lot of breakage due to blow drying daily.  When I use this, that never happens.</li>
    <li> I normally do not review products online, I usually just tell people by word of mouth. But this product is very worthy of a review. Like another reviewer said, this is NOT the blow dry perfector kit that Garnier has that is getting such poor reviews. This is the straightening balm that is applied just before blow drying. It is amazing. I am transitioning from relaxed hair back to natural but still want to wear my hair straight on occasion. I didn&#x27;t think I could achieve a nice blow out without going to a salon.  However, after using this product and a round brush, my hair was bouncy, full of body, shiny and healthier looking. Normally when I dry my hair, it is dry, dull and lifeless.  I always have to apply additional heat using a flat iron or large barrel curling iron. But after my hair was dry, I didn&#x27;t even need to do so.  I highly recommend this product, particularly for those natural girls out there that still want to wear their hair straight on occasion. Truly pleased with the results. Also, the product claims to help blow out last 3 days with no frizziness. I had to go out during a thunderstorm 2 days after my blowout and NO FRIZZ!!!!! Excellent product![[ASIN:B0058CJUWO Garnier Blow Dry Perfector Straightening Balm, Sleek and Shine, 5.1 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Sort of works, sort of does not work. Does not last all day, but a quick morning fix.  Fine line between to much or too little.</li>
    <li> This product did not really do anything for me.  It was a little too thick for my liking and when I applied it to my hair, I did not see any difference from when I would blow dry or style my hair without it.  If I put this too close to my roots it would make them extremely greasy and if I put the product on the ends of my hair it did not help the frizz whatsoever.  This product is so reasonable that it wasn&#x27;t really a waste to try.  My hair is chemically treated and a little more damaged than most sine I have drastically gone from blonde to black so if you have virgin hair or just lightly highlighted hair then this product might work for you.  My hair is also a little wavy, not straight and not curly so it might work a little better with someone with a different type of texture.</li>
    <li> When you put the balm in your hair the balm kind of balls up a little bit, but once you start blow drying and brushing they disappear.  Things that I wish that were listed previous to buying.  It says on the back that they recommend a round brush while blow drying.  Also, this product &amp;#34;helps&amp;#34; straighten your hair but doesn&#x27;t fully.  It also says on the back to match this product with the Flat Iron spray.  Even then using both products if you have naturally wavy hair it still isn&#x27;t completely straight, but pretty close.  Still a nice product though.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I bought this product to get a nice sleek blow dry without having to use the flat iron.  I don&#x27;t find that my hair is any sleeker when using this product (as compared to using nothing at all) BUT I think it feels like a marvelous leave in treatment! It makes my hair softer and more manageable and seems to control the static fairly well. BUT I still find myself flat ironing my hair daily - what I was trying to avoid from the beginning. So, not bad....just not perfect.</li>
    <li> I am in awe with how well this product delivers for the price. I have really difficult wavy/curly hair that is exhausting to blow out. I&#x27;ve tried products that cost 10 times as much as this one, and only worked half as well. I don&#x27;t know what ingredient accounts for the magic here, but I&#x27;m hooked. What&#x27;s comical to me is I bought this item on close out at my grocery store, mostly because it was cheap and I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot after I ran out of my more expensive product. Now I&#x27;m on Amazon hunting down more bottles to stock up on my supply because the grocery store is out. Bottom line: buy this product (just don&#x27;t buy so much that I can&#x27;t find any).</li>
    <li> This product is great! It helps with the drying process, it smells awesome and makes my hair look great even without straightening my hair!</li>
    <li> it smells good but it doesn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary to my curly hair when I want to blow it out.</li>
    <li> This balm works. It pencil straightens your hair well.  You dont need alot of it to do the job. Its cheap and affordable.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me except make my hair look a little dry. I am giving it away. I prefer the shine oils. They shine and control frizz and my hair NEVER feels of looks dry.</li>
    <li> Just what I need to moisturize my hair. It does the job. Makes my hair soft and silky without over drying.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps with the frizzes.  I use it as recommended.  Smells nice doesn&#x27;t leave hair icky either.  It last me for 2 days easy.  I use it with a brush blow dryer also.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing it prevents my hair from going frizzy and and it does not heat up</li>
    <li> This is one product that I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased. At first, it was okay as I was only using it every so often. Recently, I started using it almost every day and the build up is awful. My hair feels like someone has poured wax on it. I don&#x27;t like to strip my hair since it&#x27;s harsh, but I&#x27;m afraid I might have to at this point. I only use a super tiny amount, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m using gobs on it. Very disappointed and just hope I can get the normal, soft texture back to my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a year into transitioning and wanted to try something new when blow drying to give my hair a less full looking effect..more of a bone straight relaxed look.  Read a couple of reviews that were excellent for hair types like mine.  Tried it last night and it does what it says!  My hair is bouncy and straight and it rained really hard this morning...still straight.  No revsersion from the weather.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair...silky and was so bouncy I had a hard time wrapping it last night.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I like this product, I do not use it all the time, but I do like it, and it is a good price for the product, I would recommend this product, it works good, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, and works well for the purpose it is used for.</li>
</ol>
