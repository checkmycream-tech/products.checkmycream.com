      <li>This mannequin head is very good for the price.</li>
      <li>Arrived in great shape, just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>So in all was a great purchase an</li>
      <li>Now I have a good way to display a mask I knitted for the fair!</li>
      <li>and it was packaged very nicely.</li>
      <li>and I can just leave them overnight very nice</li>
      <li>Just what I needed and fits good on my tripod</li>
      <li>i like drawing my own face on it and make-up.  </li>
      <li>My own head measures 21 inches.</li>
      <li>It was in tack no broken pieces and it perfect for displaying my sisters homemade effects masks.</li>
      <li>My Foam Bald Mannequin Head arrived on time and and in good condition and my wig fit nicely on it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of wigs, and needed more heads for storage.</li>
      <li>Came faster than expected and works perfectly, 5 stars all around</li>
      <li>all cute and keep my wig clean and in place.</li>
      <li>so that wasn&#x27;t a huge problem.</li>
      <li>Chances are, if you guy a Styrofoam head online for a price like this, you will have to modify it to fit your head shape regardless of the price.</li>
      <li>Works great for my long wigs or ones</li>
      <li>my mom freaked out when this came in the mail because apparently a good foam wig head would be around 90$, but i only paid about 5$.</li>
      <li>I wonder if a large version is available somewhere?</li>
      <li>my family has had much fun decorating this head.  </li>
      <li>Its cranium is soft but sturdy so pins can be inserted in it easily to.</li>
      <li>Nothing special, decent foam material.</li>
      <li>The ones I received do not look exactly like the product images.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Its solid too, so no holes or dents will be produced easily either.</li>
      <li>especially if you use them to sell wigs, believe it or not a cute little face on it makes the wig look more attractive!!</li>
      <li>The head is some what small for sewing wigs on, so i have to stretch the wig cap all the way to the mannequin&#x27;s nose for an accurate fit.</li>
      <li>It will live to see another Halloween I expect.</li>
      <li>I can live with that</li>
      <li>Its rather short, so a long wig would not be a great fit for this, due to the ends may get frayed or dirty from not being lifted up of the surface.</li>

<li> The crown of unstructured hats gets stretched out, while stiffer hats are unbalanced and the head keeps tipping over.</li>

<li> does the job, a few bumps on the face from shipping and packaging, but it is only foam</li>
<li> I used this to make a u-part wig and the head is super tiny, which made things very difficult for me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than some other wig heads on the market, but I expected it to be small anyway</li>
<li> There was very little extra in the box to prevent it from moving around.</li>
<li> So, who&#x27;s head is actually this small?</li>
<li> works for the average head.  </li>
<li> You know, those little air bag things they put in boxes now.</li>
<li> it was a little dented up when i received it</li>
<li> but it still does the job and also the head was quite small so just fyi.</li>
<li> Well my stand was broken in half.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
<li> I was horribly disappointed.</li>
<li> What really angered me was how it arrived.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s just like the picture and it was packaged very nicely. Works great for my long wigs or ones I am styling for a con and I can just leave them overnight very nice</li>
    <li> my mom freaked out when this came in the mail because apparently a good foam wig head would be around 90$, but i only paid about 5$. does the job, a few bumps on the face from shipping and packaging, but it is only foam so what can you do.</li>
    <li> Still using it for an outside Halloween decoration 3 yrs. later</li>
    <li> I ordered this to hold my crochet hats while putting on embellishments and to take pictures. I was horribly disappointed. The head I got only measured 20 inches and not the 20.5 inches as described. My own head measures 21 inches. I can live with that but I&#x27;m not happy. What really angered me was how it arrived. There was very little extra in the box to prevent it from moving around. You know, those little air bag things they put in boxes now. Well my stand was broken in half. So the head doesn&#x27;t stand. Which I need it to do. Going to try to return it for a new one and hopefully the new one won&#x27;t be broken</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and fits good on my tripod</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s a bit smaller than some other wig heads on the market, but I expected it to be small anyway so that wasn&#x27;t a huge problem. Chances are, if you guy a Styrofoam head online for a price like this, you will have to modify it to fit your head shape regardless of the price. Other than that, it&#x27;s fairly standard.</li>
    <li> Did what I needed it to do. Meets the need. I have a lot of wigs, and needed more heads for storage.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great shape, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Came faster than expected and works perfectly, 5 stars all around</li>
    <li> She loves it. It does what it is meant to do.  Best of all, the price was the best anywhere.</li>
    <li> This mannequin head is very good for the price. I keep my wig on it and it just sits there all cute and keep my wig clean and in place.</li>
    <li> So, who&#x27;s head is actually this small? I used this to make a u-part wig and the head is super tiny, which made things very difficult for me. I wonder if a large version is available somewhere?</li>
    <li> a foam head is a foam head.  not always.  this one has stayed well put together with all the wear and tear and water i put it through.  some fall apart.  i like drawing my own face on it and make-up.  especially if you use them to sell wigs, believe it or not a cute little face on it makes the wig look more attractive!!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, decent foam material. The ones I received do not look exactly like the product images. The noses and lips are significantly smaller and there are no eyebrow ridges.&lt;br /&gt;Note that the head circumference is 20&amp;#34;. Definitely smaller than an medium-large NFL product hat.</li>
    <li> it came in the mail today and a chucky of the strofoam was gone and not in box and face was smashed I wanted it in mint condtion and it no where close to that wanted for display</li>
    <li> I hoped to use this to store some fragile hats but it&#x27;s very small, much smaller than an adult&#x27;s head. The crown of unstructured hats gets stretched out, while stiffer hats are unbalanced and the head keeps tipping over. But if all you want is a piece of head-shaped styrofoam ... this is one.</li>
    <li> The head is some what small for sewing wigs on, so i have to stretch the wig cap all the way to the mannequin&#x27;s nose for an accurate fit. However, it serves it&#x27;s purpose and holds the completed wigs well.</li>
    <li> it was a little dented up when i received it but it still does the job and also the head was quite small so just fyi.</li>
    <li> works for the average head.  Perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Got to hold a Halloween wig so the synthetic hair would not bend or get misshapen in the heat. Its rather short, so a long wig would not be a great fit for this, due to the ends may get frayed or dirty from not being lifted up of the surface. Its solid too, so no holes or dents will be produced easily either. Its cranium is soft but sturdy so pins can be inserted in it easily to. So in all was a great purchase an I would recommend to a friend with a wig or costume, but would keep in mind the height.</li>
    <li> What can I say about a styrofoam mannequin head? It was shipped without damage and worked as a Halloween prop just the way I wanted it to. It will live to see another Halloween I expect.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived promptly and to my expectations! Now I have a good way to display a mask I knitted for the fair!</li>
    <li> My Foam Bald Mannequin Head arrived on time and and in good condition and my wig fit nicely on it</li>
    <li> It shipped on time and was just as the details describbed. It was in tack no broken pieces and it perfect for displaying my sisters homemade effects masks.</li>
    <li> a very good head.  my family has had much fun decorating this head.  i am planning on using it for a scarecrow</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  It was used for when making hats.  It was a  bday gift.</li>
    <li> Just how I thought they would be</li>
