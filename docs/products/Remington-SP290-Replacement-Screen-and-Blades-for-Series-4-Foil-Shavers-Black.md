<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These did not last more than a few days before they came loose while I was shaving.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely matter and fits my shaver perfectly. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> As long as the motor keeps running I will keep replacing the screen and blades so that it shaves like new.  I have a newer remington shaver and don,t like it as well.</li>
    <li> Screens don&#x27;t last very long but they are comfortable when they are still good.</li>
    <li> Great price, delivered prior to promised delivery time, fits perfectly!</li>
    <li> Spare parts.  Get them while they are new.</li>
    <li> I like this electric razor, I have had it for a couple years now and all I have to do is buy new screen and blades every 4 months or so and the thing is fantastic! It&#x27;s a clean and close shave, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like so many razors do, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Love it. Buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement item for when the screens and cutters wear out on the shaver purchased at the same time. I do not expect to use it for several more months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed and I have had no problems with it since 3 weeks has passed.  Nice.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my Remington.. Just what I needed.. So glad they have replacements because i almost bought a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Works so well I decided not to replace the razor with another one. This is the original screen &amp; blades that came on the razor. It&#x27;s so nice to shave &amp; not have it pull the hair out &amp; feels nice &amp; smooth as it cuts.</li>
    <li> Great blades! On auto delivery!  My husband uses a Remington shaver on his bald head daily.  these blades get his head nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, Remington foil and blades #SP290. Much better pricing than through Remington or a retail store. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used The remington shavers for 65 years and have always preferred their products to their competitors.  Amen Lowell Merrell</li>
    <li> Supplies needed. Meets the requirements.</li>
    <li> Good replacement foil and blades. So far so good and going strong. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I expected. A razor refill. My husband says it pulls the hairs instead of a smooth shave, but he is learning how to get around that.</li>
    <li> I recommend the seller was very attentive. Product very nice! i liked.</li>
    <li> Because Walmart has stopped selling shaver screens and cutters, thereby making even their top of the line items short-lived, Amazon saves our bacon, as usual.</li>
    <li> Better price than in stores.  Makes razor last a long time.</li>
    <li> JUST LIKE ALWAYS LIKE YOU PROMISE...ON TIME, HAND DELIVERED, NUTTIN BAD TO SAY. REMINGTON SP290 FITS PERFECT ON SHAVER.BRAND NEW AND ALWAYS WORK FINE. LEAVES MY FACE SOFT AND NO NUBBS.WILL ORDER AGAIN WHEN ITS TIME TO BUY ANOTHER ONE.</li>
    <li> Great product. I received it on time, price was great and even less expensive than I expected to pay. Great product all around. Thanks.</li>
    <li> When I needed a new screen for my Series 4 Remington shaver I went to Amazon and was very happy to find just the item I needed.  I ordered two sets and it was processed and received at my house very quickly.  It was easy to remove the old cutters and pop on the new screen.</li>
    <li> Item was perfect.  What a difference.  I forgot what the razor used to cut like.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful to be able to refill a razor that is not the latest model, and to do so without paying a fortune for &amp;#34;old stock&amp;#34; or for excessive shipping charges.  Remington makes fine products which have very good lifespans, and this razor is a favorite of the men in our home.  The refills fit well and function perfectly.  The pack is just the right size to last a while, and the price is right.  We have had very good luck and experience with Remington products.  It is our hope that Amazon will continue to stock refills for this and all of the Remington products, and we will continue to purchase them.</li>
    <li> Perfict replacement for th original.</li>
    <li> So far... so good.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou! !</li>
    <li> A lifesaver of a head!  The last head I had wore through, kept popping off and was pulling on my whiskers as well and these aren&#x27;t just anywhere out there anymore and even worse, go to a razor I had no desire to toss out, considering how expensive the newer ones are and how poorly they (per reviews) seem to cut.</li>
    <li> Item worked great and fast shipment</li>
    <li> Wrong size for my fixed Remingtion head but I kept for my other Remington. Arrived on the delivery-by-date.</li>
    <li> I have bought replacements heads and foils before for the same razor and this was by far the cheapest ill fitting one.  It tends to not seat well on the razor head and comes off when I remove the plastic cover.  I would not recommend purchasing, go somewhere else.  This is a very cheap and poor imitation.</li>
    <li> I had my shaver for probably a year and half when I finally wore a hole in one of the screens.  Purchased this replacement set and now I&#x27;m up and shaving again, much to my wife&#x27;s delight.  Incidentally, I did not notice an improvement in shave quality from the previous set, which just goes to show that replacing at 3 or 6 months is overkill.  I probably buy another set in a year and keep them in a drawer until I wear a hole in the screen of this set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by Remington replacement parts. They always do what they&#x27;re supposed to do! But for God&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t buy them from your local retailer unless it is an emergency, because the markup there is excessive. Be sure to do your homework when selecting a seller. If you choose to pay full price, the cost of a new shaver isn&#x27;t all that much more. If you hold out for a bargain, you can keep that shaver going for a reasonable price. I bought this in July 2013 for about $14.50 with free shipping. Happy bargain hunting!</li>
    <li> On time, at advertised price. Perfect fit!</li>
    <li> What more is there to say? It fit my shaver perfectly and the save is smooth. 4 more words required.</li>
    <li> Excellent and within 30 seconds ,shaving again.  Easy shopping at Amazon for new or replacing items. I don&#x27;t even have to leave home to shop.</li>
    <li> There is no way I could find this item locally so I was very happy to find it here. After bringing my electric razor out of the drawer I saw the screen has been damaged. The razor was still working fine but unusable in that condition. I have learned to keep the protective cover on when not using. This was a fair price for this replacement screen and blades.</li>
    <li> This product quality is very good and the price is incredible I borought it for my husband and he love it I will order more for him .</li>
    <li> These screens appear to be identical to the original but are not.  The individual foils have some vertical play in them where the original clipped in tightly.  This seems to have no affect on the performance, and the razor seems to shave as well as ever.</li>
    <li> purchased this item for my husband.  Service was excellent!  Received it super fast!  He says the price was much better than buying at a retail store, plus it isn&#x27;t always available in many stores.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my Remington. Walmart stopped selling the shavers. Mine still works. Great shaver.</li>
    <li> good product, as described,  Thanks</li>
    <li> The parts did not fit the razor for which l purchased them. Awaiting approval for return. See photo.</li>
    <li> I first checked out the factory item, then I looked at the replacement item offered at Amazon, no comparison in price,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was much better.  The order came in fast and the item was perfect, installed easily, and bingo, a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this experience.</li>
    <li> As described.  Works well</li>
    <li> The replacement is okay, but just barely better than the original blades and screen that were nearly 2 years old.  I expected better.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The SP290 replacement screen and blades fit perfectly, and shaves smooth just like when it was brand new. Also they look, and fit exactly like the original parts. The SP290 are the replacements listed on the box. I wrote this information down in the instruction manual, and I&#x27;m glad I did, because it was easy to look up on Amazon since I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Happy with seller and purchase.</li>
    <li> We looked several places to replace the shaver heads and found this site which had excellent prices. The merchandise arrived sooner than we had expected, the price was excellent, the merchandise was just what we expected. We have only good things to say about this merchant. We would use them again.</li>
    <li> Good price.  I wish these things lasted longer.  That&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> The foils are a perfect replacement match.  My gripe is the design of the shaver head itself.  The sides of the shaver head have a protruding piece of plastic on the top of each side that digs into your neck and takes a bit of getting used to.  Seems like the designers never actually used the product before selling it.  Once you get used to it it&#x27;s fine, but still a nuisance.</li>
    <li> The screens lasted about one week and then bent so it was unusable.  Very disappointed.  May be best to pay a little more and purchase a Remington prodyct.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time well packaged &amp; as described. Product works well.</li>
    <li> Stores only have a few of the many cutters and screeens for sale. Will buy from Amazon.com again, that is for sure.</li>
    <li> Worked great with my 5 year old Remington. The head was slightly different so I took the foil assemblies out through the top, and popped them into my older style housing - worked perfect and my shaver works like new!</li>
    <li> Bought these replacement blades for my shaver, Have used them before, as everyone knows the shavers dont last very long, but replacement blades at the store were double the price, so I tried amazon, they were shipped fast and i was back to a clean shave, Direct Replacement cheaper then the store and shipped right to our house!</li>
    <li> I order these when needed from this supplier.  Price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;They usually last from 4-6 months, depending on use and type of beard</li>
    <li> Right product at great price</li>
    <li> Perfect fit!  Runs like new again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had my shaver for about six months before the foil futzed out on me. These work just like the shaver is brand new.</li>
    <li> Both the cutter blades and the screen fit easily onto the razor and function well. It is simple and straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;  While it is recommended to change the blades and screens at regular intervals, the screens can and sometimes do get holes or snags before the blades need replacing. It would be nice and save resources to have Remington screens available separately.&lt;br /&gt;  This is my second order of Remington replacement parts. Previously I tried a generic screen, which required a fair amount of patience to get into the plastic housing, and never did seem to fit as well,</li>
    <li> A good replacement for the series 4. Snaps right in and just use, again. Good shave, once more.Couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
    <li> I just needed replacement blades for my razor, these are reasonably priced. Now I can use my electric again. As I have some scar tissue to shave the electric serves as my quick and adequate.</li>
    <li> This Remington screen and blade replacement was exactly the right item, the price was reasonable and shipment was quick</li>
    <li> Will keep buying as long as my shaver holds-up.  Much better price than the store and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to replace the head (cutters &amp; foil) on my Remington shaver.  Delivery was quick.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The screen and blades should last a long time when kept clean and not damaged, but it is good to replace as needed.</li>
    <li> The foil is very fragile.  I have damaged two of them already by simply touching them while removing the assembly to clean it.  The foil cracked both times.</li>
    <li> Everything is good with it the only thing was a problem for me was the price kind of expensive $ for a replacement</li>
    <li> I was skeptical really, expecting something NOT to fit right.  Much to my delight, I have been shaving for a few weeks now and all is working well.</li>
    <li> Could not find in stores . Ordered this fit like it should . Shaved like brand new . Easy to install.</li>
    <li> Good value.  With my tough facial hair, these are the only ones that will last a full 6 months before the first hint of becoming worn.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in good packaging and met expectations.</li>
    <li> works great -fits better than original</li>
    <li> Its amazing what a new razor screen and razors will do for you and your face. :) Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Every thing came in on time and in good condition, really saves money to replace just the blades&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver needed a replacement head. He was going to throw it away but I went on Amazon to research. I found it and it was way cheaper than buying it from the store. It fits perfectly and shaves better that the original head.</li>
    <li> Right item, fast delivery, even to Maui!</li>
    <li> It did what it is supposed to do, which is replace the worn-out blades and foil, which were about 2 years old. Removing and putting in the new blades is a little troublesome in terms of fitting your fingers in the enclosed space to lift the old ones out, which is why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is the second replacement blades and screens I have bought from the same seller. They look exactly like the package and fit the F4790.  I looked at the date of last purchase, along with when I bought the razor, and they&#x27;re lasting me about a year before replacement. Both times I was already thinking about needing to think about a replacement because the cutting starts getting not so great at getting all the hairs, then I accidentily damaged the screen(s).  I was in luck I was already thinking about replacement, but those screens are so easy to break so watch out!  Once they&#x27;re broke, they cut the skin.  I&#x27;d suggest getting this duo package and save the screens as backups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;ve owned remington&#x27;s like this one more than any other razor because they last long and cut well.  Had one razor last 5+ years and this one is going on 2 now.</li>
    <li> Works great Price is great , remember when blades where as much as a razor, thank you,</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I got this replacement blade set and it works great , A little pricy but better then buying a all new razor .</li>
    <li> When I decided to order and install the screen and replacement blades for my Remington foil shaver, I had no idea what a positive difference they would make for my daily shaving experience.  It&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver -- smooth, quick and comfortable.  My order arrived quickly and the Amazon price was a bargain over in-store replacement prices.  I now plan to order a new foil and blades annually.</li>
    <li> Replacement came on time and in original packaging.Fit shaver perfectly! Hard to find another deal for this item because local stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> I found this on the internet after I was unable to locate in several local stores.  I also paid less than what I had paid for previous replacements I found at local stores.  Win-Win!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I got this when I noticed my original foil had a hole in it, the blade had actually worn the foil though and left a sharp spot. I got this, it fit right on, it&#x27;s not 100% the same, but it&#x27;s 90% there (the foil holder clip was styled different)&lt;br /&gt;now, this worked great for 2 shaves, i think it was actually a little smoother than my original&#x27;s, however when I went to clean it I ended up having an issue. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it was new, or what, but it was just tight enough in there i had to try to get it out. by that, i mean, i can pull my old one off with 2 fingers with my eyes closed, this one was on there good. i had to give it a good tug (not like jammed on there, just not worn in at all) and when i got it off, it rolled down onto my thumb and creased both foils ruining them! it&#x27;s not a design flaw or anything, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of. i&#x27;m actually going to order a second set, and be a little more cautious this time.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this seeing how the store I purchased the shaver from didn&#x27;t stock any replacement product.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These blades fit the electric razor perfectly, and having them sent to us automatically is great! We do not have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> replacements good. However I wouldn&#x27;t get this razor again. It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of shaving. I have to be very careful and go over areas multiple times. In the end I usually need to use a razor to get areas that just didn&#x27;t get shaved by the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington electric shavers for more than 20 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but always came back to Remington.  I feel their shavers do give the closest shave.  Having these replacements are great.  I change them every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Prompt service&lt;br /&gt;  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have a Remington F4790 and this is the perfect fit for my razor.  Easy to change out.  Will buy from here again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> After a little trouble getting the cover to securely latch onto the razor, it&#x27;s like shaving with a brand new razor.  Almost five stars.</li>
    <li> It fits.  It works.  It&#x27;s inexpensive.  I&#x27;ve no complaints.  In fact, this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this exact item when the old blades wore out on my razor.  If it&#x27;s still available in a year or two, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and blades matched the existing screen and blades that came with my shaver.  They installed very easily and restored the shaver to original condition.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Looks and shaves like new,price was good,delivery was quick. I  just wish it included the protective cover for the foils.</li>
    <li> This was the correct product for my shaver.  It came packaged well and in good condition.  I have already ordered another one and it also came in good condition.  Also, the price was right.</li>
    <li> I had worn my electric razor foil to the point it was pulling my beard. The replacement was perfect and my razor is like new again!</li>
    <li> Very easy to replace.  You never realize how dull your blade is until you put in a new one.</li>
    <li> The parts were just perfect for my shaver.  I would not hesitate buying them again.  I would also recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The screen and blades are a wear item that at some time will have to be replaced. I have had this shaver since March 2013 and it has yet to need the replacements. So, this is like the spare tire in your car, it is there when it is needed.</li>
    <li> Very Fast shipping and order arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> Same as last time I ordered one.  It fits nicely and works fine.  Although the price was slightly lower this time, I still think it is over priced.  One more exchange and I could buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> What can I say about the head.  It shaves very close and I love it.  Thanks for sending it to me</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 2-year-old shaver. After the replacement it worked good as new--the shaver was much faster and cut closer. I was surprised by how big a difference the replacement made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think it was worth buying the replacement.</li>
    <li> The housing that holds the screen will not fit on my shaver even though the advertizement said it would. I solved the problem by removing the screens and putting them in the old shaver housing. It now works great and I recommend the screens. The rating is 2 star for the frustration and required changes but 5 star for doing its job.</li>
    <li> Consistent product that I can rely on every time. Fast delivery and great price!</li>
    <li> I paid more for this replacement screen then I did for the whole razor</li>
    <li> Awesome love it getting another one soon</li>
    <li> This is an excellent replacement shaver blade that I have been using for years.  It can be expensive and hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> The foil screen lasted six weeks then suddenly has a tear or hole in it with just normal use.  It was cutting my skin so easy to detect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen a foil screen tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had to immediately be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure I&#x27;ll get away from this shaver and to one more reliable at my earliest convenience.</li>
    <li> Great seller, will use again.</li>
    <li> the cutters and screen are just what they are supposed to be, new replacements that fit correctly. And new cutters give a much smoother, quicker shave if your old ones have become dulled.</li>
    <li> Product is fine and appears ok.  Must replace every year and this seems like a good value.  I expect no issues. I like the razor.</li>
    <li> Finally after 1+ years, I found this replacement product for my shaver. The original blades really lasted a long time, however it was at the end of life. With the cost of good shavers so high, it was a relief to find the replacement and they work very well. New life has been breathed into my shaver again. 100% excellent and working.</li>
    <li> Factory replacement. 3 day shipping.  All is good</li>
    <li> blades are adequate but screen is pitiful. same shoddy craftsmanship as the razor. have bought 2 screens plus the original in just over a year. Remington quality is the pits. have owned both Braun and Norelco, both put Remington to shame.</li>
    <li> I saw these for more than twice as much at other websites.  This was a good price for the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> Blades are ok, but the screen wear out prematurely way before the blades.</li>
    <li> this item is so cool i got it for my dad beceuse his was broken thank you for this now</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the correct head.  My head cover won&#x27;t stay on with the new head &amp; blades.  Got ripped off!</li>
    <li> Replacement screens and cutters work fine. Ordered online because I could not find it at any local stores (Target, Walmart, Meijer&#x27;s, Walgreen&#x27;s ,etc.)</li>
    <li> Improvement over previous replacement sets.  Much easier to install.</li>
    <li> Works great and was a good price. I will definitely buy these blades again when these get too dull to use.</li>
    <li> I got these for my dad, and this was a very good price. He was thrilled to find this source as he has used them for a long time, but they need replacement screens.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> We can send a device to take a good look at Pluto, but we cannot manufacture a decent electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The product is fine.  Could improve by adding something to easily grasp the screens to place in and  or take out.</li>
    <li> Great service!Great Product!</li>
    <li> It was not the item that I had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will fit the new razor that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> have not opened yet.  I only wanted/needed the foil but could only find the combo of foil and cutter offered .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not know why this particular model only comes together</li>
    <li> Accurate description, product shipped promptly. It is the right blade for the shavers listed in the description. I&#x27;ve use this replacement pack twice.</li>
    <li> Second time we&#x27;ve ordered this item.  Both times we were happy with our purchases.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like having a new razor. Excellent product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK...I think I&#x27;ll get a different razor for next time as this one is kinda cheap...but overall it does a good enough job.</li>
    <li> Great deal, better than any other store. Fit like a glove and razor back to &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; condition.  Happy, happy shaving!</li>
    <li> The remington SP290 replacement screen arrived promptly and was just what I had ordered.  Smooth transaction.  I will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> The SP290 Replacement Screen and Blades make the razor like factory new.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my dad. They fit his razor with no problem. Will purchase again. Item as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these replacement blades.  These Remington SP290 Replacement Screen and Blades for Series 4 Foil Shavers are just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> Worked great. These two foils are doing the job each and every day.. i would order any time and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a long time and these blades are adequately doing it&#x27;s job.  I will keep using this shaver unless I find another better one.</li>
    <li> I could not find the screen and blades anywhere locally.  They  were easy to install.  They appear to be of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I love the razor this comes with, but the worst part is easily the screen and blades.  I found out that my last screen needed replacing when a hole formed in it while I was shaving - for a week I had big red lines engraved into my scalp (I use it to shave my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however, that they&#x27;re easy to replace.  I guess that&#x27;s something.</li>
    <li> I use my Remington all the time.  The screen and blades have to be replaced every three months, so keep up the good work.  Thanks for everything.</li>
    <li> I could not find these replacements anywhere. I thought I was going to be forced to buy another shaver. The price was good and the quality was good as well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my blades were until I installed the new ones. They were a perfect fit for Model F4790</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered and work great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. This is the only shaver he&#x27;s using and his using it for years. Buying blades is the best way he can save money.</li>
    <li> The blades are sharp and the head fits really good this is a great deal for replacement blades will buy more</li>
    <li> It definitely met my expectations good job</li>
    <li> The SP290 is a very nice package with two replacement cutters / blades and an assembly which contains the foil screen. The two replacement cutters / blades easily fit into place in the razor, and the full replacement head assembly helps to prevent damage to the foil screen by reducing handling of the screen itself. The parts are long-lasting, requiring replacement only once per year. They are nicely packaged and the replacement system works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two and a half years of use I have down-graded this from 5 star to 4 star. A piece of metal in the foil screen broke and stuck out of the screen and began to scratch my face. This prompted me to change razors to avoid this problem in the future. I don&#x27;t know if I used the razor improperly or if this is a common problem, but it&#x27;s one that I don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> Was going to throw razor away and then noticed I could replace head with in reason. Yep. I am cheap. Single mother and have to watch my budget. So happy to have bought this..</li>
    <li> The replacement head didn&#x27;t fit my razor so I had to pry the old micro-screens out of my old head and pry the micro-screens out of the replacement head that comes with this kit and then fit the new microscreens into the old razorhead.  Not a big deal but you have to be a little careful.  Once I did this and replaced the blades and shave head the razor works like new.</li>
    <li> works great for my husband&#x27;s razor, glad I was able to find replacement blades cause I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacements at the store I purchased the razor</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my dad. He couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else. Glad to find them here.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is they are a little pricey.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how new blades can make a difference.  I swapped out my head and blades for the first time in years.  Mainly because of the blades fell off the head recently.  This works fine as a sub for my razor and I love having sharp blades again!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in any brick &amp; mortar stores where I live, so on-line was my only option.  Exact replacement for the original, good price, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> My husband is away from home working most of the time.  If his shaver head breaks he is out of luck, so it is nice to have extras.  We are constantly looking for replacement heads to have on hand, just in case.  But it is very disheartening when stores, such as KMART, WALMART do not carry what a person needs, let alone the smaller local stores.  So when all else fails it is good to know that Amazon can be counted on.  I realize that this was supposed to be a review of the product.  However, if we have the product and it has worked for years then I do not need to continue to praise it, just be grateful my husband doesn&#x27;t have to try new ones to find another that he likes as well.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Remington SP290 Screen and blades sets arrived in excellent condition. The set is as described and function very satisfactorily.</li>
    <li> I have had my Remington razor for nearly 5 years now - very, very valuable purchase.  I just change out the replacement screens/blades every 6 months and it functions like new.  The replacement sets are inexpensive and make a world of difference when you replace the old screen+blades - and completely replace most of the moving parts of the electric shaver that one would expect to break down over time.  Definitely would purchase this Remington again - but don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s going to be necessary at all in the next 5 years.</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement blade because the original blades wore out. But they lasted about 18 months. The new blades work great, just like the original blades. I expect the same great service out of these blades.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re razor heads. what do you want me to say?</li>
    <li> im fine with this product</li>
    <li> The Blades arrived fairly quickly and were easy to install. The product is solid and shaves nicely.</li>
    <li> Once my husband finally got into the anti-theft packaging, he&#x27;s very happy with this to replace a scratch screen on his Remington shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the cheapest price.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for many years.  I  tried others, but always came back to this one.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I Love these simple Remington razors.  Work great and replacement parts always fir and are easy to find at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I have used and order this product before and it works every time</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband so he could use it to try to fix his rechargeable razor.  It worked like a charm and kept him from having to spend the money to buy a new one!!  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This is just the part I needed fit perfect and I hope these last for a couple years like the last replacement</li>
    <li> I love my Remington electric razor, so getting replacement blades was fantastic! The problem was that the battery did went dead and ended up buying a new Remington Electric Razor.</li>
    <li> The product is correct and fits.  It is a bit hard to install properly but works well.  I have used these before, but I wonder why they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Husband needed a repair kit and couldn&#x27;t find one in any stores in our area.  It was cheaper to order on line that drive around looking in all different stores to find a repair kit.</li>
    <li> Saves buying a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;It even fit another model that I happened to have.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, nice to have to screen and blades. Great way to get replacements for shaver that I love.</li>
    <li> Replacement product. Priced right! Shipped Fast</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> screen and blades work fine, razor too loud, slow back and forth movement works best</li>
    <li> One out of two of these screens have mold defects which prevent them from staying on the shaver.  I usually open one and discover the defect well after the Amazon return window is closed.  On this last one, I was away on a business trip when I discovered the defect.  Try shaving whilst holding the screen/foil on to the shaver sometime.  Not fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This alone is a good reason not to buy this model of Remington shaver.  If you do buy this item, I recommend buying one at a time so that it can be returned if needed.</li>
    <li> Pretty standard stuff. It either works or it doesn&#x27;t. I need eleven more wods so here they are. Two more.</li>
    <li> To start with, the shaver is a cheaper one than I have used in the past, so I didn&#x27;t expect it to get through the original blades, and for less than the cost of another shaver, the blades do as good as new, and they don&#x27;t get loose and fall off, as others replacements have done. Definitely worth the extension of life.</li>
    <li> Though not listed on package, this also fits the Remington F3900 that I own.  Works the same or better than the original screen and cutter.  This replacement pack SP-290 is listed in my razors package insert.</li>
    <li> Remington repair kits good as usual.What else can I say about  a needed product that is not always available in stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement for my Remington shaver&lt;br /&gt;It is like having a new shaver</li>
    <li> could not find in local stores.  still able to use shaver since have replacement screen and blades and price is fair.</li>
    <li> The chart was very difficult to figure out. I ordered the one that listed my shaver, but it ended up being wrong. The return shipping would have been as much as the head so I just kept it. If you need one let me know. It&#x27;s new and unopened.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband. He uses a F4 shaver and the screen developed a hole after a couple years of use. Bought this set to repair and replace the cutters. Worked extremely well.</li>
    <li> This hard to find replacement product was needed badly by my husband.  Without a new screen, he was cutting his face with an electric razor!  All is now well.  Thank you for always having the right thing for any problem.</li>
    <li> Good price for hard-to-find replacements.  Very few stores carry blades &amp; foils for any razor over about 2 years old, as they just want you to buy a new razor.  Easy to shop on Amazon and best price around.</li>
    <li> Ordered these parts for when the old ones wear out. Had a hard time getting replacement blades for the last razor, so I ordered these in advance. Blades seem to last but the screens get little wholes after about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  I had forgotten how well my Remington razor worked when it is new.  Now I have a like new razor that cuts the beard close and quick.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> This replacement did the job after my original screen became damaged. Now my razor is like new again. Love it!</li>
    <li> Quality not as good as original but if your careful with it it will work. I&#x27;ll end up replacing my razor</li>
    <li> Not only did this arrived promptly and in good condition BUT it seems that the Remington people did a slight re-design of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original screen head that came with the shaver was too hard to grab, insert, and remove without risking breaking it. The second set I bought after I had the shaver for 14 months broke in 3 days for exactly that reason. Too hard to handle. This new design has eliminated that. It&#x27;s easy to grab, snap in, and snap off for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boys in the lab got this one right</li>
    <li> These were for my brother.  They are good.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and right on time with what was quoted.</li>
    <li> Cost to replace the screen and blades for the rechargeable Remington Men&#x27;s shaver is about what blade and shave cream users pay for one of the new 4, 5 (or is it 6 now?) blade shavers.  Easy to afford replacing these blade sets at 4 to 6 month intervals.  If your Remington shave takes a little longer than it should then it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
    <li> Great replacement foil and cutters, the F4790 shaver is better than the andis &amp; wahls shavers bc its hv the best of both those shavers, quality build as the andis and close shaves as wahl with an flexible head that curves with your face that neither andis or wahl hv and at a great price unlike brauns or other expensive shavers and get the same results, to get long life out of the foils dnt press hard on your face or brush the foil of lose hairs bt rinse them with water and keep shaving bt I&#x27;m a barber and hv to disinfect mine, also holds a charge for a couple of weeks, a must buy if you&#x27;re into electric shavers. Thanks Amazon for fast and professional service!</li>
    <li> Shaver works as it is supposed to,razor is like new again.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Niiiice!</li>
    <li> Good product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Perfect match, fixed my razor.</li>
    <li> It is necessary to replace the screen and blades every six months or so. This replacement part fits this requirement.</li>
    <li> Not much to say -- installation was easy and it made my F4790 razor like new again (which I love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that it says not to push on the edges of the blades when installing -- that means you would have to hold it on the sides as pictured. This was pretty difficult for me because my fingers would barely fit, but it was possible. For those who have bigger fingers than me, I&#x27;m pretty sure you would have to press on the edges of the blades. Not really sure how you would push it in with enough force otherwise.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Didn&#x27;t want to spend much. Didn&#x27;t last for too long (few months). Maybe mine was defective. I may get it again just to give it another chance.</li>
    <li> These replacements seem to last a very long time. The razor body has lasted through three sets of these already.</li>
    <li> The parts were easy to use and the shaver worked great. I had no problems. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The fit is good - snapped right in place.  My shaves are sharp again.  Works as it should. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit replacements.</li>
    <li> It works and it was easy to install.</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades. So much cheaper to replace the blades twice a year than have to purchase a new razor. So glad these are on  Subscribe &amp; Save (5 item special discount). Purchased one last year for $11.99 and one last week for $7.99.  Still saved money over Wal-Mart $14 price.</li>
    <li> Very quick service and the exact product we needed. Thank you</li>
    <li> Low cost, easy to install and makes my razor like new. Item was delivered 2 days ahead of estimate and was packaged well. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> Since this is an OEM replacement set, I would expect it to fit perfectly into my Remington shaver and it does.    I would have given this product 5 stars but like the original set that came with the shaver, it seems to lose its sharp edge after using it on a regular basis, if you don&#x27;t clean it using the Remington spray cleaner.  The cleaning brush that came with the Remington shaver is not up to the task of cleaning without a follow-up by the Remington spray cleaner (which is also a lubricant).</li>
    <li> Super Fast service. Great price. I would continue to use them in the future. I&#x27;ll be back in a few months  Thanks you</li>
    <li> I replace my blades and screens every six months.  This gives me the best shaves.  Ordering through Amazon has made purchasing this item very easy.</li>
    <li> These people have used tactics very successfully planned obsolescence ... are already 3 times I&#x27;ve had to order this kit, but at the end of the day, at least come fast.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped timely and was exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> They came dull hardly would cut</li>
    <li> Works great and renewed my razor.</li>
    <li> Its not that Amazon prices these cutters and foils too high its that the cost of this item is about half the cost of a shaver. In a store i can see paying slightly more because of overhead but shaver makers really need to stop the practice of making their products useless by not supplying needed parts at a reasonable price.. It took me a while researching shaver prices before I ordered this and I was very close to just buying a whole new shaver. .. thats just not right.</li>
    <li> Works well and the foil fits well. I would have given 5 stars if the blades stayed in the holders better during cleaning.</li>
    <li> my only issue is the price! Why is the entire razor just a few bucks more than these replacements?</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get as close a shave as I am used to.</li>
    <li> went through several sets of screens and blades.  They are a quality product.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in Wallmart, CVS or anywhere so I looked to Amazon and they came through. Be advised that the grills can be taken off and used to replace on your old guard if the guard on this is different from your original guard. Other than that Perfect.</li>
    <li> Fit was not perfect but very close. Happy with razors cut and easy to replace. Price better than buying original.</li>
    <li> Great service. I would&#x27;ve do it again when I need to purchase this item. I also recommend others to go amazon as we&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> Sad that I needed replacements this soon, but these are working fine. Fit perfectly and work exactly as I expected!</li>
    <li> need a replacement screen for my razor and this fit perfect.&lt;br /&gt;My blades were also in need of replacement so this kit fit the bill and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores so it was nice to find on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screens are very sensitive, can crease easily so be sure to keep the protective screen cover on when transporting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price ok but  a little on the expensive side.  Still cheaper than a new razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered two replacement head and blade sets and the Remington Facesaver stick&lt;br /&gt;which qualified my order for the free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;As like any electric razor, it is crucial that do not push your razor very hard&lt;br /&gt;on the face. Pushing harder only forces the blades onto the metal screen, tearing the screen up.&lt;br /&gt; A light and slow approach will increase the life of the blades and screen.&lt;br /&gt;The FaceSaver stick gives you a very rewarding shave but a little extra clean up will&lt;br /&gt;be necessary due to the powder. If you do get some Facesaver powder on your shirt, brush&lt;br /&gt;it off and use a damp towel and wipe the rest off. Also the FaceSaver stick creates less drag&lt;br /&gt;and a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;I usually check for deals local stores for products and have for years I have been an Amazon customer.&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, I buy from Amazon most the time.&lt;br /&gt;ED......</li>
    <li> I like the price good product</li>
    <li> Happy Camper, product as described</li>
    <li> A very good product and it met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband wanted!</li>
    <li> The replacement screen and blades fit perfectly. The price was good and delivery was fast, within five days.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price. Thank you. Recommended. Will do business again.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and received in excellent condition. Blade and head replaced factory pieces supplied with unit when purchased. Easy to install and and fit as well as the originals</li>
    <li> Good product! Easy install! Dont last long, could be a littlle more durable! The foil wears through pretty fast. but overall it is fine.</li>
    <li> This fits my razor just fine.  Quality seems OK.  It shaves as well as the original.  But I go through 2 of these replacements a year.  The original set lasted a year.  Also shaving dust is left on my face especially under the nose.  I have to wash my face with a wet towel after shaving with the replacement screen and blade set.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  I&#x27;m on my third replacement screen and blade set.  I buy two at a time now.  The screen is what wears out.</li>
    <li> These are the easiest Remington blades to replace yet and they shave very close. I am ordering more. The price is right but they are hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades did fit but would not cut. It caused irritation. I tried it on dry skin more than twice.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and was the exact replacement for this shaver.  Installation was quick and easy and the the blades performed as expected.  I will definitely buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Husband reorders these from amazon all the time, the price is right and they work perfectly...would def keep ordering for the price</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is acceptable. The availiability is not. Stores that sell the electric razors should also make the replacement screen available. It&#x27;s frustrating to have to buy a completely new unit when only the screen needs to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Excellent item and fast delivery! Part fit like a dream. Bought this from Amazon before and will do it again 😊. Safe and secure.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to replace old parts.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd replacement that I have ordered for my razor.  I am very satisfied with the price, quality and timely delivery. I will definitely order another replacement when needed.</li>
    <li> Wish they would sell these in the stores.  I love this razor and was easier to get replacement blades vs new razor.</li>
    <li> Everything was just what I wanted. The price was right. I found what I wanted without going to numerous stores!</li>
    <li> This worked well for replacement for my husbands shaver!! No one in our area has any replacements for this shaver.</li>
    <li> ..but, after installing, my better half decided to just replace the whole unit with a Norelco for a better overall shave.</li>
    <li> Easy to order online.  Shipped quickly.  Product exactly as described and pictured.  (Eight more words are now required...a silly requirement.)</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say.  It&#x27;s a Remington shaver and Remington replacement blade and foil.  It should rate high and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Blades are not as sharp as last 2 orders ?</li>
    <li> Works great and extended the life of my electric razor--the best one&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ever had for the money.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Needed to replace my current shaver blades.  I like that it comes with the heads and the foil.  The foil is a little different than the original, at least it seemed to me.  The only thing was that snapping the heads on was a chore.  I had to use cardboard to push down on the foil, evenly, in order to lock in place.  I don&#x27;t recommend using your thumb or your finger.  That would just be unwise.  I don&#x27;t recommend using anything else because you can push down and bend the blades, but I couldn&#x27;t find out how to get it on the unit so it snapped into place.  I ended up putting some liquid soap on the plastic so it slid in easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that method, I don&#x27;t know how else i could&#x27;ve gotten them in place.</li>
    <li> When you are shaving daily ,there comes a time when the blades get rather dull ,so I always keep a extra spare on hand.It just seems to be a good idea to me . I have used the Remington Electric for many years and find it reliable and long lasting , hence you need a set of spare blades.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these; however, the cutter part of both of them was not sharp at all.  I noticed this immediately.  I used the cutter for 3 days (felt like it was already more than 6 months old) and ended up buying a new electric razor.  The cutter that came with the original electric razor lasted 6-9 months for me; however, the replacement cutters were a waste of money.  It has me wondering if the replacement cutters were genuine or counterfeit.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful yet inexpensive product. I bought my razor three years ago, and have been replacing the blades and foils using this vendor ever since. I am extremely happy with the savings.</li>
    <li> This screen/blade combo is manufactured by Remington for the company&#x27;s dual-screen electric shavers. Removing the old screen/blades and installing the new set is easy. It gives a great shave! The price here on Amazon is reasonable, and the lowest I have found.</li>
    <li> would only let me buy 2.  Did not fix the issue, but I have two now so i guess thats not terrible but i had to pay for two when I only wanted one.</li>
    <li> I have 2 old remingtons, and after buying it for one, and seeing that it works perfect, I purchased a second one for my other shaver.  will do it again as long as something else  does not break.</li>
    <li> I really like my Remington shaver and I am so glad Amazon has the replacement parts available at a reasonable cost. This is the genuine OEM foil and balde set and works perfectly. I used to buy these locally, but they are no longer stocked since the retailer stopping carrying the shavers. In fact, the price on Amazon is far less than I used to pay for them at the store.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I needed.  I looked everywhere and could not find them.  They work great and I a getting a great shave.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I got my dad some extra parts for his razor so that he would be set for the next 20 years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get these at my store in town.  They work great for my husband.</li>
    <li> Finally, a way to get replacement screens and blades, and not have to take out a second mortgage on the house. It was exactly what I ordered, and to my delight, the item arrived 2 days after I ordered it, via U.S. Mail. That&#x27;s right, not &amp;#34;StreamLite&amp;#34;, which would have taken at least a week, or UPS, which would have delayed the delivery by a couple of days. Yes, good old U.S. Mail, the best parcel delivery system in existence.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! I&#x27;ll use Amazona again!</li>
    <li> Good price; arrived fast (Prime!); is doing the job. The mesh on the screen seems to me to be thinner than the original, so I have no idea how long it will last, and just anecdotally, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as comfortable as the original, but I&#x27;d still buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE... The mesh screen did indeed wear out - that is, a hole or two has appeared in it - more quickly than expected: within 2 months. So I will likely buy the manufacturer&#x27;s version next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2... Took a chance and purchased a 2nd one, and it is MUCH BETTER. The mesh screen is much more comfortable, so perhaps I just got a bad unit the first time.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have any choice about this product. And Remington surely makes a large chunk of revenue from these replacements in addition to the actual shaver purchase. So, when you are installing or handling the foil head assembly, be careful not to touch the foils. i did and seriously dented it not long after installing it. My solution was to rearrange the two foils in the holder so as to not have the dented portion always touching my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the comfort level is very good, and they last longer on my heavy beard than previous models.</li>
    <li> Some writers said the blades came in blank packaging and were dull or failed quickly.  Mine came in factory packaging and fit perfectly.  I have been using them for some time now and they are still sharp and give a close smooth shave.  I would order these again.</li>
    <li> Correct fit and easy change-out.</li>
    <li> This is an exact factory replacement screen and cutter assembly for my Remington shaver. The foil had worn through on the factory original in one spot and was pinching. Pricing here was much better than buying straight from the manufacturer. A drop in fit.</li>
    <li> work well but don&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> I think this is my 4th time buying this item. I&#x27;m always happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly. Good price and superior shipment of product.</li>
    <li> Price is very reasonable&lt;br /&gt;Price was great compared to what  we can find retail. it also worked very well.</li>
    <li> prompt service. exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> The original screen that came with this razar was crap!  It cracked &amp; sliced up my face!  I bought this replacement screen &amp; blades.  The shipping cost was a little high, but the screen is fantastic &amp; my face appreciates that......</li>
    <li> Great item.  Makes the razor like new.  Good price.  Better than buying a whole new electric razor.</li>
    <li> Good price fast ship good quality</li>
    <li> Blades work no problem. Clean shave</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades and head. Work better than the original!! Will order again when needed. I recommend this great product.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly , exchanging old cutters and foil took less than a minute . I usually get about 6 months life out of a new foil before holes start to appear and skin scratches start to occur on shaving.</li>
    <li> My Remington electric razor which uses the screen and blades, is the best combination I have ever found for comfort and close shave. The razor itself and the blades and screen all are quite reasonably priced. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> no problems with delivery and quality of the product</li>
    <li> Razors are so expensive these days but I was happy to find these for a decent price.  I have been happy with the razor except one thing: they don&#x27;t let the little hairs go behind the screen.  All the hairs bunch up and sit on top of the screen so I have to constantly dump them out or they get everywhere.  Other than that it works well and worked to replace my razor.  Also, the packaging was not the same as the picture, mine was all in French (I live in the USA).  It was the same product just not the same packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find item in the stores and the price was right.  Recieved it sooner than they told me.</li>
    <li> Great price and with Amazon Prime, got it here in two days. Works perfectly with my razor and should last for another year until I need another one.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly on my shaver.</li>
    <li> The screen didn&#x27;t fit right, and had problems staying on the razor.  I had to heat and bend the back tab of the screen before it would fit right.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the previous version of the screen that I bought a year or 2 ago.</li>
    <li> Still a little pricey but the shaver is still in good shape and I need these. But all went well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in my razor model. Had to by a new razor ,so I can use these parts for it when that time comes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Remington F4790 shaver for years and get to purchase these about every six months.  Usually buy two so when one dies I&#x27;m ready to replace it.  When the second one dies I know it&#x27;s time to reorder.  Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but razor blades are more expensive.  The Remingto does as good a job as a blade razor for me.</li>
    <li> I thought &amp;#34;How can I go wrong&amp;#34; when I saw the price.  This product is the original manufacturer&#x27;s replacement, and the price is less than half of what Remington has on their website.  This is the 2nd time I replaced the blades and screen over the last 4 years.  I purchased the 1st replacement from Remington, and it was fine, but this time I went for the great value.  It is the exact same product and it made my shaver work like new again.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and they cut the beard very well. The Remington screens and blades just get dull in less than a year and have to be replaced at a pretty hefty price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what you expect of it. nothing else, but exactly what you need. just go buy it as needed.</li>
    <li> Please keep making them!</li>
    <li> Works good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> It fit the shaver perfect&#x3D; its hard to find in the store  Thank you</li>
    <li> i returned it because it was not the right one as pictured in the ad...it should be 0 stars, but i need the space to write a comment...i&#x27;m sure it would have work great if i got the correct merchandise.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown, arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a couple of months and they are just as good as the originals. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> They were the correct replacements for my Remington  Razor.</li>
    <li> I have multiple electric shavers, home, travel, car, gym bag, etc.  All Remington brand shavers and all purchased over the years but all still running strong.  Remington is a great brand to buy, tried other ones but they broke down not long after purchase, but not my Remington shavers they still are gong strong.</li>
    <li> excellent product, use these to shave head. gives me a close clean shave and last a long time. Have tried several other brands but none compare in my opinion to these.</li>
    <li> I had two screens wear holes in them. It takes about 3 weeks. And they leave black smears on my face.</li>
    <li> After several weeks of use functionality is equal to original parts and the pricing was better than other vendors with equal products.</li>
    <li> I ESPECIALY LIKED THE COMPLETE HEAD REPLACEMENT RATTHER THAN JUST NEW FOILS. VERY REASONABLE COST COMPARED TO OTHER REPLACEMENTS AT MORE THAN TWICE THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Couldnt find this locally so Amazon was the only way to get replacement blades. I had purchased a low end (still twice the remington shaver price) braun which had no power and was horrible so I got these replacement blades. Work good.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price for the foil and blades.  It&#x27;s not the top of the line, but it gets the job done.  Price plus prime is hard to pass up.</li>
    <li> These blades work great for a nice close shave but they wear quickly and I constantly have to order more. They would be better if they lasted a couple months. I  really like the performance of them, just not the longevity of the product.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a replacement head, I recommend this one.  I&#x27;ve been getting them for a couple years now.  They work great.</li>
    <li> Replacement screen and blades were received promptly and are currently installed on my razor.  I am pleased that there seems to be no difference between the original blades and the replacement.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit!  Great price.</li>
    <li> If only they could last forever!</li>
    <li> Remington razors always need refills.  Happy to have them supplied in this way.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was ordered and does the trick.</li>
    <li> What can be said?  I needed new blades and can&#x27;t seem to find them around here.  They are like they should be.  New and nice and clean and sharp.  Price was good too and saved several gallons of gas driving around looking for them.</li>
    <li> 3rd set of replacements. They last about 6 months but do the job.</li>
    <li> Was searching and searching for replacement heads for my Remington 3900 model and found them no where...  Took many a website to find this package was the one I needed....  most offers for this package don&#x27;t state the full range of Shaver it will fit, so if you have a 3900, this is the one for you, the Remington SP290...</li>
    <li> Perfect, Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, and very good price. Shaver is just like new now.</li>
    <li> Great Quality.  Everything I expected.  Thanks for keeping the quality when you can get it.</li>
    <li> How do you use this product  I Love It&lt;br /&gt;What similar products have you used, and how does this compare  I Love It&lt;br /&gt;What should other customers know when considering this product  I Love It&lt;br /&gt;What aspects of this product do you like or dislike  I Love It&lt;br /&gt;Was the quality of this product above or below your expectations  I Love It</li>
    <li> The screen and blades perform just like brand new. Clean shave.I can typically get a year with the screen and blades.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than replacing the shaver.  I am not as impressed with the results of this shaver as I have been with older model Remingtons.  They used to be repairable.  Now all you can do is replace the cutters!</li>
    <li> The new blades make the shaver usable again, but they don&#x27;t last as long as advertised and my husband does not have a heavy beard.  A 3-4 month replacement cycle is more like it.  The Remington Shaver Saver spray also helps to clean and lubricate the shaver for better performance</li>
    <li> Work just fine. Screen and blades on razor were badly worn. Easy to see improvement in comfort and closeness of shave with new blades/screen. Bought for my husband.</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly, and now my shaver is shaving close again.  I really need to buy another 2-3 just to stretch out the life of my shaver.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed when I needed it, so very good</li>
    <li> Works just like it was brand new.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I love this razor, it&#x27;s great for my type of beard.  I&#x27;ve had this Remington for over two years and this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve had to have the blades replaced.  The Remington is still going strong and still holds its&#x27; charge for several shaves.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington Electrics for years.  Works great!  jame</li>
    <li> This makes my razor like new and will last at least 6 months since they are upgraded quality as compared to what I already had and they lasted that long.  I am really pleased with the price of the replacement blades since shaving with this nice electric razor saves money over using a blade without sacrificing quality.</li>
    <li> Save money- reliable shaver had lost blades over the last year.  Replace the entire shaver? No way!  Bought the SP290 replacement screen and blades for a small fraction price of a new shaver and voila- I have a new shaver.  Still the same close shave.</li>
    <li> I was going to just buy a new razor but though I would try to get more life out of it since it was still running fine.&lt;br /&gt;Changing the blades and screen made it a new razor. I had forgotten how it was supposed to cut since I had&lt;br /&gt;running it with dull blades for so long. It was really easy to change out the blades</li>
    <li> These well made products are just what I was looking for. This is well made and arrived in short order. Thank You!!</li>
    <li> This is an original manufacturer&#x27;s product so it works as expected. Quick delivery and a good price seal the deal. This is one of those things that you would think would be available locally but I wasn&#x27;t able to find.</li>
    <li> I give the Remington replacement blades a 5 because I couldn&#x27;t find the&lt;br /&gt;blade at either Walgreens or WalMart.  The shipment came just in the&lt;br /&gt;time that was originally stated, and I found the package in perfect&lt;br /&gt;condition.</li>
    <li> Great and handy.  Wish they were more locally available.  Easy to change and greatly improves the shave.  I use it every day</li>
    <li> I had to take it apart and use the plastic frame from the old old and put the new screens from the new part in side them to get it to work. The screens were the same but the outside was a different shape and wouldn&#x27;t fit. This is the part number listed on the box my shaver came in too. It may be the last Remmington product I buy. The shipping was fast. I thought it should be in a small box instead of a padded envelope as I think it could have been easily damaged in the mail.</li>
    <li> Razors for theses replacement parts are in expensive and the ease of getting screens and blades in one package is very conveinient.</li>
    <li> I saved quite a lot by purchasing these online.  The first set of cutters is doing very well.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for several years and have worn out several blades but I am very satisfied with the service I have gotten out of it and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> The screens are not durable and only last one or two months before they are punctured and cannot be used.</li>
    <li> replacement works well so far.  was a little disappointed that i needed one 3 months after buying shaver.  we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This fits perfectly and got it at a great price.  It&#x27;s exactly what you can get at the store but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades work very well, just as good as when the razor was brand new</li>
    <li> The razor head parts were exactly what we needed at a great price and we received them super quick. We would order them again in heart beat.</li>
    <li> Fits the razor, replaces the screen with the tear in it. Have not installed the new blades yet but will soon.</li>
    <li> It fits as a replacement part is expected to and does what it is supposed to do.  New notch on housing helps hold the plastic screen cover in place better than before.</li>
    <li> Not as good as original. Head doesn&#x27;t stay in as good. Not as smooth on the face. Plulls hair on face.</li>
    <li> What can you say about replacement blades other then they work and allow me to get the best use out of my shaver until the battery starts to fail.</li>
    <li> got  it sooner than I expected  good price and quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original blade that came with the shaver for over two years and until the screen began to get holes in it. At this point it was time to get a new one. Walmart charges a pretty penny for a replacement so like any Amazonian, I took to the interwebs in search for a replacement. It takes seconds to swap from the old to the new and is very simple. When swapping blades you will notice a closer shave and less mess. This replacement is definitely worth the price. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Foil only lasted for 3 months before it ripped open right in the middle. I found this out after it cut my face. Not worth the money. The Braun foils last for over a year for about twice the money. The math adds up.</li>
    <li> My husband drives truck over the road throughout the midwest but, never without a fresh shave in the morning with his remington.&lt;br /&gt;Yes blades do wear out, so this isn&#x27;t the first time to order these same exact blades on the internet. He has a tough scruff in the morning but, these blades have always done a good close shave. They come sealed and in the  brand new original packaging.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Only place we could find replacement parts for my husband razor.  I just wish they would just sell just the screen as that seems to be the only part my husband needs.</li>
    <li> I was really happy to find these replacement parts for my shaver as it has provided a clean close shave.</li>
    <li> With this product, you&#x27;ve either ordered the correct replacement heads or you haven&#x27;t.  If you have and it&#x27;s delivered as agreed, which this was, then it meets expectations.</li>

    <li> I purchased these for my Dad! He has used them for years and years and is quite happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Pros: last a long time and do a good job. nice to be able to still find the replacement parts to the razor when its hard to find them in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Cost is a bit much.</li>
    <li> I was quite happy with my purchase. Everything went fine and without any hiccups or problems. Anyone needing Remington supplies should consider Spectrum Brands as a possible supplier. I will continue to do so myself.</li>
    <li> Good price for replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Always good deal, slow in delivery time.</li>
    <li> This is my second package of these replacement parts and they both work as well as the original parts.</li>
    <li> Works fine and not problems getting it.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed ,delivered on time,will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Hard to find in any store anymore. Works fine.</li>
    <li> I gave this a four  because it doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the old screen. It fits my razor okay , but the edges of the cutter frame protrude a little more which makes it a little  more uncomfortable  to shave. Other than that it works great though.&lt;br /&gt; When this screen wears out I&#x27;ll be back to Amazon to get another.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced the blades in my shaver in years.  The shaver was working okay, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  HUGE difference with the new blades.  It shaves much faster and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  The replacement screen and the protective cover (came with my shaver) do not play nice together.  It&#x27;s hard to pull off the cover without pulling out the screen with it.  The cover fits on the screen pretty tight, so it&#x27;s something I have to be careful with when removing it.</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly in my razor and worked great. Not much else to say about this product, but Remingtion makes great shavers in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The best price out there for this. When you need a new screen, this is where I shop.  Amazon always seems to give the best deals on the things I am searching for.</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased with the product and free shipping (I ordered two of the item to qualify).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement screen and blades were the correct fit for my shaver and were easily installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find the item on Amazon since the store where I bought the shaver no longer&lt;br /&gt;carries replacement screens in store (Walmart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price ($ 14.95?) seems exorbitanant but there you go.</li>
    <li> I visit few stores  that sell replecement blades I couldn&#x27;t fine the one I need, this fit very well, no problems at all. Hubby very happy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my shaver, before moving to Africa. Haven&#x27;t needed to replace the cutter &amp; screen yet- that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Great!  Item fit perfectly on my husband&#x27;s rechargeable electric razor.  Item was shipped quickly and arrived in fine shape.  I&#x27;d recommend ordering here instead of purchasing at a big box store.</li>
    <li> Ordered this replacement for my Remington shaver.  The foil broke after less that 2 months of usage.  I recommend buying another brand of replacement screens or avoid the Remington brand completely.</li>
    <li> Original replacement.  What else do you have to say...</li>
    <li> The foil is easily damaged, so be careful with it.</li>
    <li> It seems like it was purposely engineered to pop off the shaver while shaving. It doesn&#x27;t grip both sides as well as the original did.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This replacement screen and blades product works very and is easy to install.  My husband has a heavy, stiff beard and wears out the screen before the razor needs replacing, so the screen and blade replacement duo is ideal.</li>
    <li> My husband love s it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just like the original</li>
    <li> Worked well good price</li>
    <li> An exact replacement part for my shaver. Easy to assemble on to my old shaver and it works like new.</li>
    <li> The product fits perfectly on my Remington F4790. The screen is a little bit different than my old one but fits perfectly on my shaver. The price is the best out there!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The screen will not stay in place when the razor is operating; it vibrates loose.</li>
    <li> The blades work fine, seem very sharp. However the screen does not stay snapped on the shaver very well.  The vibration during shaving pops it off.  I have to hold it on with my fingers while shaving.  The design was obviously changed slightly, and not for the better.</li>
    <li> it was the correct replacement and works like new</li>
    <li> The blades return the shaver back to the way it was when new. Good value and price. Would recommend it strongly.</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of money.  I ended up buying a whole new razor!  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> I have found that one can replace the screens and blades on a Remington razor once or maybe twice before performance becomes unacceptably bad.</li>
    <li> they are replacement blades that work well</li>
    <li> Replacement blades and screen perform great.  Order arrived quickly.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Made shopping easy. Product can be sometimes hard to find in stock. Didn&#x27;t have to go store hopping (gas). Being a Prime member is a nice perk..</li>
    <li> Good replacement.  Fit was ok, color is black and my shaver is grey but I really don&#x27;t care.  These don&#x27;t have a hole worn through the screen causing the blades to tear up my face.  Much better.  I hope they last as long as the last ones.</li>
    <li> It was fast and they fit!</li>
    <li> Makes razor feel like new - even the speed of the razor audibly increased. I&#x27;ll continue buying this replacement product rather than spending the money on a new razor.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband a new shaver for Christmas, same brand, but he didn&#x27;t like it so I took it back. Went on Amazon &amp; found the replacement screen &amp; he loves the job the shaver does &amp; he doesn&#x27;t get stabbed by the old cut up screen anymore.</li>
    <li> Could not find this in any store, it fits the razor perfectly and works well.&lt;br /&gt;More words to complete review HaHA</li>
    <li> Fix perfectly with no problem.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my Remington. Very inexpensive. If you are attached to your old razor as I am, then I&#x27;d recommend getting this as an update.</li>
    <li> Remington SP290 Replacement Screen and Blades for Series 4 Foil Shavers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was delivered on time as promised and was in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LJJ</li>
    <li> Exact replacement and works well. Easy to replace and only took two minutes to switch out. Price good compared with other brands I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
    <li> already put replacment on hope it lasts longer than two weeks like the other Tip: If you want to sell these razors, include a replacement screne</li>
    <li> The replacement screens/cutters are working just fine. But there is a product quality problem. After only 2 months of use, the screen is developing holes and these scratch my face and it is a very uncomfortable shave.</li>
    <li> shaver going strong still</li>
    <li> The screen in the replacement set is microscopically different from the original, and keeps popping off when shaving. These parts are good, but not great. Replacing the blades led to a spring popping loose also. It was not that hard to fix once I found the spring, which went flying, but the entire problem was unexpected. That said, the shaver does shave pretty well again, as long as I keep popping the screen back on.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to get my razor working well again.&lt;br /&gt;Mike Williams</li>
    <li> My screeen got a nick in it and started to tear up my face.  I could not find a replacement screen at any retailer around.  Found this.  Arrived within 3 days.  Pulled off my old screen and blades - the new blades popped right in and the screen clicked in place. Can&#x27;t ask for a better experience.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get much of an improvement in performance after replacing screen and blade after almost a year of use on the originals, but the razor itself isn&#x27;t rated that well, anyways.  looks like its time to get serious and research a new razor.</li>
    <li> Product arrived sooner than was expected, but was greatly appreciated since I desperately needed to replace the foil in my shaver which had developed a large hole and was scratching my face badly.&lt;br /&gt;So many thanks for the excellent service!&lt;br /&gt;The product is working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John  Mark&lt;br /&gt;Seattle WA</li>
    <li> The fit on the foil is a little different from the one it was replacing, but it did fit. The price is high for just these parts, but it beats replacing the entire razor.</li>
    <li> I purchase these through Amazon for my husband. The shipping is fast the price is right...</li>
    <li> Would Buy Again. Delivered quickly and was what I expected. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad. He needed a replacement bad. He had to work with it a little bit to pop off the old and pop on the new. Aside from that it was cheaper here than at the store. It works just as it should, and like a new razor! Just make sure you order the right one for your razor. Will buy again as need for sure. If you found my review helpful, please click below. Thanks.</li>
    <li> easy replacement - makes it feel new</li>
    <li> Shaves better than a blade. Hard to believe, Remington, Congratulations!</li>
    <li> While the micro screen and blades on this Remington razor meet my needs and are somewhat inexpensive they are not the  same quality of my old razor.  Also these screens are not as durable as other brands.  I would recommend this razor to others as an inexpensive alternative with the caveats above.</li>
    <li> Quality product and the shaver is like new again!</li>
    <li> The replacement is a good fit.  It is performs well.  I would recommend this as a good replacement for the blade and screen.</li>
    <li> Works like the original.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; service!!</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be original replacement, however did not fit razor properly, but it&#x27;s useable. Nothing more can be said.</li>
    <li> screens fit perfectly- low price and was exactly what I needed.  Was unable to find this product at any local store</li>
    <li> I dropped my razor and damaged the blades.  I hated to give up on the razor because I really liked it.  I searched for and found this replacement set on Amazon and they fit perfectly, thus saving my razor.  Even if your blades are just getting old, I would consider replacing them.</li>
    <li> great price!! Love amazon</li>
    <li> This product was easy to change out, and I was pleased with how well they worked.  It was like having a new razor but only having to spend a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my F-3900, though it doesn&#x27;t say in the description that they work for the F-3900. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Got my blades and they work great.</li>
    <li> I thought I needed to buy a new razor when the screen started to break, but after replacing both the screen and the blades my razor works better than ever. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to extend the life of the Remington razor.</li>
    <li> Made a great deal of difference in the performance of my razor.</li>
    <li> $6.50 cheaper than purchasing from Remington&#x27;s website(NOT INCLUDING the shipping &amp; handling they would&#x27;ve charged. I don&#x27;t know how much because I&#x27;m not registered to log in to find out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros buying from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheaper price&lt;br /&gt;2. Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2-day shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of the Remington F4790 Pivot &amp; Flex Dual Foil Shaver:&lt;br /&gt;1. Only has 1 shave setting, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old Remington which had 3 settings, but that is the consequence of buying the cheapest one 6 months ago. I&#x27;ll probably buy another 3 level setting Remington shaver once these new replacements wear out in about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I order these replacement screen and blades for my old razor that I&#x27;ve had for several years but they have changed the razor and therefore it does not fit.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave! Gives me a much closer shave than Norelco!</li>
