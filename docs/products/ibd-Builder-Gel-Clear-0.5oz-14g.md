<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Reliable product although I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I know the brand and tried some in the past. Very good brand</li>
    <li> Good product but it leaks also.</li>
    <li> My favorite gels for doing nails well worth the price and good quality.</li>
    <li> This is a good builder. Its important that you apply a bonder such as the IBD Bonder and apply thinly otherwise it will peel off before the day is over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied correctly over natural nail, this will last for weeks.</li>
    <li> Ibd makes a very nice gel.  I have used some of the cheaper stuff out there and ibd seems to get the right viscosity in their builder gel.  The others seemed to start getting thinner as it soaked up body heat from the nail and run all over the place.  This stuff stays very well.  Dont forget to buy the primer or those pretty nails you just did will pop right off.</li>
    <li> Works nicely, and dried great under UV light. Not thick at all but sticky if you use to much.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple compliments on nails.</li>
    <li> This gel is awful in my option. As soon as I&#x27;m done doing my nails it peels right off. Waste of money</li>
    <li> This can in a tiny little screw bottle and is much smaller than I had thought. I think that it&#x27;s way small for what I paid for it since I paid like 12 dollars or more for this and I got this tiny thing. Anyways didn&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t like it but yeah I love it its just so cute if you got this then you know what I mean since the bottle is so cute and I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I&#x27;m sure that it works just fine.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product. I love it. I don&#x27;t need to go nail salon any more. Saved my times and money.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my nails for sometime and I was floored that I spent nearly $20 at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and half the cost on here...yep I will be ordering it from here from this point on!</li>
    <li> Does not work with led lamps, must get led/uv builder gel!!!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO DO NAILS AT HOME, AND LOVE IT. I USED EXACTLY AS DIRECTED AND GOT THE RESULTS I WAS HOPING FOR. IT DOES TAKE PRACTICE FOR THE APPLYING AND SHAPING, THAT OF COURSE WILL COME WITH TIME. JUST REMEMBER A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, AND TAKE YOUR TIME IF YOU ARE NEW SINCE PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. THIS IS PERFECT TO SAVE US MONEY SINCE MY GROWING DAUGHTER WANTS HER NAILS DONE, I CANNOT AFFORD CONSTANT SALON VISITS AND THIS IS SALON RESULTS :)</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a couple of weeks now and really don&#x27;t see a lot of improvement on my nails.  I guess I&#x27;ll continue to use it until Ive run out and hopefully will see a change by then.</li>
    <li> very good uv gel last about 2 weeks if your washing dishes or doing chores . its very sturdy non yellowing cures fast i ordered clear and pink gel</li>
    <li> I like this product however it starts to chip at the free edge and cuticle area. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used it before when I was in nail school and I won&#x27;t use anything else. It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I am new at DIY gel manicures.  I took a leap of faith and ordered this IBD Clear Builder Gel (along with a UV lamp, brush, nail forms, files, bonder, etc. from a variety of Amazon sellers).  I absolutely love it!  My very 1st gel manicure, where I had to lengthen 6 broken nails, hence the builder gel, turned out beautifully!  For any of you DIY-ers I suggest watching some YouTube videos 1st.  I write very few reviews, but felt compelled to write this one for 2 reasons:  1) Excellent product, and 2) Great Seller!  My initial order arrived damaged so I contacted them and sent a photo, as requested, and received a replacement about 1  week later. I appreciate any seller who stands by their product and makes sure their customers are satisfied.  I will be ordering from them again!</li>
    <li> Love love love, nothing else to say. Love this stuff. Lasts forever, easy to work with, self leveling.</li>
    <li> best builder ever! lasts a full 2 weeks no more salon visits i save so much money now, this builder is strong just like acrylic but better because it lasts longer</li>
    <li> Thick and self leveling, very easy to work with.</li>
