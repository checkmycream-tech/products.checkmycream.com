<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love these brushes and would recommend then to anyone. The ones i ordered were blue and pink and was everything i was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying that I too had ordered the bunny collection thinking it was going to be pink and blue however they arrived in blue and silver instead. I emailed both the seller and Sigma directly and they both informed me of the same thing. Here is the email below&lt;br /&gt;email.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the Mrs. Bunny pamphlets are no longer included in the kit. However, a white pamphlet is included in every package that includes our entire brush line and explains the uses for each brush. Was this pamphlet included in the shipment package?&lt;br /&gt;The Essential kit- Mrs. Bunny has been redesigned to include the new three ringed chrome ferrule. We will not be carrying the Mrs. Bunny with the pink ferrules. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns I can help you with.&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Sigma&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. Other than that small mishap the customer service was Great and they even sent me two free sigma brushes to compensate the problem.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and as described. This is a fantastic starter set of brushes of high quality. The price is a little tough but at the price it is way cheaper per brush than MAC and it comes with a nifty case. Most people use the interlocking cup style case for brush storage at home on their vanity but I am on the go a lot and love the fact that this is a sturdy hard case that protects the integrity of my brushes. There is also room in the case for some of my odds and ends brushes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fantastic starter kit, I would recommend picking up a Sigma F80 (Flat Top Kabuki) or Beauty Blender for better foundation application and this would be a wonderful professional grade starter kit.</li>
    <li> i love this brushes!!! SO soft. i cant wait to use them! Got this as a christmas gift, thanks Sigma for this Vegan Brushes!</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow! These brushes are so soft and fluffy they feel wonderful on the skin.  They work great applying makeup too! Sorry Mac, but I&#x27;m a Sigma Mrs. Bunny brush fan now :o).</li>
    <li> Hello!  First of all, i always wanted a good brush kit which would be both good quality and affordable, that&#x27;s why I purchased this amazing Sigma Brush Kit of 12 face and eye make-up brushes.I love that they are synthetic because that means vegan-friendly and as a huge animal lover and activist is super important to me!  It is a complete pack with all you need as a beginner to start your set.  I love the holder! makes travel and storage super easy and practical plus their colors are so cute!  The brushes are decent and don&#x27;t shed and they are super soft.  I definitely recomend it for a beginner !  So far I love it!  MK</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a good set of quality brushes for a long time. After trying a bunch of different brands, i couldnt be satisfied. Then after hours of looking at reviews and recommendations I checked out the Sigma brand. I&#x27;m am very happy with the Mrs. Bunny set, it is so adorable and the brushes are the softest i&#x27;ve ever felt. The variety of brushes you get  is perfect, it being the essential kit, I can see me only using this set for a long time. As soon as i received my package, which shipped incredibly fast, I tried the brushes out. They hold just the right amount of product and apply it beautifully! Sigma is definately on my love list and in the future I plan on getting the dry&#x27;n shape and the Hollywood Glamour flat top kabuki.</li>
    <li> daughter was wanting these Mrs.Bunny brushes for a long time and because of cost but being her 21st birthday i got these for her and it was an hit she was so happy. she probably was thinking finely.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase from Sigma, and so far I&#x27;m overall happy with these brushes. I love the colors, and the brushes are very soft. However, the duo fibre brush is a little sparse, and I wish this kit had a short shader and a kabuki.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  My husband bought them for me for Christmas, and they are beautiful.  The pink and blue coloring is adorable, and there are so many brushes in the set.  They are all synthetic and SO soft.  I have a few of the synthetic brushes already (F80, F84) and two of the smaller precisions, and I&#x27;m enjoying these just as much!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes after reading many wonderful reviews about them and I LOVE them!  They are so soft and really make a difference in how your make up is applied.  I would absolutely recommend!  They also wash/dry very well. You really wouldn&#x27;t ever need many other brushes if you have this set.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of brushes I have ordered from Sigma. The first brushes I ordered were just the regular ones, which I though were great until I started using these. These are SO much softer then the regular brushes, and they are so pretty! You get an AMAZING deal... 12 brushes for less then $130.00! These are comparable to M.A.C. brushes for 1/4 of the price. Also, my brushes got here in no time. These are wonderful brushes and this certainly will not be my last purchase from you guys. GREAT COMPANY. I recommend these brushes to everybody. Thanks so much for the awesome brushes. :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome!! I liked them so much that I recently ordered the essential kit brush set, I really recommend Sigma brushes to everyone, worth the price!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these brushes. Sigma brushes are amazing and great on my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used it for awhile before writing a review and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Return customer here.</li>
    <li> Favorite brushes ever!!!! These are beyond soft and I am glad they got rid of that horrible pink band around the top. I prefer the silver accent. I Wish Sigma would expand this line of synthetic brushes so I could buy separately and just add to this set.</li>
    <li> Hi!  I just received my Sigma Mrs. Bunny Brush Collection and I love them.  First of all, I order my brushes late in the afternoon on Sunday and they arrived today.  That was really fast.  I am very pleased with the quality of the brushes.  I purchased a Mac blush brush a couple of months ago and the Bunny blush brush was 10 times better.  I will be purchasing more brushes from Sigma in the future.  I am a true fan of Sigma!!!!</li>
    <li> I will not buy any other brush kit but SIGMA. When somthing is this good you stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back again.&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I am absolutely madly completely in love with these brushes! Not only are they cutest things in the whole wide world, but they are so soft and and distribute your make up in the most beautiful way! I am so with my purchase and I would recommend them to anyone! Sigma never disappoints :)</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  Beware when you first open the the package.  The smell is very strong. It helps by keeping the box open over night.  The factory smell is extreme.  Once the smell is gone it is good to go.  No problem at all.  Love all the brushes, they are so soft.</li>
    <li> i love this bunny set. i&#x27;ve seen soo many youtube reviews on sigma brushes and i knew i had to get a set myself. while i was on the website, i came across the mrs. bunny set and knew i had to get it. babyblue and light pink are my favorite colors and to have them combined on this beautiful and soft brush set was like a dream come true. even when i&#x27;m not using my brushes to put makeup on... i still hold it in my hands sometimes and just run my fingers through the fur.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are the best! The feel of the bristles are so silky soft and they are very durable as the hairs don&#x27;t seem to fall out like cheap drugstore brushes. This is my second set I have bought in less than 3 months bc I accidentally left my first set on a cruise ship and was never able to reclaim them :(</li>
    <li> This set is good for me I&#x27;m a beginner and don&#x27;t need any more brush than this. They r soft a and do the job. Smell a little like paint at first after a couple weeks the smell go away. The arrive on time and I like that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife for her birthday. She raved about how these brushes were super cute and really soft. It was her very first set of makeup brushes and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. She was torn between this kit or the Make Me Cool one and I ended up purchasing Mrs. Bunny for its vegan-friendly purposes! Came in a functional container which will be helpful to keep her other brushes in one place.</li>
    <li> What must I say the name speaks for itself. This was my 1st sigma brush set and I&#x27;m in love. They all work perfect for all my coloring and highlighting needs this is the perfect set for beginners and pros and the price was just right!</li>
    <li> These brushes are of excellent quality and works great for me. I love the finish and perfection these brushes provide.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a uber cool case used to transport it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend loves it and has been using it for some time now.</li>
    <li> I couldnt wait to recieve this awesome brush kit that i have been wanting forever!!   I felt like a little kid in a candy shop :) Of course i tried them out right after i got the package. The brushes are so soft and are perfect for a perfect make up application. My make up collection is now complete. Thanks Sigma!</li>
    <li> Best brushes! Expensive, but so worth it! This set has every brush you will ever need! The bristles are soft, the handles are just the right length. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased and happy with the Mrs. Bunny Essential Brush Kit from Sigma. I love how each and every brush is hand made, and designed to be very soft. These brushes are great with picking up, holding and blending the product you&#x27;re using. I found these brushes to be even better than some of the MAC brushes I have. These brushes do not shed like some MAC ones do and they seem to hold up their shape a lot better. If you purchase the Mrs. Bunny Essential Brush Kit I can promise that you will be very happy and satisfied with your order, and that you&#x27;re money will be well spent!</li>
    <li> My daughter liked this.</li>
    <li> I just loved it! I waited some time to buy it and now I can tell you that was the best choice of shopping!</li>
    <li> So let me start off with saying my sigma brushes arrived lightening fast estimated shipping time said I would receive them 7 business days.  I ordered them on the 15 they shipped on the 17 and was at my doorstep by the 19!  I was pleasantly surprised, so I wasted no time openings them and trying them out.  I had already had my face done for the day but I couldn&#x27;t wait for tomorrow so I washed my face and re-applied my makeup.  Everything went on so smoothly, all the brushes are amazingly soft and very sturdy and easy to work with.  Thank you Sigma I will definitely be shopping with you again!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes and excellent service.  Received as promised.  The matching blue case is perfect to keep the brushes in!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of professional makeup brushes. I always bought brushes from CVS or Duane Reade thinking they were great and why would I want to pay more.... BUT at this price, these are really not much more expensive and 10+X better. SO soft and wonderful with NO shedding and smooth even application. And so cute with the beautiful colors. Also important that it is synthetic so no real bunnies hurt :)</li>
    <li> Just received my Mrs Bunny essential kit and it looks awesome! Cant wait to try all the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;The leather case it comes in looks very nice and is very useful for storage, traveling and goes great on top of my desk.</li>
    <li> Just received my new Sigma Essential kit - Mrs Bunny,&lt;br /&gt;I purchased them for my daughters birthday. she luvs them so much.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are excellent quality. My daughter has just started wearing&lt;br /&gt;make-up at the age of 14 and, these brushes are excellent for teenages as&lt;br /&gt;they are really soft and gentle on the skin and there is a range of brushes for&lt;br /&gt;her to choose from. Now my other daughter want a set......I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;these brushes to all my friends.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great and do not shed. I had been so discouraged when I purchased a MAC brush to put on my foundation only for me to end up with brush hairs on my face. So with that I decided to give these a shot after all the reviews and YouTube videos using them. I have to say they are amazing and live up to all the hype. These are an investment and have lasted very well through my daily use and washes. The color is true and the cause is great as a stand to hold all of the brushes in.</li>
    <li> Excellent~~~~Love it and great quality. You will not be disappointed. And the case is so worth the extra money. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Fast shipping arrived in 4 days, very pleased. I love all the brushes, so soft. I was skeptical about them being Vegan but the quality is amazing. Great purchase: 12 brushes for only $109! Love Love them</li>
    <li> these are very soft pretty looking brushes, would buy sigma brushes again, good quality I washed them a few times now and they don&#x27;t shed. just a nice soft way to apply make up</li>
    <li> Best synthetic brushes ever... first time purchasing these type of brushes and i have to say i love them.... the colors are beautiful and unique....</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister. She&#x27;s a makeup addict. She loves them! They feel very, very soft.</li>
    <li> I was saving for a few months for a makeup brush kit, I thank&#x27;s God I made the perfect choice. Love this cute Sigma synthetic kit, the application it&#x27;s perfect, brushes are high quality, color is gorgeous. I little bit pricey, but worth it. 5/5</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are very soft and the handles are comfortable. For someone that is interested in becoming more advanced in makeup application, these definitely give more options and better quality results. The price is great for the quality that you receive. I love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about getting these brushes as I heard great reviews about them and how comparable they were to high end brushes. When I received the brushes, I found that many of the brushes were bent and were crooked. I also found the container the brushes came in was extremely cheap and you could see where they glued the edges together of the cup &amp; it can easily be pulled apart because the glue isn&#x27;t strong. The brushes also smell strongly of paint. I would closely consider if you are willing to spend the chunk of money for brushes. Yes, you get alot of brushes, but the quality is obviously compromised.</li>
    <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
    <li> I just want to warn everyone that you might not get what you are ordering. I ordered the blue and pink Mrs. Bunny, but received the silver and blue. The picture was changed a few days after my order. I have the confirmation email and it was the pink and blue, but now it silver and blue in the Amazon picture. If they ran out I should have been notified. I should not be shocked when I open my order! I feel they were being sneaky by changing the picture.  The only reason I kept the brushes is because I wanted that type of brush. I wish I could have ordered from a better respectable company.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush set and color!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on MAC brushes. These rock. If you love make up and want that professional look then you need these!!</li>
