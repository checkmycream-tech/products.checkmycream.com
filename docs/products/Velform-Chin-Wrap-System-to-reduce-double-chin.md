### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Sooooo attractive!  </li>
      <li>so your spouse or loved one does not have to see you all wrapped up with all your face &amp; chin fat pressed out front making your face look swollen!</li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this product is fair.</li>
      <li>so I used my own firming lotion.</li>
      <li>Shipped with a couple free gifts which I thought was nice.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not really a terrible experience.  </li>
      <li>It would have worked better if the chin strap had more elasticity.</li>
      <li>Like I said it is better than not using anything or surgery.</li>
      <li>The skin under my chin and neck has a more firmer look.</li>
      <li>It has worked for me, and I feel significantly better about the way I look now.</li>
      <li>Once I figured out one strap was longer, it fit better.</li>
      <li>moreover the design is not so accurate to tone up the side jaws.</li>
      <li>If not placed just perfectly, face tends to round &amp; puff up, but this thing moves around while sleeping.</li>
      <li>However, I did also reduce my caloric intake and began exercising more (and the muscles that are specific problem areas in the neck), so I&#x27;m sure those things also helped out.</li>
      <li>Loved it, as a young male I feel even more attractive, the little bit of loose skin under the neck is going, its an amazing product..</li>
      <li>so far I have just been kneading my chin with my fist to tighen it up, seems to be working better.</li>
      <li>Beyond that, however, I&#x27;d say this product is a good supplement to other weight loss measures.</li>
      <li>I had purchased the product in the past from verseo.com, and I was happy with it.</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>, the lotion without a nice scent does nothing and the wrap is so darn tight it gives you a headache.</li>
      <li>just ok not so much good.as after some time the band become loose.......</li>
      <li>I used the whole thing: no difference whatsoever.</li>
      <li>The chin strap slips and is very flimsy.</li>
      <li>in real sense</li>
      <li>haha  </li>
      <li>I expected a better product for my money.</li>
      <li>initially I was kinda peeved by the 1.5 ounce cream bottle, but that size is more than enough really.</li>
      <li>This is a very cheaply made item, extremely small for a woman size 8 and very flimsy.</li>
      <li>The cream is pleasant smelling and isn&#x27;t sticky or gross, and the chin wrap at the very least keeps me single-chinned for 1/2 hour</li>
      <li>Nothing like old fashion cardio exercise &amp; diet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 and had a double chin, this product really does work.  </li>
      <li>i do not have a big head but found the wrap (which I know is to be tight to work) when pulled to fit tore and lost the stretch.  </li>
      <li>The neck section rolls up and the entire item is extremely inferior but costs far more than it it should by at least five times.</li>

<li> Hopefully in a week or two there will be a dramatic enough difference that someone will ask me if I lost weight (did I mention wishful thinking?)</li>

<li> Duh, the longer strap goes around your scalp, while the shorter one goes around your neck.</li>
<li> I am not happy with this product at all.</li>
<li> Yes I am one of those unfortunate people that now have a double chin, which is rather ugly as everyone knows!</li>
<li> not impressed</li>
<li> You might look silly, but it works and you don&#x27;t have to leave it on all day.  </li>
<li> I was afraid to use the rest on my skin</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also ordered the toning gel separate,because I go through it like crazy.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had the Lifestyle Lift in Nov 07 - I was supposed to wrap my face/chin with an elastic wrap while I slept. What a pain! I tried the chin wrap system - I could actually sleep in it (I know, the instructions said to wear it 30 minutes, but, it didn&#x27;t say I shouldn&#x27;t wear it longer). Once I figured out one strap was longer, it fit better. Duh, the longer strap goes around your scalp, while the shorter one goes around your neck. I find the velcro connector is scratchy on my neck, while the head strap tends to need repositioning as it slips off my pointy head.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;After one use, it lost its form. The gel it came with was old and the top was all dried up like cold wax. I was afraid to use the rest on my skin so I used my own firming lotion. If not placed just perfectly, face tends to round &amp; puff up, but this thing moves around while sleeping. Form is even worse after 2nd use. Nothing like old fashion cardio exercise &amp; diet. Seller did contact me after reading my review and offered refund after return.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> For someone with a double chin - this wrap does not fit on my head &amp; neck. I was disappointed</li>
    <li> cheapest piece of garbage I have ever purchased, I would NOT recommend this to anyone at all! I wish I could just get my money back</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is my third purchase of the system. I&#x27;ve also ordered the toning gel separate,because I go through it like crazy.  I&#x27;m 50 and had a double chin, this product really does work.  It has made my face thinner and look about 10 years younger.  I use it during my workouts.  But you can wear it while you are cleaning around the house.  You might look silly, but it works and you don&#x27;t have to leave it on all day.  The skin under my chin and neck has a more firmer look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days and maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking but I believe I see a difference already!  I use it twice a day, once in the a.m. and once before bed.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not really a terrible experience.  The cream is pleasant smelling and isn&#x27;t sticky or gross, and the chin wrap at the very least keeps me single-chinned for 1/2 hour LOL  The velcro is a bit scratchy but honestly that&#x27;s the worst I can come up with about this product so far.  Shipped with a couple free gifts which I thought was nice.  Hopefully in a week or two there will be a dramatic enough difference that someone will ask me if I lost weight (did I mention wishful thinking?)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say this product is fair. It has worked for me, and I feel significantly better about the way I look now. However, I did also reduce my caloric intake and began exercising more (and the muscles that are specific problem areas in the neck), so I&#x27;m sure those things also helped out. initially I was kinda peeved by the 1.5 ounce cream bottle, but that size is more than enough really. The biggest issue I have with the product is how \\&quot;special\\&quot; you look while wearing it. I refuse to be seen in it, so I have to tactfully plan my useage time. Beyond that, however, I&#x27;d say this product is a good supplement to other weight loss measures.</li>
    <li> this product is .....just ok not so much good.as after some time the band become loose.......and it looses its property to control the double chin.  in real sense i m not satisfied from this product.  moreover the design is not so accurate to tone up the side jaws.</li>
    <li> It would have worked better if the chin strap had more elasticity.</li>
    <li> Regular effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Yes I am one of those unfortunate people that now have a double chin, which is rather ugly as everyone knows! I don&#x27;t want lipo-suction or any other evasive treatment so I hoped this would offer an alternative... it does not. So save your money, the lotion without a nice scent does nothing and the wrap is so darn tight it gives you a headache. If you want to try it for yourself, do it while you are alone so your spouse or loved one does not have to see you all wrapped up with all your face &amp; chin fat pressed out front making your face look swollen! Sooooo attractive!  haha  ;)  Next alternative... so far I have just been kneading my chin with my fist to tighen it up, seems to be working better.</li>
    <li> This product does not do anything. I used the whole thing: no difference whatsoever. Spend your money on something else.</li>
    <li> Loved it, as a young male I feel even more attractive, the little bit of loose skin under the neck is going, its an amazing product..</li>
    <li> This is a very cheaply made item, extremely small for a woman size 8 and very flimsy. The neck section rolls up and the entire item is extremely inferior but costs far more than it it should by at least five times.</li>
    <li> I did use this from time to time...do&#x27;t r eally know if it works but it surely is tight under your double chin. Weather or not it helps it must if you keep it on 2-3 times a day!!! Like I said it is better than not using anything or surgery.</li>
    <li> The wrap has velcro to attach it and it cuts into your skin.  i do not have a big head but found the wrap (which I know is to be tight to work) when pulled to fit tore and lost the stretch.  not impressed</li>
    <li> The wrap&#x27;s ends didn&#x27;t stretch enough to fasten Velcro fasteners around my head.  It seemed to be a child-sized version, but it didn&#x27;t say it on the package.  I am not a giant and my head is an average size.  I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;This was actually my third Velform Chin Wrap - I had purchased the product in the past from verseo.com, and I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product at all. The chin strap slips and is very flimsy. I expected a better product for my money.</li>
