      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t in love with this hydrator.</li>
      <li>i mix with Estee Lauder anti aging cream 1.6 oz, and LOVE THE LIFT, OR Weleda Pomegranate aging serum</li>

      <li>I AM THRILLED with the results,my face looks and feels  soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>love this light beauty product - fast became one of my favorites for moisturizing my skin</li>
      <li>absorbs immediately and you see results quickly</li>
      <li>This serum is absorbed quickly, and not greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>Also, this hydrator wasn&#x27;t quickly absorbed into my skin which is an issue for me.</li>
      <li>Seems to work well and worth the money.</li>
      <li>this product is a powerful tool for anti aging.</li>
      <li>After trying so many different products and spending a truckload of cash I decided why not try this.</li>
      <li>My face is still dry even though I&#x27;m using it more than twice a day.  </li>
      <li>Went back to Dermalogica and my skin is fine now.</li>
      <li>Ordered 2 bottles, for my wife and mother-in-law, to try instead of their normal favorite, Olay Professional Pro-X Age Repair Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30.</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying out a skin hydrator, as I normally use skin moisturizers.</li>
      <li>What I was really looking for was the serum.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t feel heavy,sticky or tacky on my face and the description of this</li>
      <li>It instantly calms your face, reduces pore size and feels light on....</li>
      <li>and I think they are reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to add the skin plumper to my routine because with results like this from a hydrator</li>
      <li>It really did moisturize my skin and plump it up.</li>
      <li>i really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was pretty natural.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and I could feel my skin was tighter and more firm.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if this works but love the plumping cream.</li>
      <li>, then... your skin looks soft, radiant and dewy!  </li>
      <li>The second day I used this product, my face became very irritated.</li>
      <li>So far I like this hydrating formula.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find BHT, a preservative, in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>And I am 68 years old.</li>
      <li>I saw a complete turnaround in my skin in two day&#x27;s time.</li>
      <li>Product is light, little goes a long way, moisturizers great, no more dry spots like with other products!</li>
      <li>, it actually melted in and made it feel soft and young.</li>
      <li>It actually helped clear up my skin!</li>
      <li>Soft feel to your skin and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, dry, and acneproned.</li>
      <li>This absolutely beats it for effectiveness hands down.</li>
      <li>After using it 3 times in less than 24 hours I can say that my skin looks dewy and soft...not enough time for any plumping results, but certainly my face looks brighter and younger (I think!).</li>

    <li> Bought this at ulta and am very impressed. For me it was instant change in the feel of my face and my skin tone was more even and firmer. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like th hydrator however it leaves my skin feeling sticky.  not sure why that is.  I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn&#x27;t the sticky feeling that I get after applying.  Seems to work well my skin seems to be more hydrated.</li>
    <li> This products works to hydrate your skin all day long. You can even apply over your makeup throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It really did moisturize my skin and plump it up. My skin is very sensitive, dry, and acneproned.</li>
    <li> This product works fine, although I have yet to see results.  What I was really looking for was the serum. It doesn&#x27;t say serum on this one or any others I found online.</li>
    <li> nice product.  It has hyluronic acid in it and this is great for your skin.  I received a sample and when I used it I immediately found it on line and order some.  Good prie, nice product, good for your nails and cuticles, soaks right in and not greasey on face or hands.</li>
    <li> Soft feel to your skin and moisturizes at the same time. Thamk you</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  It keeps the skin hydrated, and it works well after I place a vitamin C serum on my face, then I add this on top.  Excellent product at a wonderful price.  in addition, it works great over makeup for a touch up to give the skin a nice glow.</li>
    <li> love this light beauty product - fast became one of my favorites for moisturizing my skin</li>
    <li> I love Hada Labo products but I wasn&#x27;t in love with this hydrator. This was my first time trying out a skin hydrator, as I normally use skin moisturizers. This product is not the consistency that I thought it would be. Also, this hydrator wasn&#x27;t quickly absorbed into my skin which is an issue for me. There were a few occasions where I had to use a tissue to pat my face dry, and I didn&#x27;t use a lot of product either. I think that I will stick with moisturizers instead.</li>
    <li> I have been following this line of products and wondering if this could be the one for me.I&#x27;m 47 with skin in desperate need of help.The wrinkles are killing me.After trying so many different products and spending a truckload of cash I decided why not try this.I really wanted a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t feel heavy,sticky or tacky on my face and the description of this made me hopeful it would fit the bill.Not only did it not leave my face feeling tacky etc., it actually melted in and made it feel soft and young.With the addition of collagen and retinol complex this product is a powerful tool for anti aging.I AM THRILLED with the results,my face looks and feels  soft and healthy.I&#x27;m getting ready to add the skin plumper to my routine because with results like this from a hydrator I can only imagine what the skin plumper does.FINALLY a line I can say 100% makes a difference to already damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I am inlove with this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works but love the plumping cream.</li>
    <li> Product is okay.  Looking for more intensive hydration.</li>
    <li> Has retinol so dont go out in the sun with thus</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed because all it&#x27;s done is make my skin feel rubbery and leave it a little bit oily.</li>
    <li> Just purchased yesterday.  Definitely a great product.  As soon as I got the package home, I tried it over my makeup as suggested....and there was a difference!  After using it 3 times in less than 24 hours I can say that my skin looks dewy and soft...not enough time for any plumping results, but certainly my face looks brighter and younger (I think!). This serum is absorbed quickly, and not greasy feeling.  You can apply your makeup over it in seconds.  And another plus, there did not seem to be any annoying fragrance.  A great refresher for you face during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution though: use care with the pump....it doesn&#x27;t take much to get just a few drops.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product ! It instantly calms your face, reduces pore size and feels light on....I use it a few times a day to stay hydrated !</li>
    <li> The second day I used this product, my face became very irritated. I stopped for a while and tried again...same thing. Won&#x27;t be trying again. Went back to Dermalogica and my skin is fine now.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! It makes my skin look younger instantly, so I cant wait for the long term outcome. It soaks in immediately with no greasy feel. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing product for someone with hormonal/cystic acne like me. It actually helped clear up my skin! I love it!</li>
    <li> So far I like this hydrating formula. It does leave the skin kind of oily but I just blot the excess. I don&#x27;t wear make-up so I don&#x27;t know how it works over/under make-up. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well and worth the money.</li>
    <li> got a sample of this in my ipsy and loved to so much that I bought it on Amazon.  I noticed a difference after one use and I could feel my skin was tighter and more firm.  I do not have wrinkles but I am using this as preventative treatment.  I would defiantly recommend adding this to your regiment.  A small amount goes a long way as well so I was defiantly happy with this purchase and will buy it again when I run out.  I even use it on my husband and he likes it as well</li>
    <li> Read about this on Good Housekeeping&#x27;s Anti-Aging Award Winners for 2013. Ordered 2 bottles, for my wife and mother-in-law, to try instead of their normal favorite, Olay Professional Pro-X Age Repair Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30. Both agreed they preferred the Olay better. Not saying this cream was bad, but they will be going back to their old favorite.</li>
    <li> I had been using a very expensive product line in the past -- as much as $200 an ounce. This absolutely beats it for effectiveness hands down. I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it. I use it with the plumper gel. I saw a complete turnaround in my skin in two day&#x27;s time. I still can&#x27;t believe the difference. And I am 68 years old. Amazon -- please keep this in stock!</li>
    <li> Product is light, little goes a long way, moisturizers great, no more dry spots like with other products!</li>
    <li> absorbs immediately and you see results quickly</li>
    <li> Simply FABULOUS!  This goes on like a viscous water, blend for a couple minutes, then... your skin looks soft, radiant and dewy!  On alternate days, I use this with Sonia Kashuk Radiant Boost Restorative Oil.  This is THE best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Did not like. Makes skin feel dry.</li>
    <li> I like this and I feel it also does a sufficient job. My favorite is the face plumper. I like all their products and I think they are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> My face is still dry even though I&#x27;m using it more than twice a day.  I was surprised to find BHT, a preservative, in the ingredients. I thought it was pretty natural. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> i really like this product.  I must admit though, i mix it with one or two of my other products for maximun results.  i mix with Estee Lauder anti aging cream 1.6 oz, and LOVE THE LIFT, OR Weleda Pomegranate aging serum</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff.  What I like about it is that it can be used before or after your make-up.  My husband likes to use it sometimes after shaving with the electric razor.</li>
