      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>I then started using Careprost ophthalmic solution which worked great, but when I ran out,...I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere to order.</li>
      <li>The bottle lasts me quite a while, so I think it&#x27;s a good price for the results.</li>
      <li>I used this successfully years ago and am glad I came across .it again and at a good value.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, it works &amp; I have now bought it for friends &amp; family.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this store and the product is awesome ....</li>
      <li>I recently ordered the 2-pack, for the best value, and now keep one bottle in my travel bag.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I have many allergies and this product does not irritate at all.  </li>
      <li>i love it  and i have seen the results, my sister too people  had been noted  </li>
      <li>I just reordered more so hopefully my lashes will come in thicker.</li>
      <li>Mavala is safe, non-irritating, and has no odor.  </li>
      <li>I surely will buy from this store again</li>
      <li>I LOVE Mavala nail oil as nail hardener.</li>
      <li>more power to your store.  </li>
      <li>Even the best mascaras tend to dry out my eyelashes</li>
      <li>I was excited to try a lash lengthening product that was easy to apply and would not discolor my eyelid.</li>
      <li>I used this product for one month and so far, so good.</li>
      <li>and it broke some right off !</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference after the first bottle, yet I have with another more pricey product.</li>
      <li>I started using this and at first, I was losing my eye lashes!</li>
      <li>I had a gap in my left top eyelash line and it has filled in --</li>
      <li>With the use of mascara during the day, and Mavala at night on my clean dry lashes, the results have been fantastic!</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>I love the product and have ordered several times.</li>
      <li>So far I am very pleased with the results that I bought a second bottle for my sister...    </li>
      <li>My lashes were really long, but the growth was very light on the ends of my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>It keeps my lashes healthy and long!  </li>
      <li>Best of all, I have long thick lashes.</li>
      <li>I see a difference, it&#x27;s not a dramatic difference, but I see an improvement.</li>
      <li>They also look a bit thicker, I&#x27;m guessing because this conditions your lashes really well, and keeps lashes from falling out.  </li>
      <li>I really like this eyelash conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I now use castor oil once at night for lashes and brows which works very well for me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, esp for this price!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even care that much about the length, I wanted my lower lashes to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am sure my lashes are longer and this is my third week of using Mavala Eye-Lite Double Lash.</li>
      <li>So I had high hopes for this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and this vendor.  </li>
      <li>just brush it on &amp; I am sure to touch the roots because after all, hair is dead, but it seems to stimulate the roots.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this on a consistent enough basis.  </li>
      <li>When my hand is shaking, because the wand is all round, it makes it easy to reach every lash.  </li>
      <li>I ordered two lash products that one applies directly to the lash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m as surprised as anyone, but this stuff works.  </li>
      <li>It leaves lashes soft and supple and does not run into the eyes.  </li>
      <li>but my eyelashes really weren&#x27;t the same.</li>
      <li>If you are consistent, it works, if you are not consistent, it works somewhat.  </li>
      <li>When I first pursued longer lashes, I used Latisse for a few months.</li>
      <li>I am not the type who leaves negative reviews left and right, so that shows my disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;It can work for others, it did not work for me!</li>

<li> which in return would make my eyebrows grow in much faster than usual.</li>
<li> Long, thick, full lashes and eyebrows for hundreds less than some big brands.  </li>
<li> I got tons of compliments on my eyelashes being so long.</li>
<li> I also ordered three other lash products at the same time to mix things up.  </li>
<li> I purchased the MAVALA Eye Double Lash mascara and found the wand to be extremely helpful.  </li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> I purchased a 2 pack, and don&#x27;t think I will waste my time with the 2nd bottle.</li>
<li> Only complaint is that my eyelashes got so long that when I put the stuff on it would rub on my eyebrows</li>
<li> The other is my Mavala alternative.  </li>
<li> I am 63 years old and expect my lashes to thin out, but this product appears to be preventing that.</li>
<li> I think lashes are a little slower to grow.</li>
<li> I need to use it a little longer to see results.</li>
<li> If you are over 35 and have noticed holes between lashes or thin lashes, or short lashes, this is for you!  </li>
<li> Was a wasted of money.</li>
<li> I will continue to use as i bought it and don&#x27;t believe in letting things go to waste.</li>
<li> I have MS and have trouble putting on mascara.  </li>
<li> This product Mavala has many nasty chemicals</li>
<li> I was using Rapidlash but got tired of the darkening of skin on eyelids</li>
<li> It is expensive</li>
<li> Sadly this did not work at all and is non-returnable (nonrefundable).  </li>
<li> One was terrible, turning my lids dark and itching in just one day.  </li>
<li> I just wish they came with an applicator like a skinny paint brush :(</li>
<li> it works like crazy!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use to have a nervous tic, instead of biting my nails I would pull out my eyelashes and I stopped but my eyelashes really weren&#x27;t the same. I started using this and at first, I was losing my eye lashes! But I decided to keep using it hoping it would start working, and low and behold, they started growing again! My eye lashes are back and I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> If you are over 35 and have noticed holes between lashes or thin lashes, or short lashes, this is for you!  When used regularly (I do mine before bed) it works like crazy!!  Long, thick, full lashes and eyebrows for hundreds less than some big brands.  If also pair with Biotin vitamins for hair, skin and nails.  If you are consistent, it works, if you are not consistent, it works somewhat.  I highly recommend it, esp for this price!</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash conditioner.  I see a difference, it&#x27;s not a dramatic difference, but I see an improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m as surprised as anyone, but this stuff works.  I&#x27;ve been using Mavala for about three months, and my eyelashes are definitely a smidge longer.  They also look a bit thicker, I&#x27;m guessing because this conditions your lashes really well, and keeps lashes from falling out.  The bottle lasts me quite a while, so I think it&#x27;s a good price for the results.</li>
    <li> I used this product for one month and so far, so good. I just reordered more so hopefully my lashes will come in thicker.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for over a year now and it works.  you will see the different with in 30 days.  I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like Mavala products and this one is definitely a keeper/repeater.  I noticed a definite thickening of my lashes within a week, and they appear longer too.  However, I do not like the applicator brush, because you can&#x27;t get the product close enough to your eyelash roots without a poke in the eye.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try a lash lengthening product that was easy to apply and would not discolor my eyelid. Sadly this did not work at all and is non-returnable (nonrefundable).  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Honestly, it works &amp; I have now bought it for friends &amp; family.  just brush it on &amp; I am sure to touch the roots because after all, hair is dead, but it seems to stimulate the roots.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this store and the product is awesome ....more power to your store.  I surely will buy from this store again</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It keeps my lashes healthy and long!  Even the best mascaras tend to dry out my eyelashes and then they fall out.  This product has been saving my eyelashes for over 7 years.</li>
    <li> I have used Mavala for years. Great product.  I also ordered three other lash products at the same time to mix things up.  Megalash by Wet n Wild is a serum to line the eyeld and I use that at night.  It is very good also. I ordered two lash products that one applies directly to the lash. One was terrible, turning my lids dark and itching in just one day.  The other is my Mavala alternative.  Mavala is safe, non-irritating, and has no odor.  I have many allergies and this product does not irritate at all.  It leaves lashes soft and supple and does not run into the eyes.  I put this on in the morning and there are no side effects.  It is expensive but then it works and there is no irritation. Best of all, I have long thick lashes. It is the gold standard for me.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see any difference, i didn&#x27;t wear any eye make up during a month because i wanted it to see the difference but i didn&#x27;t. i followed the instructions but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely phenomenal. When I first pursued longer lashes, I used Latisse for a few months. But with the cost of that item, it was short lived. I then started using Careprost ophthalmic solution which worked great, but when I ran out,...I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere to order. So along my search, I came across Mavala, and it was cheaper than all the rest. I ordered 2 bottles and began using it. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product. With the use of mascara during the day, and Mavala at night on my clean dry lashes, the results have been fantastic! I am constantly getting compliments from coworkers and clients at my job. I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I should have taken pictures before and during use of Mavala Eye-Lite Double Lash. the Mavala Eye-Lite brush leaves something to be desired. I am sure my lashes are longer and this is my third week of using Mavala Eye-Lite Double Lash.</li>
    <li> Came just as described:D This stuff truly works if used as instructed.. Thank you, Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> still waiting to see results.  I haven&#x27;t used this on a consistent enough basis.  Shipping was very fast. I just wish they came with an applicator like a skinny paint brush :(</li>
    <li> I have MS and have trouble putting on mascara.  I purchased the MAVALA Eye Double Lash mascara and found the wand to be extremely helpful.  When my hand is shaking, because the wand is all round, it makes it easy to reach every lash.  Great product!</li>
    <li> i love it  and i have seen the results, my sister too people  had been noted  the different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thank you</li>
    <li> I love the product and have ordered several times.Works to condition lashes as well as to separate before applying mascara</li>
    <li> They definitely worked! My lashes were really long, but the growth was very light on the ends of my eyelashes. I only wish that they would make them thicker as well darker, but it definitely lengthens your lashes. I got tons of compliments on my eyelashes being so long. I was very happy. Only complaint is that my eyelashes got so long that when I put the stuff on it would rub on my eyebrows which in return would make my eyebrows grow in much faster than usual.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product just about a month ago and i have seen no changes at all. I will continue to use as i bought it and don&#x27;t believe in letting things go to waste. I hope that maybe in the process it will work.</li>
    <li> I purchased it about a month ago, after burnning my eye lashes (making bannanas flambé).  My eye lashes grew to the length tha  they were before but they kept growing.  So far I am very pleased with the results that I bought a second bottle for my sister...    Wink, wink...one with each eye!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference after the first bottle, yet I have with another more pricey product. I was looking for a cheaper alternative, and had no luck finding it. I purchased a 2 pack, and don&#x27;t think I will waste my time with the 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Mavala nail oil as nail hardener. So I had high hopes for this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for 6 months now, and it has not worked for me. My lashes are not longer, and they are definitively not thicker. I don&#x27;t even care that much about the length, I wanted my lower lashes to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I regret wasting 6 months on this product. I am not the type who leaves negative reviews left and right, so that shows my disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;It can work for others, it did not work for me!</li>
    <li> Although it is too soon to tell if this product lives up to its promises about eyelashes; I can say that my eyebrows are filling in.  I use the product nightly on both my lashes and brows and I can definitely see a change in the thickness of my brows.  I think lashes are a little slower to grow.</li>
    <li> does not work. Going on two months so I went back to using latisse.</li>
    <li> I was using Rapidlash but got tired of the darkening of skin on eyelids it caused tho it did lengthen my lashes. This product Mavala has many nasty chemicals so i used it on eye brows which did help but had to put on several times a day. I now use castor oil once at night for lashes and brows which works very well for me.</li>
    <li> this product does not work for me, try it for 2 weeks and see no result. would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this successfully years ago and am glad I came across .it again and at a good value.  I need to use it a little longer to see results.</li>
    <li> I think it is just starting to work on my eye lashes. I had slept in my eye make-up and the next day used my eye lash curler and it broke some right off ! I have been using this product for about a month now. I can start to see my lashes getting thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would order this product again and recommend it to any one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula Heyntsen</li>
    <li> because i see no change they told me one month you see a difference has been a  1 mount i use this product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product and this vendor.  I have been using this product for several years and am very pleased with the results.  I recently ordered the 2-pack, for the best value, and now keep one bottle in my travel bag. My order arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I both two bottles but none works for me. Was a wasted of money. Every night I used it and after 6 months I give up.</li>
    <li> The vendor has shipped bottles with liquid to Colorado, where temperatures are in 20s, in plastic bag.  The liquid froze and bottles exploded.  Brilliant!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for five years. I stopped for a few months then began using it again and really did notice an improvement in lash health. I had a gap in my left top eyelash line and it has filled in -- it looked like one or two lashes had fallen out and weren&#x27;t going to grow back. I am 63 years old and expect my lashes to thin out, but this product appears to be preventing that. I do use mascara and am careful to remove it completely every night, then appy the Mavala Double-Lash.</li>
