      <li>Good thing that I did, because it didn&#x27;t work until the point that it was completely rubbed in.  </li>
      <li>Great smelling solution for dry and/or cracked heels and skin.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Definitely it&#x27;s worth in price of gold, or ahem</li>
      <li>Smells great but kind of weird to use.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that is gentle enough to be used on other rough skin areas, not just feet with excellent results.</li>
      <li>This gentle peel doesn&#x27;t work for tough callus, good for very smooth heal just for maintenance.</li>
      <li>I have use this every day since I got it earlier this week, and I have gotten more effect from my pumice stone in one session.</li>
      <li>This product I thought was the same thing, but it feels more like a scrub</li>
      <li>They seemed to work at first but would not give any noticeable, CONTINUING, SUSTAINED improvement.</li>
      <li>Now they are soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This stuff does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I applied it all over and did some emails, then gently rubbed my hands on my face and loads of skin came off!</li>
      <li>Thanks Mom for recommending it!</li>
      <li>Glad I only paid $3.99 at Marshalls for</li>
      <li>I just finished using this product for the first time</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I continued massaging it on my feet LONG after what seemed appropriate.  </li>
      <li>I am finding as I grow older, meaning over 50,I need to take better care of my feet and have been experimenting with various products for 3 years now.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s for feet, but it&#x27;s a nice little side use.</li>
      <li>There ARE parabens but they&#x27;re listed on the very bottom of the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t notice much of a peel happening.</li>
      <li>Still there rough part, but better.</li>
      <li>I run anywhere from 30-50 miles a week and my feet really take a beating.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gentle, not stinging, as its packaging ad promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>as the info on the back of its container says, it also \\&quot;works great for hands, knees elbows and other dry skin</li>
      <li>a tiny dab of this take it right off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got some kind of thickener in it, and when you put it on your skin and start rubbing it around, it turns pasty white, and eventually it comes off in little slivers.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time last night.  </li>
      <li>So I was looking for a foot lotion that would heal my feet and this lotion makes them soft &amp; smoother.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is that this is a complete miracle product.</li>
      <li>I have soft heels.  </li>
      <li>Then, well, since it is a peel, tried in on my dried clean face.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed at how much dead skin was gently rubbed off in just the first application.  </li>

      <li>I only needed it occasionally and, after using a callus sander &amp; razor, it would really do the job on smoothing and softening my feet.</li>
      <li>No other foot creme I&#x27;ve used compares.</li>
      <li>It does not sluff off too much of the rough skin at a time, thank goodness</li>
      <li>Apparently this is designed to make you think that it is your skin sloughing off, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
      <li>Like the other reviewer, I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding this favorite at retail outlets.</li>
      <li>It definitely takes major pressure to get the skin to begin rubbing off, but even then, it seemed as if the lotion was the only thing balling up and rubbing off.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve rubbed it onto my dry sometimes mildly to moderately painful elbows and they have gotten much more softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is NOT a peel. More of a scrub. I think this would work alright on feet that only need a little work, like a few rough spots, not actual calluses. If you have an actual callous, this is not for you. I bought the Microplane Colossal Pedicutre Rasp Brown by Microplane through Amazon after not being happy with this scrub and it worked AMAZINGLY. It was around 8.00 and worth every penny. If you need a solution to your hobbit feet, buy the Microplane, you&#x27;ll be amazed. I, admittedly, have always had Flintstone feet. I have tried numerous creams, pumices, callus stones, and even razors. I have never been as happy with a product for my feet as I am with the Microplace. If you&#x27;re thinking that the pedi-egg is essentially the same thing, its not. The microplane blows the pedi-egg out of the water and its a bit cheaper also. Skip this foot &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; and buy the microplane!</li>
    <li> I use this when I watch tv.  This gentle peel doesn&#x27;t work for tough callus, good for very smooth heal just for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Seems ok but I don&#x27;t notice much of a peel happening. The cream is gritty feeling, maybe it is mislabeled and is actually dermabrasion product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is gentle enough to be used on other rough skin areas, not just feet with excellent results. I stocked up after reading reviews about this being a hard to find item. Wish Amazon offered this on subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product at retail outlets anymore, so was pleased to find it on amazon.com. Apply to feet at night, sleep in socks, and roll off excess skin in the a.m. Also okay to use when scaly skin develops on elbows, arms, etc.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewer, I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding this favorite at retail outlets. I was worried that it was no longer being manufactured. I had a tube of this that lasted for several years. I only needed it occasionally and, after using a callus sander &amp; razor, it would really do the job on smoothing and softening my feet. I love it! The peeling, sloughing action convinces me that it&#x27;s removing old, dry skin and leaving conditioned, moisturized skin behind. So glad I found this here. No other foot creme I&#x27;ve used compares.</li>
    <li> I run anywhere from 30-50 miles a week and my feet really take a beating. I just finished using this product for the first time and I&#x27;m hooked! Before I started I had terrible, thick callouses on the balls of both feet. They were so bad they were actually painful to walk on. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of them no matter how hard I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a moderate amount and rubbed vigorously with my thumbs. I did this for several minutes and reapplied to keep the momentum going. The callouses are starting melting away. I then used my Ped-Egg and continued shaving away skin while the cream was still on my feet. All I can say is that this is a complete miracle product. Thanks Mom for recommending it!</li>
    <li> There is no scent of tea tree oil at all. All it has is a weird chemical scent. The peeling isn&#x27;t that functioning, either. After rinsing, it left a weird touch on the skin. There is a price sticker under underneath saying: $3.99 TJMAX....</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I thought it would be Had other \\&quot;peels\\&quot; and this one does not&lt;br /&gt;peel\\&quot;. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, and works well to exfoliate away the dead skin on your feet. Use with a foot file for even more exfoliation.</li>
    <li> My feet are quite calloused and this requires lots of time (30+ min) to make progress. I found sitting and letting the stuff soak in for a bit before rubbinf most effective.&lt;br /&gt;From another review I thought to try this on my face. I applied it all over and did some emails, then gently rubbed my hands on my face and loads of skin came off! Nasty but effective, and usually I have super sensitive skin and get rashes from almost everything, but this had no adverse effects whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this foot peel.  Smells so good.  Feels good.  And it works if you use it daily.  I have soft heels.  Received my product before the estimated delivery date and packaged securely.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would give me smooth feet, but I was disappointed.  It definitely takes major pressure to get the skin to begin rubbing off, but even then, it seemed as if the lotion was the only thing balling up and rubbing off.  My feet felt slightly smoother after, but certainly not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> this is not what I expected to receive.  I used to buy a product sold in stores that after you put it on your feet for a few minutes you would peel it off and it left your feet soft.  This product I thought was the same thing, but it feels more like a scrub and you have to wash it off, I will use it but I wish it was the product I used to use, I should of kept the container, maybe they don&#x27;t make it anymore? but it was a foot peel, at least the the delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  I always suggest that they order it.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not only does it gently remove dead skin from feet leaving them noticeably softer and smoother with each use; it does the same for rough hands.  No more excuses for your blue collar husbands!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works like a charm! Leaves feet extremely soft, even the worst areas. And can b used every day several times without causing damage.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe so many of the reviewers on here who give this product 4 and 5 stars have been so fooled. Do you remember when you were a kid and you put glue on your palm so it would dry and you could peel it off?  Only sometimes you were too impatient, and just started rubbing it off?  That&#x27;s what this lotion is like.  It&#x27;s got some kind of thickener in it, and when you put it on your skin and start rubbing it around, it turns pasty white, and eventually it comes off in little slivers.  Apparently this is designed to make you think that it is your skin sloughing off, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s just the lotion clumping up and peeling off.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to use on feet after washing and drying. Then I got the idea to use it  on dry spots on my thighs. Great!  Then, well, since it is a peel, tried in on my dried clean face.  OMG! Chemical peel with Alpha Hydroxy! Smooth and youthful skin where ever you want it!</li>
    <li> This stuff does exactly what it says. Great smell, great exfoliation. I used it on my elbows as well and it did great. Leaves your skin feeling smooth</li>
    <li> It came 2 days a go. I applied before took a shower and massage my heel, then took a shower and I never felt my heel smooth like this. Well, my heel...actually my feet very rough. Sometimes the skin cracked and bleed. Itchy and because itchy, very often I picked the skin..made them worse. I always shame with my feet, but this cream making them better.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days, my heel smoother and looks better. Still there rough part, but better. I hope one day I can show off my feet.</li>
    <li> Great smelling solution for dry and/or cracked heels and skin. Have used several times. Would definitely recommend. Glad I bought two tubes. Will order again.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastic. it truly works and you can use it daily. it does not over peel your skin off. it does what it is suppose to do and really is great</li>
    <li> I bought mine for $3.99 at Ross&#x27;s Dress for Less.  I use tea tree oil shampoo for my hair since tea tree oil is a great repeller of lice, fungi, bacteria, etc and has healing effects.  So I was looking for a foot lotion that would heal my feet and this lotion makes them soft &amp; smoother.  I really pound my feet during the day at work and arrive home with tired, sweaty, smelly, dirty feet, especially when I walk around the house barefoot.  After I take a bath, I put this on and my feet feel soft, cool, and less painful and it&#x27;s gentle, not stinging, as its packaging ad promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as the info on the back of its container says, it also \\&quot;works great for hands, knees elbows and other dry skin areas.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve rubbed it onto my dry sometimes mildly to moderately painful elbows and they have gotten much more softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has tea tree oil as a main ingredient and tea tree oil usually has a mediciny fragrance but not here - here, the fragrance is beautiful and subtle with a pleasant scent of peach/nectarine.  The Australian tea tree oil in it serves as a repellent to fungi, bacteria, etc, all of which contribute to dirty stinky worn out feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its backside packaging ad (my shared image #2) promises it&#x27;s made of the finest ingredients and the 1st one on the list is extracts of neroli, then tagette, then ylang-ylang, nutmeg, jasmine, cactus flower, aloe vera (which heals), chia, jojoba, peru balsam in purified water, other ingredients as well as vegetable glycerin, australian tea tree oil and alpha hydroxy fruit acid complex (to instantly roll away rough, dry skin) and tea.  There IS methylparaben and propylparaben in it but they&#x27;re LAST on the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not tested on animals and is packaged environmentally green. There ARE parabens but they&#x27;re listed on the very bottom of the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely it&#x27;s worth in price of gold, or ahem.......feet. I&#x27;d use it as an everyday lotion at home, a lotion at work &amp; traveling, and give it as a gift to all my family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.all my family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.</li>
    <li> The smell is addictive!  I have really rough, scaly feet, so I&#x27;ve found it best to let this soak in for a bit after a vigorous bout of pumice-ing.</li>
    <li> I agree with the &amp;#34;Emperor has no clothes&amp;#34; reviewer.  This stuff does nothing.  Glad I only paid $3.99 at Marshalls for it.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions every time, but all is does is dry and peel itself off!  None of my skin is removed.  My daughter tried is also with no favorable result.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was rated so highly by so many reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I continued massaging it on my feet LONG after what seemed appropriate.  Good thing that I did, because it didn&#x27;t work until the point that it was completely rubbed in.  Then, and only then, did I see the dead skin gently slough off as I continued to firmly massaged my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it three times now, and each experience has been the same.  It hasn&#x27;t worked the way I THOUGHT it would work, but it has definitely worked.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! It does not sluff off too much of the rough skin at a time, thank goodness, I have had other product do that and it makes for sore feet.  I love that it has tea tree oil, because it is a natural anti-bacterial.  All of the ingredients are natural and promote good health for my tootsies, and it smells wonderful.  It is like a pedicure and a foot doctor all in one tube.  I am finding as I grow older, meaning over 50,I need to take better care of my feet and have been experimenting with various products for 3 years now. I have tried the Avon foot care line, various soaking solutions, the foot files. They seemed to work at first but would not give any noticeable, CONTINUING, SUSTAINED improvement. This product does that. Nirvana for my tootsies.</li>
    <li> I have use this every day since I got it earlier this week, and I have gotten more effect from my pumice stone in one session. It was a complete waste of my money. I only gave it one star because the site won&#x27;t allow no stars. I would suggest this instead: [[ASIN:B000052XW5 Pretty Feet &amp; Hands Rough Skin Remover-Exfoliant, 3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> Such a great way to soften my hands and feet. Love the ingredients and the results</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find this again. This cream exfoliator is great. It actually makes the skin rub off after just a short period of time, without having to worry about a peel that is too severe. My heels are great after using this. I like it paired with the same brands lotion. It&#x27;s going to sound ludicrous, but I use this on my nose after I have a terrible cold. I get that dry skin after blowing my nose too much and a tiny dab of this take it right off. I know it&#x27;s for feet, but it&#x27;s a nice little side use.</li>
    <li> Love it does the job highly recommend</li>
    <li> works good, nice scent</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time last night.  I was amazed at how much dead skin was gently rubbed off in just the first application.  I also used it on my hands, as my palms were rough.  Afterward, I moisturized my feet and hands.  Very happy with this product.  I works!!</li>
    <li> The peel took a while to rub into my feet and start working, but the eventual results were impressive.  It took some patience, the dead skin on my hands and feet began to roll off.  Now they are soft and smooth.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells great but kind of weird to use. It starts out like lotion but as you rub it, becomes sticky and sort of like an elmer&#x27;s glue... It starts to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; up against itself and, in turn, starts to exfoliate by sloughing dead skin cells off with said &#x27;gluey sticky&#x27; property. Kind of cool. Works well on my feet but have also used it on my elbows and hands.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. After reading so many rave reviews I was excited to experience a baby smooth skin on my feet. Nothing came off. Was just like a scrub for me.</li>
