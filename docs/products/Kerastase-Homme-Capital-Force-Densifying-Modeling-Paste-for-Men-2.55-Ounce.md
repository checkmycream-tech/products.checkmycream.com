      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>Very good, I like the Kerastase products in general.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best of any other hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on it&#x27;s own and it&#x27;s excellent, but wanted to conserve due to the higher price point.</li>
      <li>Worth $25 easily!</li>
      <li>The guy that cuts my hair gave me some for free</li>
      <li>Even if you put a lot of this in your hair it stays light.  </li>
      <li>This leaves the hair natural looking, washes out like it&#x27;s nothing, and is GOOD for hair growth.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much about whether it makes hair look denser, but I suggest this no matter what your hair concern (buy this even for healthy hair).</li>
      <li>This paste is easy to apply and lasts a long time all while maintaining a very good hold while looking natural...</li>
      <li>Just FYI, this is very pasty/heavy (fine with me) and has a strong initial fragrance (wish it wasn&#x27;t so strong).</li>
      <li>Amazing hold without stiffness if applied when hair is dry.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, holds well, gives a shiny, yet natural look.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;OREAL should be ashamed of themselves for charging that much more for the same product targeted to men.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use Modeling paste.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get your hair right.</li>
      <li>solid product- applies and washes off easy, holds hair well and makes it look thicker all the while too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than american crew fiber but the cost factor is HUGEly different.  </li>
      <li>a new one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use very little of this mostly as a finish layer after applying Garnier Fructis Surf Hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used regular store hair product for years,  and this is a whole different level, and to me is absolutely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Natural look but holds well</li>
      <li>Wow, am I buying hair paste or caviar?  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband for the first time around December 2011, and even though he was a bit skeptical at first (before this higher brand one he liked his grocery story bee wax pomades and did not like the extra $ we were paying for this one), he is completely in love with this product now, he has said multiple times how easy it is to work with his hair which it is very thick and slightly wavy, and we like the fact that his hair does not look like it has much product on, but to the contrary it looks natural, shinny and not greasy or hard like other product used to leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>First, I don&#x27;t have thin hair--but you don&#x27;t really need thin hair to want to give it more body.  </li>

    <li> Natural look but holds well</li>
    <li> I bought this off eBay for $21.50 5 months ago and i&#x27;m almost done with it. I use very little of this mostly as a finish layer after applying Garnier Fructis Surf Hair. I&#x27;ve used it on it&#x27;s own and it&#x27;s excellent, but wanted to conserve due to the higher price point. What I love most about this paste is the scent. It&#x27;s the best of any other hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. If they made a cologne I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
    <li> its a bit expensive but it doesn&#x27;t take much to get your hair right. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it works for my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading a review in Esquire.  When I received it, I noticed that it was made by L&#x27;OREAL, so I compared it with L&#x27;OREAL Overworked Hair Putty.  Guess what, it&#x27;s essentially the same ingredients, except the L&#x27;OREAL brand costs $5.00.  So, do yourself a favor and save your $17.00 by buying the L&#x27;OREAL brand.  L&#x27;OREAL should be ashamed of themselves for charging that much more for the same product targeted to men.[[ASIN:B0014568CO L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line Overworked Hair Putty, 1.7 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I love this product. Smells amazing. Can&#x27;t get enough of it. Pricey. But a little goes a long way. One tub lasts approximately 2 months for me. Definitely would recommend. No flakes. No grease.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is used in conjunction with the Capital Force shampoo for men, it smells wonderful and does a great job adding volume to hair.</li>
    <li> This leaves the hair natural looking, washes out like it&#x27;s nothing, and is GOOD for hair growth. I can&#x27;t say much about whether it makes hair look denser, but I suggest this no matter what your hair concern (buy this even for healthy hair).</li>
    <li> Wow, am I buying hair paste or caviar?  I love this product but the recent markup has left me disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair gels/creams for more than 30 years.  This is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This was suggested to me by a hairstylist in Barcelona. I love the product. Easy to apply, holds well, gives a shiny, yet natural look. Holds well hold day. It also smells great, which makes applying it even more pleasant. I&#x27;ve used regular store hair product for years,  and this is a whole different level, and to me is absolutely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else not that I&#x27;ve tried this.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and won&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily. It would be 5 stars if the price dropped a little bit.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that provides awesome styling finish for your hair.  It is non-greasy and smells great!  Not too sure about the densifying effect but all-in-all, love it!</li>
    <li> Nice light hair product that isn&#x27;t crunchy or sticky.  Even if you put a lot of this in your hair it stays light.  I nice light to medium hold without getting sticky or crunchy.</li>
    <li> Best wax out there!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use Modeling paste. I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product for styling</li>
    <li> Its never sticky, crunchy, or too clay like! This paste is easy to apply and lasts a long time all while maintaining a very good hold while looking natural...no jersey shore gel, hairspray look here!</li>
    <li> First, I don&#x27;t have thin hair--but you don&#x27;t really need thin hair to want to give it more body.  This and Shu Uemura frame wax are the best hair waxes/pastes for men I have used (and frame wax is discountinued).  It&#x27;s hard to justify the cost though.  It&#x27;s better than american crew fiber but the cost factor is HUGEly different.  It is way over priced.  The guy that cuts my hair gave me some for free but I wasn&#x27;t going to pay the $60 they wanted when it was gone.*  *UPDATE*  They massively lowered their price!  It&#x27;s one of the top products!  Worth $25 easily!</li>
    <li> This non-sticky paste will keep your hair in place without turning your follicles into crispy little Han Solos. Fortified with a blend of amino acids and vitamins to fight against premature hair loss, it’ll also make your hair look thicker, fuller, and stronger.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like the Kerastase products in general.  Just FYI, this is very pasty/heavy (fine with me) and has a strong initial fragrance (wish it wasn&#x27;t so strong).</li>
    <li> solid product- applies and washes off easy, holds hair well and makes it look thicker all the while too.</li>
    <li> Amazing hold without stiffness if applied when hair is dry.  If applied when wet, simply running your hand though does the trick!  Great molding power with no stickiness</li>
