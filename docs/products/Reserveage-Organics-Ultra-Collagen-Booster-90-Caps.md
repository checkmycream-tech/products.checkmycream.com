      <li>Remarkable Product</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I believe this is a superior product that rejuvenates the skin.  </li>
      <li>Good service.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin</li>
      <li>Its great!, came in really quick 1 week and 1 day.</li>
      <li>They are a bit of a splurge/pricey, but my knees feel better and my skin looks great.  </li>
      <li>my hair is in great shape...and my skin looks better also..</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>and I wish my skin looked this good in my teens and 20s because my skin seems to be more balanced</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3-4 months &amp; my face has a nice rosy color again.</li>
      <li>I would give it five stars, but it is kind of on the pricey end.</li>
      <li>I have taken this product for quite a while and honestly cannot tell the difference.  </li>
      <li>I FOUND THIS.. AND IT IS VERY EASY TO SWALLOW, AND TAKE, ALSO..</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan and it took seeing results to get me there!</li>
      <li>Way too many pills to take and can&#x27;t say that I noticed a bit of a difference.</li>
      <li>but I look in better</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE HAVING THIS TO USE.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
      <li>BUT, my skin IS better.  </li>
      <li>, my skin started feeling plumper and more youthful.</li>
      <li>I love these vitamins.  </li>
      <li>Its ok May work better for somebody else</li>
      <li>The most noticeable areas, though, are my neck and the backs of my hands.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay....</li>
      <li>but I look in better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to call yourself organic for a lot of products which are not sufficiently regulated - but after reading through their website, their analysis and so forth -- I began to find this company credible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, you need to take these for many months to see full results.  </li>
      <li>It WILL improve skin tone, fine lines around mouth and eyes.  </li>
      <li>I am using this with their other product, Beautiful Legs, and love them both.</li>
      <li>And I have to say, at times when I am thinking about something and sort of rub my face, I am am amazed at how smooth and moist it feels.</li>
      <li>Too early to tell...need more time to see if this product is effective.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;d recommend that you keep a watch on the price on Amazon as it can fluctuate significantly.  </li>
      <li>With the Ultra Collagen booster, my skin starts to look more plump, radiant and softer halfway through my first bottle.</li>
      <li>Finally a product that delivers remarkable results.  </li>
      <li>Collagen is made in the intestinal tract naturally, but if you want to super size it and have a definite nutrition plan, this is an excellent source.</li>
      <li>I would recommend you take these for at least three months for best results...and then continue to take them if you like how you feel and what you see.</li>
      <li>But nothing extraordinary May Tracy differente brand</li>
      <li>when it was ordered I received it quickly.  </li>
      <li>Order arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>WELL WORTH TAKING..</li>
      <li>and I rarely get a pimple.</li>
      <li>Because of good care and genes, my facial skin has remained pretty youthful over the years; but I&#x27;d made the mistake for many years of not taking the same care of my neck as I did my face.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was my imagination or wishful thinking, but a young friend of mine who just turned 30 -- totally independently, commented on how good my skin looked - how fresh</li>
      <li>Like the product very much.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much .</li>
      <li>also am very much into organic, chemical-free, etc lifestyle</li>
      <li>I have placed a second order because I think you need to give it more than just a one bottle try.</li>
      <li>I recommend this collagen supplement even more than the regular collagen booster.</li>
      <li>The rest of me is also quite youthful and most people think I am 10-15 years younger than I am - which has been the case</li>
      <li>I became convinced that they were truly trying to produce products that were consistent with their philosophy as well as efficacious.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s prices have been better so the last two bottles were purchased from them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m most of the way through my third bottle of [[ASIN:B009NJQX8C Ultra Collagen Booster]].  </li>
      <li>go the lengths above to encourage you to assure yourself that my review here is authentic because it is a quite positive review of my experience with this product - and frankly -- I don&#x27;t trust reviews regarding products that claim to reverse some aspect of the aging process.</li>
      <li>so things were already pretty decent on that front.  </li>
      <li>really didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of results from this product but within 10 days</li>
      <li>I really do believe this works.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t really see any improvement or change in skin.</li>
      <li>and that is when I realized how much this supplement helped my nails grow.  </li>
      <li>My friends tell me I&#x27;m &amp;#34;glowing.&amp;#34; Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This is a legitimate, unsolicited, unpaid for review.</li>
      <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS ITEM..</li>
      <li>Even my nail and hair are growing at a much faster rate.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell any effect it has on my skin</li>
      <li>I am preoccupied with my partner&#x27;s declining illness - so I really haven&#x27;t thought much about</li>
      <li>The only thing I eve found to work is Retin A -- the straight forward prescription cream --- which was prescribed to me for a medical skin condition and to my surprise had an amazing effect, making my skin look healthier and clearer.</li>
      <li>I will see if it really works.</li>
      <li>These have really boosted my cells and my wrinkles are fading.</li>
      <li>Reservage sells their protein powder is in a form that would not be my choice for protein purity and muscle building but their reasoning is quite consistent with their philosophy for as natural a product as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The result was a neck that looked older than my face.  </li>
      <li>I continued to use it long after the original condition went away until it was used up and then stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>IT IS HIGH QUALITY, AND</li>
      <li>You can read my other 100 reviews over the last 10 years to reach your own conclusion as to the independence of my thoughts here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my whole adult life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also love their Green Tea Extract with Raspberry Keytones.</li>
      <li>My skin looks better than it has in a few years.</li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle in the healthcare section of our local organic and gourmet food shop.  </li>
      <li>My first bottle was at regular retail price ($52 - yikes!)</li>
      <li>I do not usually comment on products I try but have to rate this product a 5 because it truly delivers.  </li>
      <li>And I have started to wrinkle and sag a bit - consistent with someone 10 -15 years younger than I am .</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t look any younger -- I still look my 10-15 years younger than my true age -</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t look any younger -- I still look my 10-15 years younger than my true age -</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m in my early 50s,</li>
      <li>Organic French red whole grape (skin, vine, stem, seeds) (Vitis vinifera) full-spectrum polyphenol profile, USDA certified organic muscadine red whole grape (skin, vine, stem, seeds) (Vitis rotundifolia) and natural wild Polygonum cuspidatum stnadardized to contain a minimum of 100 mg of trans-resveratrol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>been taking it for a long time but don&#x27;t really know if it does all what it claims.</li>
      <li>And protein powder plays a major role in all that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Diarrhea on several occasions. After several days, I decided to consume only this product and again the diarrhea. I then soaked the capsule to compare the color. This product is the same color of the diarrhea.</li>
    <li> I have seen some plumpness in my face and others have asked me what I am using.  So I guess you could say it is working for me! I have been using for several months and plan to stick with it.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff when I have the extra funds. It is pricey so that is why I only gave it a 4 star. I do see that is seems to make my nails stronger when I use it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really see any improvement or change in skin.</li>
    <li> Way too many pills to take and can&#x27;t say that I noticed a bit of a difference. Really expensive and silly amount of pills to take in one day.</li>
    <li> Only used for about 3 weeks so I can&#x27;t really tell any effect it has on my skin but I am a believer in collagen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.... been taking it for a long time but don&#x27;t really know if it does all what it claims.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I would give it five stars, but it is kind of on the pricey end. Having said that, I feel as though my skin is glowing and my nails are growing stronger and faster! I have placed a second order because I think you need to give it more than just a one bottle try. The difference is seen when you use it for about three weeks. Three pills a day -- I take mine all at the same time -- and that&#x27;s it. No side effects, no tummy aches, no adverse reactions. I really do believe this works. My skin looks better than it has in a few years. It had a dullness to it, but no longer with the help of Ultra Collagen Booster! I will keep ordering this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a year. I am a huge fan and it took seeing results to get me there!</li>
    <li> product really works to reduce dryness in mature skin and keep wrinkles from getting worse.  Recommend to folks with dry, mature skin that has seen the sun and looks like leather.  This product helps reduce the leathery look.</li>
    <li> Its great!, came in really quick 1 week and 1 day.</li>
    <li> Collagen is made in the intestinal tract naturally, but if you want to super size it and have a definite nutrition plan, this is an excellent source.</li>
    <li> Love it !!!! Thank you very much .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m most of the way through my third bottle of [[ASIN:B009NJQX8C Ultra Collagen Booster]].  I bought my first bottle in the healthcare section of our local organic and gourmet food shop.  They have an extensive supplement section and their healthcare rep said the bottles were &#x27;flying off the shelf.&#x27;  Well, I&#x27;m in my early 50s, so time&#x27;s a&#x27;wasting on trying to keep my skin looking its best.  Plus if the rep wasn&#x27;t spinning a lie about *everyone* buying it, I hated to be the last to know about the secret to looking 20 again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s about 11-12 weeks later and unfortunately I still don&#x27;t look like I did when I was 20.  BUT, my skin IS better.  I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin so things were already pretty decent on that front.  What I noticed first, after a few weeks of daily use, is that my skin is firmer and sort of glowy.  The most noticeable areas, though, are my neck and the backs of my hands.  Because of good care and genes, my facial skin has remained pretty youthful over the years; but I&#x27;d made the mistake for many years of not taking the same care of my neck as I did my face.  The result was a neck that looked older than my face.  There is now a noticeable tightening and firmness there too.  Also, because I sculpt and oil paint, my hands are constantly in \\&quot;something\\&quot; and that, accompanied by sun exposure and frequent handwashing, had taken its toll.  It didn&#x27;t matter how much hand creme I used, the skin on the backs of my hands had become dry, thin, and starting to look a bit &#x27;crepey.&#x27;  Not any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about Ultra Collagen Booster is that it&#x27;s expensive.  My first bottle was at regular retail price ($52 - yikes!) which was pretty ridiculous for a one-month supply.  Amazon&#x27;s prices have been better so the last two bottles were purchased from them.  However, I&#x27;d recommend that you keep a watch on the price on Amazon as it can fluctuate significantly.  Sometimes the price is about $10 under retail -- other times it&#x27;s about $20 under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can take the capsules with or without food.  The recommended daily dosage of three vegetable capsules contains the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Longevity Resveratrol Blend(tm) (400mg): Organic French red whole grape (skin, vine, stem, seeds) (Vitis vinifera) full-spectrum polyphenol profile, USDA certified organic muscadine red whole grape (skin, vine, stem, seeds) (Vitis rotundifolia) and natural wild Polygonum cuspidatum stnadardized to contain a minimum of 100 mg of trans-resveratrol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BioCell Collagen: Hydrolyzed Collagen type II (600mg), Chondroitin Sulfate (200mg), and hyaluronic acid (100mg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermaval (500mg): VitaGranate BioActive Pomegranate Extract, asparagus concentrate, abelmoschus esculentus concentrate, Vita-Berry Tropical (coffea arabica concentrate, Brazillian acerola cherry, Amazon camu camu, sophora japonica concentrate, acai berry, mangosteen concentrate, maltodextrin, vegetable cellulose, rice bran, and silica.about $20 under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can take the capsules with or without food.

    <li> It is a very good product. It came on time. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Prior to using Reserveage my skin was getting very dull. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3-4 months &amp; my face has a nice rosy color again. My friends tell me I&#x27;m &amp;#34;glowing.&amp;#34; Highly recommend it!</li>

I continued to use it long after the original condition went away until it was used up and then stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br /&gt;I came across this company, Reservage, while searching for some biotin. My hairdresser said that I was showing signs of thinning hair around the hair line. I am female and though well past the age most women start dying their hair - for some reason I have no grey accept for a few strands here and there. The rest of me is also quite youthful and most people think I am 10-15 years younger than I am - which has been the case my whole adult life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even looking 10 -15 years younger, as I get older so does the 10-15 years younger version too. And I have started to wrinkle and sag a bit - consistent with someone 10 -15 years younger than I am . I am preoccupied with my partner&#x27;s declining illness - so I really haven&#x27;t thought much about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my hair dresser said I should start taking biotin -- that probably my nails were breaking easily as well -- which they were -- sometimes painfully so. He suggested going into any drug store or supplement shop and take any brand -- might as well get the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can never get the cheapest so I started doing research. I discovered that a lot of people break out with increased doses of biotin and as my skin is prone to breaking out -- I tried to find a product that came in smaller dosages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINDING RESERVAGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of them did -- that is until I came across this company which had a product with about half of the usual amount of biotin in its supplements (Keratin Booster.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am very much into organic, chemical-free, etc lifestyle so I decided to read up on Reservage. It&#x27;s easy to call yourself organic for a lot of products which are not sufficiently regulated - but after reading through their website, their analysis and so forth -- I began to find this company credible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What finally clinched it for me is that Reservage sells a protein powder in a certian form. I am big on physical fitness and lift weights and take a body builder approach to things though I am not a bodybuilder per se. And protein powder plays a major role in all that. Reservage sells their protein powder is in a form that would not be my choice for protein purity and muscle building but their reasoning is quite consistent with their philosophy for as natural a product as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I became convinced that they were truly trying to produce products that were consistent with their philosophy as well as efficacious. So I decided not only to buy the biotin product, Keratin Booster, but this product, Ultra Collagen Booster, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of results from this product but within 10 days, my skin started feeling plumper and more youthful. I thought it was my imagination or wishful thinking, but a young friend of mine who just turned 30 -- totally independently, commented on how good my skin looked - how fresh it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been taking the supplements ever since.  And I have to say, at times when I am thinking about something and sort of rub my face, I am am amazed at how smooth and moist it feels. I keep thinking it must be skin oilsand I forgot to wash my face but then I realize it is from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t look any younger -- I still look my 10-15 years younger than my true age - but I look in better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I definitely recommend it. It is expensive so it is possible sometimes to find it for less on various sites. I buy it up when I can.and I forgot to wash my face but then I realize it is from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t look any younger -- I still look my 10-15 years younger than my true age - but I look in better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I definitely recommend it.

    <li> I love these vitamins.  They are a bit of a splurge/pricey, but my knees feel better and my skin looks great.  You DO have to take three pills a day, so it may be hard for people who hate to swallow vitamins.  Also, you need to take these for many months to see full results.  I would recommend you take these for at least three months for best results...and then continue to take them if you like how you feel and what you see.</li>
    <li> These have really boosted my cells and my wrinkles are fading. I feel great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to use it. I will see if it really works. Iwill let you know</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I believe this is a superior product that rejuvenates the skin.  It WILL improve skin tone, fine lines around mouth and eyes.  I do not usually comment on products I try but have to rate this product a 5 because it truly delivers.  I am over 55 and report great results for Ultra Collagen. Finally a product that delivers remarkable results.  When I skip a few days I can defiantly see a difference.  Even my nail and hair are growing at a much faster rate. Remarkable Product</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS ITEM.. IT IS HIGH QUALITY, AND WELL WORTH TAKING..&lt;br /&gt;IT HAD GREATE INGREDIENTS IN IT.. AND I LOVE HAVING THIS TO USE.&lt;br /&gt;SINCE I WAS LOOKING FOR A HIGH-QUALITY COLLAGEN CAPSULE..&lt;br /&gt;AND I FOUND THIS.. AND IT IS VERY EASY TO SWALLOW, AND TAKE, ALSO..</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working.  Notice a difference in skin tone &amp; seems like my eyes are even brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product, affordable price...</li>
    <li> Good service. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this collagen booster for about 6 months as a way to help slow down the signs of aging (I am in my late 30&#x27;s) and noticed my hair growing faster which I didn&#x27;t need but welcomed. I recently had surgery and had to stop my vitamin regimen for just over 2 weeks and that is when I realized how much this supplement helped my nails grow.  I have thin, slow growing nails and would file or cut them down once or twice a week while I taking this supplement. When I stopped for those 2 weeks my nails barely grew and I never trimmed them during that time. I just recently started up again with my vitamin regime that includes this collagen booster and I will see if my nails starting growing again!</li>
    <li> Would not be without it....my hair is in great shape...and my skin looks better also..no side effects!</li>
    <li> Reserveage Organics - Ultra Collagen Booster 90 Caps&lt;br /&gt; It was what I wanted. when it was ordered I received it quickly.  I t was just what I expected</li>
    <li> I have taken this product for quite a while and honestly cannot tell the difference.  But then, I may look worse without it.  So, I keep taking it just in case.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my skin, and I think I have seen some improvement in my facial wrinkles and creases - but the biggest thing that I notice was that within a week the pain in my hands was gone!  I had pain in my index finger and thumb, on both hands, and it was progressively getting worse.  It ached at night, I was wincing when picking things up, and fumbled with things because the sharp pain would catch me off guard.  I have none of that now.  I still have a little joint swelling on my right hand index finger - I smashed it between two logs when trying to change a horse trail obstacle almost two years ago - but the pain is gone.  I have reordered, and plan to share with my mom who also has lots of pain in her hands.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> Order arrived quickly.  This has seemed to help with joint pain.</li>
    <li> Only 1 capsule a day. It works! No more year-long mild knee pain going up and down stairs!! It seems to be the synergistic tipping point in that I had been taking  1 MegaRed Joint Support and Now Foods Hyaluronic 2X Plus on alternate days, for nearly a year, with a bit of relief but after a month of Reserveage, the knee discomfort is totally gone and has not returned since mid-April. I have just reordered a 90-day refill.</li>
    <li> works great! add elasticity to the skin, face feels fuller and not as sallow around the eyes. takes a cpl weeks to see the difference</li>
    <li> Its ok May work better for somebody else i can see some improvment But nothing extraordinary May Tracy differente brand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it now I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> I have been taking these for several months.  Like the product very much. I will definitely reorder this product again</li>
    <li> Too early to tell...need more time to see if this product is effective.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t seen great results but I&#x27;ve only had one bottle.  I was hoping it would help with  a skin problem.</li>
    <li> I am using this with their other product, Beautiful Legs, and love them both. I re-ordered and see a difference in my skin. I also love their Green Tea Extract with Raspberry Keytones. Another product I recommend to clients who are dieting.</li>
    <li> I used the ReserveAge Collagen Booster for about a year with wonderful results on my skin and my joints (I have Fibromyalgia). I switched to Ultra Collagen Booster after about two months without taking anything. Needless to say that my skin reversed to it&#x27;s former dyer and dull state. I The main difference between ReserveAge Collagen Booster and Ultra Collagen Booster is how long it takes for the pills to start working. With the regular Collagen Booster I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement on my skin texture, joint flexibility, etc until after the second bottle (1 1/2 - 2 months) With the Ultra Collagen booster, my skin starts to look more plump, radiant and softer halfway through my first bottle. That is impressive. My skin looks and feels great now. I&#x27;m in my 30s now and I wish my skin looked this good in my teens and 20s because my skin seems to be more balanced and I rarely get a pimple. I recommend this collagen supplement even more than the regular collagen booster. It works faster!</li>
