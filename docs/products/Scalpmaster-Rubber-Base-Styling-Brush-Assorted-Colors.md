      <li>Would have liked to pick my color.</li>
      <li>so the Pros of this product is that it nicely priced and I got the brush within two days.</li>
      <li>This brush will do more damage to your hair than good.</li>
      <li>That says &#x27;denman style&#x27; its an ok brush.. but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was brought up on the bristled brush and used to think that was the brush for people of color, but I&#x27;m glad I got out of that stupid-thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>However, these type of brushes are okay.  </li>
      <li>Most brushes that I use does not hold up and it doesn&#x27;t even get to the roots of my hair.</li>
      <li>Still love this brush.</li>
      <li>and I have to I love it.</li>
      <li>This brush pulled my hair more than it untangled it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try to modify it and see if that makes it better.</li>
      <li>Does the job better than most brushes.</li>
      <li>I love this product and use it several times each week, it is great!!!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Does more pulling than brushing.</li>
      <li>All other brushes tear out our hair and this has been the best choice in brushes i have made in many many years!  </li>
      <li>More for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on my natural type 4 hair</li>
      <li>I always thought that the original brand is supposed to be better than the knock off&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I recieved my package in Houston very quickly.</li>
      <li>Love this...comparable to a Denman and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I will probably still get a TRUE Denman brush because I want my curls to be MORE defined.</li>
      <li>This one works just fine.</li>
      <li>it works fine.</li>
      <li>I like the sound it makes when you brush your hair.</li>
      <li>so I guess it&#x27;s my own fault for not paying attention to the trickery of what the title really says,</li>
      <li>I plan on buying a few more to go around as this is the perfect brush for our large family.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely in Christ,&lt;br /&gt;Leesa C.&lt;br /&gt;Eph.2:8,9</li>
      <li>When I blow dry my hair with this brush, my hair gets all staticy and fly away.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really see that happening though being how I am totally satisfied with this one, but if I do I&#x27;ll let y&#x27;all know.</li>
      <li>it was the actual Denman Brush which I have had for years and loved.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>I thought I was ordering a Denman or Demi hair brush that was great for natural hair and assisting with the natural curl pattern of your hair.  </li>
      <li>Well, I got the item quickly, so delivery from merchant was not the issue.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>this one!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely recommend to my friends and I&#x27;ll buy some more, too!</li>
      <li>Next time I see a bargain, I will be sure to read the fine print.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.</li>
      <li>Healthy, Long, and Strong.</li>
      <li>I am starting a hair journey with my girls and heard many wonderful reviews and actually used my sisters Denman brush a few weeks ago.  </li>
      <li>It makes detangling hair super easy, especially when used with a leave in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It is a well-made, very sturdy brush that is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This brush really does create a curl pattern!</li>
      <li>It works exactly as it should.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised-its a hard type of plastic but not damaging to the hair when brushing.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so large.  </li>
      <li>You live and learn, glad it was only $4 bucks.</li>
      <li>, I assure you the scalpmaster denman is much easier on the hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know the real Denman brush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to compare this Denman-styled brush to the real Denman.</li>
      <li>It shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Style is great but quality is poor</li>
      <li>I use it brush my 4c hair as part of my conditioning routine and not so much on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing about the Denman brush&#x27;s for some time and really wanted to try it.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and my husband has straight hair and we all use it.</li>
      <li>So I might buy the real one just to see.</li>
      <li>Good to have as a secondary brush though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of stiff but</li>
      <li>My hair is super thick and its able to get through and brush it out.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t use it on wet hair yet, but it smooths dry hair down perfectly.</li>
      <li>And I finally got my favorite color which is blue.</li>
      <li>My hair is a 4b/4c type hair, so getting any kind of curl pattern is hard.</li>
      <li>I love how the brush has a heavy feeling to it!</li>
      <li>First of all I&#x27;m glad this was only a few bucks I purchased 2 real Denman brushes at the same I bought  this wad of plastic</li>
      <li>its nowhere close to the same quality and results you get from a real Denman !</li>
      <li>Just okay in my book, Very heavy and does not glide through the hair like I like it too.</li>
      <li>its pretty much what I expected.</li>
      <li>The cons for me were since i have natural 4B hair</li>
      <li>I could never find one in the stores near me.</li>
      <li>I have thick coarse hair and it kind of pulls my hair.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s a decent brush, but definitely NOT a Denman.  </li>
      <li>I am African-American and have natural hair and was surprised and grateful at how fast this detangle and helped me to manage my tight curls.</li>
      <li>I actually gave my brush to a friend who is a newly natural.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the brush came apart, it was easy to put back together.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on our head and our hair; almost a little massaging on the scalp.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know the real Denman brush.  I love this one!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely recommend to my friends and I&#x27;ll buy some more, too!</li>
    <li> I found out about the Denman brushes from Terri LaFlesh&#x27;s book: Curly Like Me: How to Grow Your Hair Healthy, Long, and Strong. (you can also find that book on here.) What a great brush! My daughters, son and I have curly hair and my husband has straight hair and we all use it. It works exactly as it should. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug our hair to the point of damage and yet can withstand a lot of use. It is a well-made, very sturdy brush that is well worth the price. Which is a great bargain if you ask me. Before I ordered it here I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Walmart, Target and even the Dollar Store but couldn&#x27;t find a brush to suit our needs because they were either too expensive (the first three stores) or looked poorly made(dollar store). I plan on buying a few more to go around as this is the perfect brush for our large family.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely in Christ,&lt;br /&gt;Leesa C.&lt;br /&gt;Eph.2:8,9</li>
    <li> When I blow dry my hair with this brush, my hair gets all staticy and fly away.</li>
    <li> Well, I got the item quickly, so delivery from merchant was not the issue. The price was right too, but this type of brush just doesn&#x27;t work for my thick, easily-tangled, 4a hair. The brush tears my hair out (with water and conditioner in it). I will sitck with my current wash/condition routine using a wide-toothed comb.</li>
    <li> Not a true denman brush.  This brush has round tips that tangle your hair.  Not what expected.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Detangles well. I never tried the denman brush but this works for me.  Would have liked to pick my color.</li>
    <li> This brush is NOT a Denman brush, it is a Denman STYLE brush! Nonetheless, I use it when I&#x27;ve wet or washed my hair and it seems to help curl in my hair, but no more than what I already have. I will probably still get a TRUE Denman brush because I want my curls to be MORE defined. Good to have as a secondary brush though.</li>
    <li> I believe I made a mistake.  I thought I was ordering a Denman or Demi hair brush that was great for natural hair and assisting with the natural curl pattern of your hair.  It did not work like I anticipated.  However, these type of brushes are okay.  I like the sound it makes when you brush your hair.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a Denman, it&#x27;s a Scalpmaster Brush.  I absolutely hate when seller&#x27;s \\&quot;trick\\&quot; consumers into a purchase by including a popular brand name in their listing. It&#x27;s sorta like false advertising and very dishonest.  But, the title does say Denman \\&quot;Style\\&quot; Styling Brush, so I guess it&#x27;s my own fault for not paying attention to the trickery of what the title really says, even though \\&quot;style\\&quot; is a common term in grooming hair, thus it IS misleading.  The title should&#x27;ve included \\&quot;imitation\\&quot; or something along those lines.  Anyway, it&#x27;s a decent brush, but definitely NOT a Denman.  I give the brush 3 stars; the seller 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Since my review, the seller has updated the title of the brush... Good job seller!  If only you had done that before I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Nice colors! I never liked this style of brush, until I see a lot of natural hair people recommend it for detangling &amp; smoothing. I haven&#x27;t use it on wet hair yet, but it smooths dry hair down perfectly. This is a knockoff &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; of a Denman brush I&#x27;ve read. But having never owned a Denman brush. This one works just fine. And priced half of an actual Denman..</li>
    <li> Just like a denman brush, just cheaper!</li>
    <li> I recieved my package in Houston very quickly. I&#x27;ve been hearing about the Denman brush&#x27;s for some time and really wanted to try it. My hair is a 4b/4c type hair, so getting any kind of curl pattern is hard. This brush really does create a curl pattern! I&#x27;m extremely pleased!    Update: I actually gave my brush to a friend who is a newly natural. I purchased a Denman BRAND brush....and I hate it! The scalpmaster Denman is sooooooo much better! I always thought that the original brand is supposed to be better than the knock off&#x27;s, I assure you the scalpmaster denman is much easier on the hair. I&#x27;m ordering another one for myself to replace the Denman brand brush.</li>
    <li> The brush works very well at detangling my thick coarse hair. My only complaint is that the brush came apart, it was easy to put back together. Does the job better than most brushes.</li>
    <li> This was a big brush.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so large.  But it is a denman brush nonetheless.  It shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t break, thank you</li>
    <li> Tried to use this just once. It hurt my head so bad and didn&#x27;t get my tangles out so I immediately put it down. I&#x27;m going to try to modify it and see if that makes it better. If not I hate this brush. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it was cheaper than an actual Denman brush. BIG MISTAKE! This brush pulled my hair more than it untangled it. I have 3c curls and this does not work well for me. I wish I would&#x27;ve just spent the money to get the Denman brush. Now I know.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for, husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I just received my order a few days ago and I have to I love it. And I finally got my favorite color which is blue. The brush is hard which I really need for my head,m because every time I brush my hair this brush save the day. Wahoo. Still love this brush.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;m glad this was only a few bucks I purchased 2 real Denman brushes at the same I bought  this wad of plastic its nowhere close to the same quality and results you get from a real Denman !Never again will I buy a brush from this company again !This brush will rip your hair out it causes horrible tangles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush!  It makes detangling hair super easy, especially when used with a leave in conditioner.  Its a must have for a beauty junkie.</li>
    <li> Item as described and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay CLOSE attention to the description. That says &#x27;denman style&#x27; its an ok brush.. but almost kinda cheesy- the brush head came off while brushing-- thankfully.. its slides back on</li>
    <li> these are \\&quot;Denman Style\\&quot; brushes...they are not Denman&#x27;s.  They are real heavy...I am so dissappointed.  Next time I see a bargain, I will be sure to read the fine print.  I will have to throw these out or use them on my dogs.  Even at a bargain price they are a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was brought up on the bristled brush and used to think that was the brush for people of color, but I&#x27;m glad I got out of that stupid-thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family and I have dry and overly kinky (tight) curls not relaxed. So to minimize breakage, pops and pings, I&#x27;d comb our hair only when wet and with conditioner in it. When I use that technique in combination with this Denman-styled brush it is AMAZING! Detangling is a breeze. My little girl was tender-headed, but not anymore! It&#x27;s gentle on our head and our hair; almost a little massaging on the scalp. No snagging either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this brush is so low in price. But I&#x27;m not complaining! Very glad I got it before they choose to raise the price (if they are thinking about doing so). I&#x27;d like to compare this Denman-styled brush to the real Denman. So I might buy the real one just to see. But I don&#x27;t really see that happening though being how I am totally satisfied with this one, but if I do I&#x27;ll let y&#x27;all know.</li>
    <li> My mom used to use this brush on our hair when we were little girls and i tell you i am glad to be using it!!  All other brushes tear out our hair and this has been the best choice in brushes i have made in many many years!  I&#x27;m even giving on away to friend, she will love it!</li>
    <li> I am starting a hair journey with my girls and heard many wonderful reviews and actually used my sisters Denman brush a few weeks ago.  It was a firm brush but the bristles were massaging to the scalp - this brush IS NOT that!  I do not think &amp;#34;Denman Style&amp;#34; should be a part of the product title as there is no comparison in quality.  This brush is extremely heavy and hard ... it is equivalent to the black handled, heavy scissors vs. cutting shears. Seller should specifically &amp;#34;this is not a Denman&amp;#34; ....</li>
    <li> Just okay in my book, Very heavy and does not glide through the hair like I like it too. Not bad.</li>
    <li> The brush I received was not what I expected.  It has the round tips on it which gets tangled in my hair.  I though, based upon the picture, that it was the Denman brush without the rounded tips on it.  Not too happy with this one.</li>
    <li> This is not a Denman and they are wrong for using the wording in the description period. It is hard, plastic and makes my hair snag. You live and learn, glad it was only $4 bucks.</li>
    <li> This has rubber tips on Brussels,real Denman brush does not.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised-its a hard type of plastic but not damaging to the hair when brushing.  I use it brush my 4c hair as part of my conditioning routine and not so much on my scalp.  My hair is super thick and its able to get through and brush it out.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 years ago thinking it was the Denman brush but it&#x27;s nothing like it and does noting for kinky curly hair. I Only use it for brushing wigs now.</li>
    <li> Now if i would have read this page like i should have i would have seen this was not a denman brush but a \\&quot;Denman Style\\&quot; brush as they stated so that was my oversight.&lt;br /&gt;Ok so the Pros of this product is that it nicely priced and I got the brush within two days. The cons for me were since i have natural 4B hair the pins in the brush actually got caught and twisted in my after one brush. It could be because that it has 9 rows but after that literal hair snag i haven&#x27;t tried it since.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was the actual Denman Brush which I have had for years and loved. It is not. It rips out my hair and takes forever to detangle. This brush will do more damage to your hair than good. I have thick, tangly 3b, 3c hair and trust me this brush is a nightmare.</li>
    <li> I am African-American and have natural hair and was surprised and grateful at how fast this detangle and helped me to manage my tight curls.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Quick delivery. A+</li>
    <li> The teeth are too tight for my hair. Does more pulling than brushing. More for fine hair. Not useful to me.</li>
    <li> Love this...comparable to a Denman and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a denman for the longest. I could never find one in the stores near me. The real ones on Amazon where kinda expensive and so where other sites when you add in shipping . This is a great alternative!!!! I love how the brush has a heavy feeling to it! It works just like a regular denman! I would happily order again. Works great on my natural type 4 hair</li>
    <li> I got this for my hair (nappyside) and ohhh boy do I love it! I was disappointed in the fact that you actually get one brush and not three as shown in the picture. However, after trying it out in my hair that didn&#x27;t matter at all.</li>
    <li> Brush came apart after only a few uses and my was already entangled with a wide tooth comb. Style is great but quality is poor</li>
    <li> I was expecting a different brush that did not have the little balls on the end of it. I almost send this brush back to amazon. However, the brush did do the job.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it several times each week, it is great!!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> False advertising! Brush is nothing like a Denman. Plus, photo shows 3 brushes, only received 1</li>
    <li> Not the denman brush I was expecting should&#x27;ve ordered 4 rolls instead of 9 rows</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of stiff but its pretty much what I expected.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t dislike it but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  I have thick coarse hair and it kind of pulls my hair.  After I get it together it works fine. It didn&#x27;t break so I&#x27;m good with that.  Most brushes that I use does not hold up and it doesn&#x27;t even get to the roots of my hair.</li>
