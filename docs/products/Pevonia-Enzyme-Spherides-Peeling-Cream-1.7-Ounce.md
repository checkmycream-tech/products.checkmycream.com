      <li>Way better price than you would find at the spa.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and love the product!!</li>
      <li>Wonderful way to keep dry, flaky skin under control.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Its mild, but effective.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure this works just fine.</li>
      <li>This product gives a quick result, is easy to use, and is effective.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve continually ordered this since becoming licensed.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and I will purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to use as directed to see results.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product, even for sensitive skin!!!</li>
      <li>I love the whole pevonia line!</li>
      <li>In doing so, I notice immediately after washing off the cream that my complexion appears lightened and my skin fresh!</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this product, and have used it since trying it first at the Spa at Hotel Hershey more than 5 years ago.</li>
      <li>I have tried philosophy, Kate Sommerville, Murad, Dermalogica, Burt&#x27;s Bees - multiple higher end skin care lines and many from the drug store as well and this has worked the best for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Pretty high price for something that just smells good.</li>
      <li>It has kept my pores clean without drying out my aging skin.  </li>
      <li>skin doesn&#x27;t always stay acne free, but this surely allows me to have days that skip the whole makeup routine from time to time.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this is one GREAT exfoliating product, quick to use, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very reactive , sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and I will probably reorder when I run out.</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin feel fresh and soft.  </li>
      <li>Simple but effective</li>
      <li>This is a very gentle enzyme cream mask, it doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, and it is so easy to use in the shower</li>
      <li>Only takes 2-3 minutes to \\&quot;process\\&quot; which makes it that much easier to squeeze into busy schedules, and the product performs beautifully.</li>
      <li>and it has my face smooth and super soft ....</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and my face feels so soft after use.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use it properly (check the pevonia website if you need to or talk to your aesthetician).</li>
      <li>When I first bought it</li>
      <li>One jar can last me more than 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I watched the video on the pevonia website, so I applied it exactly as directed (water and rubbing activate enzymes).  </li>
      <li>In any case, I first learned about this product when I was in school to become an esthetician</li>
      <li>Shouldn&#x27;t be used more than twice a week as there are some heavy duty ingredients, but using it less often makes it work more effectively anyway.  </li>
      <li>On time shipping and, brand new!!</li>
      <li>Very highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth and I really notice a difference in texture when I use it religiously.</li>
      <li>Plus shipping is so fast.</li>
      <li>I really like Pevonia products.</li>
      <li>It is thick, rich and easy to use.</li>
      <li>and i noticed a difference almost instantly after using it but even more so the next day......</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>&quot; and then to \\&quot;wet fingertips again and work the product into a light foam\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I stumbled on Pevonia a few years ago and just love it.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this product ages ago during a facial.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how soft and radiant my face was after just one treatment with this cream!</li>
      <li>Did not do what it said, despite following directions exactly, I noticed no visual difference whatsoever, maybe because i&#x27;m a man and men&#x27;s skin is much thicker, that could be the reason</li>
      <li>This peeling cream has made a huge improvement in the overall appearance of my skin, however the most noticeable difference is that with regular use, I see that it is fading the small red spots that had remained on my skin since high school when I had a short bout with acne.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; allergies &amp; used this product for over 10 years.</li>
      <li>Wow is all i have to say.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and used the pevonia roseacea line for quite a while.</li>
      <li>I always follow it with aromatherapy sensitive skin oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had problematic skin, with much thanks to my parents, (my mother and father both suffered from acne, but my mom had cystic acne as a teen!)</li>
      <li>I find if I use this product every other week or whenever my skin needs a &#x27;pick-me-up&#x27; just before an important event, it will last longer that way.</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
      <li>Such soft, clear skin in just one use!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second jar and have a third one ready in reserve.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sooo appreciated other customer reviews on Amazon, that I too am trying to pass on to others helpful feedback.</li>
      <li>doesnt turn sensitive skin red or dry it out</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i have always had problem skin but even more so around &amp;#34;that time of the month.&amp;#34; I read the reviews and i am soooo happy i did. This stuff is amazing....doesnt turn sensitive skin red or dry it out and i noticed a difference almost instantly after using it but even more so the next day......this stuff is a miracle. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Not really a mask, since it doesn&#x27;t work by sitting on your face.  I watched the video on the pevonia website, so I applied it exactly as directed (water and rubbing activate enzymes).  I wasn&#x27;t impressed, and my face really needed exfoliation.  I think it did something, there was no tingling or stinging.  Won&#x27;t buy again, probably won&#x27;t even finish the tub.</li>
    <li> Wonderful way to keep dry, flaky skin under control.&lt;br /&gt;You own mini-facial at home.&lt;br /&gt;A great product to include in your skin care regime.</li>
    <li> used before, it is an excellent product for face exfoliating, just works great and leaves the face smooth and feeling good.</li>
    <li> I can tell a definite difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. Be sure to use it properly (check the pevonia website if you need to or talk to your aesthetician). I just bought my second jar. I use it every 2 or 3 nights. When I first bought it I used it once or twice and didn&#x27;t feel like it made a difference, but after a facial and learning how I&#x27;m supposed to use it, and using it regularly, it has become a permanent step in my routine. I love it and highly recommend it. By the way, I have oily/sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wow is all i have to say. Literally works miracles in one day. I usually use it in the shower after the steam opens my pores a bit. Such soft, clear skin in just one use!</li>
    <li> I really like Pevonia products. It calms my skin. I also love the speedy delivery of my package. (two thumbs up!!)</li>
    <li> I stumbled on Pevonia a few years ago and just love it. I have extremely sensitive skin and used the pevonia roseacea line for quite a while. I have struggled with finding an enzyme or exfoliating treatment that doesn&#x27;t leave me just raw with red skin. This is a very gentle enzyme cream mask, it doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, and it is so easy to use in the shower (jump in, let the steam work for a minute, put it on, let it sit for a couple minutes, rinse it off). This and the Pevonia C Complexe are the two skin care items I splurge on. I have tried philosophy, Kate Sommerville, Murad, Dermalogica, Burt&#x27;s Bees - multiple higher end skin care lines and many from the drug store as well and this has worked the best for me and my sensitive skin. I would suggest this product to anybody. A little bit of this goes a long way so it lasts quite a while if using two times per week.</li>
    <li> I have tried a ton of different products for my sun damaged skin.  Nothing works like this.  I began getting facials in the salon and then realized they sold it on line. It works just as effectively at home.  Your skin will glow after just one use.  Shouldn&#x27;t be used more than twice a week as there are some heavy duty ingredients, but using it less often makes it work more effectively anyway.  Can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problematic skin, with much thanks to my parents, (my mother and father both suffered from acne, but my mom had cystic acne as a teen!) and I was unlucky in the gene pool to inherit every last bit of it. In any case, I first learned about this product when I was in school to become an esthetician and I&#x27;ve continually ordered this since becoming licensed. It says on the directions to \\&quot;leave on for 2 minutes\\&quot; and then to \\&quot;wet fingertips again and work the product into a light foam\\&quot;. I cannot stress this portion enough! In doing so, I notice immediately after washing off the cream that my complexion appears lightened and my skin fresh! This absolutely helps in warding off the dull complexion without over-working your skin. I find if I use this product every other week or whenever my skin needs a &#x27;pick-me-up&#x27; just before an important event, it will last longer that way. One jar can last me more than 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t always stay acne free, but this surely allows me to have days that skip the whole makeup routine from time to time. Give it a try even if you don&#x27;t have acne problems. With normal or maturing skin, it gives a beautiful dewy complexion.</li>
    <li> I received the order and I enjoj using the peeling cream every time when I use it it make my skin fresher and much younger looking</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. Smoothes your skin. Smells great while doing it.  I found this at a spa when try used it during a facial and I gad to gave it.</li>
    <li> my wife actually bought this..she uses this 2x a week and loves it..on her 4th jar now..great price here.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice peel ..I use it twice a week and it has my face smooth and super soft ....I apply and then use my finger with water and work it in ..And then leave on for 2 mins... Simple but effective</li>
    <li> Bought this after it was recommended by a spa where I had a facial .  It has kept my pores clean without drying out my aging skin.  I also think my pores seem smaller .  I am impressed !</li>
    <li> Pevonia moisturizers are great, but the peels are not that effective.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. Plus shipping is so fast.</li>
    <li> This peeling cream has made a huge improvement in the overall appearance of my skin, however the most noticeable difference is that with regular use, I see that it is fading the small red spots that had remained on my skin since high school when I had a short bout with acne. This product gives a quick result, is easy to use, and is effective. I cannot believe how soft and radiant my face was after just one treatment with this cream! I use it twice a week now, and I could not be more pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great to use to get rid of blackheads. .  I have been using it for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; allergies &amp; used this product for over 10 years. When I use it my complexion looks brighter &amp; hydrated. I always follow it with aromatherapy sensitive skin oil. Very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, even for sensitive skin!!! I love how it makes my skin feel fresh and soft.  Buy two or three!!</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes. I don&#x27;t see how this cream can be considered a peeling cream. It smells great, dries like a mask but I don&#x27;t see any peeling or skin turnover and I&#x27;m using it regularly. Pretty high price for something that just smells good.</li>
    <li> made me break out. i wanted so badly for this to work and I stuck it out as long as i could. ended up tossing it. money wasted</li>
    <li> I really LOvE this peel...easy to use and results are what is advertised! I will continue to buy this product, and have used it since trying it first at the Spa at Hotel Hershey more than 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> Did not do what it said, despite following directions exactly, I noticed no visual difference whatsoever, maybe because i&#x27;m a man and men&#x27;s skin is much thicker, that could be the reason but I still expected to notice something .  Smell is also quiet overpowering!</li>
    <li> On time shipping and, brand new!!</li>
    <li> I love Pevonia products, but this one is my favorite.  It&#x27;s important to use as directed to see results.  The smell is great and the results are noticeable almost immediately.</li>
    <li> This cream gives my skin just the boost it needs. It is thick, rich and easy to use. Brow minutes and rinse, that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Way better price than you would find at the spa. Happy with this item</li>
    <li> I use this product on my elbow and knees and I am very happy that this works.  I&#x27;m a little bit scared to use this on my face as I have a very sensitive skin and .... I can&#x27;t take the chances.  That&#x27;s just me but I&#x27;m sure this works just fine.</li>
    <li> Went to a spa in Florida. Loved the Pevonia line for combination skin. Found this mask especially helpful for cleaning out your pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sooo appreciated other customer reviews on Amazon, that I too am trying to pass on to others helpful feedback. Anyway, this is one GREAT exfoliating product, quick to use, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very reactive , sensitive skin. AND does what it promises!  I&#x27;m on my second jar and have a third one ready in reserve. Only takes 2-3 minutes to \\&quot;process\\&quot; which makes it that much easier to squeeze into busy schedules, and the product performs beautifully. Keeps annoying, flaky areas from appearing with regular use.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and love the product!!</li>
    <li> This product works like magic. The spa that I go to for a facial uses &amp; recommends this product. Makes my face feel refreshed</li>
    <li> Pevonia makes wonderful products.  This is the same product that is used when I get a facial at the spa.  It is easy to use, and my face feels so soft after use.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product ages ago during a facial. It exfoliates without using anything harsh or grainy so there is no risk of irritating or widening pores. It also smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works well and will purchase again. I use 1x a week.</li>
    <li> Usually buy at a spa for $45.  Great deal, great product.  Skin feels so much better immediately!  I love the whole pevonia line!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s money well spent. One of the best exfoliants I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Combined with the dry skin mask it&#x27;s like a facial in a jar.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used to expedite the healing of skin.  I use it as a spot treatment for breakouts and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It delivers just as described.  My skin feels smoother and softer with a nice healthy glow.  It is easy to use and I will purchase it again.  Best price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliator! Unlike other exfoliators, this cream doesn&#x27;t have the abrasive beads in them so you won&#x27;t risk damaging your skin.
