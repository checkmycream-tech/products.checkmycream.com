      <li>/&gt;have a great day!</li>
      <li>To start off the Dryer...is just Great!!!</li>
      <li>dryer just feels great in your hand!  </li>
      <li>So, this dryer seemed like a perfect match for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is the best one my family has owned.  </li>
      <li>Its a novel ideal.    </li>
      <li>The three heat setting with the two speeds are a great feature.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer works great.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>This is a great blow dryer, but it&#x27;s just that, a blow dryer.       </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great dryer, then try this one, but if you&#x27;re buying it for the gadgets, I&#x27;d keep looking.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the dryer itself is great.</li>
      <li>It did however make my hair feel and look great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The dryer in itself a very nice dryer.</li>
      <li>Using the conditioner for the Healthy Infusions Pro wasn&#x27;t very successful.</li>
      <li>So this was a pleasant surprise.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall its a good product, good results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The blow dryer itself is good</li>
      <li>and the grip is good.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time managing my hair, even as I&#x27;m hoping it looks good.  </li>
      <li>Someone at Amazon should know that the people at VINE are ripping off the good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>idea in theory; not so good in execution.</li>
      <li>Would love to give a great review for the product, but it was never sent to me.  </li>
      <li>The color and shape of the dryer is good, and the buttons are positioned nicely.  </li>
      <li>If you want a blow dryer that works great and dries you hair quickly, this is it!  </li>
      <li>I tried the dryer with the conditioning strips and it did feel smooth and silky but don&#x27;t be fooled -repeated heat will cause damage to your hair and eventually compromise the cuticle which leads to split ends and fly aways.</li>
      <li>I liked the smell of the conditioner</li>
      <li>The conditioner did help the comb go through my hair easier and smelled nice.</li>
      <li>what kind of &#x60;chemicals&#x27; are in it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice color, and suitable for men or women.</li>
      <li>Well, the hype sounded really cool; however, the reality wasn&#x27;t as great.</li>
      <li>A light pleasant scent indicates the conditioner is working;  </li>
      <li>I would have liked the swivel cord feature Wahl has on their Healthy Infusion Straighter.</li>
      <li>After having an old hair dryer for years, this dryer was a very welcome relief.  </li>
      <li>I love the settings and the balance of the dryer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the Healthy Infusions keeps me thinking.</li>
      <li>Manipulating it to style your hair requires more dexterity than I possess.</li>
      <li>But I am glad it works for my hubby...</li>
      <li>The instruction booklet lists an eight-step process in order to get the most out of the conditioning cartridge.</li>
      <li>Even the smell wasn&#x27;t that appealing.  </li>
      <li>The Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro hair dryer goes beyond just drying your hair.</li>
      <li>Ok...</li>
      <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the conditioner cartridge with comb.  </li>
      <li>Okay hair dryer;</li>
      <li>I do love the built in stand.  </li>
      <li>Wish it had a better design, and ease of use was better.</li>
      <li>I also liked the hands free feature.</li>
      <li>I love the side screens</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my purchase, and my bargain price.  </li>
      <li>When I saw the feature called, \\&quot;ionic conditioning\\&quot; to &#x60;reduce static and deliver nutrients&#x27;, I rolled my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I am sure Wahl could come up with some revolutionary products.</li>
      <li>With all the sleekness and sophistication of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, this will look downright sexy just sitting on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you like your hair tools to look designer, then you&#x27;ll love this hairdryer from Wahl.  </li>
      <li>Its got a nice sleek look, but that isnt what is important.</li>
      <li>This blow dryer has more gimmicks than a food processor.  </li>
      <li>I have been through many, many accessories</li>
      <li>This dryer works well, fast, and leaves my hair looking very nice.</li>
      <li>Very convenient to use..the cord length is very nice.  </li>
      <li>The cartridge comes in its own protective case when not in use and has a soft and pleasant scent of coconut.</li>
      <li>This requires products that are quickly effective, and easily used, and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and easy to use and is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In theory this does sound interesting.  </li>
      <li>The hairdryier works great, leaving your hair soft, silky and manageable.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight however, which makes it more comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>The handle is easy to hold and the switches are really easy to turn off and on.</li>
      <li>Better to use your own, good conditioner and then blow dry using the comb</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s so much easier and more effective to infuse your hair with a styling mousse or hair treatment product.     </li>
      <li>and it went fine on my hair.  </li>
      <li>, it gets to be a huge fuzz ball.</li>
      <li>and the conditioning was light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The conditioning is light.</li>
      <li>Three kinds of conditioning are available:  </li>
      <li>a scale from 1 to 10 in sound level and drying strength, both are about a 6.</li>
      <li>This is inserted into the conditioning cartridge which will have you pulling your hair out trying to \\&quot;fit it\\&quot; on the end of the dryer</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a light weight blow dryer this is not the one.</li>
      <li>This will undoubtedly help keep the dryer powerful, as the ease of cleaning means it&#x27;ll happen more</li>
      <li>conditioning attachment seems to be the important feature, so with that in mind</li>
      <li>It would be great to see an all-natural conditioner, although I do see the challenge in that given the conditioner becomes solid in the cartridge when the cartridge cools</li>
      <li>It has three heat settings (cool, warm, hot) and two speed settings.  </li>
      <li>There is no substitute, so if the company cannot supply the refills, the dryer will not be very useful.</li>
      <li>The cool setting is especially great since it doesn&#x27;t make him overly hot or dry out his skin.      </li>
      <li>As a basic hair dryer, it&#x27;s good, better than good actually.</li>
      <li>It is not user friendly.  </li>
      <li>Despite, overall a good rating for an innovative idea and a powerful, well-designed dryer.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure: I received a free sample of the product to review but was not paid nor otherwise compensated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite, overall a good rating for an innovative idea and a powerful, well-designed dryer.</li>
      <li>My hair feel smooth and looks straight, and I just had to use the medium setting as they suggested which is better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works well, and it&#x27;s great to have so many choices, high, medium, and low and even the cool shot.</li>
      <li>Overall a good quality product.   </li>
      <li>Use the cool shot button to help style your hair.    </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ve got a much more reasonable product.</li>
      <li>It has a nice sturdy feel to it, but is not heavy at all.    </li>
      <li>One thing I really, really like about this dryer:  it is designed so that you can stand it on end, rather than taking up precious sink space laying on</li>
      <li>/&gt;The comb attachment is a bit sharp and it greatly extends the length of the dryer nozzle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly adequate hair dryer, but you don&#x27;t need all these frilly, non user-friendly attachments.  </li>
      <li>Better to have a simple, better balanced, dryer and use a separate conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are 3 different heat settings, (cool, warm, hot) which is a very useful function.  </li>
      <li>Overall Id say the dryer has a nice quality, knock the price off about $15 and take off the conditining strip</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This is a powerful blow dryer.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I chose this item because my hair could really use it. My stylist is always giving me bad news-breakage, frizz, etc. But my fine, naturally wavy hair goes straight under the weight of regular conditioners, which means I don&#x27;t use them as often as I should. So, this dryer seemed like a perfect match for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the dryer is good and powerful, and the vents, placed at the sides of the dryer don&#x27;t pull your hair in and burn it like a past dryer of mine did when the vents were on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really fabulous feature is that the dryer vents are metal plates with holes punched in them rather than wire mesh, which is so very difficult to clean. These plates you can simply wipe off. This will undoubtedly help keep the dryer powerful, as the ease of cleaning means it&#x27;ll happen more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioning is light. Part of this will be due to my fine hair texture, which dries quickly. If you have thick hair, you may want to be more careful about how much conditioner you put on. My hair was dry before it could possibly be over-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did look a bit less frizzy than it usually does and the conditioning was light. My hair had plenty of lift when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has a cool shot button for setting hair, and multiple heat and power settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice color, and suitable for men or women. It&#x27;s a semi-metallic, tannish gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety feature: an overload button that pops out and stops the device when necessary. It is easily reset by pressing the button back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The improvement after conditioning was not dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb attachment is a bit sharp and it greatly extends the length of the dryer nozzle. I hit my scalp with it a few times while drying and the sharp comb hurt a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit unwieldy. It&#x27;s a two-hand operation. You have to hold the dryer in one hand and your hair with the other; otherwise the stream from the dryer blows your hair around and it doesn&#x27;t stay in the comb. (If your hair is particularly short, this may not be an issue for you, but the sharp comb might.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some concern with the heated conditioner because it contains paraffin. There have been questions raised about this being unhealthy in candles (hence the soy candle movement), and the conditioner is close to your face so you&#x27;d be breathing it, but since so little comes out at a time, perhaps this is not a great concern. However, I don&#x27;t know for sure one way or the other. That would be something people would consider before using the conditioner as it is. It would be great to see an all-natural conditioner, although I do see the challenge in that given the conditioner becomes solid in the cartridge when the cartridge cools down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle comb needs to be removed, or at least the cartridge, when you&#x27;ve had enough conditioner. It&#x27;s not a problem for me because of my hair texture, but I&#x27;ve decided not to use it and have found it a bit difficult to remove. If you have nice thick hair, I can see how taht would be troublesome to have to remove it during each drying session. I&#x27;ll probably use traditional conditioners, but the dryer itself is fantastic and I&#x27;ll be using that for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite, overall a good rating for an innovative idea and a powerful, well-designed dryer. This alone should carry the product. I&#x27;d definitely buy the dryer as it is heavy, easy to clean, and powerful.articularly short, this may not be an issue for you, but the sharp comb might.)

    <li> If you want a blow dryer that works great and dries you hair quickly, this is it!  After having an old hair dryer for years, this dryer was a very welcome relief.  My hair which used to take forEVER to dry with my old dryer dried within a few minutes with this Healthy Infusions Dryer.      However, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the conditioner cartridge with comb.  First, the comb was very awkward to use.  The way you have to angle it in order to comb your hair was unnatural and not the way I would normally comb my hair while drying it.  I really had a hard time combing my hair with this thing, and therefore it was difficult to get the conditioner in.    I liked the smell of the conditioner and it went fine on my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if I used too little conditioner, as I see some had difficulties with the conditioner being waxy, but it made my hair soft and shiny.    I like it, but maybe something a little more user-friendly would make the comb attachment easier to use.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I have a very expensive, very powerful blow dryer, and I was extremely apprehensive to even try this one out. I have fairly long thick, curly hair, and it&#x27;s coarse to boot. I have had it straightened, but there&#x27;s no way I can get away with not blowing it dry to keep it shiny with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My normal routine takes about 45 minutes. I have to divide my hair into sections, and hold each part taut with a circular (or flat) brush and keep rolling it as it dries, so it stays straight.  I was told that I should use high heat, and make sure that it&#x27;s bone dry before I quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo, I took out this blow dryer and figured I would give it a try, and probably have to rewet my hair and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it took me 15 minutes to blow dry my hair , and it would&#x27;ve taken 10 if I hadn&#x27;t gone over each part again just to make sure. My hair feel smooth and looks straight, and I just had to use the medium setting as they suggested which is better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have tried hair dryers with comb attachments, and they have been disastrous. All they&#x27;ve done is blow around the hair not in the comb, and not dry taut the hair that was. But this was different. The hair still blew a bit around the comb, but not much, and even though it didn&#x27;t feel like it would, the comb was really able to keep the hair taut enough to dry straight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few things to say as far as criticism -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The comb attachment was hard to connect to the dryer - it took me a few minutes and I gave up trying to take it off. (I&#x27;m planning on keeping it attached anyway so no big deal for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The conditioner was okay, but a little gimmicky. I only used it for a few minutes, and decided that I didn&#x27;t need it. Better to use your own, good conditioner and then blow dry using the comb alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s a little too easy to accidentally push the control buttons while holding and using the dryer, and I found that I kept having to put the speed back to high and the temperature to what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Using the comb attachment gets your hair very straight, so if you want any curl, you need to use something additional to curl the ends. (And if you want really silky, you may still want to add the use of a ceramic flat iron.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I would give less than a 5 star rating for something that had these problems, but on the whole, they are minor AND THIS DRYER REALLY WORKED. I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those of you with hair like mine.to put the speed back to high and the temperature to what I wanted.    4) Using the comb attachment gets your hair very straight, so if you want any curl, you need to use something additional to curl the ends.

    <li> This is an easy to handle hairdryer that allows you to blow dry your hair and condition it at the same time thanks to a special conditioning cartridge and comb with ionic conditioning. If you want to condition your hair while drying it and are willing to buy a new conditioning cartridge each month or two than this is the hairdryer for you. I found the feature a bit of a hassle to use but if you really want to condition your hair while you dry, it works fine.    The instruction booklet lists an eight-step process in order to get the most out of the conditioning cartridge. In abbreviated form the process is:    1. Towel dry your hair to remove excess water;  2. Insert the conditioning cartridge;  3. Start the dryer on high heat and high fan;  4. Keep the airflow moving through the hair and use the comb feature to detangle your hair;  5. After one or two minutes start combing your hair. A light pleasant scent indicates the conditioner is working;  6. Comb through your hair strand by strand so the conditioner is evenly distributed;  7. After a desirable amount of conditioner is applied switch to medium or low to avoid heat damage; and,          8. Use the cool shot button to help style your hair.    It takes a bit of practice before you evenly distribute the conditioner. Maybe it was me but it took a few uses before I felt I was using the conditioner properly. It is important to start the dryer on high heat and high fan to get the conditioner ready for use. The conditioner works like other conditioners I have used.     The instruction booklet is a 12-page fold out with drawings explaining how to fully use the comb and conditioner. It is hard having to foldout the entire booklet and turn it over and over again to look for something in the instructions. It would have been much easier to offer a booklet with  individual pages so if you are not sure about how something works you can just go to that page. Real pictures would help as well. Customer satisfaction depends on using this correctly so the instruction booklet should have been much easier to use.         Other special features include a hanging hook and hands-free position so you can place the hairdryer on its&#x27; back while you dry your hair. I have yet to figure out how the hands-free position really would work.     The hairdryer came with one moisturizing cartridge for dry or color-damaged hair. You can also purchase a smoothing cartridge for hair with split ends and an extra body cartridge for limp or fine hair. The instruction book states that each cartridge lasts between 10 and 30 uses.</li>
    <li> If you like your hair tools to look designer, then you&#x27;ll love this hairdryer from Wahl.  With all the sleekness and sophistication of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, this will look downright sexy just sitting on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the coolest thing about this dryer is that they&#x27;ve moved the air intake vents to both sides of the dryer.  I thought the dryer would try to suck my hair into the vents, but because the vents are so large and there are two, instead of the traditional single on other dryers, the suction is quite minimal and this dryer didn&#x27;t try to eat my hair at all.  I love that they added a rubber \\&quot;stand\\&quot; where the old air intake is on traditional dryers, this makes this dryer super easy to leave in a standing up position, which is great when the end is hot and needs to cool down before storing away.  This feature is being marketed as a means for hands-free drying and for those with short hair, I&#x27;m sure this is a useful feature.  My hair is way too long to be dried in this hands-free fashion with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer just feels great in your hand!  The weight is very evenly distributed throughout the length of the dryer and you can tell this is not some $10 dryer from some bargain store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the straightening comb, I find it completely useless.  The teeth in the comb are spaced too far apart to pull my fine hair taut.  Also, the coverage area of heat when the comb is attached is really small.  This would take a lifetime to straighten my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot really comment on the conditioning cartridge because I cannot tell a noticeable difference between when it is clamped into the unit and when it isn&#x27;t, except that it stinks a little.  The advantage, however, is that you don&#x27;t have to waste money on resupplying conditioning cartridges, since they appear to have no effect/little effect on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great dryer, then try this one, but if you&#x27;re buying it for the gadgets, I&#x27;d keep looking.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair dryer.  The quality of the materials used can be felt as soon as you pick it up.  It has a nice sturdy feel to it, but is not heavy at all.    There are 3 different heat settings, (cool, warm, hot) which is a very useful function.  Sometimes it just gets too hot when you are blow drying your hair, and need some cool air constantly.  No need to always depress a button to get cool air.     The dryer is very powerful and blow dries hair and other stuff fast with the high setting on.      I even used this to dry my puppy after a bath.  The cool setting is especially great since it doesn&#x27;t make him overly hot or dry out his skin.      The conditioning cartridges last up to 20 times, and is the selling point of the dryer..but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference using those and conditioner in the shower.  It does take a bit of time before you can use the conditioner attachment as it needs to be heat up first, so don&#x27;t expect to just pop it in and use it if you are in a rush.        It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you do get quite a lot of features with it compared to a standard dryer.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One thing I really, really like about this dryer:  it is designed so that you can stand it on end, rather than taking up precious sink space laying on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioning cartridge works as advertised, but only if you have paid very careful attention to the instructions.  If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up with a thick layer of gunk in your hair.  You have to warm the cartridge, dry your hair on a heat setting for a few moments, then switch to a cool setting.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think the benefits of using the cartridge outweigh the unpleasantness of blowing cold air on my wet head, especially as I shiver through getting ready for work on a dark winter morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge head is not removable, so if you want to use attachments such as a diffuser, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good idea in theory; not so good in execution.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this once it arrived!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fastest dryer I have tried&lt;br /&gt;No smell after the first few uses (you know that smell of the coil&#x27;s getting hot???)&lt;br /&gt;Small and Compact&lt;br /&gt;Comb Attachment&lt;br /&gt;3 Heat Settings&lt;br /&gt;Cool Shot&lt;br /&gt;Has a stand for \\&quot;Hands Free\\&quot; operation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;NONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this for $50! It is a win-win for any buyer!</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of hair to dry, or you want it done quickly, this is the hair dryer to use.   The Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro hair dryer goes beyond just drying your hair. It offers 1875 watts of drying power using a three stage heater and a powerful 2 speed blower. This dryer moves a lot of air and can put out an overabundance of heat.  In addition, the kit includes an attachment to separate your hair and apply a conditioner as you dry. Three kinds of conditioning are available:  a moisturizer (included), a smoothing conditioner, and an enhanced body conditioner can be ordered separately.  Even without the conditioning cartridge, the built-in ionizer helps prevent split ends.</li>
    <li> The comb attachment with the insertable conditioning tube is the primary selling point of this otherwise ordinary hairdryer. The attachment pops on and off like any other hairdryer attachment. It is basically a long white plastic comb with a hole to insert the conditioning cartridge, which is about the equivalent to the size of a cigarette lighter. The cartridge comes in its own protective case when not in use and has a soft and pleasant scent of coconut. When I used the hairdryer with the conditioning comb attachment, the long angled contour of the comb made me nervous that I could poke my scalp. It just did not work for me ergonomically, especially when in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw minor evidence of conditioning when using the attachment, but overall I just wanted to avoid using it. Perhaps if a person had very long, thick hair, this product would be a better option for them. I would have liked to see a standard nozzle attachment included for more versatility, but mine came with no other attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale from 1 to 10 in sound level and drying strength, both are about a 6. It is lightweight however, which makes it more comfortable to use. This product is decent for the right person, but it didnt have the features that are important to me.</li>
    <li> I like this hairdryer only as a hairdryer.  The comb attachment is unwieldy and I prefer to brush my hair with an actual comb than deal with the comb attachment, even though I have medium length hair.  I also dislike the conditioning comb, as I find it equally unwieldy.  However, I do like the power of the hairdryer and found it to dry my hair relatively quickly.  I own several other hairdryers, and I found it to be more \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; feeling than the Conair models that I own, however, the construction feels cheap and uncomfortable to hold in comparison, the buttons were easy to push accidentally while drying my hair, and the cold-shot is lukewarm.  I would only purchase this as a regular hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great. I have very thick and wavy hair. The three heat setting with the two speeds are a great feature. I am not completely sold on the conditioning stick. It did not disburse evenly.It still held conditioner at the end of the stick and the middle was gone.The conditioner did help the comb go through my hair easier and smelled nice. I will use the dryer without the conditioner. I also liked the hands free feature. It made it easier to style my hair.I would have liked the swivel cord feature Wahl has on their Healthy Infusion Straighter.Overall a good quality product.   Mrs. Rhodeymark</li>
    <li> The pros: As a basic hair dryer, it&#x27;s good, better than good actually. It feels very solid in your hand, has heat settings that actually feel different, and is very powerful. My hair is super thick, and this dryer can dry it as fast or faster than any I&#x27;ve ever tried.    But this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t just claim to be a basic hair dryer. It claims to be different because of its \\&quot;healthy infusions\\&quot; cartridge and attachment.     The attachment is clunky, and it takes away from the convenience and fast drying that you get without it. Also, it&#x27;s so much easier and more effective to infuse your hair with a styling mousse or hair treatment product.     Instead of the fancy infusion attachment, I would have preferred a diffuser. If it had that, then I&#x27;d definitely recommend this hair dryer because of its power and solid construction.     Full disclosure: I received a free sample of the product to review but was not paid nor otherwise compensated.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this dryer for a few times before I reviewed it. I&#x27;ve had it now for almost a month and I personally haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my hair after using it. I usually use Nexxus products so I haven&#x27;t seen the benefit of the cartridge. The cartridge says its suppose to last for 30 drys but that&#x27;s an overestimate and they are very pricey once they are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer in itself a very nice dryer. It&#x27;s very powerful and easy to use and is very easy to use. It&#x27;s a little expensive though for a dryer but I gave it three stars because of the simplicity of use.</li>
    <li> Ok...I have a TON of hair, and naturally curly hair at that, which if not blown dry correctly, it gets to be a huge fuzz ball. Needless to say I was very excited about trying out this hairdryer with the \\&quot;conditioner infusion strip\\&quot;. I have purchased probably 10-15 hairdryers in the past 7 yrs that claim to not make your hair frizzy,etc...but its honestly all in how you use it and the hair products you use...and this hair dryer is no exception. It is sturdy, somewhat heavy, it has 3 buttons for heat, and a cool shot, like most standard hair dryers. I first used the conditioning strip that came attached to the dryer...well...that was a huge gross mess! My hair felt waxy and looked sick. I instantly, rewet my hair, tried to get the conditioning \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; off of my hair and removed the conditining straightening piece. I used it as a regular hairdryer and it works fine, just like any other dryer. I do like that it has this piece on the bottom where you can stand it up.Instead of just lying it on the counter. Although I have brackets in my bathroom closet that I hang my dryer and straightener on... it was still a neat addition.  Its got a nice sleek look, but that isnt what is important. Overall Id say the dryer has a nice quality, knock the price off about $15 and take off the conditining strip and you&#x27;ve got a much more reasonable product. I do not recommend using that strip to anyone with naturally curly hair. It also pulls your hair and doesnt feel very pleasent.</li>
    <li> I thought this hair dryer was going to be heavier but it wasn&#x27;t which is a plus considering it takes me about an hour to dry my hair. I tried the dryer with the conditioning strips and it did feel smooth and silky but don&#x27;t be fooled -repeated heat will cause damage to your hair and eventually compromise the cuticle which leads to split ends and fly aways.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer has more gimmicks than a food processor.  It has three heat settings (cool, warm, hot) and two speed settings.  There&#x27;s a little button hat turns hot air into cool air (when you hold it for several seconds).  It&#x27;s not the lightest of hair dryers so they invented a little stand so you can set it upright for hands-free drying (I don&#x27;t know how anyone would use this).  The big sell here is the \\&quot;conditioning cartridge\\&quot; with options for &#x60;moisturizing&#x27;, &#x60;smoothing&#x27; or &#x60;extra body&#x27;.  I have no idea what kind of &#x60;chemicals&#x27; are in it.  This is inserted into the conditioning cartridge which will have you pulling your hair out trying to \\&quot;fit it\\&quot; on the end of the dryer and when you try to \\&quot;pull it off\\&quot;.  It is not user friendly.  Plus, I highly doubt the &#x27;30-day&#x27; cartridges do something any hair conditioner couldn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a gimmick and a rather troublesome one at that.  The comb attachment did allow me to dry my hair into a buzz cut or flat on the sides, but to be honest; I just blow it all over and let it fall where it does.  I suspect women with long hair might like the cool drying setting with the heavy, thick-toothed comb to prevent tangles, but you can do that with any dryer and a brush.  When I saw the feature called, \\&quot;ionic conditioning\\&quot; to &#x60;reduce static and deliver nutrients&#x27;, I rolled my eyes.  It&#x27;s a perfectly adequate hair dryer, but you don&#x27;t need all these frilly, non user-friendly attachments.  This was a hard sell, especially with the price.  My advice is to go simple - like you probably already are.</li>
    <li> Well, the hype sounded really cool; however, the reality wasn&#x27;t as great. The hair dryer works better than some that I&#x27;ve had, so I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it. It does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the conditioning part... Well, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using that. It is not easy to attach and then it makes the hair dryer bulky and awkward. I mean, think about it... The comb is positioned on the end of the barrel of the hair dryer. Manipulating it to style your hair requires more dexterity than I possess. Plus the comb attachment is fixed in just one position and doesn&#x27;t rotate. Maybe I will eventually get used to it. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... Okay hair dryer; not so keen on the infusion.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best one my family has owned.  We have two others in the house, but everyone uses the Wahl.  Very powerful breeze, lots of settings, can be put down on counter so that my wife and kid can use both hands to style while it stands up and blow dries their hair.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Using the conditioner for the Healthy Infusions Pro wasn&#x27;t very successful. At first if was hard to get the attachment on the dryer and it seemed very cumbersome to use.  In addition, it took at least two wasted minutes for the stuff to work and by that time much of my short hair was already dry, defeating the purpose of the conditioner coming out of the dryer.  Even the smell wasn&#x27;t that appealing.  Perhaps someone with long hair would like it more. I think the time spent conditioning is wasted since  applying conditioner in the shower is easier.    The dryer is a little heavy, but work perfectly well without the attachment. The color and shape of the dryer is good, and the buttons are positioned nicely.  It works well, and it&#x27;s great to have so many choices, high, medium, and low and even the cool shot. However, I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money to get this dryer since I don&#x27;t like the attachment and the conditioner.    Overall the design is an interesting idea, though not very successful. I will use the dryer without the attachment.</li>
    <li> After using this hair dryer for a little while I&#x27;ve realized that I&#x27;m increasingly choosing to let my hair air dry rather than pull this out.  That&#x27;s a bad sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In theory this does sound interesting.  My hair is thinning, so anything that could help prevent more damage is definitely something I&#x27;m willing to try out.  It&#x27;s not altogether thin, and it&#x27;s still able to be styled, keeping me from shaving it close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usual process isn&#x27;t that long.  I&#x27;m a guy, and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time managing my hair, even as I&#x27;m hoping it looks good.  This requires products that are quickly effective, and easily used, and comfortable.  I don&#x27;t want to think about the process, I just want to get through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the Healthy Infusions keeps me thinking. To heat up the conditioner takes a bit of time, and by the time it&#x27;s going my hair is dry. Over-drying for the sake of getting a little help isn&#x27;t really helpful in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the added piece makes the dryer particularly lengthy, and unwieldy. The dryer isn&#x27;t particularly heavy, maybe lighter compared to other dryers of the same size.  But the length makes it awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment is a bit tricky to put on, and the comb is not particularly helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the dryer itself is great. I love the settings and the balance of the dryer.  The featured &#x27;stand&#x27; is a bit of exalted worded. Basically, this consists of a couple of rubber bars on the back that allow the dryer to balance while sticking mostly straight up. Presumably, this is helpful for those with really long hair.  Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioning attachment seems to be the important feature, so with that in mind I gave this dryer 3 stars.  It probably is most effective for those with long hair and who have long hair drying regimens.  For those who don&#x27;t, this dryer adds a lot of extra bother.  Better to have a simple, better balanced, dryer and use a separate conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth it to put in a lot of extra work just to help this dryer do what my hands could do a lot easier.f extra work just to help this dryer do what my hands could do a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I specifically have been using this blow dryer to dry my 5 year olds hair after having it washed.  She&#x27;s got really long, thick hair and is not a fan of having it dried.  We were both thrilled when her hair dried in a much shorter time and the heat wasn&#x27;t too hot to burn her scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on gimmicky items and I felt like this fell into that category.  I don&#x27;t use the added features on this blow dryer like some people might.  Basically I just want to plug it in and use it.  The handle is easy to hold and the switches are really easy to turn off and on.</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer, but it&#x27;s just that, a blow dryer.       Pros:     This is a powerful blow dryer.    I do love the built in stand.  Just rest the blow dryer on it&#x27;s back.  You can use it as a hands free dryer if you can get low enough to it.  It also has a convenient loop to hang it on a hook.      I love the side screens, they prevent my hair from getting sucked into the blower and motor.        Cons:    Expensive for just a blow dryer.    I didn&#x27;t find the conditioning attachment to be of any advantage, it&#x27;s too bulky for such an attachment and very inconvenient to use.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair either.  Maybe, that comes with using it in time.  Don&#x27;t buy it for this feature.    The blow dryer is a little on the heavy side for me.  I&#x27;m a small person.     It didn&#x27;t come with any additional attachments.      You&#x27;ll have to buy additional cartridges for this thing in the future.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer itself is good but I am not sure I would use the conditioner part again. I don&#x27;t care for the smell and I don&#x27;t feel it did much for my hair. The dryer itself works very well and has enough power with 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings. I would recommend the dryer just not the conditioner add on.</li>
    <li> It was a little difficult to use.  I had a trouble getting the attachment attached.  Then, since the comb is horizontal across the opening it was awkward pulling it through your hair before it blows it away.  It did however make my hair feel and look great.  My hair has short layers which is the reason I think I had trouble. I feel it would be much easier to use if you have long hair. You are supposed to take the conditioning strip out of the attachment and cover it until you use it again.</li>
    <li> Would love to give a great review for the product, but it was never sent to me.  Someone at Amazon should know that the people at VINE are ripping off the good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have a great day!</li>
    <li> If there is one thing I know it&#x27;s about hair care products. I have been through many, many accessories and I know right away if one will work for me or not. This one did not.   I like the idea of being able to put a serum on your hair as you blow dry it, but I like to choose my own products because I know exactly what works on my sometimes dry, frizzy hair. The serum that comes with the blow dryer wasn&#x27;t enough, or thick enough for what my hear needs.  I also did not like the length of the hair dryer. It became very awkward to use on the back of my hair and I felt like my arm had to be about 5 inches longer in order for the blow dryer to work well.  When I tried to use this with a brush, again it felt awkward and I couldn&#x27;t get a grip on the dryer and the brush.  I used this dryer once and I probably won&#x27;t ever use it again.</li>
    <li> The product is a simple to use hair dryer with a plastic comb that fits over the nozzle.  The various heat settings and blower strengths add to versatility.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this blow dryer for $19 at Big Lot&#x27;s store.  I like it and it did come with 5 conditioner cartridges so i am please.  I feel I got a good deal since every other site list it for over $30.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer at Big Lots for $19.00.  I thought I was picking up a run of the mill hairdryer, I was mistaken.  I brought it home, open the box and realized my purchase was not what I had thought.  I figured I would use it as a regular dryer and not worry about the conditioning part.  Upon my first use I changed my mind and gave the conditioning part a try.  It was kind of awkward to use.  I finally worked it out by using my round brush along with it.  I could not believe the results, silky, manageable hair. Wow.  I have had Keratin treatments at salons that cost $100&#x27;s of dollars, I feel this gives you a very similar effect.  I am pleased with my purchase, and my bargain price.  Wish it had a better design, and ease of use was better.</li>
    <li> Ok...I just got another Hair Dryer...got this when i didnt really need one...This is going to be in my guest room...Ok...Now I always thought of Wahl to me more into hair cutting appliances...So this was a pleasant surprise.    To start off the Dryer...is just Great!!! If wahl has to sell only the dryer too I would pay this price as its a pretty powerful dryer ..Its not as heavy as most other dryers...Very convenient to use..the cord length is very nice.  and the grip is good.    Now as for the Conditioning cartridge....Between myself and my hubby...He finds using the cartridge like adding wax to set his hair...which is really not so bad considering he has difficult hair..but for me...its a big nooo nooo..besides after my hair rebonding treatment I really stick only to one brand of conditioner. It somehow didnt work for me..I hate to admit that...But I am glad it works for my hubby...He is not really a metrosexual...So he had to be coaxed into trying this..    I think Wahl should come up with miniature versions of these with hair styling gel dispensers etc for men...Its a novel ideal.    For the concept..Kudos to Wahl...With a few changes here and there..I am sure Wahl could come up with some revolutionary products.</li>
    <li> The hairdryier works great, leaving your hair soft, silky and manageable. the instrucions to place the conditioner cartridge are easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad side.....it&#x27;s a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The operation buttons are treaky because they are located where you place your hand to handle it, due to this sometimes the fingers touch the&lt;br /&gt;buttons and the temperature or the speed gets changed, so this is a little unconfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good product, good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> This dryer works well, fast, and leaves my hair looking very nice. But I am not sure it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I was attracted by the idea of conditioning while I dry my hair, because I am always looking for a way to streamline my toilette. I was especially attracted by the extra-volume version of the conditioner, but I have not been able to try that version yet(see below). The standard conditioner does work well for me, and I WANT to like this dryer better than I do.&lt;br /&gt;What are the drawbacks? First, it is awkward to use. The on-off switches are located exactly where I want to hold the handle, so I keep turning it off accidentally. Second, the comb on the end is very odd, and I am still not sure if I am using it correctly; it feels very awkward. Third, unless you use the dryer daily, you are supposed to remove the conditioning cartridge, which means re-assembly each time you dry your hair (and also looking for the cartridge, which is usually hiding behind something else in your medecine cabinet). Fourth, the dryer is considerably more expensive than a typical hand dryer, and there is the continuing cost of buying more conditioning cartridges. (Of course, you no longer need to buy conditioner, so that partially offsets the cartridge cost.) But, finally, when I tried to re-order the cartridges, they are out of stock and and have been for several weeks. There is no substitute, so if the company cannot supply the refills, the dryer will not be very useful.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a light weight blow dryer this is not the one. But if what you want is smooth hair and spending less time doing your hair, then this is the product for you.</li>
