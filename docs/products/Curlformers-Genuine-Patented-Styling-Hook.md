      <li>This one pulls apart way too easily.</li>

      <li>It arrived on time and the quality is fine.</li>
      <li>glad I ordered the real curlformer hooks because the knock off one that came with my knock off curlformers is very cheaply made and kept coming apart.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s good to have more than 1 hook - not only for back-up, but to save time.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
      <li>Not like our original one.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not as flimsy as the original I have</li>

      <li>I will load 3 hooks at a time or asks someone to do it, the process seems to go much quicker with more hooks.</li>
      <li>Thanks:)</li>

      <li>And quick delivery.</li>
      <li>The tip did not perform adequately.</li>
      <li>I have absolutely nothing but kudos for this product!!</li>

      <li>This tool is pretty neat and can work well if you know what you are doing.</li>
      <li>Broke the first day.</li>

      <li>Very sturdy!</li>
      <li>It was my first time using it, but I would recommend it to anyone.</li>

      <li>Makes application very easy and hook is very long.</li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and makes the curling process so much easier and faster!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work with the curlers!!</li>
    <li> Hook comes in 2 pieces that easily snap together. Seems like its sturdy and won&#x27;t easily break. My only complaint is that once it is put together it is too long to store in the package with the curlers. If they could have made it foldable or snap apart again it would better.</li>
    <li> This hook works good. It was my first time using it, but I would recommend it to anyone. I liked the results!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  However, the curls are impossible to dry quickly by air or with a hand held dryer.  Not comfortable to sleep with.</li>
    <li> Worked great ... no problems.  Matter of fact, I bought a second one ...</li>
    <li> Sturdy and smooth, the only two qualities that matter.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. worked perfect!</li>
    <li> This Curlformer hook is the real deal. It is better than the hook that comes with the knock off sets on Amazon. The end of the hook is plastic and does not covered with the rubber that some hooks have on the end. This is much better because it helps the hook to slide through the Curlformer better - it does not get stuck. After several uses I have not had any issues with the hook at all. Love my Curlformers and my Hook!</li>
    <li> Makes placing curlformers a breeze once you get the hang of it..follow instructions carefully....can be taken apart (splits in two) for easy storage..</li>
    <li> It catches the hair and comes apart quite often.</li>
    <li> They grip way better than the ones that came in the 40 pack formers. I love it.</li>
    <li> This did exactly what I was afraid it was going to do, got stuck in the mesh. I just didn&#x27;t think it would happen on the third curler! Unless you are super carefu, and by super careful I mean you have someone else do this for you, you will get the hook pulled through the mesh and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to extricate it yourself. they definitely need to rethink design on this product.</li>
    <li> Found the whole system of curling my hair this way is quite difficult and goes way too curly.  Something that I may have quite a learning curve with.</li>
    <li> Great item. Very sturdy. I bought this item in 2011 .... and it is now 2015 and it is still holding on strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece and she loves it. She has been doing everyone&#x27;s hair to rave reviews. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product and useful.</li>
    <li> The Entire Curl Former Idea is Amazing. If you&#x27;ve seen the many video reviews of the product line on youtube, I know you probably agree with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this hook along with two packets of short wide curl formers as an alterntaive to buying the starter kit sold on amazon [[ASIN:B003JMYU20 Curlformers Salon Kit]] for $69.99. You do not need to spend $69.99 to try this product out. Just do as I did and buy the components you need separately and save $30.00. Both the hook and each package of curl formers came with very helpful directions. In addition, as I mentioned before, there are numerous videos on youtube demonstrating how to use these tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With respect to this specific product, I really have no complaints. The hook can snap apart at the middle in order for more efficient storing and it&#x27;s made of a pretty sturdy plastic material. It does exactly what I expected/wanted it to do. And most importantly, my hair looked adorable.</li>
    <li> Not sturdy enough.  The tip did not perform adequately. It kept bending out of shape and my hair would become unhooked as I tried to pull it through the curlformer..  The plastic needs to be made of metal or a harder plastic that won&#x27;t bend so easily.</li>
    <li> You need this to get your curlformers to work</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t need this. One comes with the kit. This one pulls your hair out also.</li>
    <li> The first time I used the curlformers I was afraid I was going to break the hook and the second time I tried to use them it broke on the first curler. If you have short hair, it might be easier to do this without breaking the hook, but my hair is about 5 inches below my shoulders and using this hook hurt, pulled out some of my hair and ultimately failed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying this on long hair.</li>
    <li> The Curlformer Hook does not snag your hair, very easy to use. I would recommend over the hook that comes with the vakind set :)</li>
    <li> I am super disappointed with this hook. I have very dense thick hair but I&#x27;ve been using curlformers successfully for awhile now. The first time I tried to use this hook with my curlformers it just kept separating where the two parts are meant to join together no matter how thin of a section I made. If you have dense or thick hair..I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wand.</li>
    <li> No problems found with this product. It arrived in a timely fashion and worked as described. I was even able to use it with another brand.</li>
    <li> I love how much more sturdy this curl former hook is than the actual hook that came with my rollers. I have absolutely nothing but kudos for this product!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery. It arrived a lot faster than expected. Works well. I was a little disappointed in the curlers sticking to the rubber grip at the end though. Made it a lttle awkward to maneuver up the rod.</li>
    <li> Goood. Price ok And quick delivery. Its free delivery</li>
    <li> Be sure to order a few extra of these to go with the curlers.  Especially if you have little helpers - they can break pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Very good buy. Totally worth the money! I would so buy this curlformer hook again . It works perfectly!  Nice</li>
    <li> Broke almost instantly. I do have long hair, but never got past 3 curls and it bent and broke</li>
    <li> I ordered a knock off set of curlformers and the rod that came with it broke in 2 uses.I ordered this one instead which works great and has a rubbery grip to work through the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of Formers and wanted a sturdier hook so I thought I would give this one a try.  I like it, it&#x27;s not as flimsy as the original I have and so far so good!</li>
    <li> Great Bargain for the price. Bought it to use with the off brand curlformers and it was worth the extra few bucks.</li>
    <li> Definitely loved this hook because it was so sturdy. Only thing is, the curlformers ended up being a waste of money. Just buy a steam curler and it works better with less product needed to actually keep the curls throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Really simple application of the Curlformers and gentle on your tresses.  It gets an At.</li>
    <li> Strong wand.  It&#x27;s holding up to alot of use.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find some of the Curlformer products so this was a great way to get the product.  It arrived on time and the quality is fine.</li>
    <li> glad I ordered the real curlformer hooks because the knock off one that came with my knock off curlformers is very cheaply made and kept coming apart. These are very good quality,rubber grips instead of hard ,cheep plastic. I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I had a Hook already but I heard Great reviews about this one as a spare and it won&#x27;t break. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice and sturdy wand. It is easy on the hair. Works well. I have no complaints and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one on the recommendations of others who purchased the curlformers replicas and noted the wand that came with it was broken easily. I did not have an issue with the cheap one so I find this was an unnecessary purchase. However, it is easy to put together and fairly sturdy so I&#x27;m keeping it as a backup.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair so these are a good length. The plastic has a good grip. I bought these to replace the one I lost that came as part of the set and it&#x27;s exactly identicle.</li>
    <li> The end opposite the hook is too fat. The curler gets stuck and it&#x27;s hard to break it free with one hand.  It is made sturdy.  Shipping is ridiculously expensive for something so small and lightweight.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the knock off hook I bought as an extra back-up worked better than this one. The lip in the hook was so flimsy, too easy to move around that every time I tried to pull the hook thru the Curlformer, it would snag the mesh and I couldn&#x27;t pull it thru. It&#x27;d get about 2 inches in and it would just catch on the inside of the roller. SO FRUSTRATING! I pulled out my knockoffs and didn&#x27;t have a problem at ALL. Maybe because the plastic is so much harder, it doesn&#x27;t give when you try to pull it through. Made for a way easier installation.</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointed when I got this hook simply because I ordered one a few months ago and it was much thicker and sturdier and the one they sent me this time is skinny and looks fragile. I have thick hair and it looks like it&#x27;ll easily break or be a struggle for me to use. Like I said I havent used it yet, so I will update my review when I use, however  I&#x27;m disappointed its not the same one</li>
    <li> This hook broke the first time I used it! i will have to reorder so I can use the curlers</li>
    <li> Not like our original one. This one pulls apart way too easily. Made me and my daughter very frustrated.</li>
    <li> I used to use a generic hook for my curlformers until my boyfriend threw it away on accident.  I am so happy he did because this thing is so much better!  It is very sturdy and makes the curling process so much easier and faster!</li>
    <li> I had no issues using the curlformers hook, it worked as adverstised. I don&#x27;t that there is a word count for posting a review.</li>
    <li> First time using item</li>
    <li> Ok so I got these because I wanted to have loose curls for my wedding. Although it works well, I don&#x27;t like the fact that because you have to pull it off, the curls are not as smooth and it damages the hairs. Getting them on was not so bad though. It is a good product if you want to help yourself but it is not without consequence.</li>
    <li> I first wanted to save a few bucks and bought the cheaper, Asian made garbage. When it broke during the first use, I realized why I needed to pay just a little bit extra and try the name brand item. The extra money was totally worth it. First, you get instructions in English, very important! The way that you thread the hair and pull it through hurts your daughter far less using the proper technique. The plastic is much thicker and I have not a problem with breakage. After I put the hook together I did not take it apart. The area where you put it back together is where the cheap one broke and I was worried, but the plastic in this area on this product is much thicker, so I am sure there is not a problem. I just store it in a big Ziplock with all of the curlers and it fits put together so I figured why take it apart. I wish I would have just spent a few extra dollars and gotten the real one the first time!</li>
    <li> too weak for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A WINNER.  ITS NOT AS LONG AS THE HOOK THAT COMES IN THE PACKAGE WITH THE CURLFORMERS WHICH IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this tool. I needed it to install my curlformers. It is easy to use once I got the hang of it. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that I could not take it apart for storage.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to work this product. I have used this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair and the curls cam out pretty good. This tool is pretty neat and can work well if you know what you are doing.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time and the hook kept bending backwards making it nearly impossible to bring the hair all the through. I&#x27;m just going to have to throw it away. Its usless.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use the culer without the Hook, right?  I like the quality of this hook.  When I bought my curlers I ordered them from overseas.  They came with a hook...I curled my hair using the hook 3 times and then the hook broke!!  I ordered this name brand hook and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since. Saving money is good, but sometimes you just gotta go for the gold!!</li>
    <li> It breaks every time I try to use it. The hook you get when you get the Curlformers is so much better. Save your money!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy! I have two knock-off hooks and this one. You can definitely tell a difference. However, both products do the job without any trouble. It&#x27;s good to have more than 1 hook - not only for back-up, but to save time. I will load 3 hooks at a time or asks someone to do it, the process seems to go much quicker with more hooks.</li>
    <li> Difficult to pull apart once its connected. Broke the first day. Going to tape it up an try to use it anyway.</li>
    <li> There is a knack to it.  Don&#x27;t force too much hair in and this product works as the description states it should.</li>
    <li> The hook alone just ruined my whole experience with curl formers and made me stop using them. It would break through the former, getting my hair caught. And its very hard to undo without breaking some strands</li>
    <li> I bought this because I purchased the knock off curl formers and everyone was saying how bad their hook was so I just went ahead and got this with my order. Makes application very easy and hook is very long. Also arrived on time. Thanks:)</li>
    <li> Great for hairdo. Easy to use. I am very glad to have it. :D :D :D :D :D :D :D</li>
    <li> Please get this as an additional hook if you are going to my the dupes. This hook worked way better than the one the dupes came with.</li>
    <li> Handle is weak, but it&#x27;s an affordable replacement.</li>
    <li> Much easier to use with great resultd</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I purchased this. Having natural hair is awesome and now that there is an alternative to styling using Curlformers, I am hooked. Lol. The hook is fairly easy to use and I highly recommend it to everyone who may be using this type of roller and if they aren&#x27;t a great fan of heat styling. Awesome tool.</li>
