      <li>greatest amount i could for such a price!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper, but better yet, it dissolves a lot better...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad i found this.  </li>
      <li>For more info, read The Magnesium Miracle.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>

      <li>I love this product and will reorder again</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this Essom Salt ...</li>
      <li>I use it as plant food and my plants love it.  </li>
      <li>Going to try it with my hair conditioner to see if it gives my hair more volume as it states.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great product</li>
      <li>but I find this product has a finer, smoother appearance than the store brands, dissolves better in the bath and as one review suggested may be easer on the skin.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it!!!y daughter</li>
      <li>Love the quality of this salt....</li>
      <li>My first shipment of salt was good, some had came out of the bag and was sitting in the bottom of the box, but I just dumped that into a container.  </li>
      <li>Excellent Product, Keeps my citrus trees, nice and green.</li>
      <li>Great quality excellent price but poor packaging/shipping.</li>
      <li>Now that all is transferred to appropriate containers, the product is fine.</li>

      <li>Wow, this is a great deal.  </li>
      <li>fit the bill as the drug store Epsom salt  was becoming price prohibitive.</li>
      <li>I have fibromyalgia, and epsom salt baths make a huge difference in my pain level and sleep quality.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect!  So glad to have it in quantity!</li>
    <li> Good stuff .. Well packaged... The real thing.... good pricing..</li>
    <li> This is fantastic, thank you for my great baths! What a great way to take magnesium transdermally. I use 2.5 pounds at a time. Under our bathroom vanity we keep numerous lidded plastic containers that hold that amount, so we refill them from this bag. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> large quantity, for not too expensive price. I use this with deep soaking baths on a regular basis. Not really sure how different this is from other epsom salts.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without my epsom salt.  Nice to be able to get a Heisenberg sized haul of it too!</li>
    <li> Bought this to add to baths. Great value!</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. A compact but heavy package. I&#x27;ll be storing this in the basement, periodically filling a large jar from it, and blending with essential oils for baths.</li>
    <li> Great for soaking away my aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt; --I also used to kill weeds-- I mixed with 2 cups white vinegar and 1/2 cup dawn dish soap about a 1 cup of Epsom salt.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this 2 days ago and it killed most weeds, I&#x27;ll reapply on the few that are still a little green.  You can make larger batches if you have a weed sprayer, I used a Windex bottle and sprayed a mist.  I just poured the mix on the larger weeds and those are the ones that died first.  Be creative!</li>
    <li> this is the most economical way to buy Epsom salt if you use them a lot. I take bear loves in 2 cups of Epsom salts a couple times a week at least. If you suffer from aches and pains I recommend buying up some salt in bulk. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Packaged very well and this saved me a trip to the drugstore (and my back from carrying the heavy cartons)!  Priced well and will absolutely order again.  Epsom salt baths are a true luxury for me.</li>
    <li> This was the only way I could find to buy large quantity. It has been amazing to put on my lawn, made it nice and green and thick. Also Roses and tomatoes are loving it. And don&#x27;t forget a good soak in the tub!!</li>
    <li> this is my second time ordering.  Love it.</li>
    <li> There really is a difference... I am so glad that my store never has pure epsom salt in stock anymore. Otherwise, I never would have bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper, but better yet, it dissolves a lot better... A lot!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a great deal.  It is clean and I&#x27;m surprised to find that this is all natural.  I use it as plant food and my plants love it.  I bathe in it before bed.  It&#x27;s a great way to get good night&#x27;s sleep and get the magnesium you need transdermally (sp?).  The package came timely and it was packaged well in an airtight, heavy duty plastic bag.  Nothing had spilled out.  I will buy again!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been diagnosed as magnesium deficient but I can&#x27;t tolerate magnesium supplements.  My doctor recommended epsom salt baths, which I take several times a week and they definitely help.  This salt is finely ground and comes in a nice waterproof bg and the price is reasonable, comes out to much less than buying bags at the drugstore, just ordered another bag!</li>
    <li> Just a big ol&#x27; bag of Epsom salt. Exactly as described. Comes in a silver bag with a label on the front.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the purchase and it seems to be working great for my sore back and neck. It is fine salt and easily mixed into the tub.</li>
    <li> Life saver. I use epsom salt all the time.&lt;br /&gt;It saved me when I was doing a lot of intense exercise and had super sore muscles&lt;br /&gt;Again when I was having pregnancy aches and pains&lt;br /&gt;Then again for postpartum healing and aches&lt;br /&gt;Who needs drugs full of chemicals when you can soak away aches and pains in a warm bath!?</li>
    <li> It came on time been using it on my plants and grass.  Plants look great.  Going to try it with my hair conditioner to see if it gives my hair more volume as it states.</li>
    <li> Wow it arrived way fast .  Price is great! Only problem, there&#x27;s sooo much 25 lb. Should have had it prepackaged. In smaller quantities. Easier to store. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The order arrived is perfect condition and in a timely manner.  I use epsom salt as fertilizer for the lawn and certain plants, and to keep the snails away.  I also bathe in epsom salt.</li>
    <li> My roses thrive after an application of Magnesium sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not salt  ... Must be a reason it&#x27;s called salt.&lt;br /&gt;Such a problem.</li>
    <li> It was OK, but feel there are better, cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  But be careful opening the box; there&#x27;s nothing between the blade and those bags they come in and I sliced mine right open.  Still, Greenway seems to be a good company to do business with.</li>
    <li> Great deal on this!  I recently discovered the benefits of putting Epsom Salts in my garden!  It works!</li>
    <li> The package was ripped and the metallic type bag was stuffed into the shipping box. Salts were everywhere, and it was quite a trick to transfer that heavy load to containers. I had it shipped precisely to avoid dealing with heavy loads constantly. Now that all is transferred to appropriate containers, the product is fine.</li>
    <li> Makes for a relaxing bath after working hard all day to relieve sore muscles</li>
    <li> got here so fast. and was a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product and value.</li>
    <li> Great in the bath.  I use this all the time.  My only complaint is not with the product but with my mail person who stuffs it in the box and it is hard to get out of the mail box. :)  I use this with essential oils.</li>
    <li> My first shipment of salt was good, some had came out of the bag and was sitting in the bottom of the box, but I just dumped that into a container.  The second shipment was in hard clumps like it got wet during shipment.  I love this product and will reorder again</li>
    <li> Use this in my baths. Same thing as the expensive $5/lb stuff. Great price and will last me a while!</li>
    <li> This is powdered Magnesium Sulfate, not Epsom salts (they are different products). Even comes with the label &amp;#34;wash thoroughly after use&amp;#34;. Not graded for bathing or ingesting. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Contents were clean and worked exactly as one should expect.  Works great in may vegetable garden.</li>
    <li> The Epsom Salts were an awesome buy.  Shipped super quick. I used them for making bath salts for a baby shower guest gift.&lt;br /&gt;They turned out fantastic. The quality of the salt is terrific.  I would suggest purchase of this product to anyone. Also the packing is a thick heavy vinyl type bag.  Making it very easy to handle the bulkiness of that much weight in one container.</li>
    <li> MIXED WITH VINERGAR AND LIQUID DISH DETERGENT IT MAKES A WONDERFUL WEED KILLER.  also GREAT FOR SOAKING TIRED FEET.</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia, and epsom salt baths make a huge difference in my pain level and sleep quality.  It is wonderful to be able to buy such a large amount at one time instead of lots and lots of small bags.  The price is great too.  They also dissolve very quickly in warm water.</li>
    <li> All&#x27;s good and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, Keeps my citrus trees, nice and green.</li>
    <li> Wanted a large quantity and per lb its a good price.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Very satisfied with the item.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Low price. Amazing customer service. A definite A+!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great price!</li>
    <li> Great quality excellent price but poor packaging/shipping. 1/4 of bag was missing due to hole in bag and packaging upon arrival. The salt was leaking out when postman handed it to me.</li>
    <li> Functions as intended.</li>
    <li> .... its epsom salt ....</li>
    <li> Good quality Magnesium sulfate. Shipped to my house in a day. Though I live in the same city as the depot.</li>
    <li> Quality Epsom salt. Great prices.</li>
    <li> This is amazing -- large quantity -- i use so much of this for my baths.  I&#x27;ve ordered this twice.  I&#x27;m so glad i found this.  It&#x27;s allowed me to use more in my baths than when i was buying in smaller quantities in the stores.  This is nice salts and then you can add whatever essential oils you want.</li>
    <li> great price for a great product</li>
    <li> great aid in garden and gets the maid moving</li>
    <li> exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it in a tub for soaking my tired body.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR VEGETABLES NEEDING MAGNESIUM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second (update: now third) order and plan to continue if price remains reasonable. Love the product. The seller, homengardenproducts, communicate well. I put 1/2 c in tub each night. This stabilizes heart beat (for me), relaxes muscles and I sleep like a baby. For more info, read The Magnesium Miracle. One bag last me about three months.</li>
    <li> Seems to be an amazing quality of epsom salt.  I mixed it with essential oils as christmas gifts and everyone loves it!  I&#x27;ll be ordering again.  Great quality at a good price for the quantity.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Awesome! Well-packed.</li>
    <li> just what I needed I can&#x27;t find it in quantity any where else</li>
    <li> Used it on our lawn. Happy with the results</li>
    <li> great product and very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this Essom Salt ... Two cups in the bath water and soak in it for twenty mins. and my body feels at rest long enough for me to fall asleep at night... I suffer from fibromyalgia so my nerves and muscles are hurting , pinching and knotting up all the time, with medications I now have good days and bad but I could always count on my Epsom salt... I also use it to kill weeds in my yard! I know it sounds crazy but yeah it really works and also fertilizer and so much more that&#x27;s why I buy in bulk, saves money to..</li>
    <li> Bag had small hole in seam so Epsom salts came out onto floor when I removed it from shipping box.  I was cleaning it off floor for days.  Product has large clumps in it.  I have purchased other brands from you that were great This one IS NOt.  Will not but again</li>
    <li> stinky, smells like bad eggs lol.  put it in a bucket and store it that way...with closed top.</li>
    <li> Well shipped, this is one heavy bag of Epsom salts. Great for bath and garden. No perfume.</li>
    <li> Dissolves quicker and more completely than the small containers sold at the pharmacy. I am almost ready to order again and as long as I can get this here I will not waste my money on those little cartons of coarse overpriced epsom salts.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!!!y daughter and I take Epsom Salt baths every night. This bag will last us awhile :-)</li>
    <li> GREAT value, Superior grade Epsom Salt.  I suffer from chronic gout arthritis attacks. I also recently took a fall and damaged a knee. After reading about all of the benefits of Epsom salt and my additional pain I have increased my Epsom use to almost everyday with great results. I use a few cups per bath so I love the large 25 pound bag.  I was looking for a better cost option with my heavy use and this product fit the bill as the drug store Epsom salt  was becoming price prohibitive. After receiving my order I find the packaging (bag)  is very heavy duty and looks to be professional grade. With my pain the convenience of having 25 pounds delivered to my front door via Amazon prime is priceless! I am not a chemist or anything but I find this product has a finer, smoother appearance than the store brands, dissolves better in the bath and as one review suggested may be easer on the skin. I agree that this product is  mild on the skin, actually made my skin very soft and helps the pain!  My opinion is this Epsom Salt is the best of all the brands I have ever used.  Great Product, Great Price, Highly Recommended; I will buy more!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product</li>
    <li> So wonderful for so many things; making bath soaks, feeding my tomatoes, making an all purpose plant food, all natural pest control in the garden, etc... And you can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;ll be buying from this company for a long time.</li>
    <li> We use these for bath salts.  The price was right and they work just fine.</li>
    <li> Lovely product and a great price.</li>
    <li> Worked well around our trees and flowers</li>
    <li> greatest amount i could for such a price! love my epsom bath soaks!</li>
    <li> Great came shipped and packaged quickly!!! Love the quality of this salt....I use to for my baths with essential oils after a hard day of work...Im a massage therapist!  great product</li>
    <li> Great. The postman made sure I knew to be careful the box was heavy. I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him it was 25 pounds epson salts. Lol, it was fabulous to not have to carry it! It is a great value. Soaked already, and its like any other salt so far. Arthritis can go away for an hour or so!</li>
    <li> I use epsom salt for so much around the house that its far more economical to buy it bulk.</li>
    <li> Another great from of Magnesium, I use 2 cups in each bath. Research the benefits of Magnesium.</li>
    <li> Good quality and a great price! Works well for our intended use (fertilizer suppliment for our dutch bucket system) packaged well and arrived promptly</li>
    <li> Good way to get bulk epsom salt.  Worked the same as CVS brand stuff at a much cheaper cost.</li>
