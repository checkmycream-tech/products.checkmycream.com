      <li>It seems more of it was wasted leaking than what it was actually used for.</li>
      <li>The reason behind that is that jojoba oil mimics our own natural sebum production</li>
      <li>I also use it after I dry it too gently</li>
      <li>so it actually regulates this natural process of our skin!</li>
      <li>I have been natural for 3 months and this made my curl moisturised with any extra work...</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly because it was 4 ounces and cheaper than the other stuff.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a change in my hair or growth, but it did kept my hair oiled/moisturized for a long period of time. I&#x27;ll see how the other oils are.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly because it was 4 ounces and cheaper than the other stuff. I don&#x27;t know if that means that there are other oils in it, but i don&#x27;t care one bit. This oil made my Kinky Curly hair super soft and shiny, which is good because my hair HATES grease and butters. If you&#x27;re like me, and you need something to seal in moisture, but you don&#x27;t like heavy grease or butters, I encourage you to try this. Good stuff,Great Price.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  Nice size for the price.  My scalp and natural hair are enjoying this oil, and it lasts a long time.  Will definitely be ordering more.  Love me some Jojoba!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for many yrs and absolutely love it. I used to purchase it at the local  beauty supply store here in Houston and then one day it was just not around anymore, so with some time and searching I found that i could get it here on amazon. Needless to say i jumped at the chance to get this oil - it makes my hair so soft and shiny and without that heavy greasy look or feeling. I will always be a user of this product no matter where I have to buy it. I LOVE THIS STUFF - YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TRY IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this oil! I am an esthetician as as so, I am always looking for the next best thing to try on my skin. I am combination skin with an oily t zone. This oil doesn&#x27;t break me out in fact it clears up any congestion I might be having. The reason behind that is that jojoba oil mimics our own natural sebum production the closest so it actually regulates this natural process of our skin! It&#x27;s perfect for someone that has access oil or active breakouts. I apply it first then intensive moisture balance by dermalogica after as a sealant. My skin has never looked brighter or more even toned! I also take Clearzine, a natural skin clearing supplement I found on Amazon as well. I&#x27;m 31 but I get told I look like I&#x27;m 25 all the time!! Try this if u have acne, I know u will love it!</li>
    <li> The best thing that your skin will drink down as smooth as it feels. It isn&#x27;t oily as one might infer from its title.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as close to the bodys natural sebaceous process. Your skin won&#x27;t recognize \\&quot;oil\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect as a Stan alone moisturizer. Not shiny. Your skin will drink it up. Try nature&#x27;s cure to oily skin, yes it will actually correct your skin issues. It&#x27;s a guarantee from god.&lt;br /&gt;I use nothing else</li>
    <li> My fave oil for hair and skin. This is the only oil that does not break out my already oily face. It does not clog pores.</li>
    <li> Item was not what I expected. The bottle leaked frequently even with it being tapped for shipment. It seems more of it was wasted leaking than what it was actually used for.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS OIL AND YES I WOULD LET EVERYONE KNOW THIS MAKE YOUR HAIR SOFT AND SHINY WHICH I GOT IT FOR MY SCALP</li>
    <li> If you want real Jojoba oil do not buy this one. It makes an impression it&#x27;s a Jojoba, oil but it is not.</li>
    <li> I got coconut oil. I live in Jamaica and so it was not economically feasible for me to return it.</li>
    <li> great product. will work with again!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much . It came early and thanking for putting the tape on the top so it would not pop open and spell</li>
    <li> I got this stuff for stretching my ears, it smells fine and the shipping was fast. Only issue i have had is the bottle leaking, it leaked in the shipping package and still continues to leak. but other than that great item well worth the price</li>
    <li> second time ordering this!! made my hair grew so quick and nice the first time! cant wait to start using it again!!</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my hair to deep condition it before washing. I also use it after I dry it too gently pat (2 drops rubbed on hands)all over lower part of hair, the dry part, (this takes practice to not over do it in any one area). By patting in on I get a great shine better than shining sprays and it is good for my hair. I prefer it, for my hair anyway, over argan oil. Great value and size.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something with a bit of a nutty fragrance but this just smells like cooking oil. Not really complimentary to be wearing on your head. Also was disappointed that its not pure jojoba oil. There are other ingredients that are not listed. Makes me wonder what I&#x27;m putting in my hair. It&#x27;s just ok...I would spend a few extra bucks and buy the pure organic jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for 3 months and this made my curl moisturised with any extra work...Love It..my top pick.</li>
    <li> Great for hair &amp; skin</li>
