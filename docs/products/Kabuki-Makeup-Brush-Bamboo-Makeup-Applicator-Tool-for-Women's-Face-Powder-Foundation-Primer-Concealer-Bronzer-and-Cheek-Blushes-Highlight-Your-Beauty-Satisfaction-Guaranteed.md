      <li>This brush is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>It feels nice, but does not work as a foundation brush as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Works nicely</li>
      <li>Very good product , thanks</li>
      <li>This brush provided the perfect application of my powder concealer and it is so soft on your face.</li>
      <li>very very very very satisfied plus its short handle works best for bringing it in your purse.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful soft makeup brush that grabs just the right amount of powder and spreads it evenly over my face for great coverage.</li>
      <li>I have been able to successfully clean the brush without having any bristles fall out, so I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this brush.</li>
      <li>I love it....</li>
      <li>I love te brush and</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more of their products.</li>
      <li>will order more of this brand I will order the foundation brush as well.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this.</li>
      <li>Just what I have been looking for! :)</li>
      <li>which EM doesn&#x27;t even make any more, so I don&#x27;t like having to use it every day -</li>
      <li>It is super soft and  make up application is flawless.</li>
      <li>I love the softness of the bristles and that they are so easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Love kabuki brushes, so these were exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>Applies foundation so smoothly, giving you the &amp;#34;Air Brush&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
      <li>The wooden handle is great quality.</li>
      <li>BUT - if you want a soft, densely-packed brush, this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>the bristles are soft but they are too &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; for the product to cling to, and you don&#x27;t get good cover at all.</li>
      <li>I clean it about every two weeks.</li>
      <li>The brush has a bamboo handle, which is nice, and really soft bristles.</li>
      <li>Love my new brush!</li>
      <li>Very easy to hold, and soft on your skin.</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s commented several times how nice it is.</li>
      <li>This brush was less than fair.</li>
      <li>This brush is exactly what I needed to apply my Jane Iredale mineral makeup.</li>
      <li>It goes on precisely where you want it and the bristles are soft.  </li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t have any first hand experience with this, as it was a gift to my wife for Christmas, she couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I also have the EM retractable flat top brush that I use when traveling.  </li>
      <li>It is super soft.</li>
      <li>this is all I use, very dense but still has a give to buff powder foundation all over.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are very densely packed.</li>
      <li>like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>a DIY gentle cleaner that involves baby shampoo</li>
      <li>and they come back clean and soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My new brush is just what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Very soft and makes application a breeze!</li>
      <li>does a fantastic job of coverage of loose and bronzer powder.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>nothing bad at all on this purchase, this is very high-end feeling.. soft and dense, very happy.</li>
      <li>After I was it the brush fluffs right back like it was brand new.</li>
      <li>I have been using the EM brush for years and needed a new one.  </li>
      <li>A dupe for Everyday Minerals Flat Top Brush!  </li>
      <li>Very soft &amp; holds onto the face powder for application.</li>
      <li>After using this brush I can say that it feels very soft to touch.</li>
      <li>It came very early, and is so soft!</li>
      <li>WHen it came in the mail my husband was trying to figure out ways that he could use it because  it was so soft!</li>
      <li>SOFT bristles!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazingly soft and my foundation goes on evenly!</li>
      <li>This brush is really soft to my face.</li>
      <li>I always wanted a good foundation brush, but they are so expensive.</li>
      <li>The bristles are too silky and they don&#x27;t hold much of the loose powdery makeup product, i need to put it in the cap and swirl it around 7 - 8 times for application, as opposed to 3 or 4 as i&#x27;d normally do with my old brush.</li>
      <li>It definitely picked up a decent amount of powder, but it didn&#x27;t do any favors for what was already itchy, irritated skin.</li>
      <li>A few months ago, my EM flat top brush finally bit the dust</li>
      <li>I prefer over the bare mineral brushes.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;d previously been using a huge, fluffy drugstore power brush to do so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t shed at all, I&#x27;ve had it for about 3-4 months. I have no complaints about it. Works nicely</li>
    <li> I am using this brush for some art pieces I am doing and I need a soft brush for cleaning off small pieces.  This does the trick.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have bought! It is super soft and  make up application is flawless. Will buy again and agiain!</li>
    <li> Shorter than I expected but that&#x27;s ok. SOFT bristles! Made well</li>
    <li> Just a heads up looks a LOT bigger than it actually is...</li>
    <li> It was way smaller than I expected. I ordered it for my sister and she was dissatisfied as well.</li>
    <li> I prefer over the bare mineral brushes.</li>
    <li> does a fantastic job of coverage of loose and bronzer powder.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Best Kabuki I have every used. I plan on buying more of their products. Very soft and makes application a breeze!</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing. I always wanted a good foundation brush, but they are so expensive. I saw this brush and immediately got attracted by the price. I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this. After using this brush I can say that it feels very soft to touch. Applies foundation so smoothly, giving you the &amp;#34;Air Brush&amp;#34; feeling. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This brush provided the perfect application of my powder concealer and it is so soft on your face. Just what I have been looking for! :)</li>
    <li> I found this brush to be harsh on my sensitive skin. It definitely picked up a decent amount of powder, but it didn&#x27;t do any favors for what was already itchy, irritated skin. I ended up buying a Clinique brush and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The brush has a bamboo handle, which is nice, and really soft bristles. It feels nice, but does not work as a foundation brush as I had hoped. The bristles are very densely packed. BUT - if you want a soft, densely-packed brush, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> this Kabuki flat makeup brush is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I will order more of this brand I will order the foundation brush as well.</li>
    <li> The reason I purchased this brush was for the sole reason of applying my BareMinerals... i&#x27;d previously been using a huge, fluffy drugstore power brush to do so but it was getting grungy so i thought i&#x27;d give this a go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major disappointment. The bristles are too silky and they don&#x27;t hold much of the loose powdery makeup product, i need to put it in the cap and swirl it around 7 - 8 times for application, as opposed to 3 or 4 as i&#x27;d normally do with my old brush. the coverage with this is also really sheer. the bristles are soft but they are too &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; for the product to cling to, and you don&#x27;t get good cover at all. i&#x27;m disappointed and hopefully i&#x27;ll find another use for this brush</li>
    <li> Works wonders. I had no idea this would make your foundation look so amazing, it gives you such an airbrushed glow that makes you look like your not wearing any makeup. The kabuki brush is the way to go when applying foundation. Its incredible and this one works great.</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I needed to apply my Jane Iredale mineral makeup. It&#x27;s great - doesn&#x27;t shower the powder all over me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have this brush for over a year and it still works perfectly. I clean it about every two weeks. Non of the brissles have came out. After I was it the brush fluffs right back like it was brand new.</li>
    <li> This brush was less than fair. The bristles are thick, which is what I was looking for. It had an odd odor though and I was breaking out like crazy when I used this brush (I use brushes all the time and never had that issue). Also, the handle separated from the brush section on day 1- heard a &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; and the glue broke apart. There are other brush options on here...go with something else.</li>
    <li> A dupe for Everyday Minerals Flat Top Brush!  That brush has been my HG (holy grail) MMU (mineral make-up) brush for years.  I also have the EM retractable flat top brush that I use when traveling.  A few months ago, my EM flat top brush finally bit the dust and I went on their website to order another...out of stock!  So, I patiently waited and just used my retractable one which EM doesn&#x27;t even make any more, so I don&#x27;t like having to use it every day - I want to keep it for traveling for as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after several weeks of (sort of) patiently waiting, I decided to see if there were any similar here on Amazon and I stumbled across this - picture is identical to the EM version except w/out the EM logo on it.  I thought &amp;#34;why not&#x27;, the price was even less than what EM was charging (and this was in stock), so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same brush!!!  WHEEEE!  If applies just like my EM did, bristles and handle feel identical.  These are VERY VERY soft bristles - I have been spoiled by these bristles and when comparing to a lot of similarly priced brushes (at Sephora, Ulta, Target, you name it), there are very very few at this price point that are this soft and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no shedding.  This applies my MMU like a dream.  When feeling these bristles side by side w/ my retractable EM brush &#x3D; cant&#x27; tell the difference!  I wash the bristles w/ a DIY gentle cleaner that involves baby shampoo and they come back clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love kabuki brushes, so these were exactly what I needed! I love the softness of the bristles and that they are so easy to clean. I use them to apply my foundation and concealer, but the only downfall of the brushes is that the brushes are short. I prefer to use long handle brushes instead but they work great so I guess I can&#x27;t complain. Would recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soft makeup brush that grabs just the right amount of powder and spreads it evenly over my face for great coverage.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well for my facial powder. It was too thick or something.</li>
    <li> I love te brush and how smooth it feels when I use it to put my make up base. I do recomend it.</li>
    <li> My new brush is just what I was looking for! Great quality.It is super soft. Your make-up will go on very smoothly I reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Glides my makeup on evenly!</li>
    <li> Love my new brush! It&#x27;s amazingly soft and my foundation goes on evenly! The wooden handle is great quality. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely amazing. WHen it came in the mail my husband was trying to figure out ways that he could use it because  it was so soft! It spreads the make up wonderfully  I actually feel like the powder is going on my face and not just sprinkling down into the sink! Very awesome and would recommend to all!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! It came very early, and is so soft! I have it four stars because I was packaged in a weird way, and it smells like glue. But over all a good quality brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is really soft to my face. I love it....I also like the fact that come with a brush tube with two openings so I only touch the wood when I need to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. I BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A CERTIFIED makeup Artist. SHE LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> The bristles are wonderful and it blends my pressed mineral foundation beautifully.  I have been able to successfully clean the brush without having any bristles fall out, so I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this brush.</li>
    <li> Very good product , thanks</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t have any first hand experience with this, as it was a gift to my wife for Christmas, she couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;I do see her use it everyday and she&#x27;s commented several times how nice it is.</li>
    <li> this is all I use, very dense but still has a give to buff powder foundation all over.  very very very very satisfied plus its short handle works best for bringing it in your purse.  nothing bad at all on this purchase, this is very high-end feeling.. soft and dense, very happy. try it, you&#x27;ll be very pleased..</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  Fits well in the hand while using. Seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of make up brushes where the foundation stays on the brush. Not so with this one. I love it.</li>
    <li> Very soft &amp; holds onto the face powder for application.</li>
    <li> Works well. This is my second make up brush and I would not apply base without one.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect sized brush for applying blush or bronzer. Very easy to hold, and soft on your skin. I recommend getting one today.</li>
    <li> I like this.  It goes on precisely where you want it and the bristles are soft.  If you&#x27;re the type who likes to see a cloud of powder dust as you are putting on powder, you will not like this brush.</li>
    <li> See photo.  I accidentally ordered this brush instead of the Everyday Mineral brush.  I have been using the EM brush for years and needed a new one.  This brush showed up in the search results and looks the same but in person it is much smaller.  The brush head isn&#x27;t as big which makes it a bad brush for applying mineral foundation.  Get the EM brush instead.</li>
