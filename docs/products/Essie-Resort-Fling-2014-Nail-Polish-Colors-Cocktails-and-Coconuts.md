<li> I think if you have a good tan going or are naturally darker in your complexion this would be a really lovely color, but without the shimmer this just looks weird and boring on those who need some sun like myself.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s really dark</li>
<li> it basically looks like black nail polish.</li>
<li> After two thin coats, my nails are left with bubbles.</li>
<li> was a little disappointed that it took as long as it did to get to me.</li>
<li> Not happy with the color</li>
<li> It has faint silver and gold sparkle which I like.</li>
<li> I like to wear this alone or as a base for a glitter topcoat!</li>
<li> Im very disappointed!</li>

    <li> I love Essie nail polish and almost exclusively purchase this brand for my nail polish. I was pretty excited for this color - thought it would be a nice shimmery sand color. In reality it was really just blah. Being very fair skinned so I never participated in the &amp;#34;nude heel&amp;#34; trend that took over my sorority and that is exactly what this nail color reminds me of. I think if you have a good tan going or are naturally darker in your complexion this would be a really lovely color, but without the shimmer this just looks weird and boring on those who need some sun like myself.</li>
    <li> Loved it huge fan of Essie!</li>
    <li> great product. love it!</li>
    <li> This is the Essie salon version.  After two thin coats, my nails are left with bubbles. Very watery as well.  I have used the Essie polishes sold in retail outlets and do not experience the same issues.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the way it goes on; very streaky.</li>
    <li> The price is right and I love the color</li>
    <li> Arrived Fast and just what i wanted</li>

    <li> Nice color and good price</li>
    <li> Wonderfully understated color. Classy and easy to dress up or down. Applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t chip. I love this color!</li>
    <li> If you want my opionion here it is...Looks nothing like the polish advertised online unfortuntitly! Im very disappointed! I Wish I never purchased it.</li>
    <li> Essie&#x27;s Cocktails and Coconuts is a great nude against my brown skin complexion. It has faint silver and gold sparkle which I like. This is one of my new nude favorites.</li>
    <li> Awesome neutral color</li>
    <li> I love this color it&#x27;s perfect! And last long</li>
    <li> I thought this would have more of a sparkle to it. It is really similar to the sand trapeze color that came out in 2013</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish for everyday professional wear! There are many nudes by Essie and this one is one of the best! I like to wear this alone or as a base for a glitter topcoat! Either way, love it! I do have to say that you really need about 2 coats to get proper coloring but that is usually the case with most nude nail polish.</li>
