      <li>Great product, no scent, goes on easily.</li>

      <li>Nice aroma and not at all too oily.</li>
      <li>Two pumps in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together to warm them up</li>
      <li>great for swedish/relaxation massage..high glide, absorbs into the skin well, creates a wonderful friction and helps produce just enough heat to be relaxing.</li>
      <li>I can put the bottle under warm running water or in a pan of water on the stove top for my chronic fibro pains.</li>
      <li>Very light fragrance.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know of any better product on the market.  </li>
      <li>Animals like the taste of this stuff, so be sure to keep it out of their reach.</li>
      <li>I do LOVE THE HELL</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Love to use this as a moisturizer instead of lotion.</li>
      <li>As a MT student we are able to sample many varieties of products..</li>
      <li>I love it and my clients love it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic massage oil!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this oil and find it easily moves my hands with no greasy feeling on my or my clients or sheets.  </li>
      <li>The most important fact to me was it&#x27;s heating probabilities.</li>
      <li>This oil is light and easy to work with; I love that it is so nourishing,  and clients  </li>
      <li>Washes out easy with no pre- treat.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice basic massage oil, good quality for the price and size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>But over all as a oil product, it works fine.</li>
      <li>My mom is a masseuse, and she agrees that this type is just as good as her professional grade stuff- for cheaper.</li>
      <li>They are very reasonably priced, high quality product, my clients like the feel of the oil, not too greasy or sticky, nice glide!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>I like that this oil is good for people that may have allergies - it has very basic ingredients.</li>
      <li>This Light Oil is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and smooth, long lasting, and has kind of a warming effect as you work it into the skin.</li>
      <li>It allows great lubrication on the skin that isn&#x27;t oil and messy.</li>
      <li>It will be absorbed into your skin smoothly and won&#x27;t leave your skin very oily.</li>
      <li>Other than the smell this is good oil.</li>
      <li>Soaks right into the skin.  </li>
      <li>The only issue I have with this massage oil is that it smells funny, kind of like carrots.</li>
      <li>who are scent sensitive love the barely-there light, natural smell.</li>
      <li>I almost purchased the larger size, but the small one w/ pump is  perfect to fit on a stove then go straight onto the muscles that need treatment at the time.</li>
      <li>So smooth it&#x27;s professional oil.</li>
      <li>Will purchase more in future.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice but doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell like some other massage oils do.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and spreads far, so I don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t feel it has a strong smell to it though.</li>
      <li>Keeps much longer.  </li>
      <li>Product itself is okay, but received a broken top which may have broke during shipment.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to massage.</li>
      <li>I wish they would have packaged it a little better.  </li>
      <li>A very light scent that isnt overpowering, and a friction coefficient that isn&#x27;t too hard to work on the skin with.</li>
      <li>and you are set to go to give a professional style massage.</li>
      <li>Pretty much odorless, but does have a slight scent.</li>
      <li>Whether it&#x27;s deep tissue or for lighter reflexology, I haven&#x27;t found a smoother, less greasy, non-staining, all natural, odor free product than this one.</li>
      <li>The scent is very subtle and nice.</li>
      <li>Biotone is such a high quality produce.</li>
      <li>And on those nights when I&#x27;m feeling romantic... a little lavender, chamomile, vanilla,  or cinnamon oil  mixed in a smaller bottle is dreamy way to take turns, relaxing me and my love into an aroma therapeutic induced sleep.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like that this oil is good for people that may have allergies - it has very basic ingredients. However, I feel that it leaves the client feeling a tad greasy in my opinion and I usually mix it with a drop of essential oil because some clients weren&#x27;t crazy about the smell. I personally don&#x27;t feel it has a strong smell to it though.</li>
    <li> The only issue I have with this massage oil is that it smells funny, kind of like carrots. After I bought it I noticed that it has carrot extract in it. It&#x27;s not a strong smell, but there is definitely a smell to it. Other than the smell this is good oil. It&#x27;s nice and smooth, long lasting, and has kind of a warming effect as you work it into the skin.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed massage therapist and have been for 22 years.  I LOVE this oil and find it easily moves my hands with no greasy feeling on my or my clients or sheets.  Washes out easy with no pre- treat.  I used to buy this at my college.  I recommend you put it in a refrigerator.  Keeps much longer.  I have a gallon in mine and use the smaller ones in my holster.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Biotone is such a high quality produce. This oil has great glide during my massage treatment. I will continue to use Biotone even through it is more expensive than other oils out there.</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> All Biotone products I&#x27;ve used are wonderful. This Light Oil is by far my favorite. As a MT student we are able to sample many varieties of products.. with that said, this oil is a superior product. great for swedish/relaxation massage..high glide, absorbs into the skin well, creates a wonderful friction and helps produce just enough heat to be relaxing. Does not leave a yucking oily feeling whatsoever. Very light fragrance. Does not stain, BUT if it gets on your sheets or clothes, to get it out, you will have to pretreat your clothing. it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This massage oil is not super greasy so when its on your hands its not a bother.  Soaks right into the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
    <li> As someone with spinal damage, migraines and a torn rotator cuff....I spend about 3 days a week in physical therapy. Asked the names of the therapy oils they used and was elated to find them on Amazon. The most important fact to me was it&#x27;s heating probabilities. I can mix with certain herbs to rid migraines, rubbed at the base of my neck and forehead. I can put the bottle under warm running water or in a pan of water on the stove top for my chronic fibro pains. I almost purchased the larger size, but the small one w/ pump is  perfect to fit on a stove then go straight onto the muscles that need treatment at the time. Whether it&#x27;s deep tissue or for lighter reflexology, I haven&#x27;t found a smoother, less greasy, non-staining, all natural, odor free product than this one. And on those nights when I&#x27;m feeling romantic... a little lavender, chamomile, vanilla,  or cinnamon oil  mixed in a smaller bottle is dreamy way to take turns, relaxing me and my love into an aroma therapeutic induced sleep. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  A little goes a long way unless you have dry skin.  Pretty much odorless, but does have a slight scent. It&#x27;s not offensive or anything, just not floral or anything like that.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend.  Wife loves it.  Will purchase more in future.  Nice aroma and not at all too oily.</li>
    <li> As the the same green bottle (tube) of the same brand was organic, I thought this one was organic too, but it&#x27;s not. But over all as a oil product, it works fine. It will be absorbed into your skin smoothly and won&#x27;t leave your skin very oily.</li>
    <li> Product itself is okay, but received a broken top which may have broke during shipment. Otherwise, good product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic massage oil! Feels like the stuff that the professionals use. It smells nice but doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell like some other massage oils do. It allows great lubrication on the skin that isn&#x27;t oil and messy. Two pumps in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together to warm them up and you are set to go to give a professional style massage.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this product for years.  I don&#x27;t know of any better product on the market.  Try it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, and after trying other lotions and oils I find myself coming back to this one time and again. It goes on smoothly and spreads far, so I don&#x27;t have to use too much. The only problem I have with it is if the bottle tips over while it&#x27;s not locked it can drip. I&#x27;ve had to apologize a time or two for a few drips/spills on clients floors and clothes. Animals like the taste of this stuff, so be sure to keep it out of their reach. All in all, it&#x27;s definitely my oil of choice.</li>
    <li> This is a nice basic massage oil, good quality for the price and size of the bottle. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> My massages were always leaving me feeling greasy and clammy after a massage- this is the only massage oil that I have used that doesn&#x27;t do that. My mom is a masseuse, and she agrees that this type is just as good as her professional grade stuff- for cheaper. A very light scent that isnt overpowering, and a friction coefficient that isn&#x27;t too hard to work on the skin with. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to massage.</li>
    <li> I wish they would have packaged it a little better.  Some of the oil spilled out in the packaging but still a great product.  Good delivery time.</li>
    <li> GREAT MASSAGE OIL, RECOMMEND TO OTHERS.</li>
    <li> So smooth it&#x27;s professional oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and use all of the Biotone products. They are very reasonably priced, high quality product, my clients like the feel of the oil, not too greasy or sticky, nice glide!</li>
    <li> Great product, no scent, goes on easily. I&#x27;d buy it again. Perfect for a massage. Not much more to say about this product though.</li>
    <li> This oil is light and easy to work with; I love that it is so nourishing,  and clients  who are scent sensitive love the barely-there light, natural smell.</li>
    <li> Love to use this as a moisturizer instead of lotion. Glides well and absorbs nicely. The scent is very subtle and nice.</li>
    <li> Awesome so Awesome I love it I love it I do I do LOVE THE HELL OUT OF IT FO SHO</li>
    <li> this is an excellent massage oil. I love it and my clients love it. It&#x27;s not heavy and no one has complained of any sensitivity to it.</li>
