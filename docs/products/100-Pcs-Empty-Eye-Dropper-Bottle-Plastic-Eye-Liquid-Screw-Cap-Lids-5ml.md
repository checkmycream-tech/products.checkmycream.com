### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good quality!!</li>
      <li>Very good product got it before date showed</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t seal that great.</li>
      <li>After putting the labels on I am so happy and know our customers will also see that we are a business and not doing things out of the house</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>Good for one time use.</li>
      <li>I just received them and LOVE THEM!</li>
      <li>It was such a hit, perfect size, sturdy, and cute!</li>
      <li>The bottles came without the top on so you can put your liquid in.</li>
      <li>On top of that, the safety seal never breaks off.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t order more bottles that don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>But what I love the most is that the screw cap has the safety seal.</li>
      <li>Cheap!  </li>
      <li>But these bottles were and will remain to be much more of a hassle than I bargained for.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>We will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Had to buy too many.</li>
      <li>And cheap as well!</li>
      <li>Glad I didnt spend alot because they ended up in the trash.</li>
      <li>The eye drop part on the top is removable and is easy to put on.</li>
      <li>no leaking and easy to fill.</li>
      <li>Great product,  long shipping time</li>
      <li>I got 1000 of them and all were clean and no problems.</li>
      <li>Works very well!!</li>
      <li>All pieces where there and they are perfect for what I needed them for.(mixing small amount of liquid food coloring to create new colors for air brushing cakes).</li>
      <li>I found that after you take that off the bottles open and close good enough.</li>
      <li>They are fine for their purpose(actually pretty decent quality), however when I ordered 200, I only received 90 bottles, 100 caps and 93 dropper tips.</li>
      <li>no harm in trying out a new vendor though!</li>
      <li>Decent product.</li>
      <li>Just FYI to any new buyers;</li>
      <li>Dirt in some bags half the tips dont fit.</li>
      <li>They arrived nearly two weeks earlier than the earliest delivery date listed.</li>
      <li>It did arrive within the window but at the latter end of the window unlike other bottles which seem to arrive before the window or the first day of the window.  </li>
      <li>I had to just remove the little ring that should break open after the first use, like a safety seal.</li>
      <li>These bottles are not only smaller, but also a little cheaper than the first ones I got.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Horrible.. took forever to arrive. Dirt in some bags half the tips dont fit. Glad I didnt spend alot because they ended up in the trash.</li>
    <li> About 25 dropper tops short</li>
    <li> Decent product. No leaks. Seal does not work on these though.</li>
    <li> The cap on these is problematic. The dropper gets stuck inside with no way of fixing it. Rarely will the lid lock, making the seal useless.</li>
    <li> The little bottles are cheap(price that is) but they don&#x27;t seal that great. I had to just remove the little ring that should break open after the first use, like a safety seal. I found that after you take that off the bottles open and close good enough. Served the purpose.</li>
    <li> Very low quality plastic.</li>
    <li> Too tiny, returned.  Had to buy too many.</li>
    <li> Small little eye drop bottles that work like an over-the-counter eye drop bottle. The eye drop part on the top is removable and is easy to put on.</li>
    <li> Bottles came on time, but when I took them out of the packaging the dripper part that goes in the mouth of the bottle doesn&#x27;t sit inside.  It would constantly pop out, on ALL the bottles.  I won&#x27;t order more bottles that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> These are crap!  Cheap!  Leaky!  Misaligned lids!</li>
    <li> Very good product got it before date showed</li>
    <li> Arrived on time maybe sooner and does what I need. What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not you.&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t you ask yourself.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s how I found out.</li>
    <li> Works very well!! Good quality!! And cheap as well!</li>
    <li> I will not order this again. They are not the type of bottle I prefer.</li>
    <li> Bought these to go into gift bags for our church fist Women&#x27;s Conference a couple of weeks ago. It was such a hit, perfect size, sturdy, and cute! We will be ordering more. They came in less time than quoted. Thank you Amazon and thank God!</li>
    <li> Great product,  long shipping time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just going to start off with the shipping. It took waaay too long. Way too long. I only ordered these because I purchased some a few months ago from another seller. These bottles are not only smaller, but also a little cheaper than the first ones I got. On top of that, the safety seal never breaks off. And with the seal off, the bottle is still hard to open and close. I mean, at least I don&#x27;t have to worry about anything leaking. But these bottles were and will remain to be much more of a hassle than I bargained for. Just FYI to any new buyers; no harm in trying out a new vendor though! Good luck.</li>
    <li> does the job...no leaking and easy to fill.</li>
    <li> We have a small business and had a hard time finding these dropper bottle locally. I just received them and LOVE THEM! The bottles came without the top on so you can put your liquid in. But what I love the most is that the screw cap has the safety seal. I got 1000 of them and all were clean and no problems. After putting the labels on I am so happy and know our customers will also see that we are a business and not doing things out of the house (Even though we are &#x3D;P but we&#x27;re still growing)</li>
    <li> The worst bottles ever made.  The items received are completely different than what is shown in the picture.  The bottles are so flimsy that the bottle caps do not come off without half the content in the bottle.  75% of the nipples do not snap on and must be melted onto the bottle.  It did arrive within the window but at the latter end of the window unlike other bottles which seem to arrive before the window or the first day of the window.  I highly discourage anyone from purchasing this product or you will be highly frustrated.</li>
    <li> They hold liquid, if you are using them for yourself remove the locking ring. Good for one time use.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase these bottles. They are fine for their purpose(actually pretty decent quality), however when I ordered 200, I only received 90 bottles, 100 caps and 93 dropper tips. Wtf?</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE quality!  The cheapest plastic you could possibly imagine- the tops are impossible to open.</li>
    <li> They arrived nearly two weeks earlier than the earliest delivery date listed. All pieces where there and they are perfect for what I needed them for.(mixing small amount of liquid food coloring to create new colors for air brushing cakes).</li>
