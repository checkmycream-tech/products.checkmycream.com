<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I was expecting it to have more power. Very expensive and same power as the previos model. I kept it because I don&#x27;t have time to shop around, otherwise, it would had gone back.</li>
    <li> Love this powerful dryer.  It&#x27;s pretty heavy duty, and it&#x27;s a little heavier in weight than any other dryer I&#x27;ve had.  But it has the cool setting medium heat and High fast dry mode.  Pretty loud, but what hair dryer isn&#x27;t it?  It smoothes the hair too , removing the frizz.  Combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results!</li>
    <li> I love love this hairdryer!!!!!!  It normally takes me about an hour and a half to dry my hair and now it takes me 30 minutes.  It is very hot and you can easily burn your scalp if not careful.  Would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Out of all the hairdryers I have used in the past 16 years as a stylist, I can say this is one I really like (although I have only used it for two full days at the salon)!  It is a bit heavier and louder than I expected,but pumps out alot of air and has a good heavy duty 9 foot long cord.  It has high and low, hot and cold and I love where the buttons are located. The cold is very cold for a hairdryer and the hot gets decently hot but not so hot that you have to worry about it burning the hair or scalp (unless you are using it incorrectly).  For comparison, my coworker has a 2000 watt Babyliss that performs as well, has the same button placement, same long cord and dries pretty much as quick as the twin turbo (but is SLIGHTLY lighter weight)...  I gave it four stars because of the weight, the noise and the price point was higher than the babyliss for the same performance.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and frankly deserves attention&lt;br /&gt;The experiences of this product I am relieved a lot&lt;br /&gt; And all my friends who saw him Aaajabu</li>
    <li> Really a good item. Expensive but works good.Was recommended by my cousin and was great advise.The air flow is nice and the heat does not burn you, yet it dries hair fast.</li>
    <li> Great professional hair dryer.  The only reason I&#x27;d dock it a star is the noise.  I&#x27;m thinking about buying the silencer to see if that will help.  Otherwise it really gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of the past models from this brand and I love this hair dryer! LOVE! This one is a little lighter that the older models and it is a tad more expensive, but you get a run for your money. The last one I purchased was about 12 years ago and the one before that lasted about 15 years. I&#x27;m not a pro but I learned how to style my curly hair in the 7th grade (I&#x27;m 30 btw) and thats when I was gifted the first one by a relative who is a stylist. It does get very hot, and if not careful you can get burned not only from the direct heat but from the nozzle. It isn&#x27;t like cheaper dryers that over heat and shut off, this is truly a professional hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Dryer is lightweight and delivers a lot of heat.  Dries and smoothes hair quickly. Cuts down drying time down in half.  Wont go back to standard dryers.</li>
    <li> When my hair dryer started to break down I asked my sister (who is naturally curly but always has perfectly sleek hair) what to get and she recommended this brand. After reading some of the reviews I ordered it. I was not dissapointed! Not only did it dry my hair in ~6 min but it did away with the freeze. Thanks sis!!</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is excellent -- it can handle my lion&#x27;s mane of hair. It is light to hold, easy to  hold and use and high-quality construction.  The Fekkai salon on 5th avenue NYC uses these dryers which is why I ordered it. I will note that the cord is surprisingly thick and heavy compared to other regular retail store blow dryers, but it provides a generous length.</li>
    <li> I returned it. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair anyquicker than my Remington $40 hair dryer which is better. The back cap constinatly fell off and would suck my hair in it  not good. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it especially for that price.</li>
    <li> No bells and whistles on this hairdryer - just an excellent product. Very powerful and light to hold. It arrived very promptly and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I HAD TO RETURN IT.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love it! It drys very well, its super hoot, so if you are not use to using heat protection products Id recommend you do, just to avoid burning your ends- ITs size is PERFECT for travel! it fit so well in a small spot, and is very durable! Id recommend!!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on an article I read.  I received the item, but no instruction booklet.  I had a couple of questions about the way the dryer was working, and that is why I wanted a booklet.  I called the supplier and they said that no booklet came with the dryer because \\&quot;it was for professionals.\\&quot;  I asked why the cool button had to be on for the heat button to work and they could not say that this was normal, or why.  I also said the box makes it sound like there are 2 different nozzles with the dryer.  There are 2, but they appear to be the same one.  They said yes, they looked alike and could not explain further. The dryer is ok.  So far not as impressed with it as anything special.  A lot of money.</li>
    <li> Works so fast and leaves my hair straight without using a flat iron! All the stylists at my work use this brand!</li>
    <li> I love my twinturbo hair dryer. It was recommended by my stylist. I was hesitant to order it because of the price, but it was on sale. It dries very quickly and my hair is softer. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This is a professional hair dryer. It dries hair quickly and it lasts and can be repaired. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair dryer!!  It dries my hair so much quicker than my old dryer.  I have really thick long hair!!</li>
    <li> Fiance loves the blowdryer!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase for me!  Dryer has great power and drying ability, very efficient!  I would highly recommend!  The item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> love these dryers, they are the only ones I will ever use. I am a professional stylist. I will say a lil upset the nozel is always falling off. I believe its some how due to how hot it gets. I exchanged it and same problem with the second one. kept it as to I love how light weight it is .. but annoying to my clients as it has flew all over the place. Its now my personal dryer ( which is nice because its so lightweight and when doing your own hair you have your arms over your shoulders for the most part)... and I have the 3200 for work. If it was not for this problem on this model I would give ten stars!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because it is the one my hair stylist uses in her salon. And, since it&#x27;s such a strong dryer, it takes much less time to dry my hair. Also, it does a better job than any other hair dryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is much smaller than I expected.  The smaller size makes using the nozzles much easier for those of us that don&#x27;t have chimpanzee arms!  The machine is also really quiet and efficient.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I had the older version to this for years and loved it and this tops that!!!! Lighter in terms of weight and can I say POWERFUL!!!! AMAZING PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It is so light weigh and powerful that I am stiling my hair a lot faster than before.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is powerful and does an excellent job. However, I bought one for my wife which I received on January 7th 2014. My wife used it 4 times and then it burned. Literally there was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit. It could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer. But, my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise.</li>
    <li> The only complaint that I have is that the chord is very stiff. It will take a little breaking in. But the performance is just as great as the one I bought a decade ago.</li>
    <li> I Own a beauty salón And My employees didnt like it. Too small and not powerfull. But for home is perfect.</li>
    <li> great product and service!! thanks you for the blower it made my wife so happy !!! Happy New Year! Thanks</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this exact hair dryer in his salon and it is amazing.  2 speeds, 2 heat settings for a total of 4 options and works wonderfully.  I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and coarse and used to take forever to dry.  I inquired to my hairdresser about higher wattage dryers and you would think I asked her how to find the holy grail!  Well, wonder no more -- you can get a honking, high-wattage blow dryer right here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but isn&#x27;t your time worth something?</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I have used older versions of twin turbo and this one is significantly smaller and just as powerful. It literally cuts my dry time in half. It shipped in a couple days to CA with the standard free shipping. i&#x27;m really happy with this buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model of the same brand. My mom had recently purchased the 3200 and I loved it so I figured it get this one, the 3500, thinking it would be better/stronger. It is definitely not. The nozzles don&#x27;t seem to give the concentration of air as well as the other dryers. Not to mention, my hair has never been frizzier or more prone to puffing up in humidity. This is just not cutting it for me. Thinking I might as well return it and order same one my mom got.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m profesional hairstylist and i love it.</li>
    <li> I already had this hairdryer so it was just a replacement.Still love it</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer, I&#x27;m a hairstylist I need a hair dryer that drys hair quickly and light in weight because I have to hold it so much throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I just got mine today and to test it I decided to do my sister&#x27;s hair ! So When i open the box let me tell you I didnt expect it to be so small . However , according to the description it was said to have more power . I told my self I&#x27;ll be the judge of that been that I had the twin turbo 3200  so I said this one should deff do better . So I did her hair &amp; finished it very quickly actually  and I can say the hair was very shinny, the size did not have anything to do  with the power this blow dryer provided!!! So I am pleased with the results the hair was very soft and like glowy which never happened with the other dryer !</li>
    <li> I have had many other twin turbo dryers. I feel this one was not even close to the same as the drying power, and it is too small , and doesnt fit right in my hand.The heat is no where near as hot as it used to be. The only reason that I didnt return it was because of my own laziness. I will keep it as a second dryer, i will continue to search for something as good as the old twin turbo.</li>
    <li> Never using another hairdryer again....twin turbo does the job perfectly! Smooths my wavy frizzy hair to look like a have been at a salon for hours!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned. It is pricey, but it&#x27;s just one of those prime cases of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. I love how fast it dries, and how you can adjust the heat and speed each to three different settings. Super powerful and I feel like I get a salon-quality blow-out with this dryer. The only drawback is that the cord is somewhat long and bulky compared to other blow dryers, so it makes it slightly difficult to store and travel with.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is professional, lightweight and easy to use! My daughter had to purchase this for the high-end salon she was working at. Im happy she did! Its great!!</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Its light weight, small thus perfect to travel with and super hot which helps dry your hair faster. I was very pleased with the speed it dried my hair and left my hair very straight with very little effort. Just a word of warning to be very careful because this dryer gets very HOT. I&#x27;ve \\&quot;burned\\&quot; my scalp a couple of times. If you have a lot of experience blow drying hair and are looking for an upgrade this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Pro quality hair dryer.  Same model as used by wife&#x27;s hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I bought the Twinturbo 3500 for my girl friend.  It is not the cheapest hair dryer, but it&#x27;s lighter, smaller and more powerful than an earlier model that she would borrow to dry her hair, and replaces a CHI that had a faulty thermostat (after a few minutes it would blow cool air) after a year of use.  The power cord is so long that she joked she could plug it in and take it to another room to dry her hair.    It arrived in good condition in just a few days using standard shipping.  More than happy to give this transaction five stars.</li>
    <li> Excelente! This dryer is light, strong, it makes hair shine, cuts half of the time of drying. I&#x27;m a professional and I definetely recomend it for professionals.</li>
    <li> I was told by my hairstylist that this dryer would cut my blow drying time in half. My hair is thick and long, so that really appealed to me. With my boar&#x27;s round brush, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference. However, a friend recommended I buy a metal (thermal?) brush with holes in it for quicker drying time, and combining the new brush with the force and heat of the this new dryer, I HAVE cut my drying time in half AND my hair is softer and shinier. GAME CHANGER! When I used my new brush with my old dryer, it did not have the same effect, so it seems to be the combo of the dryer and brush for me. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Great for my small hands. Love it</li>
    <li> Very loud. Powerful.  Only works if you start it in cold? Not sure if mine is broken but you can&#x27;t use the low heat setting without using the cold setting as well.</li>
    <li> This dryer is smaller and lighter than I had expected.  I can travel with it easily, saving myself the hassle of getting a smaller, less functional travel dryer.  It also dries your hair in 5 minutes flat and does all the other great things other people have mentioned.</li>
    <li> Works really good.. Thought it was bigger though.. It has a small nozzle. But it definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit with diffuser of twin turbo 2600. Not a noticeable significant upgrade in power either form 2600.</li>
    <li> Very heavy but powerful, it leaves my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Buy this product after a period of use I am convinced that it is of very good quality. Power cord is very durable and of good quality. airflow is exceptional. controls are where they should be. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I was excited about getting this dryer after reading the reviews.  Ive been a hairdresser for 12 years so unfortunally i have carpal tunnel.  This blowdryer is heavier than it says and it is very loud.  At home use would be ok but in salon use....not so much.  I actually returned this dryer to amazon.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars for everything but it is heavy, that is the only down side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brand since my Beauty School Days, from salon work to freelance studio works, I&#x27;ve found this brand to be the best. The brand has yet to fail me.  It continues to be the most popular salon brand among the stylist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 months and love it so far!  I have no problems with the nozzle falling off, it blows my hair dry in 1/2 the time it took before, and my hair feels so much softer!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This dryer at it highest setting does not have power.  It is painfully slow and not at all hot enough for me.  Great for less damage to hair, but is almost in the \\&quot;why bother\\&quot; category.  I am amazed to see the differing views - perhaps the last Turbo Power I had was superior and that is why this one doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I thought I had done my homework, but apparently not enough - I thought a 3500 would be faster than a 2500, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  Too bad the former didn&#x27;t last long - the cord was detaching from the base which is why I replaced it.</li>
    <li> The best blow dryer I have used so far.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer works just as it was described.  It is small and compact, so it&#x27;s much more easy to handle than drug store hairdryers.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone who has long, thick hair (I have long, very thick, dry and damaged hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to say that I will be a faithful Amazon customer for any products I need and Amazon carries.  I was blow drying my hair when the hairdryer fell to the floor and broke.  I contacted Amazon and, without even questioning me about why the hairdryer broke, Amazon replaced it at no charge and it was delivered in two days!  I am extremely impressed with Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.  I really appreciate your customer service.</li>
    <li> The only thing about this hair dryer that prevented me from giving it a 5 star rating, is the cord. The hair dryer is lightweight and powerful. My hairdresser recommended this to me to purchase for my home use. I wanted the same results at home as I get when I leave the salon. I&#x27;m not disappointed and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with this hair dryer.  I thought it would be bigger than it was and it just doesn&#x27;t have the power I thought it should have.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is so efficient. Even though it is a little heavy it gives you the salon look. It dries quick without frizz.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001UHN0OA Twinturbo 3500 Professional Hair Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hair dryer burned out in less of a year. I did not even use it every day. Very expensive for such a low quality.</li>
    <li> It is a good hair dryer, has a good size and gets enough hot.  I was very pleased with that.  On the other side, it is true that the nozzle is falling off very often, and the bad review is that it only lasted 1.5 years .  I used it for home purpose only and just for me, so I didn&#x27;t give it as much use as in a professional salon, and this is suposed to be a professional hair dryer.. for the money I spent on it, I would have expected it to last longer.  It just stopped working one day.. and it was dead.  I will reconsider spending again on this pricey model. Ths is the reason why I don&#x27;t give it 4 or 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Well, I had a Turbo 1500 for a long time until it died. Then I made my research and found this new and powerful version of Twin Turbo 3500. So, I wanted ti invest in something good. I do my own hair at home, and my hair is curly. I finished to dry my hair so fast. I just  love this Twin Turbo 3500 and it worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> works great heats up sooo fast!!</li>
    <li> the twinturbo 3500 professional hair dryer, works great, dries quick, however it stays hot and takes about 15 minutes to cool down</li>
    <li> The product has worked very well, the speed by which you smooth hair is good .. my wife is a hairdresser and is very happy with the product because you are saving time to dry your hair ... for the price you pay worth paying.</li>
    <li> Loved this hair dryer - very powerful and hot, and great for styling hair.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it stopped working after just 18 months of very average use. Warranty is only 1-year.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer ever!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this blow dryer.  Considering the high price and great reviews, I expected much more.  Some said it cut drying time in half, but I didn&#x27;t find this to be true.  It works great, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.  It&#x27;s kind of heavy and it took a little getting used to as far as the different balance of the weight.  I don&#x27;t think I would pay this much for my next hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! my hair stylist told me about it and, I am glad I listened. I don&#x27;t think I have ever had a better hair dryer before. It&#x27;s very powerful but, doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I still use the flat iron but, only on very humid days. For the most part, I am out the door in 15 to 20 minutes - I have lots of hair and, it is long. Love it!</li>
    <li> i like it  ,work very good,i will recommend it yo my friends,I&#x27;m sure they will love it like me+  good price.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer on the market -- dries fast and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> i bought this product about a year now and i have to say there are other blowers that work better than this one that are way cheaper for the price it has a high pressure of hair coming out and it is light but it does not silk the hair no matter how much you go over the same section of hair i would not buy agian. and yes i am a dominican hair stylish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a great quality hair dryer and decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews. This product is every bit as AWESOME as people have said!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! I have shoulder length, curly hair and this dryer cuts my drying time in half. Worth every single penny!!!!</li>
    <li> I had another Turbo blow dryer that my mom gave me and she had it for a while now. I decided to change it since I felt like it was not powerful enough. I&#x27;m Dominican with curly hair and I do my own hair. I love this blow dryer. I read all the reviews before buying it and was scare but decided to try it. I have not had any problems with the caps like others say and this blower gets really hot, which is amazing because it reduces drying time by a lot. I love that is smaller so it fits better in my drawer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and have purchased this dryer two times. My old one broke but I use it every day all day and had it for two years. The new one seems improved from last time with a better sturdier power chord. It&#x27;s super powerful and light and heats up to the perfect temp hot but not overly hot. Overall I love it and it makes my job easier!</li>
    <li> gran secador alta velocidad gran desempeño  tengo otro anterior a este modelo ahora no tengo de que preocuparme en mi salon tengo todo lo que neesito seca rapido antes d elo programado y durable pelo</li>
    <li> great blow dryer! my hair stylist recommended this product. very powerful, dries hair very quickly. perfect perfect perfect...and not too heavy to hold</li>
    <li> My hairstylist uses this dryer and told me I could get it online...it has a shorter &#x27;nose&#x27; that is easier for me to style my hair...I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer! Handles well, dries the hair fast, very easy to control. The only negative...its a little heavy. Love it and would recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> I purchased thi dryer from Amazon based on reviews.  My wife loves it.  It is light and powerful.  A real professional hair dryer.  Subsequently I purchased on for my daughter, who also said she has never had one even close to this.  She said iit makes her hair as when she goes to the beauty parlor.  I plan to purchase one for my other two daughters.  A superior product.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this blow dryer. I have been getting my hair blown out by Dominican women aka the blow out queens for ages and I myself am a stylist. This was not powerful enough at all! I proceeded to test it out on my sister. I had to stop and finish with my babyliss. I was sooo excited for this. I will be returning</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.  My wife claims she never knew a blow dryer could make such a change in the way you style your hair.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVEDD MY BLOWDRYER .I ALWAYS BEEN USEING TWINTURBO  BLOWDRYER BUT I LOVE HOW LIGHT THIS IS AND EVEN MORE POWERFUL.</li>
    <li> this was recommended by my hairdresser and it is all I expected.  It dries my hair!!!  faster and most likely won&#x27;t konk out in a few years.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to spend this much money on a hair dryer, and I am so happy I did.  I have always purchased the cheaper drug store ones and they not worth it- my hair is so much smoother and healthier with this dryer!</li>
    <li> My mom is a cosmetologist &amp; has always supplied me with professional grade dryers for my thick, heavy hair. This one works better than any other professional dryer I have tried. The cost was more reasonable too.</li>
    <li> I just hate it! I gave away my Babyliss thinking this one is better. What a mistake!!! When I use it my hair gets opaque. I&#x27;m very disappointment and is too late to return it.</li>
    <li> A stylist recommended this to me as it is the model they use.  It is lightweight, compared to what I had been using, is super powerful and does my hair faster.</li>
    <li> A bit noisy.did not like this item.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer, this really straightens out my natural hair quiet nicely. Can get really hot so be careful, I only use once a week or every other week since too much heat can damage your hair natural or not.</li>
    <li> Such a great tool! It makes hair drying much faster, and my hair never stays curly. It drys almost all straight.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth every penny. professional hair dryer with professional results. Cuts time spent in the bathroom drying my hair</li>
    <li> I work in a high end salon. I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.</li>
    <li> Lightweight for the salon quality it is.  Durable and not too big.  This hair dryer replaced an older super solano dryer that the pieces were falling off.  Comes with different width nozzles.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I purchased it!</li>
