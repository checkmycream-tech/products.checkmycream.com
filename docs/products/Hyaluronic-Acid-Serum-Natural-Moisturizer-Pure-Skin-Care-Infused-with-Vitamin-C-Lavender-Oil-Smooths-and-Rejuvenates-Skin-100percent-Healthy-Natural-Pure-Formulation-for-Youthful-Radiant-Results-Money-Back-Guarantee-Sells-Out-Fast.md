      <li>I&#x27;ve been going out without my foundation on and still cant believe how good my skin looks.</li>

      <li>I love the lavender fragrance also.  </li>
      <li>Great for older skin like mine.</li>
      <li>At 57, I have tried many OTC products to help reduce fine lines, wrinkles, skin tone, etc.</li>
      <li>I read the good reviews and decided to try this product as it was reasonably priced and appeared to be a good natural product to try.  </li>
      <li>It evens out my skin tone and seems to reduce those fine lines at the corners of my eyes.</li>
      <li>my skin is noticeably softer and my fine lines are diminishing .</li>
      <li>your goal is smooth, healthier (as in moisturized and not dead-looking; not an acne miracle or anything)</li>
      <li>It does go on smooth and I like the consistency, but effect was not there for me.  </li>
      <li>So far, I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I use it at night or in the morning and then use my normal sun screen moisturizer on top of it.</li>
      <li>Very light, not heavy or greasy and noticeable results</li>
      <li>Goes on very silky and helps to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It is light weight, but very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>though the serum is light weight, it&#x27;s still very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I do not have wrinkles, but pores and laugh lines are a bit of a problem</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this serum is worth the price considering the amount of product that&#x27;s in the bottle.</li>
      <li>also got my package pretty quickly, which is always a bonus.</li>
      <li>yes, you need to get off Amazon right now and go find a genie.</li>
      <li>Something I had not expected, but really love, is the lavender oil in it.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>It makes makes my face feel so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Have finished using  the first bottle but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in marionette lines or labial folds.  </li>
      <li>This is the first hyaluronic acid product that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so I read a TON of reviews before actually buying this product.</li>
      <li>The packaging is very nice except that the label feels sticky if your hands are the least bit damp.  </li>
      <li>I have seen immediate results, especially a reduction of pores since I have large pores that are more pronounced when I apply makeup.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly and absorbs fast, leaving a soft, silky feel to my skin.</li>
      <li>then push one pump of this stuff onto my fingers, then rub it into my face gently in circles.</li>
      <li>Come on, people, this is the real world.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Have you spent years in the sun, exposing your skin to wind, and UV rays, which you think a couple of applications of some serum will magically make disappear?</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Every night (occasionally in the morning), I wash my face briefly (honestly, half the time, I just splash water on my face and call it good)</li>
      <li>Can I get another at half price?  :)</li>
      <li>I am 59 years old and my skin has improved in a positive way.  </li>
      <li>Now, and fine lines I have aren&#x27;t so pronounced, and my skin doesn&#x27;t look as dead as it did the first couple days</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel very moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>like I normally have to do with a normal moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My neck has always seemed dry, but this serum makes it feel soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Yes, over time, with tender care and the right nourishment, your skin will very likely improve.</li>
      <li>I had no unrealistic hopes--my goal was simply to have well-moisturized skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and people always guess me to be in my early forties.</li>
      <li>I also have sensitive skin and found this to have NO harsh or problematic ingredients, and did not irritate my skin....</li>
      <li>As I said before, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
      <li>Product doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, however, but would like to see some results soon.</li>
      <li>Are you 60 years old and expecting your skin to look 20?</li>
      <li>I got a little while ago (those little baby travel size things you get at inns/motels/hotels, which don&#x27;t typically have a great track record for actually doing well at moisturizing).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far im seeing results.</li>
      <li>Most have left me disappointed with the results and the good money wasted.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really remember what other purposes this serum is supposed to have.</li>
      <li>I see some positive change but still not sure it&#x27;s completely because of the serum.</li>
      <li>Your skin may feel soft and supple instead of dry and rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last couple weeks on my face, and I must say that my face is considerably less dry than the rest of me right now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product only 5 days and I can begin to see a difference.  Dead skin is flaking and I don&#x27;t look so &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34;.  The deep wrinkles are beginning to soften and are not so noticeable.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what I will look like in a month.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I combine it with Estée lauder revitalizing supreme. My acne is gone my skin is noticeably softer and my fine lines are diminishing . I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far im seeing results. It&#x27;s good for the backs of the hands too;•}</li>
    <li> This is the best serum for the money. My skin has shown a great improvement. Great for older skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for some results in using this product, but found nothing after 4-6 weeks of use.  It does go on smooth and I like the consistency, but effect was not there for me.  I also have sensitive skin and found this to have NO harsh or problematic ingredients, and did not irritate my skin....that itself is a bonus!</li>
    <li> Are you 60 years old and expecting your skin to look 20? Have you spent years in the sun, exposing your skin to wind, and UV rays, which you think a couple of applications of some serum will magically make disappear? Do you want freckles, age spots, wrinkles, pimples, moles, and scars to just fade away overnight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the answers to any of these are yes, you need to get off Amazon right now and go find a genie. Or maybe a fairy godmother. Come on, people, this is the real world. Skin is a living organ. Hyaluronic acid is food for your skin. It is not magic. It is not voodoo. It is not a miracle drug. Yes, over time, with tender care and the right nourishment, your skin will very likely improve. You may look two years younger, not thirty years younger. Your skin may feel soft and supple instead of dry and rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product does NOT do:&lt;br /&gt;Take twenty years off your face.&lt;br /&gt;Erase the effects of bad care overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Make you look like a model.&lt;br /&gt;Style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Clothe you in designer dresses.&lt;br /&gt;Make stars fall down from the sky, every time you walk by.&lt;br /&gt;Win you a date with some Hollywood hunk.&lt;br /&gt;Do your dishes and laundry.&lt;br /&gt;Usher in an age of unilateral world peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry. It just nourishes your skin without clogging pores. That&#x27;s it. You want more, try wishing on a star.</li>
    <li> This serum is great! It is light weight, but very moisturizing. I love the smell - it reminds me of being at a spa which is relaxing. A little of this goes a long way, so the bottle should last a long time. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 4 weeks, and notice my pores look smaller, and I have big pores!  I use a 7 day scrub on my face in the shower before applying and cetaphil cleanser in the morning before applying.  As far as the wrinkles, not really anything noticeable to my eye, and I am 48, so I have some wrinkles I have been hoping to help disappear!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It does not have a perfume odor and it is not greasy.  It goes on smoothly and feels great.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Can I get another at half price?  :)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very moisturized and soft. Goes on very silky and helps to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see the benefit of this  on my skin. i don&#x27;t see that it increases hydration. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> this product is amazing my skin feels much younger and smother i would definitely recommend  this product and&lt;br /&gt;i will purchase another one</li>
    <li> until I used the product for a long time. The verdict is....I love it!. I use it at night or in the morning and then use my normal sun screen moisturizer on top of it. My skin is smoother and healthier and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Have finished using  the first bottle but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in marionette lines or labial folds.  Hoping that the 2nd bottle will show some improvement.  Product doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, however, but would like to see some results soon.</li>
    <li> I read the good reviews and decided to try this product as it was reasonably priced and appeared to be a good natural product to try.  I have been using about 2 weeks now and must say that it is more than I hoped for.....my dry skin appears smoother and my lines &amp; wrinkles appear &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34;.  The dark circles under my eyes have also lightened up so I am very happy with this product.  Another plus, is that my skin no longer gets greasy from moisturizer like it used to, this product seems to help my skin retain the moisture without that greasy feel.  I am 59 years old and my skin has improved in a positive way.  As I said before, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
    <li> I see some positive change but still not sure it&#x27;s completely because of the serum. I&#x27;m still a little skeptical</li>
    <li> Okay, so I read a TON of reviews before actually buying this product. I had no unrealistic hopes--my goal was simply to have well-moisturized skin. I don&#x27;t really remember what other purposes this serum is supposed to have. HOWEVER, I came home for the winter to Reno, NV where it is cold and DRY. Thankfully, the bottle was allowed on my carry-on. Every night (occasionally in the morning), I wash my face briefly (honestly, half the time, I just splash water on my face and call it good) then push one pump of this stuff onto my fingers, then rub it into my face gently in circles. I don&#x27;t put it on my eyelids though because there&#x27;s a warning about it getting into/around your eyes, so CAREFUL. Then, afterwards, I&#x27;ve just been applying some hotel lotion I got a little while ago (those little baby travel size things you get at inns/motels/hotels, which don&#x27;t typically have a great track record for actually doing well at moisturizing). I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last couple weeks on my face, and I must say that my face is considerably less dry than the rest of me right now. My hands are a nightmare, but I am incredibly smooth, which makes me happy. Now, and fine lines I have aren&#x27;t so pronounced, and my skin doesn&#x27;t look as dead as it did the first couple days I was here (when I wasn&#x27;t using the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your goal is smooth, healthier (as in moisturized and not dead-looking; not an acne miracle or anything) then I recommend this product. Especially if it is still like 80% off in price like it was when I bought it. But you have to pot lotion on after you apply this. Think of it as a booster to catalyze the moisturizing effect from your lotion (or other type of moisturizer).</li>
    <li> I thought I would have to wait a while before replying to see results. However, I have been using the product for about 3 days now and in a word, it is &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;. I have seen immediate results, especially a reduction of pores since I have large pores that are more pronounced when I apply makeup. So far, I am very pleased. I do not have wrinkles, but pores and laugh lines are a bit of a problem and I can already see a big difference. I have also noticed that overall, my skin looks rejuvenated, younger, smoother, and is softer. In conclusion, I have nothing but great things to say. Thank you for a great product. I will be purchasing more in the&lt;br /&gt;future. If anything changes, I will send another message.</li>
    <li> This is the first hyaluronic acid product that I&#x27;ve used.  It makes makes my face feel so smooth and soft. I love the lavender fragrance also.  The packaging is very nice except that the label feels sticky if your hands are the least bit damp.  Not sure why this would happen but it is no problem.</li>
    <li> Very light, not heavy or greasy and noticeable results</li>
    <li> My daughter found this product for me. I ordered it and have been using it in conjunction with my Derma Roller and I love the results my skin looks amazing. I&#x27;m 50 years old and people always guess me to be in my early forties. I&#x27;ve been going out without my foundation on and still cant believe how good my skin looks.</li>
    <li> At 57, I have tried many OTC products to help reduce fine lines, wrinkles, skin tone, etc. Most have left me disappointed with the results and the good money wasted. But I was very pleased with this product. It applies smoothly and absorbs fast, leaving a soft, silky feel to my skin. It evens out my skin tone and seems to reduce those fine lines at the corners of my eyes. My neck has always seemed dry, but this serum makes it feel soft and smooth.  Something I had not expected, but really love, is the lavender oil in it. For me, it is very refreshing and cooling, which is a plus at my age.  I will be using this for a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple weeks now and I really like it. It&#x27;s very light weight, which is perfect for the summer. The packaging is durable and sleek, and I feel like you get a lot of product for the price. All I need is one pump of the serum to cover my entire face, so I think this bottle will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the serum is light weight, it&#x27;s still very moisturizing. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to reapply the serum later in the day to the dry patches on my face like I normally have to do with a normal moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got my package pretty quickly, which is always a bonus. I hate when I buy things like makeup or skincare online and have to wait forever for them to arrive. Not an issue with this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this serum is worth the price considering the amount of product that&#x27;s in the bottle. Definitely happy with my purchase!!</li>
