      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect affordable sunscreen for my sensitive, acne-prone, somewhat oily skin.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>

      <li>I really love to wear this sunblock under my make-up.  </li>
      <li>I use it when I know I will be out in the sun most of the day.</li>
      <li>; I think it would make makeup stick rather than run off, but I haven&#x27;t tried it with anything to know for sure.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Have found this to be the best daily sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The Banana Boat seems to sting the skin around my eyes more, but also hasn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The packaging on this is a disaster. I couldn&#x27;t get the sunscreen out, and by the time I&#x27;d poked enough holes in the top to make the sunscreen come out, it was a total loss. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> I love this zinc/titanium sunscreen for sensitive skin!  It doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes and doesn&#x27;t sting on my face or body.</li>
    <li> Great under makeup!  Very light dry finish.  Really perfect.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin that reacts to many products and is prone to break outs. This sunscreen is absolutely amazing as it does not break me out. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on the face, doesn&#x27;t leave oiliness after being applied either. That means you can wear it under makeup without a problem. This sunscreen is awesome on top of being very affordable.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  This was recommended by my dermatologist.  It does not sting the eyes and goes on easy. It goes on white and blends in but it has a white tint to it unless you put makeup over it. You don&#x27;t need to use much and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Good coverage but leave white residue</li>
    <li> Remember, \\&quot;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot;. It&#x27;s best to wet and then pat-dry face before using, then this will lock the moisture into your skin. No odor. Non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin, and this makes my skin look white and flakey.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and don&#x27;t break out or itch like with other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Great price, quick service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a hundred sunscreens on my face and finally I have a non-greasy, non-white amazing product that actually works.  I have very fair skin and burn super easily...I put this on in the morning and can go all day in the sun without getting a sunburn.  I even used it on the part in my hair....once rubbed in...couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d used it.  I will continue to use this product as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> I agree with everyone else-this is a wonder product and I&#x27;m so happy to have found my perfect sunscreen. I LOVE IT. Works great under moisturizer and then makeup, works great every day, and I only use a few drops so the tiny bottle will last (even though I have the urge to stock up on my new favorite thing because I don&#x27;t want to think of them discontinuing it!)  I&#x27;ve had it now for a few months and it still feels as heavy as when I got it. I got this small 3oz tube at CVS for ~$14 in the spring but just saw it there on sale today for ~$7. Go buy it today, you&#x27;ll thank me.     Glad to see more and more physical sunscreens available at the drugstore. Physical/mineral based sunscreens work for my sensitive skin while chemical based sunscreen gives me hives.     As a side I also use Aveeno Sun Natural Protection Sunblock with Mineral Block SPF 30 on my body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for years trying to find a sunblock that has everything I wanted all in one product to use daily with my moisturizer and makeup: physical sunblock (vs irritating chemicals), blocks UVA and UVB rays, lightweight, oil-free AND non-greasy, does not worsen acne prone skin (non-comedogenic), and reasonable price. This sunblock is all of the above. There is a bit of whiteness once applies, but it seems unnoticeable after a couple of minutes or after applying makeup. It&#x27;s hard to find this product in lots of stores as of yet, so thank goodness for Amazon. Hopefully they&#x27;ll get more in soon and put it on the Subscribe &amp; Save discount. :D</li>
    <li> this is a good mineral sunscreen, maybe more suitable for woman when make up but for us guys will leave a white residue and our face will look like a geisha or gosth so unless you are a woman and wear make up SKIP THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended using a sunscreen that has the protection of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. This is one of the few that has both ingredients and it works great. Only issue is it leaves a pale white look on the skin after application.</li>
    <li> Wow, this offers excellent sun protection, without the irritation/burning eyes I get with chemical sunscreens, and no \\&quot;white face\\&quot; look, either. Love it!</li>
    <li> It leaves a white cast on my face... But it is a excellent chemical sunscreen!!!</li>
    <li> I guess this works. I&#x27;m not a scientist so I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;prove&amp;#34; it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and haven&#x27;t been sunburned or noticed any new brown spots. The smell is a little weird. It barely leaves any white on my face and it works OK under makeup.</li>
    <li> HG sunscreen! Works great, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does leave a slight whitish cast but that&#x27;s fixed with a light application of powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face, neck, and chest. I&#x27;ll often put it on my hands, too, but I really don&#x27;t like it for that because it can be pretty drying around my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be a sad day when they stop making this. :(</li>
    <li> Love Neutrogena liquid sunscreens!!!  This version uses mineral sunblock, which can generally look kabuki.  But this&lt;br /&gt;spreads easily and evenly, giving just a slight white tint.  And it is less greasy then the chemical version which I use spf 70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this drier texture better to put foundation and makeup over.  My new favorite Neutrogena sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is by far the best one I&#x27;ve seen and used so far.  I love that it is so light on your skin and makeup goes over it like it was invisible.  It does leave your skin a bit whitish at first but the whiteness goes away after it gets fully absorbed (which is quite quickly).  Now, if only Neutrogena would become cruelty-free, that would make this the perfect product.</li>
    <li> I tried to convert to this product after years of using Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer Liquid sunblock in the interest of using physical sunscreen instead of chemical.  But even this (though it is better than most physical blocks out there) leaves a white cast to the skin and a line of demarkation around the jawline and hairline.  I have tried rubbing it in more carefully, but it just can&#x27;t compare to the invisible and lightweight finish of the Ultra Sheer.  People have actually commented on the white line around my face, thinking I accidentally got something on my face.  I guess this is trade-off with physical sunscreen.  But on my face, I really prefer something that is invisible.  Will not purchase this again.  The pluses are that it is less obvious some other brands out there.  And the formula is nice and light, smooth, and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> $$16.00 smallest bottle I&#x27;ve ever seen rip off</li>
    <li> This stuff had such an awful smell I couldn&#x27;t bear to use it. And those types of things don&#x27;t usually bother me. It&#x27;s really that bad.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen to be worn every day under my makeup. It&#x27;s really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make me oily, or cause me to break out. It does have a white tint, but as long as you let it soak in for 5-10 minute it isn&#x27;t noticeable. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an expert on sensitive skin products.  I&#x27;m also insanely sensitive to nearly everything. My Asperger&#x27;s, genes, sensitive skin, Roscia, and ADD are who to give thanks for that .! I have no dermatology degree but, in this department I intimidate them big time. With that said, I try nearly everything I rate that claims it&#x27;s unscented or sensitive skin and actually seams to be. I do this for everything except some makeup.  Detergents, skin products, eye masks, clothing, hair products, bedding, ect. Unlike Paula Begone for example who doesn&#x27;t but, who also knows her stuff. ! She&#x27;s impressed but my knowledge too. With that said this is the best price around for this and this product has a couple impressive ingredients and doesn&#x27;t have too many overall , which is great.! The only known ingredient that concerns me is Magnesuim Sulfate. It is VERY drying. Also, I have heightened senses, but  this has a slight smell on application and after of an unscented bug spray ( the only way I know how to describe it) . Yuck!  Truly unscented and fragrance free products still can have a slight smell to them. But, there only of product ingredient scents. That should be irritant free and healthy for everyone.  Bug spray scent to humans is unhealthy. Another weird thing is there are two unknown ingredients in this product,  The other ingredients I know what they are fortunately and none are regular ingredients in bug spray that would cause that slight scent.  Instead I recommend Elta MD Sport Skin care lotion which is a lot better. I tried this, and like I said, it does some of what it claims while it dries u up and smells a little really bad. One more thing, on application and a little after it too. It makes my face and neck get a burning feeling too.!</li>
    <li> Looks worryingly white out of the tube, but just disappears when it goes on. Not greasy at all. The best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had. LOVE this stuff. Would absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday sunscreen to wear alone or under makeup. Similar to those produced by Kheil&#x27;s and Clarins - but nearly a third of the price. It contains titanium dioxide - which I have found difficult to find in a non-department store brand. This product glides on nearly as smoothly as Clarins but I believe due to the zinc oxide requires a little more attention to detail as it tends to look white unless distributed evenly. If you are familiar with the wonderful fragrance of Clarins SPF - herbal/plant like - this will smell much more like your drugstore brand SPFs. This is why I gave it four stars - possibly an unfair comparison - but fragrance is something I consider when purchasing items for my face. However, the \\&quot;pool side\\&quot; fragrance does not last long - in fact I do not notice it once it is completely distributed across my face and neck. For the price - this is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product dries out my skin completely. It makes my skin look dry and flaky. The liquid is not easy to spread around on my face. It leaves behind some white residue on my skin. I also notice that it leaves a slight white cast on my face. The instructions for the product mentions that the product &amp;#34;layers well under moisturizers.&amp;#34; It does not! The product makes it hard for my skin to absorb my moisturizer. My moisturizer just ends up as a film on my face. The product also has a slight sunscreen scent that I can&#x27;t stand. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I love the lightness of this, and this is the most comparable to oriental sunscreens, with the Ethanol, it sinks right in!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to wear under make-up for sun protection.  Absolutely NON greasy.  You don&#x27;t even know you are wearing it.  So glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> Will not leave a white residue when blended in well and did not dry out my skin. I have very dry skin so I moisturize then wait a couple of minutes and apply this. Wait another couple of minutes then apply foundation. It did not make me greasy or effect the foundation at all. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen for faces. I am allergic to most sunscreen but can comfortably wear this. Feels more like regular face lotion and less like sunscreen that any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I use this year round under make up.  I have no issues with my lotions rolling or not mixing well.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this in November. I could not find it in my area probably because people don&#x27;t use sunblock in the winter here. Looked on Amazon and found it. I&#x27;m very happy with the product, not oily and works well under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Wonderful consistency. Very smooth and easy to apply, definitely more liquid than most sunscreens. Great product! If it came I a bigger bottle and had a pump for ease of use I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Non greasy instantly absorbed and protected my skin after laser surgery whilst in the very hot sun in turkey. I would recommend this especially for those with spot prone skin</li>
    <li> Putting on sunblock everyday (even during winter) is extremely important; it prevents wrinkles, dark spots, and of course sun damage. Even though putting on sunblock is crucial, I hated putting them on because most of them tend to have sticky and heavy texture. My skin felt much more oily afterwards and it is THE WORST during summer when I&#x27;m sweating a lot more. I tried on many brands from Aveeno, Clinique, and this one brand that I do not remember the name of. By far, this one seems to be the BEST among those. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel sticky and heavy! My face does not feel oily AT ALL. Of course it feels weird when you first put it on (all sunblocks have that weird texture) but after 3 minutes or so, it feels like you don&#x27;t have anything on! I read some reviews that said he or she got white streaks. However, I&#x27;ve never experienced it myself. I&#x27;m loving this sunblock! I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I love this product no creasy look and feel it is worth every penny</li>
    <li> This is hard for me to find locally - it is always sold out because it is the best sunscreen.  It has a titanium dioxide base but, it is not oily or greasy. I wear it everyday under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive reactive skin and this product is very compatible to my skin type.  It absorbs quickly and leaves a soft, non greasy finish, ready for your moisturizer.  I will buy again and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered these sunscreens based on recommend from Consumer Report which is always my trust source. This product is good,  I don&#x27;t feel heavy or oily white as the other products.  I orders 4 bottles (in good size) for myself and my daughter and she likes it very much. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> i love this light sunscreen formula, absorbs so well and the package is easy to travel and easy to use</li>
    <li> My step daughter has been allergic to every sunblock we have tried, I finally went online and looked for a product that was paba free and we found this by neutrogena and it works great! My step daughter is so fair that she burns in minutes in the sun and has had to avoid the beach and sunlight for so long. Now she can enjoy it and being 19 who would want to have to avoid the beach..</li>
    <li> great and nice small size</li>
    <li> This is the only straight SPF product I put on my face. I have super sensitive skin and most sunblocks burn and sting badly.  This does not sting at all, keeps my very fair skin from burning, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I shook the tiny bottle before opening it but when I poured some on my hand, a very watery substance came out and it was difficult to spread on my skin.  The next time, I vigourously shook the bottle several times before attempting to use.  This time the product came out more like a lotion but still a little difficult to apply as it does not glide on like a lotion does.  The product protects well but between having to shake the bottle like crazy and the extremely small size, I will not order this again.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy, dries instantly into almost nothing, no smell, good value for the price, can be applied over a moisturizer if needed, no chemical sunscreens, no whiteness if you don&#x27;t overdo it. I love it.</li>
    <li> After seeing this product recommended on the DR OZ program I decided to try it. It goes on completely clear so there&#x27;s no staining or sheen its absolutely the best sunblock I have ever used.</li>
    <li> easy to use&lt;br /&gt;not heavy.i use it as a moisturizer before makeup&lt;br /&gt;it works..great price&lt;br /&gt;easy to take with you</li>
    <li> STOP USING THIS~I have been using this for years and slathering it all over my kids! IT contains one of the highest levels of Oxybenzone - a benzophenone - which is an endocrine disruptor!  It interferes with the hormone system which causes cancer and recurrence in women who have already had a bout with breast cancer, ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer.  It also contains retinal palmitate, a form of Vitamin A found to accelerate cancer in high doses applied to the skin!!!!  It&#x27;s infuriating!</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It almost feels a little chalky, which I find very refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn when it runs in my eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off. The only drawback is that it leaves a faint white tint, so I put on some bronzer over it. It&#x27;s marketed as being perfect under makeup, and I agree it would be; I think it would make makeup stick rather than run off, but I haven&#x27;t tried it with anything to know for sure. I only use it on my face because of the price, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this, and will buy it again when I run out. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have sensitive skin and sm wary of products to use on my face as it would easily cause breakouts. Not this one though!</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. Thanks! A+++++++++</li>
    <li> Good price for a quality product</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product.  I use it when I know I will be out in the sun most of the day.It definitely give you the protection you need.  However, I do not love it, as it makes your skin look white, and you have to cover with makeup, as it does emphasize the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great for outdoor sports.  I think that it is effective because I haven&#x27;t freckled or colored at all, after using for 2 months for daily biking.  The water-resistant formula can feel suffocating on sweaty skin (your sweat will bead well).  It can also be overly drying on dry skin, so I layer over moisturizer when I&#x27;m dry.  It washes off easily with any regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any stinging or irritation at all when applied.  Currently labeled &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; by Paula&#x27;s Choice beautypedia for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if I wear this product for a few hours at a time, it will clog and irritate my pores and cause acne.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish there was a less suffocating non-water-resistant formula for everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect affordable sunscreen for my sensitive, acne-prone, somewhat oily skin. Chemical sunscreens make me break out, so I&#x27;ve limited myself to physical sunblocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is a liquid (as expected), has no scent, and has a somewhat grainy texture. Kind of like very fine sand mixed with milk. I can&#x27;t really comment on its sun protection as I didn&#x27;t test it on any long days in the sun, but it does seem good for my sensitive skin. It didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts as far as I can tell, and only stings my face a little. It leaves a moderate white cast (hard to avoid with physical sunblocks). My main complaint is with its texture. When trying to blend it into my face it balls up like an old sweater, leaving little white thread-like things all over my face. When it dries it often leaves my face looking flaky. It is not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve been told that the balling up might be due to a reaction with some other facial product that I use, so it may work better for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recently bought Banana Boat Natural Reflect physical sunblock, to compare. Both these sunscreens are similar in price, though the Banana Boat gives you slightly more. The Banana Boat is much thicker than the Neutrogena and also much greasier. It has a kind of traditional sunscreen-like smell. Both leave a similar white cast. The Banana Boat seems to sting the skin around my eyes more, but also hasn&#x27;t made me break out. Compared to the Neutrogena, the Banana Boat goes on much easier, and has a nicer texture with none of the weird balling or flaking effect that I got with the Neutrogena. I would probably choose Banana Boat over this Neutrogena product, but I would not recommend the same for someone with very oily skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen online after I was unable to find it in stores. It contains physical blockers (titanium 5% and zinc oxide3%)  instead of chemical blockers which is what my dermatologist recommended for my skin. Although the sunscreen goes on white, it does soak in quickly and does not affect how my makeup wears. I often put a moisturizer on over it as well. It does not drip if I become sweaty.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that (a) I would be getting a liquid sunscreen not a watered down sunscreen. Sure, I guess it still qualifies as liquid because it is fluid but I was thinking clear liquid. I&#x27;d read a random scattering of reviews and most people had said that it went well with putting makeup or lotions on top which is what I was wanting to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coating of the sunscreen went on smoothly and *did* disappear into the skin with only the slightest tinge of white. However, the second I applied my lotion (a non-white lotion and not a cream), it immediately blazed pure white. I rubbed in as much as I could and wiped off the rest; kind of defeating the purpose of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it was good for my sensitive skin and did not aggravate it or cause any kind of reaction.</li>
    <li> Great.Thanks so much. Wish I could buy this OTC.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot for use on my face and ears.  I am 57 years old, male and live in Texas so I need everyday protection.  The liquid is nice consistency, spreads well has no odor.  It does leave a slight whitish tint to your face, but I&#x27;m at the point in my life where I don&#x27;t give a s*** what it looks like or what people think.  It will sweat off under heavy exertion which is a problem for me, but I don&#x27;t really have much choice.  I can&#x27;t use any of the chemical based sunscreens - they burn my eyes horribly.  I sometimes will use a Neutrogena cream type screen on my face when working outside to avoid sweating it off.  This liquid product is very light so I don&#x27;t really think you could call it waterproof or sweat proof.  I&#x27;ll ding Neutrogena for claiming that.  Otherwise, this is great stuff and I bet it&#x27;s really good for people to use under makeup.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using this product I started breaking out. I got under skin, big and painful pimples. I thought it was the stress. One day a friend asked me if I had started using a new product and I remembered the only new product that I had started was the Neutrogena pure &amp; free liquid daily sunblock. As soon as I stopped using I stopped getting pimples. After about 2 weeks, I used the product again, just to give it another chance. I put on the product on my face in the morning before going to work and by the afternoon I had a big painful pimple on my chin. So I decided to write this review. Don&#x27;t buy this product. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Well, this is my very first review and I must say, using this sunscreen really protects my face from getting sun spots especially on a tropical island where it&#x27;s always hot and sunny :) thank you!!! And it doesn&#x27;t disrupt my makeup....blends very well!!!</li>
    <li> I love that this does not make my skin burn or sting and has never caused any acne breakouts for me.  Most every sunscreen causes one or the other on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it because it still leaves that typical white cast all over my face.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to get rid of it without adding another product on top - makeup, serum, or moisturizer.  My serum really isn&#x27;t good enough, and sometimes I JUST want to let my skin breathe - no makeup and no extra gunk.  Imagine that chalky white film with nothing to disguise it.  Vegetable glycerin helps SOME, but I haven&#x27;t totally solved this problem yet.</li>
    <li> This goes on pretty smoothly and seems to last several hours.  However, by the end of the day, it often begins to separate from my skin a bit and you can see tiny white dots from some of my pores.  Maybe if I use some powder or other coverage over it, that won&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;m not much of a makeup girl.</li>
    <li> I found the review for this product on Paula&#x27;s Choice.  I have mild to moderate rosacea on my cheeks, and have been struggling to find the right formulation that doesn&#x27;t make it flare up.  I have tried so many products that are called &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t make my rosacea flare up!  So awesome!  It is not very moisturizing, however, not necessarily meant to be.  I have dry skin on my cheeks and around my eyes, otherwise normal to slightly oily skin in the summer.  I would recommend layering another moisturizer under this on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a good choice for normal to oily skin as a daily sunscreen to be worn under makeup with no additional moisturizer needed.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen out there.  Made with Titanium Dioxide, the best option for sunscreen as it physically blocks the rays.  Super lightweight, goes on easily, absorbs quickly and does not make you look pasty white.  There is no need to look for other sunscreen options, and there is no need to buy inferior chemical sunscreens - just buy this instead.</li>
    <li> Expensive. You can do better price wise and achieve the same results. The sun screen business is really fighting for your business since SPF is such a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use a physical block, not chemical as the chemical is absorbed into your skin.</li>
    <li> I use sunscreen all year &#x27;round. This is great under my moisturizer and keeps me from looking my age.</li>
    <li> This product is completely non-irritating and non-stinging on my sensitive skin, and layers well under foundation. It is not shiny or greasy. HOWEVER I am only giving it three stars because it makes my skin look ghost white. This is not a problem once I layer foundation over it, but I can&#x27;t wear it alone unless I want to be mistaken for Caspar. My search for the perfect sunscreen continues...</li>
    <li> Great protection, non-greasy feel, very minimal white cast.  However, I have dry skin.  This made things worse and made my eyes tear up and burn.  I ended up using this just for my neck and hands.</li>
    <li> I used this for the entire summer and loved it. Can not say enough good about it. Its well rated by EWG. It left a surprising small about of white cast for the ingredients and the spf. I have greasy skin and need something very light in the summer, I also like to boost my spf in the summer, and this was perfect. This product is slightly more expensive than the what I am use to paying but it was soo worth it to have the perfect product (plus you use just a little, i have some left over from my first bottle). Will definitely be using this in future summers!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s passable but I usually pass it up in favor of my Nuance moisturize with sunscreen whenever possible since Nuance has a nice smooth feel and this Neutrogena product feels a little heavy and gritty.  Plus, again, Neutrogena tests on animals, I learned. :(</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen is expensive and I&#x27;m looking for substitutes. This one blends in a lot better than most of the barrier lotions, but it is gritty enough that I don&#x27;t want to use it on the skin around my eyes, and not hurting my eyes is the reason I want the non-chemical sunscreen.  The texture is almost like those cleansing creams with tiny grains in them.</li>
    <li> Wife is allergic to regular sun screen.  Been using this product this past summer without issue.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for sensitive combo, oily, or slightly dry skin.</li>
    <li> This provides great coverage.  Did not bother my very sensitive skin.  No sunburn all day with my red hair/ blue eyed complexion.</li>
    <li> I heard Neutorgena discontinued....I hope not!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a good product for protecting my face, neck, arms and hands. Because of its size, I can easily bring it in my carryon and never has taken away at the airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I say something negative is that it leave a white hue on the face if you have a color like myself (olive medium), mixing with your liquid foundation (darker than usual) to create to fit to your skin tone.</li>
    <li> the dermatologist actually recommended it for me, cos my son has a sensitive skin and as i&#x27;m using this product it actually helps the rash on the face to go away more than what it was before.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for all skin types, especially sensitive, even young children. High spf and waterproof, goes on light and nonsticky.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to the other neutrogena products I&#x27;ve been using - the daily moisturizer with spf 70 or spf 50.  This looked good online.  However, it&#x27;s not the same thing.  It&#x27;s good and easy to apply as a sunscreen, so I gave it 4 stars to be fair, but there are cheaper bottles of sunscreen for your face.  It has a stronger sunscreen odor than the other daily product I use and leaves a white film on your face when applied.  I&#x27;ll keep it to use as sunscreen but won&#x27;t wear it when I go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to make others aware of the difference if you&#x27;re looking for what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve had skin cancer so my doc suggests I wear something every day.  I work in an office, not outside, so I don&#x27;t need something like this.  I&#x27;ll just go back to the other neutrogena daily moisturizers with spf.  They don&#x27;t smell as strong and are more suitable for every day use.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a Neutrogena Consultant.  Since my skin is highly sensitive to many ingredients in other sunscreen products, this really works.  My dermatologist recommends a high SPF and Neutrogena Pure and Free is SPF 50.  Spreads easily and smoothly over the face and works well under makeup.  Yes, I highly recommend it.  Only problem is its very difficult to find in stores and I had to order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Hypoallergenic and a great sum block to boot!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I mix it with my face lotion every morning and it is great, oil free and keeps me from getting any sun damage.</li>
    <li> It is my FAVORITE sunscreen of all time. I have used dozens of sunscreens at variable price points, but this one has consistently come out on top (Clarins UV is 2nd). I have very fair, oily, acne-prone skin and this sunscreen is the only one that keeps my oil + zits at bay while protecting me from the sun. It has a watery-like consistency to it and goes on very smoothly (even around the eyes), and is perfect under makeup.</li>
    <li> This is very good sunscreen. I used it last summer and planning to repurchase. There is almost no smell, perfect for my skin which is dry. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sunscreen for face I have ever used. In my opinion, this is on par if not better than Shisheido&#x27;s sunscreen but for a fraction of the price. It&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t have that horrible sunscreen smell. It&#x27;s easy to put on in that it comes in a liquid form making it very spreadable and even on my skin. It&#x27;s consistency is actually very similar to Shisheido&#x27;s emulsions! What&#x27;s more is that the the packaging is fairly small and easy to carry. I can sneak this into any purse in case I&#x27;m out in the sun for a prolonged period of time and need to reapply. I like to wear this under my make up and it does not have any negative interactions with foundation or blush. I highly recommend this for everyone.</li>
    <li> Have found this to be the best daily sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried. There is no odor or oily feel. While the container seems small at first it lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting my skin, which is what I was looking for.  Love the smith silky feel of the liquid doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.  You can apply powder foundation over it, which is hard to do with some other face sunscreens with a high spf as they are usually greasy and sticky.  Not so with this, so happy to find it!  I will say that when I get all hot and sweaty then apply it does sting a little bit, but my face gets red and pores open up a lot when I&#x27;m hot and exercising.  Otherwise love it.</li>
    <li> After researching about sunscreen, I found that SPF is not an indicator for strength but chemical that contains.  Zinc and Titanium are the most effective for preventing sun damages. I looked for a sunscreen with Zinc, since Titanium wouldn&#x27;t work for broader range of UV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neurtrogena Ultra Sheer had been my favorite because of dry feel, until I learned that the strength of protection from Helloplex is very weak. Now I know why I keep getting bad sun spots after being out side for hours. I needed reliable sunscreen since I started using at-home chemical peel. I bought this Pure &amp; Free liquid daily sunblock and Coppertone Sensitive Skin Faces 50 SPF, that has twice more Zinc and water proof, so that I could compare. Pure &amp; Free liquid daily sunblock has light feel but grainy, while Coppertone feels ticker and heavy.  After a couple of hours, though, both leaves same feel on skin. Both works fine when applying under makeup.</li>
    <li> I tried both this Neutrogena product, the Pure &amp; Free spf 50 and also Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer liquid sunblock, spf 70 and this one (Pure &amp; Free) is the only one I can use.  The regular ultra sheer liquid bothers my eyes and makes them very itchy by the end of the day. I try to keep it away from my eyes but it always seems to migrate there after it&#x27;s been on for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Pure &amp; Free and it never bothers my eyes no matter how long I have it on so it&#x27;s great for those of us with sensitivities.  I do think the Ultra Sheer liquid goes on a little smoother under my makeup but this one is a close second.  I&#x27;m so glad Neutrogena is continuing to make this formula with the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  I think the ingredients are more natural as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using this formula of sunscreen.  Plus, I like the fact that it&#x27;s reasonably priced compared to department store sensitive formula sunscreens that have almost the same ingredients.</li>
    <li> I like this as a more natural alternative to other suncare products for the face but for some reason the formula kind of &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34;...? I dunno, but I get some white flaky stuff after I&#x27;ve rubbed it in.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s a chemical free sunscreen and the light fluid texture that makes it easy to spread.  And keeps the freckles from getting worse. Even though I have fair olive skin, it does give me a slightly chalky cast because of the Titanium Dioxide (white powder) that is the active ingredient. I just use 1 shade darker foundation to compensate. I&#x27;d rather do that than use chemical sunscreens.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thin in consistency, so it makes me wonder if it is really providing good coverage.  I don&#x27;t agree with some of the other reviewers--it still leaves a white residue on the skin.  I have found physical sunblocks that blend in better, but are more difficult to find online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing the job, I think. It&#x27;s a bit hard to spread because of the consistency, but it&#x27;s not too greasy or smelly.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It isn&#x27;t too thick and feels clean. Great for under makeup or alone!</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is no-greasy but it is also drying to my face. I suppose that I could mix it with my moisturizer but I still much prefer Devita Rx UltraSolar 50. I will probably just use this Neutrogena sunscreen on other areas.</li>
    <li> am using this on my face right now; its not too heavy; you only have to use a small amount, otherwise you will look like Casper !!  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The BEST &amp; ONLY facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used and loved!!!  I have very sensitive, fair skin and not only is this a superior sunblock, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!!!  I use it everyday on a clean face under my make-up...it&#x27;s weightless and NON-GREASY!!!  I hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I have found this to cover nicely and do not have white remnants - just give it time to \\&quot;soak\\&quot; in.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a clear gel that wouldn&#x27;t leave pancake streaking like all conventional sunblocks. The only difference between this and regular Neutrogena sunblock is it&#x27;s more expensive and comes in a smaller tube with a handier dispenser.</li>
    <li> Works great! it is hard to find a sheer but effective chemical free sunscreen for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> works great but can reflect light in pics making my skin look like it is greasy white. But it works great, so I use it every day.&amp; it doesn&#x27;t degrade in sunlight because it is zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> SPF 50?  I don&#x27;t think so.  I applied this liberally in the AM, and took a 20 minute walk in the sunshine that afternoon.  I got sunburned.  In just 20 minutes.  I have noticed this problem with Neutrogena sunscreens; they claim a high SPF but don&#x27;t protect as well as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used that claim a lower SPF.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and you don&#x27;t know you have this on. I like that it is NOT a chemical sunscreen. Great price point...another brand w/ same ingredients sells for 3x more.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t take too good care of your skin.</li>
    <li> Finally a sunscreen for my kids which doesn&#x27;t make them cry!  It&#x27;s so great that the whole family uses it too.  So light weight that you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Just moved to Texas and the sun is STRONG here. My previous SPF 15 was not cutting it so I tried this new Neutrogena liquid out and so far I&#x27;ve been pleased with it. I went it onto my of morning facial serum &amp; moisturizer without it feeling too heavy or greasy. The liquid is easy to control since I hate wasting sunscreen due to the fact its so expensive.    Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product and happy to see that Neutrogena keeps coming out with better &amp; innovative products. I&#x27;ve been using their sunscreen since the &#x27;90s when they first came out and still trust them today.    The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the smell. I personally think it smells like a bottle of \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sunscreen. That beachy, chemical, heavy lotion smell, that&#x27;s what I think smells like but if that&#x27;s mean my face &amp; neck are protected, I&#x27;ll live with it. I don&#x27;t find the scent bothersome but if I do take a deep whiff (and really, how often will you do that?), it does smell like a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is my daily-use sunscreen. Being a follower of the EWG (Environmental working group), I&#x27;m aware of how bad can the &amp;#34;regular-sunscreens&amp;#34; chemicals be in long term use. Since I wear sunscreen on my face every single day of the year, I try to stay in the healthier choice.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, It leaves such a dry touch and long lasting sunscreen. Not oily or dense at all.</li>
    <li> 2 of us use this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For the person with dry skin, it blends in with no whitish cast. It does not feel greasy at all - on the contrary, it has a dry, powdery (almost gritty) feel.&lt;br /&gt;- For the person with combo skin, it does leave a white cast. But, it does not budge or irritate the eyes even with very heavy athletic activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we like it a lot and would buy it again</li>
    <li> Be aware that this product was discontinued by Neutrogena, and if you order it you will probably get an expired product.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and using sunscreen was becoming annoying since as soon as I would put it on I could feel it heavy on my skin. This stuff is great! It&#x27;s not greasy feeling and you can&#x27;t even feel it on after a min or so. It doesn&#x27;t smell nice but considering it&#x27;s so much better for your skin, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. It&#x27;s not like it smells bad, it just smells like product, no flowery scents here. I have been looking for sunscreen with as little chemicals as possible and this is working out great for me. I also have acne prone skin and this has not irritated my skin at all nor did it make me break out. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The SPF 50 is why I bought it. I&#x27;m trying to add fragrance but I have to say the &amp;#34;non-fragrance&amp;#34; of this product is strange. It does dry very quickly into the skin but is not a water resistance and some other Neutrogena products. The consistency reminds me of Shiseido&#x27;s Ultimate Sun Protection lotion, but the Neutrogena is not as water resistant and the Shiseido is more pleasant smelling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, but it goes a long way. I mix in a few drops with my  moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go. It&#x27;s nothing too heavy so that&#x27;s good, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> It protects me from sun burn. But it needs to be used with a moisturizer. Otherwise there will be white residues when you spread it over the skin.</li>
    <li> I was told by my Dermatologist that this brand of Neutrogena liquid was one of the best sun protections on our shelves here in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> That awful chemical smell, greasy too, this I found useless for humid weather.  I gave it away and would not buy it again</li>
    <li> I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN, CAN&#x27;T USE ANY OF THE CHEMICAL SPF INGREDIENTS ONLY ZINC OXIDE AND TITANIUM DIOXIDE.  THIS LIQUID HAS VERY LITTLE INGREDIENTS IN IT, SO IT GOES OVER MY REGULAR DAILY FACIAL CREAM WHICH I USE......I JUST LOVE IT.  I USE THIS EVERY DAY, EVEN IN THE WINTERTIME!  ESPECIALLY, GOOD OVER MAKEUP AND YOU ONLY NEED A DROP OF IT SO IT LASTS.</li>
    <li> Great product!! So I spent 2 weeks in Greece using this 1-2 times a day depending how much time I spent sweating or in the water and did not get burnt once (I do have fair skin that burns easy-but I am able to tan). Love this stuff. Did not cause any zits (and some sunscreens make me get zits). No oily so shinny skin unless you sweat-but at that point anyone has a shinny forehead. Does not drip into the eyes when sweating. No white residue unless you put a lot on (now my boyfriend also used it and sometimes he would get it on the days he did not shave-only along the beard area). LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use the daily moisturizer version of this in the winter, but in the summer--really half the year here--I use this. I cannot tolerate chemical sunblocks, and the other non-chemical blocks can be so greasy or occlusive they cause other problems or just a very shiny face for me. This is great. It does give me that blue-white titanium face, but a light dusting of a yellow-based powder or bronzer, and I&#x27;m good to go. It also works very well under foundations when I want to be more polished. It does not break out my face or clog my pores, or settle into them.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t irritate, but leaves a white cast and tight feel on the face.</li>
    <li> Great for after and during skin cancer treatment, offers best possible protection per Dermitolgiist.</li>
    <li> I wear this under my makeup every day. While not exactly lightweight, this is much lighter than a normal 100spf sunscreen and keeps my dry skin moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and most sun blocks give me allergies. I have been using this one for three weeks and I&#x27;ve been fine. Also, it is really light so I can use make up and not feel uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I really love to wear this sunblock under my make-up.  Very light weight, not too greasy, and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen for being high in quality and for being affordable. They used to sell them in Target and that was where I first tried it. Since then it&#x27;s been only available online. But I don&#x27;t mind the little extra effort to get this. It&#x27;s the best sunscreen for under makeup or not that I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunscreen that I have used that did not bother my sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or run/melt into my eyes when I get warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no greasy feel, it&#x27;s dry and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best sun block for the face on the market, by far, especially for sensitive skin. It does not irritate or feel greasy. I wish it were still available in stores.</li>
    <li> I use this sun cream every day on my face. I need something that is not thick and greasy and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> The product I was sent appears to have been manufactured in Canada. It has a different texture from the product I have bought in the US, and it does not provide a list of ingredients. That is a problem as I need to know exactly what I am putting on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have oily skin and was looking for a sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t add more oil to my skin nor function as a moisturizer - this is perfect.  It&#x27;s not oily and absorbs very quickly and easily into the skin without a lot of rubbing.  It leaves almost a matte finish on my face.  A small drop (dime size) covers the entire face.  It does not leave a noticeable white haze however I have fair skin so I can&#x27;t say if it would on darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> Very liquidey and light. Not hard to blend. I use this right after a toner and can use it near my eyes. Very useful product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and we found it on Amazon after trying it at a retail store. The price is much cheaper on Amazon.com and and even lower with subscribe and save. It goes on non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t clump up her makeup like other sunscreen products do.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. After I wash and dry my face each morning I use Neutrogena Pure and Free Liquid. My face is soft and ready for makeup. I am thankful that I can order it from Amazon at this price.</li>
    <li> not greasy and layers well under makeup  have used this for a long time, but it is hard to find.</li>
