      <li>I am not going to risk showering with it though, since cost wise</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift for my best friend who loves Full Metal Alchemist and she loves it.</li>
      <li>I say this item is very cute and a must-have for any FMA fan.</li>
      <li>But I love it!</li>
      <li>and I just love FMA!</li>
      <li>and i feel so amazing when wearing this necklace</li>
      <li>I received this necklace just 3 days after ordering it, so that&#x27;s already amazing on</li>
      <li>(Her own decision) Except for this necklace.</li>
      <li>I got mine took like 2 weeks to get here love the chain and the amulet</li>
      <li>and I enjoyed rubbing it in his face</li>
      <li>This necklace has outlasted a lot of things that cost way more than this.</li>
      <li>Seems to be pretty nice.</li>
      <li>im a huge fma fan</li>
      <li>The only problem I could see anyone having with it would be if they were getting it for a collection, because the package it came in was shotty, but the product itself was great.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s light weight and the chain is durable</li>
      <li>its cheap in price but not in quality.</li>
      <li>it was relatively cheap.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it was too long, but it was a great charm for a necklace</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t originally going to write a review for this, as my daughter needed this for one day 4 months ago.</li>
      <li>:) i really injoyed this</li>
      <li>Big fan of FMAB and I love it!</li>
      <li>its just the spring in the chain was a little flimsy but over all great</li>
      <li>and it was worth it.</li>
      <li>Very much worth the price for this necklace.</li>
      <li>According to my daughter, who is obsessed with Full Metal Alchemist, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!</li>
      <li>And this one: I really liked the size of the pendant and how long the chain is.</li>
      <li>It has a couple bubbles on the back side of the pendant, but you can&#x27;t see that side when you&#x27;re wearing it, so I honestly don&#x27;t care too much about that.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>It was exactly like it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>When it came in the mail the back plastic thing didn&#x27;t come with it, which wasn&#x27;t a big deal. :)</li>
      <li>Its absolutely perfect and the chain isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
      <li>absolutely no regrets and i highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that is not super amazing quality metal( i&#x27;m not really sure if its metal).</li>
      <li>Its a very necklace for what it is but is very fragile in the middle and if it gets stuck on something it may snap in half.</li>

    <li> This necklace is awesome and I just love FMA! I ordered the same Flamel necklace from a different seller and it never came in, so this helped me redeem my composure after that incident. Would recommend getting!</li>
    <li> Awesome I loved it 5/5&lt;br /&gt;-Dub Center</li>
    <li> In my opinion, it was too long, but it was a great charm for a necklace or you could even just give it a smaller chain! But I love it!</li>
    <li> I loved it when it got in my hands. I have been buying other necklaces from other animes. And this one: I really liked the size of the pendant and how long the chain is.</li>

    <li> I received this necklace just 3 days after ordering it, so that&#x27;s already amazing on it&#x27;s own! I am extremely happy with the product as well. The silver color is very nice and even, no signs of rusting or anything. The only thing is that is not super amazing quality metal( i&#x27;m not really sure if its metal).

    <li> I wasn&#x27;t originally going to write a review for this, as my daughter needed this for one day 4 months ago. She&#x27;s 9 and doesn&#x27;t wear jewelry or even have her ears pierced. (Her own decision) Except for this necklace. She dressed up as Edward and really loved it and continues to wear the necklace. This necklace has outlasted a lot of things that cost way more than this. Very much worth the price for this necklace.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter&#x27;s friend. Both of them loved it!</li>

    <li> I expected it to be heavier, but it just feels like plastic. Not what I wanted, but it was cheap, so I can&#x27;t complain too bad.</li>
    <li> I was the envoy of my little brother when I got this! He is a massive FMA fan and I enjoyed rubbing it in his face how I got a job to get this necklace! Plus it&#x27;s light weight and the chain is durable-just don&#x27;t let children play with it...sharp edges.</li>
    <li> According to my daughter, who is obsessed with Full Metal Alchemist, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
