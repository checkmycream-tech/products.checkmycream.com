      <li>I bought it at a great price and got it very quickly.  </li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t like to use wax on its own because through the day, the wind would make my hair look puffy.</li>
      <li>Nice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice</li>
      <li>This is the perfect solution to my problems and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like it has a strong scent, but a very light and pleasant one.</li>
      <li>This cream is, by far, the best one that I tested.</li>
      <li>First off, this product has a very pleasant smell, but also applies easily without being too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sticky.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Not only are those qualities great, it has a great fragrance to it.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was a great product, because my hair stylist has it on me at one time.</li>
      <li>bought this on a whim at the salon for the smell, which is awesome, but not hard to get as tea tree oil is pretty inexpensive itself and a good antiseptic to have around anyway.  </li>
      <li>It  makes it easy to maintain a nice messy/wet look.</li>
      <li>Matte finish is nice, reasonably strong hold (</li>
      <li>It just makes my hair look much better, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy/nasty/goopey as stuff like \\&quot;molding mud\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>also love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>This was around 2009 and until this date I am still using this product because I just love it...</li>
      <li>Gladly I purchased two items.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a wax or pomade, for sure.  </li>
      <li>again, I try to apply more to get better hold and end up oily looking and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still, I haven&#x27;t found anything better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my favorite go to hair product.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair product ever.  </li>
      <li>I love this shaping cream and love the value I get on it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After that, the stiffness is gone, but I&#x27;m able to style my hair however I please.</li>
      <li>and with this he is able to style his hair as desired.</li>
      <li>It has enough hold to get through the day, but leaves your hair looking great!  </li>
      <li>importantly, it takes away any kind of frizzy look.  </li>
      <li>but this is my favorite one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many pomades and creams before finding this one.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous products over the years, and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>you will love the smell on your hair.</li>
      <li>Does pretty good to hold while teaching fitness classes.  </li>
      <li>To be clear, the product is great, I have used it for many years and won&#x27;t even try anything else.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Not only does it do an incredible job of shaping my hair, but the scent of this product is divine.</li>
      <li>Another good thing is the size,&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>&gt;  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>easy to use, easy to style</li>
      <li>Easy to wash out - I notice that it is also easy to remove as well (when using Shampoo)</li>
      <li>Plus it washes out easily.</li>
      <li>Unless you sleep on it, you can probably easily re-style or fix your do</li>
      <li>Good price online and ships pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy with fairly fine hair</li>
      <li>Great longevity, natural feeling on my head without a hand full of products.  </li>
      <li>But this mild tea tree scent might just be one of my favorite aromas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for guys with fine hair who want a little texture.</li>
      <li>For me, I needed a product that was light, grease free, and didn&#x27;t irritate my hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great and adds just enough hold and texture to my hair.</li>
      <li>hair is light brownish and I would say it is fine/thin hair and can get frizzy on some days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried looking for matte finish product that was at the same time great for your hair.  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much that I decided to buy it for $16.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Smells fantastic</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic, tea tree&#x27;s great for you, lasts a long time, strong hold -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product, remarkably consistent.  Gives you a great amount of hold without that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I visited a local hair salon my hair stylist gave me a short haircut and used this product on me I asked him what was it and he explained it was a wax to keep my hair style intact I liked it so much that I decided to buy it for $16. This was around 2009 and until this date I am still using this product because I just love it... This item is not greasy which is perfect for me, it dries pretty fast but you can still play with your hair while you have it in your hair anytime and is not sticky or hard it actually leaves your hair soft enough to play with your hair or change your hairstyle. It smells good not a strong alcohol smell but instead a very mild natural smell you will love the smell on your hair. It is white pretty soft just run a quarter on your hand and rub it on your hair and ready for some  twist and playful time with your hair. The wax is white and the packaging is handy. Every time you buy this item you contribute to the eco system so this is a plus for the eco protectors or global warming fanatics!!! A+</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love any other hair product like I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Styles easily and well without using much product&lt;br /&gt;- Nice dry coiffed look with flexibility for styling&lt;br /&gt;- Not greasy in appearance or feel&lt;br /&gt;- Can run your hands through your hair after using it&lt;br /&gt;- Unless you sleep on it, you can probably easily re-style or fix your do if mussed any time in the day because the hold is so flexible&lt;br /&gt;- Smells fantastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Price. I used to get it for a bit more than half of what it now costs wherever I look, and the size decreased. Still, I haven&#x27;t found anything better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have a relaxed, but classic hairstyle, and this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff does some shaping without it looking like you have product in your hair.  Nice.  Smells great too.  The ladies dig it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of hair products before I settled on this one:    REEGIS DesignLine Sculpting Mud (Light Hold), American Crew Fiber, American Crew Forming Cream, and various Pomade brands. The design light mud smelled bad and wasn&#x27;t a strong enough hold; it also left more colored streaks. American Crew Fiber was better, but hard to manipulate and gave you very little time to style before being unmanageable; smell was better, but still not great. The forming cream was more manageable, but didn&#x27;t hold strong, and left a shiny look similar to pomade based products. I dislike all pomade products which leave my hair greasy with a wet/shiny look. I prefer a product that leaves my hair looking dry.    This Paul Mitchell Tea Tree was recommended by a friend who is also a hair stylist. Smells fantastic, tea tree&#x27;s great for you, lasts a long time, strong hold - but gives enough time to style, leaves hair looking dry. For best results, towel dry hair before applying, obviously.    My hair is short-medium, and is extremely thick. I use this cream for the messy, \\&quot;bed hair\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> Lasts all day, do not have to re-apply, not too heavy or thick.  Shapes hair nicely and smells great!</li>
    <li> I am a guy who has tried lots of different hair products.  I really like the way this product makes my hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is light brownish and I would say it is fine/thin hair and can get frizzy on some days.  I keep my hair about 2 inches long.  I find this cream to work very well.  I spread it on my hands and then work into my hair to get a slightly disheveled, but mostly controlled, look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it takes away any kind of frizzy look.  It just makes my hair look much better, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy/nasty/goopey as stuff like \\&quot;molding mud\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love this hard to find product. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
    <li> this is a great product offered online for a lot cheaper than in the salons. has a great natural hold with a flat finish.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that&#x27;s about 2-3 inches long.  I usually just wear it naked since almost all products weigh it down and leave my hair too greasy and oily (including American Crew forming cream and grooming cream).  American Crew light hold texture lotion is nice, but the Paul Mitchell Tea Tea Cream gives my hair some volume and texture and allows me to actually style it.  Despite the other reviews, this product actually makes my hair look shiny when compared to no product at all.  You can work it into dry or damp hair, and restyle your hair all day long.  I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for guys with fine hair who want a little texture.</li>
    <li> My hair cutting place recommended this and it works well.  Not that others wouldn&#x27;t work but this is my favorite one.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product to style short hair. There are good alternatives but none of them are as good as this one. One of the best thing it has is that it gives you enough time to work on your hair without going hard at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pomades and creams before finding this one. And I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 5 years. If you have short, thick hair that other products have trouble holding, then this is the product you should get. It has a long working time (to style), has a great smell, leaves hair pliable and not stiff, has a strong hold, and washes out easily. You can use less to produce a more matte, natural, out-of-bed look, or use a bit more to produce a more controlled, slightly shiny look.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is it&#x27;s not greasy. You can brush it out at might and your ready for the next day. My hair is thin, so it&#x27;s easy to weight it down. Try it</li>
    <li> Tea Tree is the first hair care product I actually purchased from a salon. At $15 it was a great investment, and seeing it here for cheaper makes me even happier. I have short-medium hair, and am currently going with a Ryan Gosling sort of style (hair parted back and to the side) and can accomplish this with just a fingertip&#x27;s worth of Tea Tree. One small size tub can last me several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to providing a great hold that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I am in the mafia, Tea Tree smells great. It is sort of a minty scent but is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree will cost more than some hair care products you can find in the grocery store but you will certainly notice a difference. At $11 I recommend you \\&quot;splurge\\&quot; and give it a try. I am certainly glad I did!</li>
    <li> This shaping cream is great because unlike most gels and hair products, it is not as synthetic and thick. I have short/medium hair and this is just what I need to hold my hair in the place I want it when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this shaping cream and love the value I get on it from Amazon. I use it every morning and think it works great.  It blends and hides any white hairs I might have and holds firm, without getting spiky.</li>
    <li> I used Axe messy hair paste before I started using this product. Tea tree shaping cream has a much better feel and leaves my hair looking more natural (non of that sticky feeling).</li>
    <li> For me, I needed a product that was light, grease free, and didn&#x27;t irritate my hair. I&#x27;ve tried the Crew fiber product and while it was decent it just didn&#x27;t stand up to the Tea Tree. The smell is awesome and it is crazy easy to use. I have thin/fine hair so something heavy will not work with me. This is the perfect solution to my problems and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> To be clear, the product is great, I have used it for many years and won&#x27;t even try anything else. This negative review is for Amazon in what I actually received, 2 x 3.0 ounce tubs instead of 3.5 ounce tubs as advertised. Packing slip &amp; receipt all said that I had purchased 2 x 3.5 ounce tubs. I read the other reviews and saw this happened to others. I thought there is no way they haven&#x27;t fixed this issue by now, they haven&#x27;t. I tried reaching Amazon but never recieved a callback, oh well, lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I write this, I notice the product description now says 3 ounce. I went and checked my order histry and does say 3.5 ounce. It&#x27;s a mess, buyer beware. I will try to find locally next time, at least I know what I will be buying...</li>
    <li> Same price as larger container in stores. This is an extremely small container of hair product.  If you want to pay double what it&#x27;s worth then buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years now and it is fantastic! I would highly recommend it to everyone!</li>

    <li> My stylist recommended this product ages ago. I&#x27;ve been getting at the salon but recently found it was a better deal on Amazon. It smells great and adds just enough hold and texture to my hair.</li>
    <li> False advertisement. The item is the small container and not the 3.5oz size. However, the paste it self is great. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Having tried both, I am convinced that the regular Tea Tree Shaping Cream is a better buy.  This product feels like regular Tea Tree Shaping Cream that has been &#x27;watered&#x27; down with &#x27;water&#x27;.  I am a fine-haired individual, and I&#x27;m going to go back to using the full-powered stuff.</li>
    <li> I knew about this product and just purchased another.  I bought it at a great price and got it very quickly.  Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> The gal that&#x27;s been cutting my hair for 18 years started using this a few months and I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;I rub a  small pat  in the palm of my hands and rub it into my hair and arrange accordingy.</li>
    <li> As a guy with very fine hair that gets extremely wavy even when it&#x27;s kept really short, I&#x27;ve never found a product that does what I want as well as this one. I&#x27;ve tried every gel, pomade, wax, fiber, etc., but nothing seemed to be exactly what I need. With this, I take a somewhat heavy nickel-sized amount, massage it into dry hair until it&#x27;s really uniformly disturbed, then it does whatever I want without looking wet or being locked tightly into place. It&#x27;s hard for me to get an effortlessly tousled look because my hair naturally starts waving outward immediately at the part. This eliminates that without me having to basically glue it back.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite go to hair product. It was recommended to me 2 months ago by a hairstylist. This is a unisex product in which men/women can use. I had tried all the American Crew, Redkin, Bedhead, and even the Mitch line of Paul Mitchell products. The tea tree shaping cream is my favorite as far as giving me a nice clean cut look. It has a really clean smell and very pliable so that you can rework throughout the day if you like. The main selling point with me is that it has an excellent hold and that it keeps hair on my sides down. Other products would keep hair down for a bit and then sides would teend to \\&quot;poof\\&quot; out after a while. Once this product is applied in which I use a little more for the sides it stays put. It is tea tree which is better for hair than glues, some other waxes and gels. Plus it washes out easily. Hair looks natural with this in it and no crunchy, guido looks for me- well not anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a supporter of Paul Mitchell haircare products, and this shaping cream is no different.  I&#x27;ve always been very picky about hair gels/creams, as I usually either dislike the smell or the feel of it.  First off, this product has a very pleasant smell, but also applies easily without being too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sticky.&amp;#34;  It has enough hold to get through the day, but leaves your hair looking great!  Also, the 3.5 ounce container is a very generous size and will last for quite some time!  Another winning Paul Mitchell product!</li>
    <li> This is a great shaping cream. A pinky full goes and long way and it smells great! I use it everyday with no problems.</li>
    <li> have tried lots of hair products and have found this one to be the best.  for thick curly hair it works great to get a controlled look that doesn&#x27;t look gelled or over done.</li>
    <li> I use it to keep the edges around my hairline down for that sleek look, especially for ponytails.  It goes on white, but brushes in nice and shiny.  Brush it in good enough so the whiteness disappears.  Does pretty good to hold while teaching fitness classes.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews, but I thought I should for this product. This is the best product on the market for what it does. I have tried numerous products over the years, and this one is the best. I have a cowlick which is by definition is a (&amp;#34;a lock of hair that grows in a direction different from the rest and that resists being combed flat&amp;#34;). This is the only product that can make it look like I don&#x27;t have that (without clearly showing I used some type of product), the hair goes where I want it to go and it does not have any &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; feel to it. Not only are those qualities great, it has a great fragrance to it. This product is the best, buy it, and you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product, smells really great and feels like hard wax but once you apply it in your hair evenly it all settles down real nice and gives your hair a nice texture, also it holds your hair in the shape you want without making it hard, i definetely recommend this product guys with medium or short hair.</li>
    <li> This cream really work ..it smooth down my edges and i dont have a relaxer in my hair it really dose the job</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3+ years and it always gives me that perfect, dry hold that my hair needs to look awesome! May be a tad expensive but well worth it in my eyes.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before I purchased it from this seller. I usually get from CVS in my neighborhood for $21. I decided to look for the same product online and I encountered this seller for half the price. Gladly I purchased two items. Bottom line the product I received looked exactly the same as the product I used to get. However they didn&#x27;t work the same (trust me I know my hair) and they leave white dots that look like snow. I can only conclude that the product I&#x27;ve received from this seller is either a fake or expired.     I feel cheated and I&#x27;m NOT going to buy anything from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Why this product is worth buying    1. Matte finish - no wetness,no gloss,no shine  2. Durability - Holds all day even in the sun(wax) - Only use at the most a nickel amount of the cream would not advise to use anymore than that amount.  3. Fragrance - Smells so good I don&#x27;t even want to wash my hands...  4. Amount (oz) - Should last 3-5 months good investment  5. Ingredients - debatable... tea tree is suppose to be good for your hair.  6. Easy to wash out - I notice that it is also easy to remove as well (when using Shampoo) (Other waxes deliver extreme hold but are real difficult to get out of hair)    I use this product with Bedhead Mold Texture Paste. I don&#x27;t like to use wax on its own because through the day, the wind would make my hair look puffy. The paste is suppose to keep my hair from looking puffy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a couple of months now, and I&#x27;m hooked. Smells great and holds all day. Also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking matted or greasy.</li>
    <li> Flexible hair cream that also provides good hold. Lots of different products can do this, but this one is my favorite. Price on amazon is cheaper than in salons</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you that glossy look and holds throughout the day</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks and is too thick to work effectively in hair.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this order because I did not receive what I ordered. I ordered two 3.5 ounce containers of Tea Tree Shaping Cream as advertised on Amazon. My invoice slip inside the box showed two 3.5 ounce containers shipped but what was actually in the box was two of the smaller size 3.0 ounce containers. This is a really good product and this is the second time I ordered it from Amazon. I had no problem with the first order but when it comes time to reorder I will not be buying it from Amazon again. The product deserves a five star rating but Amazon only deserves one star for this order.</li>
    <li> I agree with most reviewers that it really holds up well. However, my problem is, after a while, the paste is getting dried up inside the container (only after 3-4 months). I have to wet my hand with water in order to get some out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;If someone reads this and have the same issue, or knows how to prevent it from drying up, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now back in the market and thinking about getting the other popular brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with fairly fine hair and I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time getting it to do what I want. I wish I had known about this stuff sooner! The way I usually use it is to put enough in my hair to make it feel somewhat stiff, then I rub most of it out with a towel (like I do when I dry my hair after a shower). After that, the stiffness is gone, but I&#x27;m able to style my hair however I please.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good and is easy to apply. It has way too much fragrance in it and you will smell it on your hair all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. my barber recommended it to me and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since with awesome results. Don&#x27;t shy away because of the price, because it lasts for awhile. Every time you use it, just use a little and it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years purchasing at my local salon.  Now that I&#x27;ve had to switch salons due to my gay haircutter hitting on me, I&#x27;ve had to order this online.  Good price online and ships pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> bought this on a whim at the salon for the smell, which is awesome, but not hard to get as tea tree oil is pretty inexpensive itself and a good antiseptic to have around anyway.  $20 for smell is what I bought.  I like the consistency of the cream, like shoe polish but more creamy and less oily - it&#x27;s not a wax or pomade, for sure.  Definitely cream, not jel/gel or lotion-like consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m going to keep shopping for something less expensive and more to my needs.  I have a short pixie cut and my hair is thick and wavy.  This cream gives volume but still leaves my hair looking pretty much un-styled, I find, so that I have to apply more than a pea-size dab which only makes it greasy and oily looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, this does not have enough hold for my taste.  again, I try to apply more to get better hold and end up oily looking and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold, I would say, is light - not even medium or moderate. So, be ware.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product ever.  Best smell!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I&#x27;m a man with short, straight, blond hair. I recently switched to shaping cream from gel and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. It  makes it easy to maintain a nice messy/wet look. It lasts all day, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry and crusty like most gels and sprays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of products over the years--gels and creams--and this is my favorite so far. Easy to apply (stuff like American Crew Fiber is too thick), smells great (without being overpowering), and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair sticky.</li>
    <li> size was smaller then what I expected.  We are used to buying bigger size.  my husband uses this item every day and he loves the item.  Arrived in time.  would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff use it all the time for a dry look. I highly recommend it. Costs less than getting it from the salon.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff for the price. Dry Look.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a great product, because my hair stylist has it on me at one time. Unfortunately my feelings towards it changed within a couple days. I started to notice white flakes in my hair and assumed it was from the product, but just to be sure, I switched back to my old product and nope, no flakes. So with that by itself, I threw it away. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair but this is just from personal experience. I like to fix my hair throughout the day because it tends to lose shape. I&#x27;m a guy with straight, inch to 1 1/2 in hair on top. When I would run my hands through my hair to kind of give it a messy look, the white stuff would come out and would disgusting almost. I actually just washed it out one time at work because it didn&#x27;t look appealing. But like I said, it might have just been a personal thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried looking for matte finish product that was at the same time great for your hair.  Either they were to greasy, made me break out, or weren&#x27;t great for your hair to begin with.  If you tried, Loreal, American Crew, Got 2 Be and etc, this one will be the last you buy.....</li>
    <li> I like this one better than his other dry wax. It smells better, but it&#x27;s not as sticky as the other one. You&#x27;ll have no problem washing this stuff off when you take a shower.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, unruly hair and this is the perfect product for keeping it where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and I&#x27;ll definitely will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Not only does it do an incredible job of shaping my hair, but the scent of this product is divine. I don&#x27;t like perfumes and colognes. In fact, I detest them. But this mild tea tree scent might just be one of my favorite aromas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of many products, and I usually use unscented, but this has a nice fresh smell. It also holds really well. You can run your hands through our hair all day and it will just snap back to where ever you styled it to in the morning. You can even wash your hair every other day and my wife says it looks even better the second day.</li>
    <li> easy to work with, like it better than any other hair product i have used.  i have very straight fine hair, and this product works great to mess up my hair...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff; it works great with my straight, fine but thick hair better than anything else.  Holds my hair well, so well that I have serious bed head if I don&#x27;t wash it out of my hair the night before.</li>
    <li> easy to use, easy to style and it&#x27;s not greasy like gels, I would recommand this to anyone. money well spend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products , like American crew fiber &amp; short sexy hair , all that but the Paul Mitchell tea tree shaping cream is by far the best hair product I ever used .</li>
    <li> This cream is, by far, the best one that I tested. I tried live 20 creams, gels, everything.. this one is , by far, the best one.&lt;br /&gt;The hair don&#x27;t fall, but don&#x27;t get stiff.. and don&#x27;t get oily... top!!!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as some others (a good thing in my opinion), but the fragrance is still pleasant.  The hold is very strong, without weighing it down or making your hair look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the size is actually pretty big, the price is more than worth it.  I also like the peace of mind that comes with buying a product that&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> (male w/ short, thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I was using Crew&#x27;s waxes which held pretty well however they smelled horrible.  Bed Head simply didn&#x27;t hold well enough.  I decided to research different products until I found one that does the job and here it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it smells minty and then the scent fades slowly after your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is a white cream that had me skeptical when I first saw it and put it in my hands.  It mixes in quickly and holds very well!&lt;br /&gt;Third, it provides a matte finish.  Wet, glossy looks are not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, it&#x27;s Tea Tree... natural ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be able to throw my other products away because this one is WELL WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products such as Crew Fiber, gels, hair cements and the like and nothing has allowed me to do what I want to my hair without residue.  Except this.  Great longevity, natural feeling on my head without a hand full of products.  I will keep buying until it isn&#x27;t made anymore.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose too</li>
    <li> Very good product,&lt;br /&gt;the hold was quite good, not as good at tigi matte separation but it got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the way it smells. Another good thing is the size,&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product that my husband will use. He has very thick hair that is somewhat &#x27;unruley&#x27; and with this he is able to style his hair as desired. He also loves all of the tea tree products form Paul Mitchell as well, he swears by them. It&#x27;s not necessarily the cheapest shaping cream compared to other brands, but Amazon is definitely the cheapest place you will find this product compared to salon&#x27;s or stores.</li>
    <li> Benefits: Shape your hair without the greaseball look.&lt;br /&gt;  Smells quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Weak cohesiveness. Will barely survive pillows and/or handsy girls.&lt;br /&gt;  Should be supplemented with tiny bits of a strong gel for maximum effectiveness and looks.</li>
    <li> Matte finish is nice, reasonably strong hold (just what I need), and it also smells very good. It&#x27;s not like it has a strong scent, but a very light and pleasant one.</li>
