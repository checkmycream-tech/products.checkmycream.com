      <li>Just as effective and saves you money.</li>
      <li>kind of the way</li>
      <li>so it would be warm.</li>
      <li>I soaked my feet in warm soapy water for about 30 minutes&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was excited to use this since I saw great results in videos and reviews online.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Right before summer this is a great way to get &amp;#34;better than a pedi&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy and works!</li>
      <li>and  i must said i  love</li>
      <li>rather tan a gel which would have covered more and &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>peel one to two more times before summer</li>
      <li>peel one to two more times before summer</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>lovely packaging.</li>

      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>but I bought it anyways to see for myself and it was a great decision because it worked really well for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did this in the Winter because you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this in summer.</li>
      <li>I continued to soak at night, more skin came off along with skin on the tops of my feet &amp; toes.  </li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>And came with a tiny sample of foot cream that smelled delicious.</li>
      <li>Going to order more and more ....</li>
      <li>this product caused most of the built-up calluses on my heels to peel off.</li>
      <li>I let it sit on my feet for more than two hours</li>
      <li>Make sure you soak- soak- soak.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read so many rave reviews and have seen as those peeling feet photos</li>
      <li>really love it ..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a magic ....</li>
      <li>Unsightly calluses are never something you want when wearing a cute pair of sandals, and with the TONYMOLY</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t think the results would be very good without soaking daily......</li>
      <li>clean, beautiful, and baby soft.</li>
      <li>the result is my first time trying this kind of products</li>
      <li>I soak my feet in warm water first, wait a bit, then follow the instructions.</li>
      <li>so we just jimmied up some plastic bags and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>Make sure you will be able to cover your feet unless you want funny looks</li>
      <li>but once my skin started peeling, it was amazing ( and kind of gross)!  </li>
      <li>smooth feet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable, the scent of the product is quite nice and the lotion is very smoothing.</li>
      <li>I had read great things about a competitor product but couldn&#x27;t get it, and thought I would try this one instead, but it simply did not work.  </li>
      <li>It is mid July now and my feet still look and feel great.  </li>
      <li>put the booties on, pour in the liquid, secure the booty ties.</li>
      <li>My feet are so smooth</li>
      <li>I was so happy it actually worked!</li>
      <li>but on this case a  $12 bottle of Alpha Hydrox foot lotion applied regularly is far more effective.</li>
      <li>I have tried about four different foot treatments and this is by far the best one I have ever used, the results are great, my calluses, that normally only come off when I get a pedicure are peeling off, as is the rest of my dead skin, very impressed with this product</li>
      <li>and  yeah am very pleased with the results i will definitely buy it again :)</li>
      <li>Got the booties on- sturdy plastic with a double liner, opened the package of solution, poured in (had a towel and damp cloth handy just in case)  tied up booties at ankle and taped tab to secure bag iver the top of the foot.</li>
      <li>DO NOT force the peeling by scrubbing the dead skin will come off on its own!!</li>
      <li>Although you are supposed to soak your feet every day to facilitate shedding, I didn&#x27;t have time to soak them every day, just to clean them in the shower.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a complete bust for me.  I followed the directions exactly: the liquid took forever to absorb into my feet so I ended up leaving the booties on for 2.5 hours to maximize this.  I rinsed off and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  10 days later, still nothing.  I soaked my feet on several evenings, even though the instructions did not say to do so.  I would thoroughly NOT recommend this product.  Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> So this is my second time using tonymoly foot peel first time was great second time not so much. I received it on time on Tuesday and used it Wednesday it&#x27;s now Monday morning and i see peeling but it&#x27;s broken and flaky I&#x27;m not happy with it this time around and I had the same prosses as the first time.</li>
    <li> Never made my feet peel at all.  Soaked my feet, dried them and kept the solution on for over an hour and a half.  A week later---nothing.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant when it came to buying because of the recent reviews but I bought it anyways to see for myself and it was a great decision because it worked really well for me. I washed my feet before hand and let my feet soak for about 2 hours instead of the recommended time listed on the package. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work but once the fourth day came I was peeling like crazy and it really left my feet soft, so I&#x27;m happy I bought the product!</li>
    <li> Wow, does this stuff work!  I wore the booties for an hour and half with only one issue, I had a crack in my heel and t that burned a little.  After about 5 days my feet started to peel.  A day or two latter and the tougher skin was coming off in sheets.  My feet are now really soft and I have no more cracks.  I&#x27;m using Okeef&#x27;s foot cream to keep them that way.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather suspicious of other reviews for this product now. First- lovely packaging. I was expecting worse based on price but it LOOKS spiffy. Instructions aren&#x27;t in English but there are pictures- and I followed the instructs in reviews. Got myself settled in with the remote, water and snacks. Got the booties on- sturdy plastic with a double liner, opened the package of solution, poured in (had a towel and damp cloth handy just in case)  tied up booties at ankle and taped tab to secure bag iver the top of the foot. Set my timer for 90 min and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;Showered after and my feet were sensitive to hot shower water- kind of the way a mild sunburn feels the first time you get under water pressure- but no pain, discoloration, etc. I took this an indicative of working. Soaked me feet daily in the shower by plugging the drain after a week I noticed the skin on the sides of my feet looking whitish and dry and looked forward to the peeling sheets of flesh sure to come off soon.&lt;br /&gt;A few days later while washing my tootsies I noticed the skin felt a little crumbly and decided to help it along with a pumice. Indeed, the pumice removed slightly more dead skin than usual, but only  from the sides of my feet and lower heel- did nothing for the harder callously patches I tend to get on the outsides. At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So- no ugly peeling feet, no exciting swaths of dead flesh coming off, no pink shiny skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say you get what you pay for, but on this case a  $12 bottle of Alpha Hydrox foot lotion applied regularly is far more effective. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I bought this for my husband and his feet never peeled. He wore the booties with the solution for two hours, and two weeks later, nada. Nothing. Zilch. Zippo.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!  I ordered this after having been tickled pink by BabyFoot.  However, all this product did was sting (not intensely, but uncomfortably).  I soaked my feet before and after, soaking for an 10 minutes or more each day for 5-6 days after the peel (just left the plug in while I showered), but there was no peeling at all.  I think the positive reviews are bogus, especially since the BabyFoot worked so well on my feet!</li>
    <li> I love this, it was a great way for me to prepare for sandal season! I have a couple big calluses that it did not completely remove, but that is actually a good thing, because we develop calluses to protect us from something, and removing them entirely is a setup for pain until another callus develops. Otherwise, all the dry, tight skin from wearing shoes and boots all winter came right off. Although you are supposed to soak your feet every day to facilitate shedding, I didn&#x27;t have time to soak them every day, just to clean them in the shower. It still worked for me with no problems. Each day after walking around at my job all day, I would come home to sheets of skin peeled off. There is no pain or itching involved. My one warning: do NOT try to peel off semi-loose skin to speed things along, let it shed naturally.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed.  No stinging or bad experience when soaking my feet in the solution.  After 8 days my feet started to peel when there was dry skin but the really thick calluses remained  unaffected.</li>
    <li> My experience with Tony Moly was not fantastic. I found the liquid not moisturising my feed and yes my feet have been peeling but the calluses at the heals is still not completely removed only the soft skin. So really disappointed.</li>
    <li> As effective as the top selling foot peel for half the price.  I would definitely purchase this item again.  Leaves your feet smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! These work just as well&lt;br /&gt;As the other foot peels that cost twice as much!!! Just be careful when you put your foot into the bootie you are putting it between the lining of the plastic wrap! If you don&#x27;t it will leak.&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet before and after just like the other foot peel and my feet look and feel fabulous just as if I&#x27;d paid twice the price. Already having another order shipped to me I&#x27;m so happy!!</li>
    <li> I exfoliate, I use a pumice stone, I have callous shavers, foot files, I wear socks with lotion on my feet to bed...none of which really get rid of the last thin layer of hard callus. I saw this product on Reddit and the pictures of the aftermath and immediately ordered it.   I soaked my feet for about thirty minutes in soapy water as hot as I could stand it prior to using this product. I made sure my feet were completely dry and then put the booties on, which come with a little tie around the ankle part to help keep them stable on your feet. I added the liquid, let it sit for two hours and twenty minutes, and then rinsed my feet in a hot bath afterwards. It takes time to work, five days for me. I had no visible signs warning me of the peeling in the days before. I just woke up on day five and viola, my feet are peeling! Heels, side of my feet by the pinky toes, it&#x27;s awesome. The pink skin under the peeling parts is BABY SOFT. clean, beautiful, and baby soft. There is zero pain involved.   I am thrilled about this and will be ordering again immediately. I honestly think those who say it doesn&#x27;t work have gotten impatient and reviewed before 5-6 days. This is the real deal. It&#x27;s affordable, the scent of the product is quite nice and the lotion is very smoothing. After use of the product, my feet felt &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; before the peeling began. Please try this! It&#x27;s so cheap, with amazing results, don&#x27;t let a few negative reviews turn you off. Try it yourself. I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Took all the dead skin off. Took about 10 days to start peeling so I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work at first. Worked great!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff was terrible.  I followed the directions to the letter and it did nothing except dry out my feet even more!!  There was no peeling at all.  I used it a full week ago and there is absolutely nothing happening.  Dont&#x27; waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I did get quite a bit of dead skin off. It didn&#x27;t peel off in flakes like some reviewers. I soaked my feet for approx. 30 min beforehand and then I would soak my feet daily for 10 mins. I left it on for 2 hours. I started to see a little peeling about 3 days in. By a week it was flaking off. I used my ped egg at that point. And it was still peeling small amounts up to week two. I had quite a bit of callused skin on my heels so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle. This was the perfect thing  to get my feet into shape for sandal weather. I bought a lava rock for upkeep.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Make sure you soak- soak- soak. I soaked my feet for 20 minutes in water before putting this one and then left the botoines on for twice as long. it took about 3-4 days to see the effect. But now Im soaking my feet for about 15 minutes at nite and the skin that coming off my feet are amazing. I have been trying to get rid of heavy callouses for years.  This stuff requires a little patience but at this point you cant even tell I had horrendous cracked thick callouses at all.</li>
    <li> My feet never peeled..&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my feet aren&#x27;t dry enough?</li>
    <li> I purchased this with such high hopes. I followed all of the directions and nothing happened. It took forever to get to my house and after using it nothing at all happened.</li>
    <li> Worked really well, wish my feet wouldn&#x27;t have peeled for quite so long. Still happy with the result.</li>
    <li> Super Product . Skin peeling on feet as I&#x27;m writing this. have used a similar cheaper product before and it did the same job . It was a third of the price</li>
    <li> I used the Baby Foot peel before I discovered this brand and I loved the product, not the price. This product is a fraction of the price of a product that does the SAME EXACT THING. LOVE it! My feet started peeling on day 2 and I got the same lovely results. This is my second time buying this and I have absolutely no complaints. Does what it says it&#x27;s going to do and leaves your feet feeling like pure silk.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in March, used it in May to get ready for summer.  It took almost a week and half for my feet to start peeling so at first I didn&#x27;t think it was working. But OMG, when my feet starting peeling, they really peeled!  It is mid July now and my feet still look and feel great.  I have very hard scaly skin on the heels of my feet and it took all of that off.  I went to visit my sister in June and she even mentioned how nice and young my feet looked! (I am 50) :) The product is wonderful and so worth it.</li>
    <li> Followed the directions exactly.  I have super dry and calloused feet so I was super excited for this to work.  Unfortunately, after waiting 10 days, nothing has happened.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as Babyfoot. I also used on my elbows. Did a great job.</li>
    <li> A lot of people hand luck with this cheaper product but it did nothing for me&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet for 1/2 hr and kept the treatment on for 2hrs.  5 days later I had slight peeling on my arches ( actually the softest part of my feet).  The product came quickly but did not work for me sorry I bought 2.  Will give baby foot a try</li>
    <li> It took nine days for the peeling to begin, but once it did, wow. My feet have never been so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I did not soak my feet prior to using it (apparently you should, though the directions don&#x27;t say that) so perhaps that is why it took so long.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever. It worked and I&#x27;ll get it again if needed.</li>
    <li> This is the best Foot Peel on the market!  Baby what, baby who?  I wanted to try the Baby Feet but for half the cost I glad I gave the TonyMoly Shiny Foot Super Peeling Liquid a try.  It truly works!  At first I was a bit scared when my feel started peeling but it seemed as though they would never stop by the ending results cause me to repurchase this product twice over.</li>
    <li> well i did give it a try and  i must said i  love the result is my first time trying this kind of products and  yeah am very pleased with the results i will definitely buy it again :)</li>
    <li> I read the reviews carefully before my purchase, and I was not mislead! This stuff is pretty amazing, and the peeling is pretty gross but effective. I would buy this again -- my feet haven&#x27;t been so soft in decades.</li>
    <li> Better then babyfoot. Worked faster then expected for me. It&#x27;s been a week since I used it. And almost all but the outer edge of my feet have peeled so far. It worked more effectively then my experience with baby foot and at half the price. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Buy Babyfoot instead. My feet did not peel for one whole week after using this product and they did not peel all over due to the liquid used rather tan a gel which would have covered more and &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; to the whole foot. I followed instructions and soaked my feet daily. The peel was not a good peel. Skin came off powdery rather than in strips and my feet are still rough. I shouldn&#x27;t have gone with a less expensive product. One caveat: though the packaging info is written in Japanese, there are instructions in English on the inside. In my opinion, this product was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since the initial application and there is no noticeable change - no peeling, so softening, no nothing.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone&#x27;s skin type?  I kept it on as directed, and I have well maintained feet so it&#x27;s not like it had to penetrate through very hardened/thick skin.  Oh well.  I had read great things about a competitor product but couldn&#x27;t get it, and thought I would try this one instead, but it simply did not work.  I bought two packets, I&#x27;m just throwing out the second one, and waiting to see if I can find the original one I read about (also a Korean brand).</li>
    <li> This worked really well. It took 6 days for the peeling to begin, but when it did, it peeled more thoroughly than other foot peels, especially on my heel. Gave one to my mom and it cleaned up her ashen hooves nicely.</li>
    <li> amazing! I hardly ever wear shoes. I prefer to be barefoot. With that, my feet have always had super thick, deep callouses on them. I&#x27;ve used so many different kinds of things to keep them soft, but it&#x27;s hardly done anything. I tried this foot peel after seeing it on Instagram and I&#x27;m totally a believer!! The before pictures were taken after I soaked, and used a pumice stone on them. The after pictures were taken about two weeks after the day I soaked my feet. Such a difference!</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this since I saw great results in videos and reviews online. Used as directed but it did not work. Absolutely no peeling at all. Save your money and go to your local salon for a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Right before summer this is a great way to get &amp;#34;better than a pedi&amp;#34; feet.  You have to be commited to wear socks days 4-10 after you do the soak.</li>
    <li> Tonymoly Shiny Foot didn&#x27;t work at all.  I used it 6 days ago and there is no sign of peeling.&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews, I thought this would be similar to SilkySmooth Foot, which worked very well.  Shiny Foot is nothing like SilkySmooth Foot.  Shiny Foot did nothing.  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know, wife bought this product</li>
    <li> after following the instructions meticulously and to the letter, the only skin that ever peeled was the skin at the TOP of my feet -- which was already lovely and baby-soft, thank you.  so the lightly-tanned, perfect skin on the tops of my feet now appears as if i once suffered from leprosy (or appalling poor self-tanner application), while the bottoms of my feet remain... utterly unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;meanwhile, it&#x27;s now summer and i won&#x27;t be able to wear sandals again for months, or until i can get the skin tone to even out -- lest people think i have a horrible disfiguring top-of-foot disease of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i truly, 100% HATE this product, and if i could give it negative stars, i would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon did provide me a full refund, but save yourself the money and horrible results.</li>
    <li> This stuff was great! It was amazing to see the peeling happen over a weeks time. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> The product did not appear to do anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many rave reviews and have seen as those peeling feet photos so I decided to purchase this. I was looking forward to that &amp;#34;zombie looking&amp;#34; feet where dead skin visibly just sloughs off. One week passes, nothing. Two weeks, nothing. Three weeks nothing. It&#x27;s been 2 months and absolutely no effect. I don&#x27;t really have that much calluses or rough skin on my feet so maybe that could be why nothing happened? I mean, there should have at least been minimal peeling or something, but no change whatsoever. I will be trying the Holika Holika or Baby Foot version next. Giving it 3 stars as I know people who swear by this stuff and had amazing results.</li>
    <li> I would rather invest $25 into the baby foot instead of buying this again. You get what you pay for. It peels the dead skin but the improvement is not as dramatic as you would see with baby feet.</li>
    <li> These work really well. I had hard, callused heels that I have worked on for months to get them smoother. One application of peeling liquid although a bit messy worked beautifully. The are not perfect but I will do another application in a few weeks. My feet didn&#x27;t start to peel until about 10 days after the application. Then I stood in the bathtub and used a brush and pumice stone to get all the dead skin off. My feet are so soft. I only reason that I gave this four stars is that it is obviously from China and there are almost no instructions.</li>
    <li> Can I give -5 stars? This did nothing. Absolutely nothing. Maybe because half of the package was leaking when it arrived. I won&#x27;t buy this again and you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
    <li> as other purchasers have noted, this product seriously delivers. I have athletes foot and the skin on my feet were starting to get calloused, combine that with a job where I&#x27;m always on my feet and you get some yucky feet. The product began working after a long soak on the 4th day, and then the peeling started getting serious in the days following. The only thing I would recommend is trying not to get the product on the top of your foot. The skin on that part of my feet didn&#x27;t need peeling, but I had gotten some of the acid on them so they peeled anyway and peeled for 2-3 days longer than the soles of my feet. I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I soak my feet in warm water first, wait a bit, then follow the instructions. I usually leave it on for longer than recommended and it works like a charm. A lot of different companies make a similar product. Besides Tonymoly, I&#x27;ve tried Etude House and The Face Shop&#x27;s. There isn&#x27;t enough of a difference to warrant paying more for any of them, so the only one I&#x27;ve repurchased is this one. Even with regular pedicures, it&#x27;s a must for soft feet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s a magic .... My mum has been used t for her feet ... It peels her feet excellently !! She had suffered from her dry rough feet for years ..really love it .. Going to order more and more ....</li>
    <li> worked exactly as descibed</li>
    <li> This did what it said it would do. Took about 5 days to start peeling and a few weeks to completely peel. Every time I got in the shower the skin came off in handfuls! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Did this peel with my mom. We soaked our feet in warm warm for 30 minutes before using the peel for about an hour and a half. My feet started peeling about 4 days later but it took about 9 days for my mom&#x27;s feet to peel. I found that soaking my feet helped expedite the peeling process. Really great product, works a million times better than foot creams, pumice stones, etc etc.</li>
    <li> Did not work nearly as well as Baby Feet.  Don&#x27;t waste your money because, in the long run, this is not&lt;br /&gt;a bargain.  Did not peel the very thick calluses on my feet at all.</li>
    <li> Nope.  It didn&#x27;t do a thing.  I waited the prescribed 3-4 days and nothing happened.</li>
    <li> The directions are in Chinese or Japanese.....put the booties on, pour in the liquid, secure the booty ties. I left them on 2 hours; I wanted to give it every chance to work. I soaked my feet every night for 3 nights for 15 or so minutes, once in the morning while having my coffee. then I had to leave town so I didn&#x27;t think the results would be very good without soaking daily......but I soaked them as soon as I got home. My feet immediately turned into prunes &amp; the skin came off. I continued to soak at night, more skin came off along with skin on the tops of my feet &amp; toes.  I have pedicures but that doesn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t take off skin like this product did.  I truly have baby feet. Love love love this product!!!</li>
    <li> As a nurse, I spend a lot of time on my feet. Add to that the fact that I live in NYC and walk everywhere, and you can imagine how rough my feet were after our long winter. This product worked amazingly well for me. Within a week of use, my feet have completely shed themselves of the dried skin and callus that had built up over the winter and are sandal ready! My husband even remarked on how soft my feet are.</li>
    <li> Worked very well, easy to use,  ordered again.</li>
    <li> Not as much of a dramatic difference as I was expecting. My feet pealed some after a week but didn&#x27;t result in &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; smooth feet. This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried but the formula just didn&#x27;t seem strong enough for me. Will not repurchase</li>
    <li> Ooh no . The description in the box is in Japanese or something . I says (30) I thought I should leave it for 30 min only . *Sad* .. it was easy to use . But, the time mislead me . I knew 30 min wasn&#x27;t enough :(</li>
    <li> Peely!!!!!! Make sure you will be able to cover your feet unless you want funny looks</li>
    <li> This stuff is a pretty horrible waste of money. I let it sit on my feet for more than two hours and it still barely absorbed at all on one of my feet and wasn&#x27;t completed absorbed on the other as well. It&#x27;s been a week now and no peeling whatsoever. This item is a complete scam. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I was kind of skeptical but I figured if it didn&#x27;t work it only cost 9 dollars so oh well. I left the stuff on my feet for 2 hours, washed them, moisturized, and went to bed. Two days later I took my shoes off when I got home and noticed my heels peeling in big sheets. I was so happy it actually worked! It&#x27;s been 3 days now and my feet are still peeling but not as much as the first day. I definitely recommend this for people with dry or rough feet. It&#x27;s really easy and works!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but decided to try this based on so many good reviews. Unfortunately I have had absolutely no change in my feet. Waste of money.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as babyfoot. The one thing I miss about babyfoot was it was a gel inside the booties. This is a packet you pour into the plastic boot. The end results are the same.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly, soaking my feet every night and not peeling at things that weren&#x27;t ready to come off but it took so long for everything to peel that by the time it had all come off I had developed calluses back where I had peeled them from in the first place.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Weird, gross and messy but gives unbelievable results. My hard, flaky, callused, dry skin is now smooth and soft. I&#x27;ve recommended this to every friend I have. It took about 9 days for the shedding to begin so be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking feet in water before use and periodically in the days after to help the process move along. I&#x27;d also suggest putting thick socks on while wearing the plastic booties so you can move around as needed.</li>
    <li> This worked really well! I&#x27;d read a few reviews and step-by-steps online and by following them I found my feet ended up nice and smooth. My husband did this also (with his scaly man-feet!) and it worked amazingly - just a heads-up that the bags/booties it comes with don&#x27;t fit really big feet (his are a size 12-13 and quite wide) so we just jimmied up some plastic bags and it worked fine. The skin peeling off is disgusting and amazing, totally fun. Don&#x27;t do this anytime where you&#x27;ll be wearing open shoes in the week following unless you want to look a little like you&#x27;re suffering extreme athlete&#x27;s foot!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, the Japanese Baby Foot product costs 4x the price of this TonyMoly foot peel. After reading the ingredients of TonyMoly&#x27;s (AHAs of lactic + salicylic acids) and getting some first-hand reviews from Korean friends, I took the plunge and it does exactly what the blogs and reviews say. Just as effective and saves you money. I just recommend doing this in the fall/winter when you wear closed-toe shoes, otherwise you&#x27;ll be peeling/flaking for all to see (esp. in summer).</li>
    <li> this product does work like Baby Foot, and the price is right, but I&#x27;m only giving it 3 states because it took much longer to start working.  Baby Foot started to work in a few days.  This took over a week.  I soaked my feet for a 1/2 hour in hot water before applying the booties and product.  I left the booties on for almost 2 hrs and 15 minutes.  I soaked my feet everyday for a week and saw nothing, plus my feet were dry.  Then finally just yesterday I started noticing the tops of my feet getting flaky.  I soaked my feet twice yesterday and once this morning.  FINALLY - peeling!  Aside from how long it took to start, the fact that instructions are all in a foreign language and the few that are English are covered with a label, and the messiness of adding the product to the booties this is an ok product.  I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these. One for me, one for my daughter.  I have 49 year old feet, my daughter has 21 year old ones.  I kept the booties on for 2 hours (got distracted) my daughter had it on for one hour and took off.  My daughter complained of pain for several days after.  I didn&#x27;t have pain. My feet started to peel on the 4th day. And are still peeling a week plus later.  My daughter&#x27;s never peeled.  It&#x27;s messy.  Wear socks ... everywhere!  I&#x27;m not sure if I will do again simply because of the number of days your feet peel.  I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work on my daughter&#x27;s feet.  Maybe because hers was already soft.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t do as much as the Baby Foot.</li>
    <li> Babyfoot is way better dont waste ur money on this!</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I got this because I always love trying new beauty products out.  It was fun to do; walking around with the vinyl booties was an experience and after a few days (I think around 4) my feet began to peel.  I know I saw some people saying not to wear sandals or anything, but my feet didn&#x27;t peel that dramatically, it was more like a bad sunburn.  The only downside to this was that after my feet had peeled and everything was done, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in the smoothness of my feet or the size of my calluses.</li>
    <li> One of the best items I have bought on Amazon. Gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Peeled after about a week.  Doesn&#x27;t take long for feet to get bad again.  Don&#x27;t use if you have an open sore. Hurts!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. It took about 5 days for the skin to start peeling off but when it peeled, it PEELED. My feet are super smooth now and I will definitely be using this again at the end of the summer. Keep in mind that this takes a while to get to you, so plan ahead if you use regularly!</li>
    <li> I tried these out and nothing happened for four days so I was wondering if it would work. It really, really does! My feet started peeling on day four and just continued for the next couple of weeks. I&#x27;m always barefoot or in flip flops so while this product works, I hated wearing socks and sneakers for two weeks straight while my feet were shedding! By the end of the process my feet were 10% smoother but it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks since and my feet are now almost back to normal. The product works well but you have to use it regularly to keep the results. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use it again because of the inconvenience. The shedding lasted too long, it was really gross (especially during and after showering), and the results are only temporary.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, with little ties to keep it from slipping or spilling, compared to similar products, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! Also, the Tony Moly store near me told me that they don&#x27;t make this product...  So glad I could buy it on amazon!!</li>
    <li> Only did half Of The Job, Dry skin and dry heels skin still there, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Removed all dead skin.  2 weeks later my foot continues to peel.  I did leave liquid on for 2.5 hours and after tying the booties I placed socks over booties to help liquid penetrate feet.  After 7 days I began to soak feet in water to help speed up exfoliation.  Very happy with results</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It works as advertised. I left it on for about 1.5 hours, but will leave it on closer to 2 hours next time. Within three days, my feet began to peel. I used a pumice stone VERY lightly to help some of the bigger calluses on my heels. There was some slight sensitivity to heat and cold when the peeling process began, but no pain. I could walk around wearing the booties, though it was squishy. I used my husband&#x27;s slippers so I wouldn&#x27;t tear the booties on anything. It&#x27;s been a little over a week, and my feet are baby soft. I just bought two more because I am hard on my feet during the summer, and go barefoot quite a bit.</li>
    <li> This stuff is intense. Make sure you follow the instructions completely and exactly. it is no joke your feet will peel for days so I suggest you not do this in the summer when you&#x27;re going to wear sandals and flip flops becuse it is very noticeable, but after the peeling my feet were incredibly soft. The only downside being thhere was dead skin everywhere... on my bed, in my shoes, in my socks and it&#x27;s kindof messy, gross and not pretty. But the results were rad and I guess that&#x27;s the point</li>
    <li> This foot peel works like a dream!  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but none work as well and as quickly as this.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the most amazing product if you have dry, cracked feet.  I read about a similar product on Refinery 29 (http://www.refinery29.com/baby-foot-peel-review) about a month ago.  Basically, chemical foot peels are a thing in Korea and Japan. You soak your feet in this solution and then after a few days all your dry skin peels off and your feet are shiny and new!  I chose this brand based on the comments on the R29 article. I soaked my feet as directed for an hour and a half-- great time to do a little Netflix binge-watching. It took over a week but once my skin started peeling, it was amazing ( and kind of gross)!  I sat on my floor two nights in a row peeling dry skin off ( while my husband hid downstairs). I also scrubbed them in the tub really good the last evening and Voila!  Shiny Feet!  I will definitely order this again!  I recommend it to nearly anyone, except diabetics.</li>
    <li> Only the bottoms of my feet peeled. Meh Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried about four different foot treatments and this is by far the best one I have ever used, the results are great, my calluses, that normally only come off when I get a pedicure are peeling off, as is the rest of my dead skin, very impressed with this product</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Baby Feet but it is half the price. The shipping was fast though. Thanks</li>
    <li> Good Product, I can definitely tell a difference using it.</li>
    <li> Works about as well as the Baby Foot brand product, but it&#x27;s messier and a bit harder to use.  The booties are better, but the product is a thin liquid that leaks easily.  Baby foot is about twice as expensive, but I can actually get two uses out of one package.  Not with this one.  So, I guess that makes them about equal in value.  Therefore, I think I will use Baby Foot in the future because it it more pleasant and takes a bit less time.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a bit skeptical when I read and heard about all of the skin shedding that would happen after four or five days of this foot treatment. But I have to say as gross as it was, it was worth it! It&#x27;s been two weeks and my feet are still as soft as a little kids!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 5 days now and I&#x27;ve noticed just a few bubbles on the soles of my feet, nothing extreme like others have posted, but slight gentle peeling.  Even without the harsh and extreme peeling, it&#x27;s still doing a good job and my feet are feeling softer and not as rough as before.</li>
    <li> While the initial application is a little weird (chasing a four year old around isn&#x27;t easy while wearing baggies full of liquid), I now cannot stop touching my new smooth, beautiful feet. I will be repurchasing this when my feet get dry and cracked again. Love!</li>
    <li> Omg!! This stuff is amazing. Soaked my feet first and then left it on for full 90 minutes. About 4-5 days later my entire foot peeled!!  Soaked my feet again in water and gave them a good scrub and got even more dead skin off. My feet have never felt this good. I will definitely tried again as this is way cheaper than baby foot.</li>
    <li> Took two weeks but then peel began. My feet are much smoother than I ever remember.....and they were rough. Peeling looked a little ugly for a couple days and I encouraged it to detach with pedi egg. All in all..I would do it again</li>
    <li> Works great on my sister&#x27;s feet but not on mine. Only the skin around my heels that peeled a little. Climate and age aren&#x27;t the factors since we live in the same area and she is only a yr older than me. And we use it in January. The difference is I soaked my feet in warm water prior &amp; she didn&#x27;t. The instruction doesn&#x27;t tell to soak but I listened to some reviewers</li>
    <li> My feet get very rough, dry, and cracked in the winter and this product COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED my feet. You may want to look up beauty blogger&#x27;s reviews of this product along with images so you are prepared for what you&#x27;re getting into - the liquid is painless, but it makes you slough off skin like a snake and the process is NOT cute! haha! But after the ~10 day peeling process, your feet are baby soft.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Simply soak your feet in water prior to the treatment ( no more than 5 mins). Slip on the booties and pour the liquid. Use one satchel per bootie as instructed. Don&#x27;t try to be a cheapskate by using only one in both. Keep the booties on for over an hour. I kept mine on for 90 minutes and watched a movie in the meanwhile. I remained in a sitting position to avoid spillage. Worked wonders on my feet. If this didn&#x27;t work for you, you either didn&#x27;t follow the instructions correctly or have plain stubborn skin( sorry)</li>
    <li> Maybe I did it wrong, but it has been over 4 days and no peeling.</li>
    <li> Baby Foot more expensive --does the same job -Feet are very soft--  maybe too soft for the summer, as don&#x27;t like to wear shoes --</li>
    <li> I mean it works.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while for my feet to start pealing and even when it did it did not peel much. I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth since this was fairy cheap. I still had a lot of callus on my feet</li>
    <li> it really works! ok-so I was targeting my heels--and I couldn&#x27;t get much liquid on them...but exactly at 4 days the bottom of my feet are peeling like crazy!  I may have to buy more and rig up something to soak my upper heels in!! this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> not as good as advertised. but it does work after a while</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I have horrible feet and I&#x27;ve done everything that I could think of to try and get rid of the cracks and calluses on my feet. So I saw this on Amazon with rave reviews and ordered it. I soaked my feet first, then I followed the instructions on the packet: put my feet in the plastic socks,  poured the liquid into the socks,  sealed the socks up and chilled out for 90 minutes until I had to remove the socks and rinse my feet off. A few days later, my feet started to resemble a snake peeling its skin (be prepared its gross).  I made sure to wear shoes with no socks on and soak my feet for 30 minutes everyday my feet were peeling. DO NOT force the peeling by scrubbing the dead skin will come off on its own!! This stuff made my feet look normal.</li>
    <li> Did everything according to directions, no peeling :(</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it claims to.  I will use it again. Mine did take longer to work than other reviewers.</li>
    <li> It did nothing at all for me. No peeling.</li>
    <li> I did not get the results expected.  It did remove a bit of the calluses but overall, I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Meh. My feet have been slowly peeling for three days now, but I don&#x27;t really see a difference. I&#x27;m going back to using a foot scraper because I get MUCH better results and don&#x27;t have to hide my feet day after day or deal with skin everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used baby foot before and loved it so I was excited about finding a similar product for much less. Unfortunately the results from Tonymoly are nowhere near the quality of baby foot. After nearly two weeks my feet haven&#x27;t peeled hardly at all, they just look scaly and weird. I even soaked my feet every day for the first week. It also made my feet very dry to the point of discomfort. I will not be using Tonymoly again due to these disappointing results. It will be baby foot for me from now on!!</li>
    <li> I have super thick calluses (I go barefoot as much as possible) and this product caused most of the built-up calluses on my heels to peel off. I still have thick skin on my heels and there are a few visible cracks remaining, but the product worked better than I expected. It worked really great for my sister and her thick-skinned heels!</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well to soften rough feet.</li>
    <li> Holy Banana&#x27;s this product is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as a child I LOVED running around barefoot like a little brat. Which is partly responsible for the HUGE rough callouses I have now. Another part of it is just dumb genetics, my father also has rough feet. I have used tools to sand down the skin, I have used lotions and oil to try and make it smoother. Nothing has worked. This showed up randomly on my list of products I might be interested in while checking out some Korean skin care products. It is TonyMoly which I know to be a good and trusted brand. So I figured I would give it a try. I AM SO GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you get these big plastic/paper bags in the shape of socks to put your feet into. You have 2 packets of solution, one for your left foot, one for your right. The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant, thought it is strong. I put the packets in the sink and ran hot water on them first before pouring them into the socks so it would be warm. I kept it on for the recommended time which was about an hour and a half. I then took the socks off and washed my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They looked the same, I couldn&#x27;t see any difference. The directions said in about 3 days it will all start to peel off. Well it didn&#x27;t start peeling for me till about 5-6 days in. But boy did it peel! I&#x27;m glad I did this in the Winter because you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this in summer. It looks like your foot has been through the shredder, all the skin that comes off. Its horrific. Small children would probably cry and run away if they had seen my peeling feet. BUT afterwards my feet never looked or felt better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product, and it shipped SO so so so fast! And came with a tiny sample of foot cream that smelled delicious. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe it took off all of my hard calluses! My feet are so smooth now it&#x27;s almost unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Since Winter is upon us, now is the perfect time to take care of your feet and get them looking beautiful in time for summer! Unsightly calluses are never something you want when wearing a cute pair of sandals, and with the TONYMOLY Shiny Foot SUPER Peeling Liquid I can get rid of my calluses and have baby soft feet in time for summer! This foot peel is completely painless, and within a few days your calluses will easily start peeling off, no work needed.&lt;br /&gt;What are the features?&lt;br /&gt;·  Visibly noticeable keratin removal&lt;br /&gt;·  Gives you soft feet and relieves fatigue&lt;br /&gt;·  Great for also removing foot odor&lt;br /&gt;I have been hearing so much about foot peels that I thought I would give them a try, I didn’t expect them to really work, so I had my suspitions. The TONYMOLY Shiny Foot SUPER Peeling Liquid blew me away in every single aspect! I cannot believe how well this peel worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;How I used this peel:&lt;br /&gt;·  I soaked my feet in warm soapy water for about 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;·  I made sure my feet were 100% dry before proceeding&lt;br /&gt;·  I put on the included plastic booties and poured the peel liquid in as advised&lt;br /&gt;·  I tied the booties to my feet&lt;br /&gt;·  I left this peel on my feet for 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;·  I jumped in the shower and washed my feet&lt;br /&gt;·  Applied the included foot cream&lt;br /&gt;This peel didn’t hurt at all when it was on my feet, it got slightly warm but nothing at all uncomfortable. While this peel was on my feet I caught up on a couple shows on Netflix, hey it was an excuse to put my feet up! After washing the TONYMOLY Peeling Liquid off of my feet they looked exactly the same as they did pre-peel, but they already felt much softer, and the skin felt like it was going to peel, it’s a difficult feeling to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few days for this peel to work and I was getting impatient starting to think that it wasn’t going to happen. I constantly moistruized my feet just to make sure they weren’t drying out. I take showers normally, but one day I took a hot bath and soaked for a while. By the time I was out and walking around I thought to myself that my feet felt really weird. Almost like I couldn’t feel the carpet that I was walking on, so I looked at my feet. To my surprise my feet were completely peeling in large sheets, all of my calluses were coming off. I was both shocked and excited because I could see the new soft skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet peeled for about two days and now they are extremely soft and smooth. I have actually already purchased this TONYMOLY Foot Peeling Liquid again, I want to do this peel one to two more times before summer comes along. I am completely impressed by this peel. I have actually posted pictures of my before, during, and afters of this peel on my facebook and tons of people have commented wanting to know what I did. I also want to offer this in my Spa as a service because I am that impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry and cracked heels, or if you just have an overgrowth of calluses you need the TONYMOLY Shiny Foot SUPER Peeling Liquid in your life. I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.I take showers normally, but one day I took a hot bath and soaked for a while.

    <li> This stuff, for all tense and purposes, does not work.&lt;br /&gt;There is not enough of the liquid to fully immerse the feet, so the product barely worked.&lt;br /&gt;Now, to be fair, this could have been a problem for me because I have really big feet (US Women&#x27;s size 10, Size 42), so im gonna go ahead and give it two stars.&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what happened: I washed my feet and them into the little packets. I poured the liquid in and waited about an hour 45/two hours. Rinsed my feet, went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;6 days went by and nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;Before bed on day 6, I noticed little white &amp;#34;cracks &amp;#34; on the bottoms of my feet. The next day they were deeper.&lt;br /&gt;On day 7, my feet began to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;--except, rather than fully peel, my feet just kinda flaked. It was really gross and messy--more messy than if my feet had just peeled in bigger sheets (peeled as advertised). instead, I basically ended up with dandruff on my feet. This flaking continued for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are almost done &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; now, but, obviously, since only the smallest, thinnest flakes of skin came off, my feet are not softer. Im really disappointed--especially since my heels are still cracked and rough (the skin there is thicker so the liquid didn&#x27;t penetrate them at all). Im out ten bucks (im in college, so that was my grocery money) and I wish i&#x27;d just bought Babyfoot instead.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: if you have tiny ass feet, this could work for you? Or maybe the stuff is just a rip off. Dont take the chance, just shell out for Babyfoot</li>
    <li> Although my package arrived amazingly fast (only 14 days) it did absolutely nothing for my feet. It&#x27;s been 6 full days and no one bit of peeling yet.</li>
