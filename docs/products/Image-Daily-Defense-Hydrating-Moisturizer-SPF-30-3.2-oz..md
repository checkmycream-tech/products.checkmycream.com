      <li>Delivery time was perfect.</li>
      <li>Quality ingredients, great sun protection, perfect under makeup.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Daily Defense&amp;#34; product is a great product.</li>

      <li>This used to be my favorite daytime moisturizer, but they have changed the formula and now it is more matte than it used to be.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product line because there aren&#x27;t any parabens in</li>

      <li>I was very excited as this was listed as chemical free and had an interesting ingredient list.  </li>

      <li>choosing the best facial suncream comes down to knowing exactly what you want from the product before u buy anything,since it will be used on ur face it is a good idea to make sure it intended specifically for the face instead of for the body ,i didnt like it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great daily moisturizer that&#x27;s light and not greasy.</li>
      <li>Overall really great product.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the fact that it has SPF 30 as well as moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Best product I have used for my skin without being heavy or oily feeling.</li>
      <li>My physician assured me this lotion was far superior.  </li>
      <li>Excellent, however, you have to be careful because a lot comes out, so be very gentle with the squeezing.</li>
      <li>I pretty much love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this work nicely to hydrate and also add SPF.  </li>
      <li>I wanted the old formula that smelled nice, instead got this.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years &amp; always really liked it.</li>
      <li>It also never quite got absorbed.</li>
      <li>While I love IMAGE projects - I was specifically looking for the sensitive skin product which is shown here.  </li>
      <li>Normally people who want chemical free sunblock don&#x27;t want propylene glycol and paraffins and siloxane in the formula.  </li>
      <li>Given that, this product has very finely milled oxides, a relatively lighter carrier, and comes in a mattifying formula.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and break out easily but need sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Finally decided to try the internet and am so happy to have this back.  </li>
      <li>I use Image Face wash and Image Night cream and like them all very much.</li>
      <li>It just seemed very promising with all the amino acids listed and hyaluronate.  </li>
      <li>I use to purchase it through a salon at a higher price.</li>
      <li>If you find a physical block that wears lighter than this I&#x27;d love to hear about it.</li>
      <li>This was first recommended to me by the manager of the Coldwater Creek Spa in Pembroke Pines, Florida.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a white film and flakes if you try to rub it in more thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>I like solar defense better or the tinted daily defense cream.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the exact formula of the item I bought in the salon.</li>
      <li>This is the first review I have left for any product, but felt it was important to warn others.  </li>
      <li>It truly does leave a matte finish, and protects against the sun (I work outside, so this is important).</li>
      <li>it is very haevy on face</li>
      <li>If I use too much at one time it tends to leave the residue.  </li>
      <li>Used too much of it to return it</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>so much</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to those who have not tried it!</li>
      <li>It helps maintain the skin soft and smooth from the suns harmful rays to my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love the other Image products.</li>
      <li>However, when I got the product and removed the sticky label from the ingredients list I found it had propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, clyclopentasiloxane &amp;  isoparaffin, and many other ingredients not listed in the description.</li>
      <li>They also have a facial cleanser called Image Skincare Ormedic Facial Cleanser that I love to use with it.</li>
      <li>Thus product is a good sunscreen but as a daily moisturizer it is too greasy and goes on heavy.</li>
      <li>but i bought this one cuz she recommended it so highly.  </li>
      <li>I love the other vital c products.  </li>
      <li>I gave this moisturizer a 5 star rating, it really works as far as hydration and SPF defense against the sun,  </li>
      <li>I used it for a few weeks but man,  it goes on smooth at first but within a minute or two of putting it on thickens up</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this moisturizer daily since I live in south central Texas.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easy, and does not have the typical greasy residue on you face.</li>
      <li>the first time he put it on, he was wearing a white t-shirt.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin from drying out,  clear of red splotches and the sun from burning me!  </li>
      <li>I use they Daily Defense vital C moisturizer, serum, cleanser and mask.  </li>
      <li>This clogs up your pores and is hard to clean off.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve used these products I can tell a major differnce in my face as far as not being dry and glowing.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I was out in the sun for quite a few hours, reapplied hourly.  </li>

<li> This one leaves the white residue if you put a little more than a dub - but the dub won&#x27;t do the work for you if you are going into a serious sun.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
<li> If these ingredients are not a problem for you than you might be happy with a sunscreen that does not have chemical sunblock, just other chemicals or ingredients that have been linked to cancer :(</li>
<li> I had a little of the old tube left and tried it</li>
<li> I could have used my prior lotion on this type of exposure and would never have even turned the slightest pink.  </li>
<li> it lasts for a long time.  </li>
<li> Be careful ordering from the third party sellers!!</li>
<li> If you are going to be outside a lot, sweating, getting wet, etc, then wear a block with a heavier formula.</li>
<li> So I only leave reviews to help other people..</li>
<li> I have very dry skin and seeing</li>
<li> This moisturizer is very thick and for the value I really question its need.  </li>
<li> Also, I have found that if I use the other products in the system or use the lotion in the bathroom on my face before it becomes completely dry (still has the humidity of the bathroom)</li>
<li> I found it too heavy and greasy, to the point my foundation (powder) would not apply properly.  </li>
<li> It lasts a long time because \\&quot;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya.\\&quot;</li>
<li> Unfortunately,  this product was very drying.</li>
<li> It has a lot more ingredients, a totally different feel, and unfortunately the first time I used it I broke out in a horrible rash all over my face.</li>
<li> i found myself making faces throughout the day, like opening my mouth real wide,</li>
<li> Yes, all physical sunblocks will be heavier and greaser than chemical ones, because a thick carrier is required to keep the oxide particles suspended.</li>
<li> it ended up staining his collar when he stroke down to his neck and chest.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and break out easily but need sunscreen.  It works great under make up or by itself.</li>
    <li> I purchased this expensive lotion at a physician&#x27;s office.  I had been using Neutrogena sunblock for my face, and had been pleased with it.  My physician assured me this lotion was far superior.  The first time I used it, I was out in the sun for quite a few hours, reapplied hourly.  I burned horribly - it was if I had NOTHING on my face.  I could have used my prior lotion on this type of exposure and would never have even turned the slightest pink.  I haven&#x27;t burned on my face in years, I was truly upset.  This is the first review I have left for any product, but felt it was important to warn others.  Horrible product, they should be ashamed to market this as a sun protection.</li>
    <li> I use this product often, as it was recommended to me by my esthetician. It&#x27;s a great daily moisturizer that&#x27;s light and not greasy. I wear it under my makeup every day.</li>
    <li> Excellent, however, you have to be careful because a lot comes out, so be very gentle with the squeezing.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years! Love this product-</li>
    <li> While I love IMAGE projects - I was specifically looking for the sensitive skin product which is shown here.  Unfortunately that is not what this project it.  Hopefully this lotion will not break my face out</li>
    <li> I like solar defense better or the tinted daily defense cream. This one makes your face very very white.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I can wear my makeup over it and it dosent get oily</li>
    <li> I love the other vital c products.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin like it should.  It leaves a white film and flakes if you try to rub it in more thoroughly.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice that it contains sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion!Love how light it is and that it has SPF in it!  Best product I have used for my skin without being heavy or oily feeling.</li>
    <li> I react badly to chemical sunblocks, which means I can only use physical sunblocks that contain zinc oxide and titanium oxide.  This one is the best of them. Yes, all physical sunblocks will be heavier and greaser than chemical ones, because a thick carrier is required to keep the oxide particles suspended. Given that, this product has very finely milled oxides, a relatively lighter carrier, and comes in a mattifying formula. If you are going to be outside a lot, sweating, getting wet, etc, then wear a block with a heavier formula. Also, shake it well before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried around a dozen alternatives to this, at all price points. If you find a physical block that wears lighter than this I&#x27;d love to hear about it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and it lasts for a long time.  Just mix the sun with the serum and instant beauty and coverage with spf protection</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> Thus product is a good sunscreen but as a daily moisturizer it is too greasy and goes on heavy.</li>
    <li> So I only leave reviews to help other people.. I started going to a salon for microderm a cpl x from a groupon I got.  I don&#x27;t usually buy salon level products, usually just get aveeno or loreal day/night creams from walgreens but i bought this one cuz she recommended it so highly.  I used it for a few weeks but man,  it goes on smooth at first but within a minute or two of putting it on thickens up so much i found myself making faces throughout the day, like opening my mouth real wide, just cuz it felt like i had a thick mask on or something.  Def was not a fan of that and haven&#x27;t ever felt that with another cream.  Used too much of it to return it and i ended up tossing it when i was cleaning out my medicine cabinet.  I LOVE LOVE their hydrating cream tho, orange label,  but thats for night.  This one is a dud unles you like walking around feeling like theres mud on your face all day.</li>
    <li> I have been useing this product for a few years and found I could purchase it through Amazon. I use to purchase it through a salon at a higher price. Delivery time was perfect.</li>
    <li> choosing the best facial suncream comes down to knowing exactly what you want from the product before u buy anything,since it will be used on ur face it is a good idea to make sure it intended specifically for the face instead of for the body ,i didnt like it! it is very haevy on face is like u put a mask on</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and seeing as this is labelled \\&quot;Hydrating\\&quot; moisturizer, I thought it would be just what I needed. Unfortunately,  this product was very drying. It also never quite got absorbed. It left a white film on my face, even an hour after application!  And it felt tacky on my face. I love the other Image products. I wish they&#x27;d produce a sunscreen moisturizer that actually worked!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very thick and for the value I really question its need.  SPF coverage leaves white film on face.</li>
    <li> See above review of same product.</li>
    <li> I pretty much love this product.  It has excellent SPF coverage and leaves my skin soft. I gave it four starts instead of five because I have also had issue from time to time with the white residue others are referring to.  If I use too much at one time it tends to leave the residue.  Also, I have found that if I use the other products in the system or use the lotion in the bathroom on my face before it becomes completely dry (still has the humidity of the bathroom) I don&#x27;t get the residue problem.  Overall really great product.  It lasts a long time because \\&quot;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It helps maintain the skin soft and smooth from the suns harmful rays to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I gave this moisturizer a 5 star rating, it really works as far as hydration and SPF defense against the sun,  I use they Daily Defense vital C moisturizer, serum, cleanser and mask.  Since I&#x27;ve used these products I can tell a major differnce in my face as far as not being dry and glowing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years &amp; always really liked it. But it seems they changed the ingredients or formula in some way. It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing and has a filmy feel. I used to put makeup over it with no problem, not anymore. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite daytime moisturizer, but they have changed the formula and now it is more matte than it used to be. It&#x27;s drying and not hydrating.</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the exact formula of the item I bought in the salon. It smells different.  Not sure about the quality.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin from drying out,  clear of red splotches and the sun from burning me!  Highly recommend to those who have not tried it!</li>
    <li> I just started using the Image line a few months ago. This provides great sun coverage, moisture and smells yummy.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Daily Defense&amp;#34; product is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years. However, Image recently changed the formulation and has renamed it &amp;#34;Prevention+ Daily Moisturizer&amp;#34;. It has a lot more ingredients, a totally different feel, and unfortunately the first time I used it I broke out in a horrible rash all over my face. Twice on Amazon I have had third party sellers send me the Prevention+ product when I ordered this Daily Defense product. Beware!  The most recent seller to do this, Aloha, has still not refunded me or accepted return of the product even though they sent me the wrong product.  I would NEVER buy from that seller.  Since I have had two different sellers send the wrong product it seems they aren&#x27;t able to get this product from the manufacturer anymore. Be careful ordering from the third party sellers!!</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena sun block for quite awhile but thought I would try this product to stay in the same product line as what I was using for cleanser.  I found it too heavy and greasy, to the point my foundation (powder) would not apply properly.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with sun protection; only how it felt on my face.  I&#x27;m going back to using Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This product is a great moisturizer and sun screen.  It goes on easy, and does not have the typical greasy residue on you face.</li>
    <li> Quality ingredients, great sun protection, perfect under makeup.  Also have a great lip balancing balm.&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly. Lasts 4 months.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this moisturizer daily since I live in south central Texas.  I enjoy the fact that it has SPF 30 as well as moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer/SPF 30 is the perfect product for someone who has oily, acne-prone skin.  It truly does leave a matte finish, and protects against the sun (I work outside, so this is important).</li>
    <li> I have allergies to so many things and it is hard for me to find lotions/moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;that agree with me. I LOVE this product line because there aren&#x27;t any parabens in it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my makeup glides over it...especially if you apply foundation or tinted&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer over it quckly. It doesn&#x27;t pill up like others do. But...it does make your&lt;br /&gt;face shiny / dewy so if you hate that don&#x27;t bother with this...but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I wanted the old formula that smelled nice, instead got this. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I started using this after a facial where this was used.  I really like it.  I have sensitive skin and this work nicely to hydrate and also add SPF.  I use Image Face wash and Image Night cream and like them all very much.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to get a lightweight &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; chemical free sunblock.  I was very excited as this was listed as chemical free and had an interesting ingredient list.  However, when I got the product and removed the sticky label from the ingredients list I found it had propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, clyclopentasiloxane &amp;  isoparaffin, and many other ingredients not listed in the description. Normally people who want chemical free sunblock don&#x27;t want propylene glycol and paraffins and siloxane in the formula.  It just seemed very promising with all the amino acids listed and hyaluronate.  If these ingredients are not a problem for you than you might be happy with a sunscreen that does not have chemical sunblock, just other chemicals or ingredients that have been linked to cancer :(</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product after putting it on and then trying to apply my makeup the moisturizer flakes and little white spects are all over my face.</li>
    <li> the one i received was tinted.  as titled, neither title or image mentioned it was tinted.  i bought this for my boyfriend.  the first time he put it on, he was wearing a white t-shirt.  it ended up staining his collar when he stroke down to his neck and chest.  i was never able to get the stain off...  i thought it&#x27;s white...  anyways, he said he get really greasy after a few hours and hate the fact that it&#x27;s tinted.</li>
    <li> I had bought this cream before (not online) and liked it.  This time it just sat on my face.  I looked like the joker.  I had a little of the old tube left and tried it and it was fine .  Whatever you have done to the formula stinks.</li>
    <li> This clogs up your pores and is hard to clean off.</li>
    <li> This was first recommended to me by the manager of the Coldwater Creek Spa in Pembroke Pines, Florida.  When I moved from the South Florida area to Tennessee, where Coldwater Creek does not have a spa, I didn&#x27;t know where to find this wonderful moisturizer.  Finally decided to try the internet and am so happy to have this back.  Much better than any product I have found at high-end department stores!  Moisturizes wonderfully but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.  They also have a facial cleanser called Image Skincare Ormedic Facial Cleanser that I love to use with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best moristurizer on the market.  My Wellnes doctor recommended it for me and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I meant to get the one for the oily skin, the one that is less thick. This one leaves the white residue if you put a little more than a dub - but the dub won&#x27;t do the work for you if you are going into a serious sun.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, washing it off is a tough task. I do it with the silver ageless image skincare - it works wonders. Will not buy it again.</li>
