    <li> As other reviewers noted, this shampoo smells like heaven. And a little goes a long way, so even though this shampoo is a bit expensive, it lasts a long time. It makes my hair shiny, soft and bouncy. Not sure that it replaces any hair, but it makes the hair you have better. I am a 40+ woman with lots of fine, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> super, really super, my hair is thin, but with this it has nice volume</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look and feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Also soothed itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, I like this shampoo but find that my hair feels really oily after a day.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday and makes think hair feel/look full!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and the first use it felt great and it still does today. I&#x27;m 44 with a full head of hair and normal male pattern baldness hairline. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> absoulutely perfect..&lt;br /&gt;my hair feels stronger and the quality of the thread has improved.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used together with the concentre densifique.. It is worth ever cent</li>
    <li> I feel my hair with more volume with only 2 weeks using it.</li>
    <li> This lovely smelling shampoo made my hair dry, flyaway, unmanagable and felt like straw! I have very fine, color treated hair and I thought I would try this since I love the Kerastase volumizing shampoo (in the green bottle). I was very disappointed so I returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;I feel my hair soft and with volume</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for almost all hair types.  Gives some extra body and gentle on the hair.</li>
    <li> This is just fabulous for those of us with fine, soft hair.  When I use it, I definitely notice the body and hold in my hair.  When coupled with the Keratase hair spray, it&#x27;s a winning combination!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I have fine hair and this shampoo makes it feel so much thicker!  The smell is heavenly too.  I&#x27;m very particular, and this seems to be the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found for my hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for six months now, and my hair feels stronger and healthier.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for mature, colored hair.</li>
    <li> If you have spent any time in Europe, especially France, you know what &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; really means.  This shampoo is exactly that and is worth every cent.  I PROMISE!!!  I have *never* smelled a shampoo with such a luxurious scent.  I actually want to hop in the shower just so I can smell this product.  It is definitely volumizing too.  I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it replaces hair, but the aromatherapy aspect of it is worth it.  I just wish I were staying in a 5 star hotel in Paris getting ready to go to a Michelin 3 star hotel.  This shampoo is *that* good.</li>
    <li> Product can in super fast, I was amazed. This is the best shampoo I have ever used and I&#x27;m sticking with it. It lathers nicely, rinses easily and leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo - my hair is fine, and cut in a bob with some layers - also at my age I need to be very careful with products that will dry my hair, because I color - with this shampoo I get shine and no bad hair days - just use a dime size - a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This shampoo lived up to expectations. I will buy again for sure. I could do without the heavy perfume smell, though. Thank goodness it dissipates within a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> the hair feels smooth and with volume</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the aging hair formula and the thinning hair regime, I will return to one of those. I don&#x27;t see any body boosting happening and I don&#x27;t like the fragrance as well.</li>
