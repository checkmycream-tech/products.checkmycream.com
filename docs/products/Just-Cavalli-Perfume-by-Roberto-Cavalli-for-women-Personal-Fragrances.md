      <li>Just cavalli is the best smelling perfume that I have purchased in a long time.</li>
      <li>The ad depicts two attractive young adults in an embrace that seems urgent from the man&#x27;s perspective and nonchalant from the woman&#x27;s perspective.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, not at all cloying, and appropriate for day or night.  </li>
      <li>Men will love the sweet smell of vanilla</li>
      <li>, it is SO LIGHT that I have to use loads and loads of it to even know that I&#x27;m wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Does not smell cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap knockoff</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have found it here on Amazon, because I haven&#x27;t had any to use in a long time.</li>
      <li>Now, here I am, enjoying Just Cavalli Her for the first time in 2011.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I saw a magazine ad for Just Cavalli in 2004 and smelled the ravishing, sexy and unique scent, I really wanted to buy it.</li>
      <li>and she was so right!</li>
      <li>Great price and shipping took the expected amount of time and was packed well.</li>
      <li>It is lovely, but I will not purchase again, as it does not so much smell like what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last on me.  </li>
      <li>Came really quick, and smells</li>
      <li>Was quick to get the perfume once I ordered.</li>
      <li>The girl is pretty- gray eyes, full lips and unique jewelry.</li>
      <li>Overall, this perfume is perfect for users that prefer a light, feminine scent but be careful where you place the bottle.</li>
      <li>Everything was as described and arrived fast and accurately.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this perfume several years ago, but of course it is no longer available at the department stores.</li>
      <li>So I can not give a high for that, but service and cost were fine.</li>
      <li>It came in right</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping</li>
      <li>Wish I had tested it out first.</li>
      <li>Just a really interesting, addictive image.</li>
      <li>This scent could definitely work for any age, but it does seems like more of a daytime scent.</li>
      <li>once I got the plastic half-container off, I saw the glass bottle, which is just as pretty as the image you see in the description.   </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Just Cavalli!!</li>
      <li>I have used and bought this perfume many times and felt for some reason this did not smell the same.</li>
      <li>Not exactly what I thought the fragance would be like.....not very fragant but nice.  </li>
      <li>The product I received (quite quickly, by the way) was identical in quality to that brought directly from Italy.  </li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>and you dont have to use as much.</li>
      <li>you vey much</li>
      <li>Gentle and feminine.</li>
      <li>but the plastic packaging is very fragile and cheap looking.</li>
      <li>Still wondering if the one I actually want is available ?</li>
      <li>The price was phenomenal, considering that my other perfumes run $55-$60 for 2 oz.  </li>
      <li>other thing is that this bottle is square and the spray button is set down in the top, flush with the top of the bottle -</li>
      <li>Cavalli has more than one scent called &amp;#34;Just Cavalli&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s in an entirely different shape of bottle and smells totally different than this</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Listen I am going to share something with you, I don&#x27;t normally share my fragrance finds with people,  but I am gonna make an exception this time.</li>
      <li>The package was brand new.</li>
      <li>It was brand new.</li>
      <li>this is it, I must say I was pleasantly surprised on how many people could smell it on me a few feet away..</li>
      <li>Luckily I was allowed to keep the other bottle.</li>
      <li>The entranced, pleading look on the young man&#x27;s face is probably what made me so intersted in this perfume.</li>
      <li>It is a soft fragrance with a hint of vanilla.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>For young girls.</li>
      <li>The color did appear darker, so maybe it was old and that is how this company came about having it.</li>
      <li>Cavallis perfumes don&#x27;t impregnated much on the body like Calvin Kleins they last</li>
      <li>My daughter brought this fragrance back last year from a trip to Italy, and I just happened to sneak it for myself a few times and found that I really liked it and got A LOT of compliments.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is a little spicy, but mostly sweet.</li>
      <li>When I got it and compared it to the sample card it smelled a little different and doesn&#x27;t seem to last long when I&#x27;m wearing it, but it is still a really nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and what I expected!</li>
      <li>Generally I am a fan of Cavalli scents.  </li>
      <li>so much so when i get it the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long at all...</li>
      <li>It is such a classy fragrance and it lasts all day.  </li>

    <li> This fragrance is the best!</li>
    <li> Was quick to get the perfume once I ordered. Exactly as described and what I expected! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great customer service.  I received the product on time and it was everything I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this perfume several years ago, but of course it is no longer available at the department stores. I am so happy to have found it here on Amazon, because I haven&#x27;t had any to use in a long time. My next purchase will be to buy several bottles of it to stock up! Great price and shipping took the expected amount of time and was packed well.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing. I was pleasantly surprised. It makes me want to smell myself all day long. Weird but it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> My daughter brought this fragrance back last year from a trip to Italy, and I just happened to sneak it for myself a few times and found that I really liked it and got A LOT of compliments.  After searching department stores in vain, I let my fingers do the walking and found it here on Amazon.  The product I received (quite quickly, by the way) was identical in quality to that brought directly from Italy.  The price was phenomenal, considering that my other perfumes run $55-$60 for 2 oz.  If you haven&#x27;t experienced this scent, I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s light, not at all cloying, and appropriate for day or night.  Especially good for those of us who don&#x27;t want to be overpowered by our perfume.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, this is a hard perfume to find in the department stores, so when I found it on Amazon, which was reasonably cheaper, I had to jump on it.  I purchased this for my mom, because she loves it as well. It is a soft fragrance with a hint of vanilla. It is such a classy fragrance and it lasts all day.  I highly recommend Just Cavalli!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m searching for that &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; perfume and still haven&#x27;t found it.  I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and get this one. It smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t last on me.  Perfumes are so unpredictable because of body chemistry.  If you&#x27;ve smelled it somewhere and like it, this is a good deal.  I had a perfume called Sunset Cafe and I guess it was discontinued.  I wish I could find that one again. :(</li>
    <li> This perfume was great the smell the design of the bottle everything that I expected,if your looking for a great smelling perfume this is it, I must say I was pleasantly surprised on how many people could smell it on me a few feet away..</li>
    <li> Generally I am a fan of Cavalli scents.  I hadn&#x27;t smelled this one prior to purchase, but after researching it I knew it had all of the elemental notes that I like and that I know smell good on me.  I was trying to use up a gift card, and thought this would be a safe bet for this purpose.  Bummer, turns out that although it smells nice and clean (good for Summer!), it is SO LIGHT that I have to use loads and loads of it to even know that I&#x27;m wearing it.  Drugstore body sprays are stronger and last longer than this on me.  :|  Nothing like going through a bottle of perfume at lightning speed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with another reviewer though, who insinuated this is a &amp;#34;cheap knockoff&amp;#34;.  Cavalli has more than one scent called &amp;#34;Just Cavalli&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s in an entirely different shape of bottle and smells totally different than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing is that this bottle is square and the spray button is set down in the top, flush with the top of the bottle - these things combined make this bottle very hard to spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a terrible perfume, &amp;#34;Just NotforMe&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice. I purchased because it was recommended actually on a perfume blog. I have been looking for TRIBE (from the 90&#x27;s) forever, and on the makers blog a few ladies suggested this as a perfume that smelled just like Tribe. Not so much. It is lovely, but I will not purchase again, as it does not so much smell like what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I think this perfume is fake.  The label is different and the smell is off.</li>
    <li> Great smell!! Men will love the sweet smell of vanilla</li>
    <li> I love the light, refreshing scent of this perfume, 2-3 sprays will last for most of the day which is awesome but the plastic packaging is very fragile and cheap looking. After dropping the bottle on my carpet, the plastic layer actually came off of the bottle leaving me with the disproportional glass layer underneath. Overall, this perfume is perfect for users that prefer a light, feminine scent but be careful where you place the bottle.</li>
    <li> As soon as I saw a magazine ad for Just Cavalli in 2004 and smelled the ravishing, sexy and unique scent, I really wanted to buy it. However, I had tons of sprays so I held off on the purchase, and it fell into the back of my mind. Now, here I am, enjoying Just Cavalli Her for the first time in 2011.  The perfume bottle basically snaps into a plastic half-container, which I found difficult to detach. There is a hard-to-find clasp at the top that you need to undo. Not the most user-friendly design, but once I got the plastic half-container off, I saw the glass bottle, which is just as pretty as the image you see in the description.   This fragrance is a little spicy, but mostly sweet. It has a down-to-earth, slightly outdoorsy scent due to the tobacco. This scent could definitely work for any age, but it does seems like more of a daytime scent. Just Cavalli is uplifting and sunny.  The notes are: \\&quot;Sicilian bergamot, apple, bamboo leaves and blackcurrant, while at its heart, harmonized with lily of the valley, jasmine, apricot blossom and Madagaskar vanilla,\\&quot; and as its base, \\&quot;Madagascar vanilla, Lebanese white cedarwood, amber, musk and tobacco.\\&quot; (All descriptions of the notes are slightly different).  I still have the magazine ad for this perfume posted on my wall at home, amongst a teenagey collage of fashion-related clippings. I could faintly smell the fragrance until about a year ago. The ad depicts two attractive young adults in an embrace that seems urgent from the man&#x27;s perspective and nonchalant from the woman&#x27;s perspective. The entranced, pleading look on the young man&#x27;s face is probably what made me so intersted in this perfume. The girl is pretty- gray eyes, full lips and unique jewelry. Her eyes convey a sense of dominance and persuasion over the man, yet she looks a little bored at the same time. Just a really interesting, addictive image.</li>
    <li> I was sent the incorrect item. I was sent another bottlem in similiar package. Luckily I was allowed to keep the other bottle. Still wondering if the one I actually want is available ?</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and she Loves it. She has used this perfume for years and was so happy and suprised. Also the free samples was a nice touch. Thank You. Highly recommend. Will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Listen I am going to share something with you, I don&#x27;t normally share my fragrance finds with people,  but I am gonna make an exception this time. Just cavalli is the best smelling perfume that I have purchased in a long time. I went to the perfume counter at the local mall just looking around trying different scents when I picked up the cavalli. that was in the summer I am wearing it now. It smells so good and sexy that I don&#x27;t want to wear anything else, I receive so many compliments on this perfume every time I wear it. I simply love it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with what I received. Not only does the bottle look different from my original but it also STINKS. Wish I could return, but amazon won&#x27;t let me. TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent which makes it a nice spring/summer fragrance.  I love this perfume and can ususally find it on Amazon cheaper than what is costs in the stores. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and whenever I wear it, I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I love love love this scent, so much so when i get it the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long at all...</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I thought the fragance would be like.....not very fragant but nice.  Wish I had tested it out first.</li>
    <li> I like it but I wouldn&#x27;t  buy it again. They smell its like sweet but warm, good for fall.&lt;br /&gt;But Cavallis perfumes don&#x27;t impregnated much on the body like Calvin Kleins they last and you dont have to use as much.</li>
    <li> Came really quick, and smells oh so great!! This is my fav. perfume ever and you can not find it anywhere</li>
    <li> I have used and bought this perfume many times and felt for some reason this did not smell the same. The color did appear darker, so maybe it was old and that is how this company came about having it. So I can not give a high for that, but service and cost were fine.</li>
    <li> Affordable. Does not smell cheap. Vanilla, flowers. Gentle and feminine. For young girls. I like it. Bottle looks like it was made of ice.</li>
    <li> Shiping time was a little bummer..&lt;br /&gt;30 days but the suplayer was very good and explained all</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase. Everything was as described and arrived fast and accurately. I am satisfied with this purchase. love it</li>
    <li> My friend had it on and it smell so nice that i had to have it so i ordered and i love it.</li>
    <li> I love it. It was brand new. The package was brand new. It came in right away.&lt;br /&gt;Thank  you vey much</li>
    <li> Was hopeful that this would smell like the discontinued Tribe cologne but it didn&#x27;t. It has a nice smell but not quite what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Fragrance lasts an hour at best. Cheap knockoff I believe. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Wife was disappointed .wont buy again.</li>
    <li> I sampled this in Macy&#x27;s one day and decided to look it up on Amazon. When I got it and compared it to the sample card it smelled a little different and doesn&#x27;t seem to last long when I&#x27;m wearing it, but it is still a really nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was referred to purchase this product by a beauty YOUTube&#x27;er and she was so right! It is the perfect summer scent.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this fragrance. Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued. Happy to have found some on line here!</li>
