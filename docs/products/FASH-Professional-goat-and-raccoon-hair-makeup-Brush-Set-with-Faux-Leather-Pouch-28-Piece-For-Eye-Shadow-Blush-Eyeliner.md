<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love love love this silk robe. It feels great but also keeps me cool and not sticky like cotton. Plus it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I researched about these brushes and they seemed to be the best set on amazon for a decent price with a lot of brushes. I really like these brushes and i feel if i keep using them i will start to LOVE them. The design is good, the color of the brushes are cool, they look good in a brush holder in my room. I like how it comes with a case, which i find good for traveling but i&#x27;ve put them in a brush holder box. The brushes are good quality brushes. I think they should last me so, i would recommend this for any level of makeup and i use these every day. (: very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been used to my Sigma brushes and, still, ordered these for a change. I was well impressed by them. They are a great product for the price. : )Yes, they smell, but it&#x27;s not so bad as it seems by some reviews here...</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas.  When it arrived (the next day) I had to double check to see that the price was correct.  The pouch was the first sign of quality, I thought it was real leather!  Then to open and see the brushes, all I can say is I wanted to keep it for myself!  Now that my daughter has it and I admit I did have to try out a few brushes, I love this set!!!  I can not find it again for the same price, but I would reccomend highly to anyone who enjoys makeup as much as my daughter and I.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, and I bought this set with the intention of incorporating a more polished look into my lifestyle. That being said, I love the brushes. They&#x27;re all very soft, and seem to work well. Also, if you&#x27;re looking to expand your brush set but cheaply. this is definitely a good bet for you. The only downside is that I wish each brush was labeled with its name or use; as I mentioned, I&#x27;m a makeup beginner, and something like that would really help.</li>
    <li> This are amazing Fabulouso brushes.  First of all the bag where the brushes is really nice material it has a black ribbon that makes it look nice and elegant.  The material of the brushes is mostly human hair and they do fall out a little bit with use, but not often.  The set comes with a lot of really thin brushes either to do detailed smudge work  or work in more detail with eye make up or lips.  Other than that the other brushes work best for applying well the shadows.  But if you are looking to do and work on a blending effect be ready to do all the work.  It comes with a round brush that will substitute the fluffy mac #224 brush.  Other than that if you want to keep it to apply make up for yourself or others this is a great start and set.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes and fast shipping! Although it does a very faint plastic smell you wont smell it unless your face is right on the case. it&#x27;s not a big deal just leave the case open to air out and it will go away. I would recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I received this item. I gave it as a gift and it was greatly appreciated. Beautiful brushes, and so many of them, at a fantastic price. One of my better Christmas purchases.</li>
    <li> The product did smell, as expected from reading other reviews. I cleaned the product with a little shampoo and warm water which helped the smell and get some coloring off of the brushes. Overall, brushes seemed dense and good quality. They were not scratchy and felt soft on my skin. If you make sure to clean them when you get them, you should be happy.</li>
    <li> They do the job. The case is really cheap but I bought it for the brushes not the case. There is no funny smell as someone suggested and I haven&#x27;t had a lot of fibers fall out. They are really soft and hold powder well.</li>
    <li> This is a great set with very soft &amp; firm  brushes. You get so many brushes for an excellent price!   I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I purchased this for Christmas as a gift for my daughter. I was only bummed over the fact that I should&#x27;ve bought two. :)  Good timing with shipping.</li>
    <li> overall great brushes!im deployed right now and it defiantly made my day getting these!!!:)their soft, very bright colored! i would recommend these</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. I love the large amount of brushes. It is awesome.  I won&#x27;t need make-up brushes for a long time. This comes with every shape and size!</li>
    <li> The bushes are pretty good. they seem to shed a bit but for the price they are worth it. I would have prefered a few more angle brushes especially the bent angle brush, and they could have been smaller. i think the pencil brush might be little too sharp....other than that they get the job done.</li>
    <li> got these sets for both daughters (25 &amp; 18), they&#x27;re both amazed and are having fun trying the different brushes.  great quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this set after I read a rave review on Facebook.  The person said they were great quality for an amazing price.  Well, the old adage holds true, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the brush roll smelled HORRIBLE!  I&#x27;m not very squeamish, but this roll stank badly of some sort of chemical.  I laid it outside on my covered deck for two days to air it out (without the brushes) and it still smelled bad.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are stiff and felt like they were almost scratching my face when I used them. I had washed them and you&#x27;d think that&#x27;d soften them up somewhat, but it didn&#x27;t.  The brushes shed some, but it wasn&#x27;t as big of an issue as the scratchy feeling.  I tried using them twice, but just can&#x27;t stand them.  They now reside in a drawer until I can decide what to do with them, which may end up being to throw them away, sadly.</li>
    <li> Great!!! Love my brushes easy to use easy clean up they feel great on face!! Love this product will recommend</li>
    <li> I just love it are amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start off with my one issue with this set - the case.  It is not leather, it is not velvet lined and it smells like plastic.  The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; feels (and smells) like vinyl.  The interior is vinyl fabric (waterproof) and there is some sort of padding inside but it feels like foam, not velvet.  The whole thing is tied with a black satin-ish ribbon.  The FASH sticker peeled right off, which I prefer anyway because it just looked cheap with it on.  The smell gave me a headache but it went away after I washed the entire case with homemade brush cleaner.  I let it dry overnight before I put my brushes back inside.  The thing I really like about the case is the flap that folds over the top of the brushes, keeping everything neat and tidy.      Now, on to the part that really matters...the brushes.  First - the brushes stunk like the case did so I washed each one of them before I used them (again, with homemade brush cleaner) and let them dry overnight.  I ended up using my hair dryer to blow dry them completely and it made them super soft and fluffy. I have to say that I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of these brushes.  After a thorough cleaning of every brush in the case (24 brushes, 2 sponge tips, an eye brush, and a spoolie) I only counted about 20 hairs in the bowl.  The four red haired brushes did shed a little dye but the amount was minute.  All the brushes were firmly anchored to the shafts and the metal was firmly clamped.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the amount of hair in each brush.  These are not scrawny, three haired brushes.  I honestly would compare these with MAC or Sephora in terms of the quality.  The fan brush does leave a bit to be desired in the hair department but it works wonderfully.  I wish the brushes were labeled with their names but I took care of that myself with a label maker.  My favorite brushes, hands down, are the big powder brush and the angle brush.  Both of them are fluffly and soft and blend my makeup smoothly.  If FASH had a retractable brush set, I would totally buy it for touchups.  My brush set arrived with the fan brush placed in a slot that folded over so the bristles were crimped.  After a good cleaning and a blow dry, my brush is flat again.  I moved it about 4 slots over so it stays flat.  I also wish the brushes all came with covers to preserve the shape but they&#x27;re not expensive and I&#x27;ll be buying some.      Overall the set is fantastic.  I am pleased with what I got for the price.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the misleading case desription and the time I had to put into removing the smell.  If I could just rate the brushes, it would be 5 stars, no question.</li>
    <li> This product finally came in. Yes there was a smell as the other reviews had stated, but no, it was not something that was unbearable or soap couldn&#x27;t take care of. I would just recommend not keeping the brushes in the case because I am pretty sure that is where the smell is coming from. Out of all of the brushes there was only one that I am leery about using and that is because one side looks new and the other side is a different color, but other than that all I can say is you get what you pay for and occasionally you get a little better than what you planned for. So far they seem to be a little better than what I planned for.</li>
    <li> i can say when looking at the reviews prior to buying these i was worried but then did it any way. all i can say is that they are a great purchase but not great if your a beginer they are not labeled at all !!!!</li>
    <li> The worst brush set you can possibly buy!!!     The brushes are extremely bad quality and the smell is unbearable.     The case went right in the trash, it&#x27;s cheap and stinks like plastic.    It was a waste of money and I will never buy from them again.      Amazon should really consider taking them off the site.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this brush set and was happy to see that it arrived on time and was packaged well. On first sight the leather pouch appears very attractive as the red case is quite eye catching. However as I started to unroll it, I noticed that there were numerous dark lines throughout the case, most likely caused by the brushes being folded together inside for some time. This made the case look damaged and worn, not the feeling I expected from a brand new set.  The brushes however are a great texture and look very chic. However in removing the plastic covers the handle on one of the brushes came off completely, separating from the head of the brush. Not sure if the brush set I got is old but the quality is definitely not what I envisioned. The wide array of brushes was satisfactory though.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom for Christmas. I bought these for a couple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1) they are red her fav color&lt;br /&gt;2) they are not as expensive as the last brushes I bought her 2 years ago from sigma over 100$ Set that she did not take care of them.  I was not going to spend a lot again.&lt;br /&gt;These came in a decent roll out storage bag. There is more than enough brushed here to do all kinds of makeup looks and getting into good detail. The last brushes I bought her she did not take care of and did not wash often, I know big NoNo. I bought her brush cleaner and brush spray to use after she uses the brushes. Should make things easier  I washed all these for her the first time before she uses them, also to show her how to wash them. I saw very little shedding , some die did come off but not bad, the brushes are very soft. She was excited asking ohh what&#x27;s this brush used for. Etc.  she has to prove her self on taking more care of her brushes before I go spending hundred dollars again. We will see-  I will do update once she&#x27;s used them a little bit.</li>
    <li> I love the new set of brushes I received, thank you so much they are exactly what I wanted, and with your descriptions of the brushes, I can honestly say you were right on... thanks again and I will be ordering again soon...... I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them all, but I like them so far. I would recommend them to every woman out there</li>
    <li> I think these brushes are excellent, they get the job done, not annoying, easy to clean, are definitely cute, and soft. love it :)</li>
    <li> So glad i bought this brush set! They are Fabulous!  I love them. My only regret is not finding them sooner!  They feel great, easy to use &amp; clean. The case is perfect to keep them all in order and together.  Plus easy to travel with!</li>
    <li> This was a good quick replacement after my set of brushes were stolen. Product is exactly as described with prompt shipping and received in excellent condition.  I will definitely get my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> I was so exited to receive my brushes set. They came fast and in their fancy leather pouch thing. I could not be happier. I spent a whilr comparing brushes on amazon to buy and i am so glad i chose these. The brushes are very good quality and the price is amazing. The variety is amazing if it had a stippling brush and a difusing brush it would be the bomb.com. the only reason i gave it a 4 star and not 5 is because one brush (brow brush) came apart as soon as i removed the plastic protectant. But idc cuz they are the best brushes for the best price. I say buy them asap before they make them more expensive!!</li>
    <li> The quality of brushes is good for the price. I only wish they had the indication engraved on each one what they are for.</li>
    <li> It came with a lot of brushes and it kind of bulky but I LOVED it. They&#x27;re awesome. Definitely worth their price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes! Good quality, nice and soft. I prefer soft brushes for most things, however, you should have a couple firm brushes in your arsenal. These are amazing, though, and for the price, you can&#x27;t really beat it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend who&#x27;s a makeup artist and she was amazed of the quality of the products provided. So I was more than happy that she was pleased with my gift to her!</li>
    <li> I got these for the price, which was amazing!!! I LUV these because they hardly shed at all and pick up powders perfectly. I have yet to try them out with any crèmes. I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, the ones I have used are sooo soft and fluffy yet they have great control too and the long handles are very nice.</li>
    <li> I love this set of brushes, they don&#x27;t scratch your face like some of the lower quality brushes do. Also you  have a good assortment. Very good brushes for a good price,</li>
    <li> I was nervous to see what the quality would be like for the set of brushes as the price is so good.  I was more than happy with them and I would recommend to anybody</li>
    <li> great product arrived faster than promised, very nice quality. I will purchase product from fash professional again in the future,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, however, I would not necessarily say that the brushes are &#x27;professional&#x27; quality. Very good for everyday personal use. Very nice brushes, in a nice case.</li>
    <li> the package was received well and in due time. The brushes are of very good quality and of different sizes and shapes as seen in the picture. I am not a very good make-up specialist and i use the brushes myself but i think they will be of great help for make-up specialists also.</li>
    <li> My best friend loves this set of brushes!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes as a birthday gift after picking them out on Amazon.  I wanted this so I could experiment with the different kinds of brushes.  The brushes themselves are of a good quality, although they shed a little bit.  They are very soft.  However, the pouch it comes with is terrible.  It bends the hairs of the brushes when folded up.  Overall, it is worth it for the brushes, but not for the case.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for the discounted price because I felt it was time to own my own set. While these are good brushes I wish there may have included a list or inscription of what to use where. There&#x27;s 3 powder looking brushes (or is that blush brush) 6 or 7 different I can deduce eye makeup ones... I&#x27;m winging it but if I knew what each one was I feel I would be able to take full advantage of the product. Only had them one week but now shedding and very soft.</li>
    <li> i CAN NOT complain that much about this product.  FIRST (The Cover)- It is what they sell it to be but it is a VERY NICE cover due to what you pay for it. can&#x27;t complain. The smell at first was unbelievable and gave me a headache. I just cleaned it with a wipe and sprayed my favorite body spray over it. Other then that, it&#x27;s very well made and the inside would be easy to clean if it got dirty with makeup. You get a nice black satin ribbon to wrap around it. Just looking at it, it looks like a little purse that any girl could walk around in. And it is small enough to fit into a bigger purse.   SECOND(The Brushes)- AMAZING for the price. At first, the smell of the cover took over but I just washed them off with HOME-MADE BRUSH CLEANER. My personal favorite was the SLANTED BLUSH BRUSH. I have a couple of types of these brushes, this one has to be in my TOP THREE. It was so soft and picked up my blush just perfect. I was also EXCITED to see a SMALL FLAT-TOP, lately I have been hearing ALOT of rant and rave over this type of brush. When I got to use i fell in LOVE with it. I was HIGHLY upset and disappointed with FAN BRUSH. One of the main reasons I got this set was because of the FAN BRUSH, when I got it the plastic around the BRUSH was bent and along with the brush. I tried to revive it by washing it and putting it into this real shape. When I did this is shed out so much hair that it wasn&#x27;t worth it (it barely had hair to begin with). I just threw it out and went to WAL-MART and brought another brush to add into this set which was fuller and cost 7.89. The eye brushes as a whole were very good, barely shed and were soft upon my skin. One thing that upset me as well was the brushes had NO NAMES or NUMBERS. I would like to know which brush I was working with and when I talk to other make-up artist I would like to be able to have something to address the brushes by. That was a little BUM&#x27;ER  I give this a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Only because the cover was given a false image, the smell, the fan brush, and no names/numbers on the brush.  For the PRICE you are paying it is a STEAL. If you are a begin&#x27;er this SET is good for you.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to received these brushes.  The packaging smelled awful but after airing out and cleaning the brushes they were fine. NOTE:  make sure you do not pick up the small bushes by the hair.  They have a tenancy to fall out.</li>
    <li> love these brushes. I have some to my granddaughters and kept the rest.  Very nice quality and does not fall out.</li>
    <li> This brush set is wonderful! I use almost every brush in this 28-piece set everyday. There are a few brushes that I feel are missing, but I have bought them from other brands. Also it seems that some of the eye brushes are exactly the same. But overall I love this set, there is very little fall out from the bristles and the texture of the hair is great! The red pouch makes it easy to travel with as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while now and the hairs keep falling out! Like every time I go to put makeup on I have to pull all the loose hairs sticking out or else they&#x27;ll come off on my face and irritate me.</li>
    <li> Awesome set for the price!</li>
    <li> The case does have a smell to it and one of the angle brushes is really stiff other then that they are pretty good very soft..</li>
    <li> you get all brushes you can think of, and the quality for the price is amazing and the carrying case is super convenient too</li>
    <li> When I opened the package i thought that it would have given me a list for the order that the brushes were in. It is nice to have a pack of 28b brushes, but what is the real use when you have to figure out which brush is which. It was very annoying trying to figure them out and i still dont know what all of the brushes are for. If you are a make-up expert and can tell all of the brushes without a label then yes get this, if you are like me and can not then i suggest you do not get this set.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with my brushes. The case is sturdy and the brushes are of a good quality. I gave it four stars because some of the hairs come out when you now get it while using it but that seems to be a regular thing with new brushes. Guess that&#x27;s the excess bristles. I wished the brushes had like names engraved on them saying what type of brush it is...e.g blending or shading brush. I am a make up artist in the making and that would have really helped. Despite those small things i would recommend this product to anyone. I think I got value for my money.</li>
    <li> Brushes came in super fast shipment. Didnt have a strong smell as other reviewers said. They are new so expect that with any product...ie SHOES, CARS, etc. Soft hairs and fibers...the number of eyeshadow brushes really give you range on creating great contour. Buy them!</li>
    <li> From the reviews I expected the roll to stink to high heaven but when I got it, it wasnt as bad as I thought, It did had a faux leather smell but I had to shove my nose on it to get the smell.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft, I have felt softer but these are good , the shedding is way more than I expected, after a wash, the brushes bled dye, some of the eye-shadow brushes shed wayyyy more than I wanted to. I can flick them with my finger a couple of times and i have hairs flying out, which was sad cause I bought two 1$ brushes from china and they are much softer and don&#x27;t shed. The face brushes are softer than I expected. I have an elf total face brush and its softer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During application with a few eyeshadow brushes there is no shedding on my face so far, they pick up color well and place it well. So thats good, I guess I have to not force hairs out, at lease after all those hairs flying out the brushes so far dont feel thin or anything, so maybe over time they will stop. The handles are nice and sleek, no breaking and I love the colors red and black together, wish they had names of what brushes they are. I;m sure I can use the list provided to label them accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FAN BRUSH IS HORRIBLE. I am gonna have to replace that. Its hairs are all over the place even after a wash, its not flat its just horrible. One good thing is its still soft and isn&#x27;t shedding as bad so far.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the kit came with a flat foundation brush and a fluffy blending brush but I will just add them in due time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had bought another kit but so far its not TOO bad, just want the shedding to stop, but for the price, and since the roll for me was VERY good, the brushes despite the shedding is very soft and in my fave colors its still worth it.  I will update this if I have any changes.</li>
    <li> They work great and hold the makeup great.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I like so much my new brushes, it&#x27;s faux leather is lovely, an each brush is awesome!!! I love it! :)</li>
    <li> Looked around at a bunch of sets and this seemed to have a good ratio of quality/quantity/price.  Purchased for Daughter.  She says; good variety, soft brushes and although some hair has come out, they still work very well.  She&#x27;s using them and likes the feel (the wooden handles were a plus as far as I was concerned -but hey, what do I know...) so overall a good investment for the casual user.</li>
    <li> When I recieved this item a couple of the brushes had the brissels stuck together and looked like they had been used.  When I touched another brush, all of the brissels fell out.  I threw away these brushes right away and I&#x27;m going to clean the others before I use them in case they had been used.  I wanted to return this item, but I didn&#x27;t feel like making the effort.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy a higher quality item.</li>
