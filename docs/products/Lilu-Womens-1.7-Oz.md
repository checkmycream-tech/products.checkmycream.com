<li> Recently, the closest PacSun to me closed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used lilu since i was a teenager, the on and off the market thing is getting pretty irritating though.</li>
<li> , I know this sounds silly, but most perfume bottles don&#x27;t break when dropped on hard ground, but this one did.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the postal service or the company, but it arrived about 4 days later than the estimated date.</li>
<li> I have used this perfume for years but also sad to see the price go up so much.</li>
<li> Last, I was not impressed with the shipping.</li>
<li> I was sad when I couldn&#x27;t get it from Pacsun anymore.</li>
<li> I no longer smell like stale farts and feet.</li>
<li> The PacSun worker looked at me like I was crazy.</li>
<li> i was very sad when they discontinued it</li>
<li> When my PacSun Stopped carrying it I was very sad.</li>

    <li> It smells great. But the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know this sounds silly, but most perfume bottles don&#x27;t break when dropped on hard ground, but this one did. Accidentally of course lol. I feel that speaks for the quality.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Was sent on time and love it :)</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes I own, I&#x27;ve periodically used this perfume since high school and I always get told I smell amazing.  Again one of my favorites I recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  My nieces love this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s been my favorite perfume since I was 16. Now  I&#x27;m 27. I thought PAC SUN  didn&#x27;t sell it anymore in 2008.  Then I went on line and found out its only sold online. So now I&#x27;m excited to  have my favorite sent back. Thank you Internet. I am one happy lady :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters 27th birthday.  This was her favorite when she was a teen.  She loves the fresh scent.</li>

    <li> I love this perfume, sad to see it is not sold in my local stores anymore. I have used this perfume for years but also sad to see the price go up so much. Last, I was not impressed with the shipping. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the postal service or the company, but it arrived about 4 days later than the estimated date.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite! !!!!!!!! Wish Pac Sun still carried this! !</li>
    <li> Honestly, this perfume is my absolute favorite scent! I have been wearing it for 7, almost 8, years now. I was so upset when they stopped making it. I went ecstatic when I found it in stores again. The PacSun worker looked at me like I was crazy. I was just so excited. Recently, the closest PacSun to me closed. I am so glad I can still buy this online. I loooooove it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  When my PacSun Stopped carrying it I was very sad. I&#x27;m so happy that I was able to find my favorite perfume again- at an affordable price too! It shipped within days and I am very satisfied. I no longer smell like stale farts and feet.</li>
    <li> The scent took me right back to the last time I wore Lilu! I&#x27;m so thrilled that I found it again!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ll buy it regularly from Amazon and PacSun. This will always be My favorite perfume. I&#x27;ve used lilu since i was a teenager, the on and off the market thing is getting pretty irritating though.</li>

    <li> I love this smell. I was sad when I couldn&#x27;t get it from Pacsun anymore. So happy to have out again! My favorite smell of all time. And the bottle was much bigger than I thought.</li>
    <li> My purchase arrived in great condition and I am enjoying the product.</li>
    <li> This perfume was okay but just wasn&#x27;t my kind of scent for my personality so I gave to my sister :)</li>
