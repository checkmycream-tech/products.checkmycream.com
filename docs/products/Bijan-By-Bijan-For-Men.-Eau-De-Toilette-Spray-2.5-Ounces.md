      <li>i have been using Bijan for 18 years now and won&#x27;t give it up for NO other.</li>

    <li> It smells good - what more can one say? I don&#x27;t know how long a squirt will last, however. Try it. Find out yourself...smell good (for a change...hi...hi...) - it won&#x27;t break you!</li>
    <li> My husband likes this brand and could not find it in stores so I went to Amazon. Will purchase again if I can get a better price but he wanted it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents my husband wears.  It is awesome - spicy, yet sweet.  Mild, yet lasts a long time on the skin.</li>
    <li> I bought Bijan Eau De Toilette a number of years ago. Until I saw it on Amazon, I thought it was no longer available. It has a potency more like a cologne along the lines of a Chanel for men. Consequently, it is a bargain-but don&#x27;t use too much or it will be overpowering...</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Smells slightly different than what I remember from my younger days, but maybe that&#x27;s just me... I bought this on Amazon Prime and it&#x27;s definitely the real deal!  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> i have been using Bijan for 18 years now and won&#x27;t give it up for NO other. Love it!!</li>

    <li> I have been using Bijan for men since the mid 90s when I received a sample at the St Regis hotel in NYC.  Not overpowering and lasts through the day. Very pleasant, spicy fragrance.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband he love it!</li>
    <li> Like others, I did not even know this was still being made.  I bought this the first year it came out and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clearly for evening use and probably in the fall and winter.  It can be very strong for day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found it again.</li>
    <li> Normally my favorite, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in department stores so was excited to find it on line. Much to my disappointment, this was so old it smelled strongly &amp;#34;rank&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Husband loved it! Enough said!</li>
    <li> Best I have used.  Will only use Bijan original.  Nothing else compares.  It blends well with my body chemistry.  Forget about roses at my wake.  I want Bijan scented flowers.</li>

I promised people will be asking what is that you have on..MMM.MMM..GOOD!..Men get this colgne if its the last thing you do..Dont pass it up!</li>
    <li> It smells nasty. It looks the item is fake. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy the item. I suggest not to buy to my friends. Moreover, you CAN&#x27;T return the item.</li>
    <li> Hot hot hot one of my favorites mens cologne, it wakes up your senses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this scent for a long time and now it&#x27;s even more affordable.</li>
    <li> Get it while its hot.  these are getting harder and harder to find this great man scent for those who recall this great house of Bijan  but don&#x27;t have the  to pay $5000 for a Bijan tailored  suit  you too can smell like a million.</li>
    <li> Scent not as strong as previous bottles.  ???</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this</li>
    <li> I bought the male and the female bottle - I have 16 top end colognes and this one is just fascinating just like the first time I stopped a strange Lady to ask her what perfume she was wearing..the original Bijan before they also added a Man&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the product especially this price and the Amazon provider service was top notch!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have a girlfriend to give the female version to - but with this &#x27;fro Men&#x27; Bijan - I am optimistic!</li>

    <li> This is NOT the original Bijan For Men.  Don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve done to it but it&#x27;s not even close to what it used to be.  Beware if you think you are buying the same stuff you had in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
