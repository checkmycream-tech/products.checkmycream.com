      <li>Love the hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>The remi hair is good for the first 2 weeks after which it starts to tangle and get frizzy.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous hair, really smooth and soft, just didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t a wig, you should put a picture of it as it is, just to people like me, with a not-so-great english.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>great texture&lt;br /&gt;long lasting</li>
      <li>is my second week wearing this hair and it looks great.</li>
      <li>Great hair if you are using it for a short time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And, such a good deal.</li>
      <li>IT was a good quick simple product!!</li>
      <li>I received the hair &amp; it is very pretty &amp; silky.</li>
      <li>If you want nice hair that&#x27;s going to last</li>
      <li>but still nice enough...</li>
      <li>The hair is very soft and smooth it flows</li>
      <li>I had the hair for about a month since I made a quick weave out of it, instead of sewing it directly to my hair !!!</li>
      <li>This hair looked great the first three weeks, but after the first shampoo, it tangled and was hard to comb.</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s been the case ever since that first wash.</li>
      <li>Firstly I must say there are some kinks to this product, but for $18 I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have my hair in a whole week and it look like it had been in my head a whole month.</li>
      <li>really well</li>
      <li>texture was also very pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My friends really like it flows so well.</li>
      <li>looks like good quality hair, but unless your real hair is thick</li>
      <li>it arrived fast same as the first time I ordered from this company...</li>
      <li>I usually wear my own natural hair, but because of my birthday was coming</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>after the first shampoo it wasnt the same...</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t even do my hair near the kitchen.</li>
      <li>its really soft and silky</li>
      <li>- I don&#x27;t want to keep this style forever &amp; all the other sellers&#x27; prices are substantially higher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a hot mess.</li>
      <li>it dint get tangled or matted, I will definitely be buying this product again in the near future &amp; I would recommend this product to all the women I know!</li>
      <li>I was extremely skeptical about buying a weave from Amazon.com - the only reason I went through with it was because I had amazon credit from a returned gift and wouldn&#x27;t actually be losing any of my own money if it sucked.</li>

    <li> Look great and natural.&lt;br /&gt;The texture was also very pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;I got lots of compliments&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase over &amp; over again.....</li>
    <li> The remi hair is good for the first 2 weeks after which it starts to tangle and get frizzy.Great hair if you are using it for a short time.&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about buying a weave from Amazon.com - the only reason I went through with it was because I had amazon credit from a returned gift and wouldn&#x27;t actually be losing any of my own money if it sucked. The hair turned out to be AMAZING. And, such a good deal. I only wish they sold different shades &amp; lengths - I don&#x27;t want to keep this style forever &amp; all the other sellers&#x27; prices are substantially higher.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair in the 99J color. This hair looked great the first three weeks, but after the first shampoo, it tangled and was hard to comb. And that&#x27;s been the case ever since that first wash. I&#x27;m brushing or combing it constantly throughout the day. It&#x27;s a hot mess. I will not purchase this brand ever again.</li>
    <li> Love the hair. It is very soft and curls wonderfully !!! I had the hair for about a month since I made a quick weave out of it, instead of sewing it directly to my hair !!!</li>
    <li> I have had this hair in for 3 days and I sewed it in with closure.  Didn&#x27;t cut the weft until after getting to the top and this hair sheds like crazy.  I can&#x27;t run my hands through it anymore and it although it feels soft, the shedding is ridiculous.  I walked through my kitchen yesterday and it looked like I had a dog and I don&#x27;t even do my hair near the kitchen. Strands just fall out I guess.  I will never buy this hair again!&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I didn&#x27;t get this hair from Amazon. I love Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could attach pictures here.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I had lot of complement, good hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair it arrived fast same as the first time I ordered from this company... No complaints and the hair was great no complaints with it....</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a great idea, make a wig out of it, I will give that so e though.</li>
    <li> Firstly I must say there are some kinks to this product, but for $18 I really can&#x27;t complain.I made a wig cap with the hair kept it on for 2 weeks and its still holding up didn&#x27;t wash it yet though. The hair is very soft and smooth it flows really well I love it.</li>
    <li> looks like good quality hair, but unless your real hair is thick it&#x27;s difficult to blend. I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.</li>

    <li> IT was a good quick simple product!!</li>
    <li> I am so addicted to this hair and the flow. I cannot see myself for a while changing it. My friends really like it flows so well. Fits anty accassion.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous hair, really smooth and soft, just didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t a wig, you should put a picture of it as it is, just to people like me, with a not-so-great english.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great producto, though</li>
    <li> Nice texture, sheds quite a bit (didnt seal wefts). A little matted after washing but straightens well with flat iron.  Arrived in timely manner. Will buy again but won&#x27;t leave it in over a month. Lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> i like the hair.....pity it does not come in different lengths....after the first shampoo it wasnt the same...but still nice enough...its really soft and silky</li>
    <li> got this hair it is so nice installed it myself will buy this hair again. Hope to reorder soon.be will be telling friends.</li>
    <li> I rated this five stars because it was everything I hoped it would be, it&#x27;s a very good quality and feels very nice, it dint get tangled or matted, I will definitely be buying this product again in the near future &amp; I would recommend this product to all the women I know!</li>
    <li> I received the hair &amp; it is very pretty &amp; silky. I have not had it put in as of yet . I was waiting to have it done for Mothers Day. The hair is luxurious. I&#x27;m about to purchase more to have on hand.</li>
    <li> great texture&lt;br /&gt;long lasting</li>
    <li> First off I would like to say that I&#x27;m not a weave user so buying hair was difficult for me. I usually wear my own natural hair, but because of my birthday was coming I wanted to try something new. I ask one of my friends about hair, she told me to get Remy XQ. Wish I would have listen. Instead I purchased Remi goddess. That was the biggest mistake ever!! What made me get the hair was the store owner stated it was good hair. Two packs of hair for $150 OK I said to myself that&#x27;s cheaper than the XQ. You get what you pay for. I purchased the hair on March 2, 2013 had it put in on March the 3rd by the end of the week the hair was a mess. I didn&#x27;t have my hair in a whole week and it look like it had been in my head a whole month. It tangles really bad, it don&#x27;t hold curls. I had to curl my hair EVERYDAY!! I literally me EVERYDAY. When I decided to wash it, it tangles so bad even when I wrap it up at night the next day it was horrible and that was every single day.I will never and I mean NEVER buy this hair again &amp; I don&#x27;t recommend this hair product to anybody. If you want nice hair that&#x27;s going to last you have to spend money on it. As of today I still have it in my hair but as of 3/29/2013 this mess will be out of this head IMMEDIATELY!! And not to mention this was a sew-in. What a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> very good quality hair .This is my second week wearing this hair and it looks great. The hair is very smooth and silky</li>
