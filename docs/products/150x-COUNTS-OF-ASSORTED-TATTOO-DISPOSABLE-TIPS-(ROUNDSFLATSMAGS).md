    <li> the packaging was iffy they wont come apart n when thay do they rip open all the other packages  not good for sanitation</li>
    <li> Everything was delivered on time or before the date it was suppose to be delivered. This is excellent and i will be buying these more.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the full tube, tip, and grip combo but that was getting just to expensive. I saw these for a great price and thought that I would try them. I will never go back to the \\&quot;combo\\&quot; packs. They take up less space, a wider assortment and they are very durable. I will absolutely buys these again.</li>
    <li> The order came on time and shipped in good shape. The description matched what I received. And everything was sealed as should be.....Thanks</li>
    <li> Love these they work perfectly I&#x27;ll be ordering again</li>
    <li> These are perfect! Individually wrapped and lots of sizes.</li>
    <li> if you like disposable&#x27;s instead of the steal and having to clean them, then this is great, price was great, and didn&#x27;t take long on the shipping</li>
    <li> work great and i never have to clean them and they cam early in</li>
    <li> I places the order April 3rd in the afternoon, the eta was April 10 but it just arrived. Great surprise i must say. Packaging, no complaints. I do recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Ft4- 4 pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Ft5- 2 pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Ft11-2pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Ft9-2 pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Rt3-4pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Rt5-4pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Rt7-6pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Rt9-4pks of 5each&lt;br /&gt;Rt14-2pks of 5each</li>
    <li> Tips are good for price</li>
    <li> I ordered tips before and I&#x27;m not calling no names, but I&#x27;m getting ready to order these 150.the last co. sent me a lot of crap.i want what the description is not a bunch crap and left overs. If your co. can count and get my order right I will be a returning customers, if it&#x27;s not right, I will get my money back and get up with amazon, not being rude just want the right order. thanks crazy rick</li>
    <li> if just practicing ok but for true tattooing would recommend full tube. not great for live tattooing tube splinters and cracks when securing in gun. would recommend for practice only.</li>
    <li> great product, no issues they work great. Will be buying more from you in the future. a great assortment as described</li>
    <li> This a great packet of assorted tattoo tips. It comes with a wide variety of them and they will all be used as well which is nice. They are all sealed well and are sterilized which is a big thing to look for. They came well packed and buying them this way is a better deal than buying tips and tubes together.</li>
    <li> They are great but they give you weird amounts for random sizes! I looks like someone grabbed a handful of each and just tossed them in the bag!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problem with this, got exactly what I pay for, although I could use more liners then shaders, it&#x27;s a lot of shaders, you know what your getting tho</li>
    <li> Everything I Needed!!!!</li>
    <li> Always my way. you guys are awesome</li>
    <li> Happy with the product but when I received them there wasnt 100 pieces. I counted them and there was only 87. No 5rl, or 7rl and those are the main ones I needed.</li>
    <li> My son does tattoos and I bought these for him and he likes them. Says it works well and will be back to buy more when he needs it.</li>
    <li> It was on time earlier then I was thing thanks</li>
    <li> its the best way to protect your customers from bio hazards, im not sure how good these ones will be yet but cheap they r</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged and had all the seals intact. Little too many flats for my taste but had enough to get the job done. Couldn&#x27;t beat it for the price if you only want tips. Fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> This was great but was told 9m would be in box and it wasnt! But great product all around anyway!</li>
    <li> was very pleased with order fast and every thing in order</li>
    <li> It all works good but there were a few missing from the packages.. It just came with a few empty, sanitized packages lol</li>
    <li> poor quality and the mix pack is all b.s most I wont even use came with reall few common sizes and a ton of crap don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> well worth buying. aint found one disformed tip</li>
    <li> i placed 2 orders of these sets and they didnt send me any flats...they sent me 150 rt5, 100 rt3 and 50 rt 11....these people shouldnt be able to sell anything if they are gonna screw people like this</li>
    <li> received the package before estimated time altho that still don&#x27;t make up for how s***ty it was packed it was all thrown in a drawstring clear sack I did reicieve 150 tips but half of them are 3rl and random sizes I mostly reicieved flats. the description is not what you get at all you get a bunch of bs for $5 basically.  I haven&#x27;t even used the tips yet but I will review the quality once I try them but if I was you id just buy an auto clave and stainless everything.</li>
    <li> The tips I ordered were great. The were exactly what I needed and did great when used and the price was awesome. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Got what was expected</li>
    <li> These are the cheapest tips available. The 3rnds are more like 5s the 5s like 7s and so on. The packaging was horrible. The assortment is nothing like advertised. Only good part was shipping time. Spend the extra 2 bucks for better tips. 149 of these are already in the trash where they work best.</li>
    <li> Everything was as good as they said it was on time good quality 5☆ on my end</li>
    <li> received today. Got five extra, wrong quantity. Overall they seem legit</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and expected.</li>
    <li> is exactly what i ordered. worked perfectly as i hoped and was cheaper that chain or department stores here in town. thank you</li>
    <li> This is a good price and product. It came with all pieces accounted for. I got it sooner than I should have.</li>
    <li> Great and wonderful packaging! Would order more soon!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t too hard to write a review about because its so simple. you get whats in the picture, Theres 150 needles that come, 3L/ 5L/ 7L/ 9L/ same as shaders and same as mags.  All come sterilized which is nice and needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall&#x3D; great price great product.</li>
    <li> I have now had several tattoos from these needles and tips and for the price am very pleased! Worked flawlessly!</li>
    <li> had everything i needded only thing i didnt like was that there were a couple tips that werent rite sze</li>
    <li> Like these but I don&#x27;t have all the sizes of needles so their are some that I will not be probably using</li>
    <li> These were a gift but the tattoo artist seemed very happy with them.  He said they save him a lot of time (for whatever they&#x27;re made for).</li>
    <li> these tips are great. they allow me to do a better job than normal. awsome!!!</li>
    <li> this product arrived with almost all 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14 rounds with about 25 flats (5, 7, 9). my only complaint is that there were not enough smaller flats, and i would have hoped for a few more flats. arrived on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Great for the price...</li>
