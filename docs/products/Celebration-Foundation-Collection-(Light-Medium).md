      <li>Excellent product from my perspective.  </li>
      <li>The h20 liquid in the it line is great!!!</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with it.</li>
      <li>Plus, it has great &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>The powder is great.</li>
      <li>This foundation goes on great and feels good on my face.  </li>
      <li>I went with the light medium and it is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I would say it is medium coverage, which is good for me.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with product and delivery.</li>
      <li>Compact was nice and the quantity is good for the price..</li>
      <li>But I LOVE the brush!</li>
      <li>This makeup is amazing.</li>
      <li>it cover so nice that you feel like it is your skin and the confidence came from that and the compliments too.</li>
      <li>Fills in pores nicely.</li>
      <li>Brush is nice..</li>
      <li>I just have wonderful clear coverage.</li>
      <li>A reorder love, love, love!</li>
      <li>For me anyway.. I wanted it to apply on top of the liquid..</li>
      <li>Love the ease of use, the coverage, and especially the awesome brush...</li>
      <li>The brush was okay.</li>
      <li>and this is yet another favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love It Cosmetics,i&#x27;m a medium tone and</li>
      <li>I love this foundation.</li>
      <li>Love this make up</li>
      <li>Love this foundation.</li>
      <li>For those who don&#x27;t have lines and want fullest coverage the flat top brush would be perfect.</li>
      <li>And one more thing ; when you wash your face at the end of the day you feel it clean and soft (because of the good ingredients) buy and enjoy !!!</li>
      <li>This product does a quick job of covering some age spots on my face and it also does a nice job of hiding enlarged pores on my nose).  </li>
      <li>First time trying this product and it ls light yet gives good coverage.  </li>
      <li>Very forgiving color and good coverage</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, smooth, and applies great.</li>
      <li>Foundation does turn to a creamy finish, however, to get full coverage you need more layers which result in a Casey finish for me.  </li>
      <li>worth the price of the whole collection on its own!</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and easy to use.</li>
      <li>but even if you&#x27;re light handed while applying, it looks Chalky at times.  </li>
      <li>Flawless skin with a very, very slight illumination or glow.</li>
      <li>It is so soft and smooth and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I hope it holds up &amp; does the same great job it has done for me in April when hot, humid summer arrives~~~</li>
      <li>you can make it as full of a coverage as you want.</li>
      <li>I returned my newly released bare minerals liquid foundation when I tried this on and it is far superior for my skin and better coverage.</li>
      <li>the color was right on,very silky smooth,great brush</li>
      <li>My skin is also really pale, so I thought I would need to go with a lighter shade, but this light medium is just right, I love it!</li>
      <li>Better than Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>it goes on easy, covers very well, and stays on all day - even in high humidity here in Florida.</li>
      <li>I can still get a very moderate coverage with the rounder brush and it doesn&#x27;t pick up as much product which I like because I can control it better.</li>
      <li>I love it so much, I just ordered a 2nd compact for my purse.</li>
      <li>Really like the brush that comes with it too.  </li>
      <li>Much..</li>
      <li>A real treat to buff my skin with.</li>
      <li>I have normal to dryer skin if that helps!</li>
      <li>My skin is combination now, whereas it once was mainly oily.</li>
      <li>make ups that I have worn for 40 years (mainly Clinique).  </li>
      <li>That being said, the brush is worth the entire price!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen this same product sold with the flat top brush which I own and it lays it down a bit heavier with the flat topped brush which I didn&#x27;t like and was not flattering.</li>
      <li>This is a new concept for me.  </li>
      <li>It looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>dense, soft bristles.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, this foundation doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>and it cover it completely..</li>
      <li>up&amp;#34;, and this services for a light, everyday addition to my stash.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft but not as soft as sigma or Ecotool brushes.</li>
      <li>works very well on my skin and have seen the mixed bag of reviews.</li>
      <li>I am a young 65 year old, look 10 years younger</li>
      <li>This product is really no better than many similar products that cost much less.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 54 and have some minor laxity from the corner of my nose to downward toward my mouth..not deep grooves, but a bit of lax skin and everything settles in to this area and makes me feel self conscious.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This powder works well with a buffing brush you can make it as full of a coverage as you want. I use it when i want to wear less makeup. Also I keep one in my purse for tuch ups during the day when I use my regular cream foundation.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Better than Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> Excellent product from my perspective.  I don&#x27;t use heavy &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34;, and this services for a light, everyday addition to my stash.  I&#x27;ve already re-ordered it!</li>
    <li> I love It Cosmetics,i&#x27;m a medium tone and the color was right on,very silky smooth,great brush</li>
    <li> Saw a demo on QVC recently &amp; I was intrigued. I have never worn powder as make-up in my life (just wore some powder over my liquid make up at times). This is a new concept for me.  I am a young 65 year old, look 10 years younger (or so I am told!) and am starting to have issues with some liquid make ups that I have worn for 40 years (mainly Clinique).  My skin is combination now, whereas it once was mainly oily. This product does a quick job of covering some age spots on my face and it also does a nice job of hiding enlarged pores on my nose).  I don&#x27;t have to go over my face with a fine-tooth-comb mirror now as just a few swirls with the brush &amp; my face is done. I love it so much, I just ordered a 2nd compact for my purse. I hope it holds up &amp; does the same great job it has done for me in April when hot, humid summer arrives~~~</li>
    <li> I should have ordered a shade darker. Does not completely cover my face. But I LOVE the brush!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, scaly, flacky skin and this works wonders!  I use it with moisturizer and primer so I don&#x27;t yet know how it would perform without those but it is one of very few foundations (especially powder) that truly covers without emphasizing the dryness or looking cakey.</li>
    <li> Love this make up and so does my daughter.</li>
    <li> Very forgiving color and good coverage but even if you&#x27;re light handed while applying, it looks Chalky at times.  I sometimes use a tissue to blot after application.</li>
    <li> When I got the product and open it .... I said to my self that&#x27;s it?  But after the second time I can tell you girls that this is going to be my friend for a long time... it is not like a regular foundation, I agree with another review that it is a medium coverage, but no one wrote about the way it feels after you apply it;  it cover so nice that you feel like it is your skin and the confidence came from that and the compliments too. And one more thing ; when you wash your face at the end of the day you feel it clean and soft (because of the good ingredients) buy and enjoy !!!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. it goes on easy, covers very well, and stays on all day - even in high humidity here in Florida. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have TERRIBLE skin- really dry some days, oily some days, and really flaky. With all other makeup, it starts peeling off of my nose within a few hours. This makeup is amazing. It stays on all day, covers my everything, and doesn&#x27;t flake or cake at all! It is so soft and smooth and I absolutely love it! My skin is also really pale, so I thought I would need to go with a lighter shade, but this light medium is just right, I love it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and delivery.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend.  Love the ease of use, the coverage, and especially the awesome brush...worth the price of the whole collection on its own!</li>
    <li> Foundation does turn to a creamy finish, however, to get full coverage you need more layers which result in a Casey finish for me.  That being said, the brush is worth the entire price!  I&#x27;ve never tried anything like it...dense, soft bristles. A real treat to buff my skin with.</li>
    <li> This product is really no better than many similar products that cost much less. The coverage is not what was promised.</li>
    <li> I had a reaction to this product.  A rash appeared after a few days</li>
    <li> Not for dry skin. Unless u like that dead look!!!</li>
    <li> This foundation goes on great and feels good on my face.  I went with the light medium and it is perfect.  Really like the brush that comes with it too.  It looks very natural.  I would say it is medium coverage, which is good for me.</li>
    <li> First time trying this product and it ls light yet gives good coverage.  I am very impressed with it.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation. My skin feels so silky when I use it. Goes on smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <li> A reorder love, love, love!</li>
    <li> The brush was okay. It&#x27;s soft but not as soft as sigma or Ecotool brushes. The powder is great. It&#x27;s soft, smooth, and applies great.</li>
    <li> works very well on my skin and have seen the mixed bag of reviews. I&#x27;m 54 and have some minor laxity from the corner of my nose to downward toward my mouth..not deep grooves, but a bit of lax skin and everything settles in to this area and makes me feel self conscious. This however did not do so. I&#x27;ve seen this same product sold with the flat top brush which I own and it lays it down a bit heavier with the flat topped brush which I didn&#x27;t like and was not flattering. I can still get a very moderate coverage with the rounder brush and it doesn&#x27;t pick up as much product which I like because I can control it better. For those who don&#x27;t have lines and want fullest coverage the flat top brush would be perfect. I purchase a lot of IT cosmetics and this is yet another favorite. Flawless skin with a very, very slight illumination or glow. Fills in pores nicely. I returned my newly released bare minerals liquid foundation when I tried this on and it is far superior for my skin and better coverage. I have normal to dryer skin if that helps!</li>
    <li> This is the creamiest power foundation that I have ever used. It provides medium coverage and doesn&#x27;t settled into lines. Plus, it has great &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;! It doesn&#x27;t fade or flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have sensitive skin, this foundation doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause breakouts. I just have wonderful clear coverage.</li>
    <li> Much.. To powdery for me.. Brush is nice.. Compact was nice and the quantity is good for the price.. Just not a good product for me.. The h20 liquid in the it line is great!!! My daughter has red spots on her face.. Gets really bad sometimes  and it cover it completely.. And she loves it as well.. But this powder compact doesn&#x27;t do that.. For me anyway.. I wanted it to apply on top of the liquid..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like using liquid foundation everyday and when I don&#x27;t I always grab my Celebration Foundation in Light/Medium. It covers Everything without looking cakey. It&#x27;s easybto apply and stays all day. I don&#x27;t use makeup that needs reapplied throughout the day. I&#x27;ll attach a picture of myself wearing this foundation on a 80 defree day 8 hours after I did my makeup.</li>
    <li> Comes off looking a bit orange</li>
