      <li>clears my skin right up.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Smells girly at first, then like sulfur.</li>
      <li>I never had before ,,, funny thing, has no acne on my face</li>
      <li>Did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
      <li>this is not my first time buying it here from Amazon.com ,</li>
      <li>If you have it right now and want to eliminate it fast you can use this soap and then switch to a maintenance alternative like the Defense soap that doesn&#x27;t have any sulphur</li>
      <li>a super strong (as in give you a headache strong) cheap perfume smell that does a poor job of trying to cover up the classic sulfur smell of burnt rubber and rotten eggs.</li>
      <li>My very acne prone younger daughter, this has made her skin nice and clear</li>
      <li>I use this soap first thing in the morning with no loofah, and the evening with a gentle face loofah, I follow this with moisturizer (containing 2% salicylic acid) and lip balm.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is the strong sulfur smell.</li>
      <li>I have a skin fungus that is not curable and acts up at certain times of the year...</li>
      <li>Shipping is fast.</li>
      <li>Really helps keep my KP in check.</li>
      <li>Washed JUST my face and the whole day</li>
      <li>RX medications dont work this fast.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for All &amp;#34;Health Care professionals&amp;#34; !</li>
      <li>This soap will keep your face gently exfoliated.  </li>
      <li>Pleas to the manufacturer for help fell on very deaf ears.</li>
      <li>This stuff seemed to work well for its intended purpose and was gentle to the skin.</li>
      <li>IT really does.</li>
      <li>These really works for Seborrheic Dermatitis.</li>
      <li>Works very well on scalp.</li>
      <li>Soap works very well.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get my teenager to keep using this, so I don&#x27;t think he likes it much.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to offer an unscented version for people who are allergic to or avoid heavily perfumed products.</li>
      <li>I suppose you have to choose the demons you&#x27;re willing to live with.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had skin issues since high school, I&#x27;ve tried creams, antibiotics, hormone</li>
      <li>so far the flaking is gone but haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the scratching.</li>
      <li>Plus this product works well for troubled  and sensitive skin types, great for all age groups and the whole family will benefit from using it.</li>
      <li>but it takes a little longer to clear :-)</li>
      <li>It cleanses thoroughly and rinses clean, not leaving a slick of oil on the skin like a lot of beauty bars, and doesn’t over dry like many medicated soaps.</li>
      <li>My skin is very clear after using this soap.</li>
      <li>This soap works pretty if used regularly in stopping the spread and discoloration of the skin.  </li>
      <li>i used it for my daughter ezema on her back, with combinations of other products, i guess it was okay.</li>
      <li>My first order came in plastic containers that double as soap dishes.</li>
      <li>It helped clear up his condition as well.</li>
      <li>Also helps clear your acne and clogged pores.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see myself going back to my old soap.</li>
      <li>The combination of 10% sulphur and 3% salicylic acid is the only natural FAST working remedy for tinea versicolor that I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>i used this soap for my dog who has a frequent skin problem like scratching and flaking of the skin.</li>
      <li>it is the tropical weather or getting old ,,, don&#x27;t know&lt;br /&gt;any</li>
      <li>putting this on the skin experimentally was a mistake.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and this soap is a must as I&#x27;m having some problems with acne.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>but really keeps the red bumps away.</li>
      <li>One has extremely sensitive skin, and this does not bother hers.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to finally acquire a few bars of this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll gladly smell like sulfur for a few hours so long as my complexion remains clear.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When opening my mail box I could smell the unnatural perfume odor.&lt;br /&gt;This package was wrapped in plastic several times in a tape wrapped box!!! I does&#x27;nt take a rocket scientist to understand how potent chemical perfumes are when they migrate through plastic. I was upset to think this heavy chemical scent compound is used in soap. putting this on the skin experimentally was a mistake. It has residual scent compounds that took 2 days or more to remove from the skin.Please do not use this toxic soap. Phalate scent compounds such as this are known toxins......and have negative health affects for repeated exposure.</li>
    <li> This soup works great for me clears my skin right up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and this soap is a must as I&#x27;m having some problems with acne.  Yes acne at age 48</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said it would do. Keeps oily and out of control skin under control.</li>
    <li> Bought for teen son it seems to be clearing up the blemishes!😀</li>
    <li> i used it for my daughter ezema on her back, with combinations of other products, i guess it was okay. Seems a bit expensive for soap.</li>
    <li> My skin is very clear after using this soap. My first order came in plastic containers that double as soap dishes. It doesn&#x27;t lather very well and there is a very slight sulfur smell left on the skin. The upside is that it works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and the bars last a long time.</li>
    <li> These bars don&#x27;t contain parabens, which is important since I have a sensitivity. They work for my acne-prone face, and I gave one to a friend who has been troubled with tinea versicolor. It helped clear up his condition as well. The only drawback is the strong sulfur smell. When washing my face, it&#x27;s quite strong. It reminds me of the smell of match sticks. My friend said it makes him smell like gun powder. It&#x27;s a smell that lingers, so others around you tend to notice the smell. I don&#x27;t mind, though. I&#x27;ll gladly smell like sulfur for a few hours so long as my complexion remains clear.  I suppose you have to choose the demons you&#x27;re willing to live with.</li>
    <li> My second time purchasing this product, it works well for my skin allergy.</li>
    <li> My skin is smoother, clearer, and less dry. I really don&#x27;t see myself going back to my old soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Cleared up all fungal issues within days.  Itching stopped almost immediately.  RX medications dont work this fast.  Will always keep this soap on hand!!!</li>
    <li> My kids use this on their acne spots; works everytime to zap those unsightly, nasty skin eruptions!  ;)</li>
    <li> It really works-my husband&#x27;s stinky scalp is gone!!!!</li>
    <li> makes you can feel clean after showering but it leaves a sulfur smell on your body. seemed to work good for acne treatment. I have no problem with Amazon except the price they charge for shipping. This keeps me from many purchases.</li>
    <li> Good, effective soaps, great for acne and psoriasis. I&#x27;m just now allergic to ingredients other than the salicylic acid and sulfur. They are a bit pricey</li>
    <li> This soap works great for acne problems .</li>
    <li> I have a skin fungus that is not curable and acts up at certain times of the year...usually in warmer weather and areas that sweat a lot.  This soap works pretty if used regularly in stopping the spread and discoloration of the skin.  However, the price can be costly.</li>
    <li> I buy for my sister she recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had skin issues since high school, I&#x27;ve tried creams, antibiotics, hormone therapy-- even acutane. Ugh. I tried these as a last ditch attempt before going in for a chemical peel and one week later I have zero blemishes! The soap does smell a bit burnt and chemically (probably to camouflage the sulfur smell) but the results are worth it. And it sooo cheap! I use this soap first thing in the morning with no loofah, and the evening with a gentle face loofah, I follow this with moisturizer (containing 2% salicylic acid) and lip balm.</li>
    <li> Item works okay, smell isn&#x27;t all that bad!</li>
    <li> it arrived not in a box but as what is shown in the picture, in a plastic, and inside a bubble envelope. anyway, the soap has a very strong smell of sulfur. i know that it is sulfur soap but at least you can add something to mask the odor. you can even smell it inside the shower without using it. i used this soap for my dog who has a frequent skin problem like scratching and flaking of the skin. so far the flaking is gone but haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the scratching. it may take time to get it into effect by then may be i can update this review.</li>
    <li> Two bars for the price of one. Can&#x27;t beat that! I believe it works, yet I did not use it longer than two weeks due to its smell. It smells somewhat perfumy- not as strong as the reviews here. It does however smell like sulfur- I would compare it to a matchstick after it is blown out? The smell stays on your skin too- perhaps since I washed my face with this in the mornings. Great product for acne care. The smell means it works!</li>
    <li> I was glad to finally acquire a few bars of this. Used to find it very easily in local stores, but it scarce now. Great product and ships quickly.</li>
    <li> The product appears to function as stated. I chose the product based on reviews and ingredients. I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I picked this package up from my doorstep and could immediately smell the perfume in this soap---yes, before I opened it. I never imagined that a medcated soap would be steeped in scent! I have an allergy to fragrances and was uable to even take this into my house.</li>
    <li> Soap helps heal up almost all acne and facial skin problems. My daughter and I both use it with great success!</li>
    <li> Soap works very well. Fast delivery and great price.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for itchy skin, and smells good for medicinal soap.</li>
    <li> My son loves this soap.  We tried everything for acne .......Something worked a little some made it worse.  This was the best result of anything we tried.....</li>
    <li> This is the soap I use to keep my face from breaking out.</li>
    <li> I have bought this twice for my two teenage daughters.  One has extremely sensitive skin, and this does not bother hers.  My very acne prone younger daughter, this has made her skin nice and clear and she is thrilled.</li>
    <li> With regard to the SAL3 Cleansing Bar - 3% Salicylic Acid, 10% Sulfur, I&#x27;ve been using for several years.  I purchase very regularly through Amazon, and will continue to do so.  Why?  Because IT WORKS WELL.  No one else is making this product as well as this company.  I&#x27;ve reviewed this before and continue to &amp;#34;sing its praises&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This soap did not improve my KP. May need to try other treatment. Shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> I bought the soap to help with summer rashes and breaks outs, and so far it’s been perfect for me. The lack of specialty oils or fragrance makes it perfect for people like myself who suffer skin allergies. It cleanses thoroughly and rinses clean, not leaving a slick of oil on the skin like a lot of beauty bars, and doesn’t over dry like many medicated soaps. It is great for a face bar because it cleans without stripping and doesn’t irritate, which leads to more break outs and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slightly burnt sulfur smell and doesn’t lather like soap you get at your local mega mart. This is a small drawback compared to how well it works.</li>
    <li> The soap works really well and smells really good too. My wife and I both love it. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> These really works for Seborrheic Dermatitis. If you can, just take a rag and soap it up with this and scrub your ears, neck and scalp. You don&#x27;t need to waste your money on a shampoo. Just soap your hair with the bar. After having those nasty itchy, grey flakes for years, it was completely gone in less than a week after applying Sal-3.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and packaged very well.  I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel about the soap.  It seems to be working very well and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product! Helped to clear up the bumps on my arm and the acne on my back!</li>
    <li> Works very well on scalp.</li>
    <li> this is 2nd time buying sal3, so far they do clear out my stubborn (body) acne&lt;br /&gt;that I never had before ,,, funny thing, has no acne on my face&lt;br /&gt;either it is the tropical weather or getting old ,,, don&#x27;t know&lt;br /&gt;any way, this sal3 working like a charm for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only complain, my skin gets dry with it&lt;br /&gt;thanks to earth mama angels baby body butter the issue taken care of&lt;br /&gt;hopefully this sal3 has no health side effect if using it often ,,, cross my finger</li>
    <li> I had bug bites after being out after sundown and this soap soothed and helped healing process.</li>
    <li> This soap will keep your face gently exfoliated.  Also helps clear your acne and clogged pores.</li>
    <li> Excellent for drying up skin rashes. Especially if your itching. Also, works well with skin fungus infections. I recommend lathering it on before bed time and going to sleep with it coated on the skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get my teenager to keep using this, so I don&#x27;t think he likes it much.</li>
    <li> This stuff seemed to work well for its intended purpose and was gentle to the skin.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is overpowering. It would be nice to offer an unscented version for people who are allergic to or avoid heavily perfumed products.</li>
    <li> Wow. Didn&#x27;t expect this.  Bought two more.  Great for your hair and face.</li>
    <li> Great product, it is replacing Pernox scrub (no longer available) which I used for 40 years, to keep my skin clear. I use it with a mechanical rotating brush to keep my skin squeaky clean and free of blemishes.</li>
    <li> IT really does. That said, it&#x27;s done a wonderful job of minimizing breakouts on back and chest, even in a humid Georgia summer. .....however, sulfur compounds are among the smelliest known to man, and thus this soap leaves a lingering aura of brimstone.</li>
    <li> Smells girly at first, then like sulfur. Dries out my face way to bad. Made my face break out bad with redness. Works on feet best.</li>
    <li> Nicely scented and helps with skin irritation. I have used other soaps with sulfur, but this is the best. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin as dry as regular soap.</li>
    <li> Really helps keep my KP in check. Not a cure but really keeps the red bumps away. Leaves my skin feeling so fresh. Not the most wonderful sent in the world but it goes away quickly/doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was never able to use this properly as the bar I received was as rough and dry as a pumice stone but without any of the benefits of an actual pumice stone. (I did not order from this seller.) Pleas to the manufacturer for help fell on very deaf ears.</li>
    <li> This formula removes Eczema on Brown skin.  In 1984 I used the original bar called Sastid; and within a few months my dry patches were gone.  I been recommending this soap for years</li>
    <li> Yes it does kill lice , works great on contact&lt;br /&gt;Sulphurs been Killin lice since discovered fact!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how people could say this soap smells good! It&#x27;s absolutely awful- a super strong (as in give you a headache strong) cheap perfume smell that does a poor job of trying to cover up the classic sulfur smell of burnt rubber and rotten eggs. The mix of the two is disgusting, like cheap perfume sprayed in a garbage can instead of cleaning it. So bad I couldn&#x27;t keep using it. Washed JUST my face and the whole day people were hinting about a &amp;#34;bad smell&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t use at night either, my pillow stinks, and the smell just doesn&#x27;t go away. It may work, but the smell is so disgusting I&#x27;d rather live with skin problems!</li>
    <li> Helps a bit...not a cure though..... with my acne from Hormone Replacement Therapy</li>
    <li> The combination of 10% sulphur and 3% salicylic acid is the only natural FAST working remedy for tinea versicolor that I have ever tried. This soap works fast (in a few days) to eliminate it (temporarily, cause you need to keep using an anti fungal soap continuously to keep it away).  If you have it right now and want to eliminate it fast you can use this soap and then switch to a maintenance alternative like the Defense soap that doesn&#x27;t have any sulphur so you don&#x27;t get the weird sulphur smell when you take a shower.  As an alternative to this soap you can use Selsun Blue Dandruff Shampoo on your body. It work on tinea versicolor but it takes a little longer to clear :-)</li>
    <li> This soap cleans well and helps with our families eczema problems.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.Works well.Can smell the surfur but I still love how it works.</li>
    <li> I bought it to help with acne, and maybe it&#x27;s supposed to get worse before it gets better, but I broke out TERRIBLY. I knew it would smell bad, but yes, it smells like rotten eggs.</li>
    <li> Good skin care product and a good value.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Great soap!!!! Cleared up my skin like nothing else!!!!</li>
