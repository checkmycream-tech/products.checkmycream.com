      <li>This trio is worth every dime!</li>

      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I have very fine straight hair which is color processed.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo works well, leaving a clean and manageable hair.  </li>
      <li>HARD TO FIND BEST ON THE MARKET</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and moist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and the matching conditioner after getting a sample in my Birchbox. It works really well on color treated, dry, frizzy hair that is very thick. I don&#x27;t need any other products to take frizz out or get rid of the fly-aways. Not sure if it would work for everyone but I have been really impressed with how soft and silky my hair is.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Very hydrating for my hair.  I will continue to use this product in the future.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for processed hair, especially when used with No.4 Hydrating Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair feeling silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> seems to do a nice job cleansing the hair. the scent is a good one, just perhaps a bit too much fragrance.</li>
    <li> What a great, warm fragrance!  This shampoo works well, leaving a clean and manageable hair.  The amber-like fragrance stays with you a long time.</li>
    <li> I first used this product at my PM Salon after running out of PM Awapuhi.  This stuff is SO Much better! I have long thick curly hair so I use a lot more than the normal person would but it is well worth it.  I ran out last week and my salon didn&#x27;t have any more in yet so I have been waiting until my next appointment to get some.  I miss it terribly.  My hair has not been the same since I stopped using it, and it&#x27;s only been a few washes.  I can&#x27;t wait to get it back.</li>
    <li> My stylist first used this on my hair, and I fell in love!! Turning 40 and living in the dessert, after living in humid Florida, has caused my hair to feel so dry!  But the Hydrating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner by N.4 makes my hair feel amazing again!  Even with hard water and softener, my hair still feels so soft &amp; silky with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine, blonde hair, that is high lighted, and like I said - age &amp; weather has caused my baby fine hair to go from soft - to dry &amp; frizzy - but N.4 fixes it!!  Highly recommend this line!</li>
    <li> This smells so good and keeps your color in your hair</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have suffered from scalp dermatitis for years and used prescription treatments from my dermatologist. A hairdresser used this product on my hair and my scalp itchiness subsided for the first time. I finally concluded that gluten was the cause of my scalp issue and have used this shampoo ever since(almost 2 years). Not only did it help my scalp, my hair looks and feels amazing! I&#x27;ve used many salon products but have never gotten results like this from other products. It has a wonderful fragrance and is very concentrated.  It&#x27;s well worth the high price!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used, girlfriend loves coming over and using it, but she needs to pitch in. :)</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works great. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> N. 4 is pricey, but well worth it. A little goes a long way. This shampoo and conditioner is the best I have ever tried! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, good scent. Small bottle</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing.  I really love using it!</li>
    <li> Gentle shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair care line.  I love all their products.  The best!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to me. It was absurdly expensive at the salon, but is really cheap on Amazon for the amount that you get. It hasn&#x27;t washed out my colour and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or dry. However, it&#x27;s kind of blah and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything that amazing (compared to my old Redken product which my hair loved). After some time there is a lot of build up on my hair, which can be solved by a clarifying wash once a week. I repurchased this shampoo once, but will rotate to something else after I finish this bottle. Speaking of the bottle, it&#x27;s a really cute bathroom accessory at least!</li>
    <li> love this shampoo. Wish bottles were bigger .  I use this with the conditioner and makes my hair look great..  Very fast shipping also</li>
    <li> I tried a sample size of this shampoo and I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t splurge on a whole bottle! It did wonders for my hair so I can&#x27;t complain about that, but the smell is so strong my husband and I joked that people from medieval times would have used it for their infrequent baths in order to combat body odor. The smell isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, and I would probably buy the product if the scent was maybe 15% the strength, but it took several washes with another shampoo to get the smell out.</li>
    <li> I recently found out about this brand and I love the products!  They shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel very healthy and the smell is great!</li>
    <li> Good product however left in the shower at the gym.  So I used it just once.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo mostly because at my salon they use this and my hair always feels and stays clean and soft. My only complaint is the dispenser .it sticks and is annoying to pump ....most times I open it and just pour ( not so pore -able as it is thick ) but I would not (not) use it because of it&#x27;s packaging</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I first tried a sample from a birch box and just had to buy it. It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and moist.</li>
    <li> I love this brand for shampoo &amp; conditioner. I originally tried the clarifying shampoo through my birchbox subscription and then I purchased the hydrating shampoo &amp; conditioner as a set through Groupon. I fell in love with this brand and my stylist kept telling me how great my hair looked and felt! I bought this through amazon because it seemed to be the best price out there since groupon hasn&#x27;t had it on their site again. I have long thick curly hair and I struggle with dryness because of having this type of hair but this has helped make my hair soft and beautiful :)</li>
    <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER!! ive tried the N.4 prep and comb spray, and it was the best product ive ever used, it was the only thing that worked on my daughters tangled hair. so i thought if that was such an amazing product this has to be too. OMG was i wrong. this shampoo does not hydrate, and it smells like dead animal. i tried to return it but because of health regulations i couldnt. i dont waste so i ended up using it. the shape of the bottle makes it hard for the shampoo to come out towards the end of it. this was a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> I used this last night.  It left my hair feeling horrible and smells just as bad.  I am washing it for the second time trying to get the smell out.</li>
    <li> Does not live up to promises.  i would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is obnoxiously vile... like department store fragrance gone bad and weird chemicals.  It helps somewhat with frizz, but after washing... leaves my hair feeling dry to the touch.  Also, while this product is marketed with natural ingredients like yogurt, gluten free, etc... it&#x27;s filled with chemical names both familiar (sulfates) and unfamiliar that are terribly un-health-conscious!  I would rather live with the frizz.</li>
    <li> I use other N4 products, but did not care for this at all.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used and I have used plenty of different products over the years. It is important though to also use the conditioner. And while you are spending all that money anyway the spray and protect product is a must to have the optimum quality turnout.</li>
    <li> Fantastic products. My hair is soft, shiny, feels healthy (have naturally coarse and dry hair) and smells great. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> 1 star isn&#x27;t for the product but for the false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title says hydrating shampoo -- but if you click on the image -- the bottle says hydrating conditioner, and that&#x27;s the product you are purchasing. I LOVE this product. It significantly reduces frizz -- making styling so much easier. I originally purchased both shampoo and conditioner at the salon, but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying d/t cost. Thought I was ordering the shampoo but received conditioner instead.</li>
    <li> This all to be the BEST shampoo I have ever used!!!  I will never use anything else.  My hair loves, loves, loves it.  Thank you Number 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your customer forever,&lt;br /&gt;Diana</li>
    <li> Ditto the comment on the conditioner.  I love this shampoo.  It is every bit worth the price for my hair to feel soft and not dry.  This product does the trick...and smells soooo good.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product... makes your hair feel smooth &amp; silky. LOVE the fragrance! This pump works!&lt;br /&gt;Priced well, better than salons!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works well and smells amazing. Pricey no matter where you buy it. I treat myself to it occasionally.</li>
    <li> I had bought this shampoo and conditioner at a nice salon and was so impressed by the heavenly scent and hydrating power. I decided to repurchase on amazon and this stuff was a different color and had an almost offensive odor. It also leaves what almost feels like a waxy coating on the hair. Huge disappointment!</li>
    <li> Absolutely BEST hair product you&#x27;ll ever use on your hair, might be a little more pricy but worth every drop! Purchase and shipping was great</li>
    <li> I just purchased the entire line of Alterna’s Bamboo Volume hair care which made me less than enthusiastic when I received this product.  I decided I would give it a shot and use it every couple of days to give my hair a break from the Alterna.  I was pleasantly surprised with how well I liked this shampoo!  It does have a masculine scent that sticks with you throughout the day however it’s not so overwhelming that you smell like a boy.  I found myself sniffing my hair throughout the day because I enjoyed it.  It didn’t weigh my hair down – and I have notoriously fine and flat hair – and rinsed easily.  Definitely not my favorite shampoo but I wouldn’t throw away a sample if I got more.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo adds great shine to your hair and makes it feel real soft. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> I just tried the shampoo, conditioner and protective spray, and it&#x27;s awesome!! I have tried every high end proud  out there for course, thick and dry hair. This trio is worth every dime!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I have thick, coarse and wavy hair. This shampoo rinses cleans and leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy. I have used Aveda for years and this by far out performs. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, however I don&#x27;t use it daily as it tends to dry out my scalp. I use it every 3 or 4th wash and I use the matching conditioner daily. Great smell, and good product. Much cheaper to buy on Amazon versus a hair salon.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product line. The shampoo is hydrating and leaves hair shiny., easy to manage.  The fragrance is subtle. The Prep and Protect Leave In Conditioning  Spray from this line, is really wonderful and works great with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;If you want some foaming action mix with some water, either way, cleans without drying out your hair.  Happy with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair which is color processed.  I had used hydrating shampoos in the past, all of which weighed my hair down and made it look stringy.  I recently got a sample of this shampoo and I absolutely love it.  It has made my hair soft and bouncy and has a wonderful fragrance.  A little bit goes a very long way. I also am using the hydrating conditioner as well.  The site that sent me the sample was quickly out of stock, so I was so excited I found it on Amazon AND at a better price.  Can&#x27;t wait for my package to arrive.</li>
    <li> I have used it all: Davines, Malin + Goetz, Pureology, Aveda, Phyto, you name it. This is hands down the only shampoo and conditioner that bring all the good out of my hair. My hair tends to be dry and frizzy, and I live in LA where the sun and dry air do help tame the frizz but dry it completely. No. 4 Shampoo and Conditioner have turned this all around. I actually use a little bit of the conditioner once I&#x27;m out of the shower as a styling and blow-drying aid. I did splurge on the spray stuff, and found that it didn&#x27;t work very well for me and frizzed me out a bit, and I&#x27;ve tried a sample of the blowdry lotion which also didn&#x27;t work well for me. I do have the super expensive repair mask and that is AMAZING as well. Also the packaging of all No. 4 products is ridiculously perfect and I hear Tom Ford does the fragrance. It&#x27;s worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> Do NOT purchase this product here. It is counterfeit! My hair is like hideous straw after one use. Why can&#x27;t these sellers be honest?</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and how soft my hair feels after using.</li>
    <li> Not only is the smell amazing, it leaves you hair smelling good, looking healthy, and manageable! I love this shampoo &amp; will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I love Number 4 products. They use healthy ingredients, are highly concentrated and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is low sudsing, so if you aren&#x27;t used to it, you might use too much. I have long thick hair and I can use just one pump. The best way to use it is to rub the shampoo between your hands first, then distribute it into your hair. You will find that the suds are low, but your hair will be left clean and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very light so it won&#x27;t conflict with other fragrances that you choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number 4 makes a Beat teh Heat kist that is a great way to try four great products. The kit is designed to de frizz your hair without blow drying or using a flat iron. I do use the products that way during the warner months. I also use them  during the winter when I blow dry and use a flat iron because they leave my hair glossy, tangle free and hydrated which is even more important when you are using heat often.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell after getting a sample... But pump broke upon arrival n now I have to unscrew and dump product into hand... Far too expensive for the inxonvenience</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this shampoo the minute my stylist lathered it up in my hair. It smells fresh (kind of a unique smell) and a bottle lasts me a long time. I purchased this in October and still have a little bit left, even after using it consistently 3-4 times a week. I normally have frizzy and dull hair, but this stuff gives me shine and softness. The Hydrating Conditioner is fantastic as well. I know it&#x27;s pretty expensive (I&#x27;m a cheap girl myself), but it&#x27;s truly worth it if you want healthy and shiny locks.</li>
    <li> HARD TO FIND BEST ON THE MARKET</li>
    <li> I opened the package and the shampoo smelled so bad, that I would never put it in my hair.</li>
    <li> I originally got a sample in birch box and loved the scent, it&#x27;s like&lt;br /&gt;A tea tree smell &amp; leaves my hair clean &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason the contents of this container of this shampoo is not the same quality as what I&#x27;d previously received via Birchbox. Seemed watered down and not as thick, definitely not as hydrating as the former bottle I had.</li>
    <li> It smells like it is medicated but other than that I really like this product. I can tell me hair feels healthier.</li>
