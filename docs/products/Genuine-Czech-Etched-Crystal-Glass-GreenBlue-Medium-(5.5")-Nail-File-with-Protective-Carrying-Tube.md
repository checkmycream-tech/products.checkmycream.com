      <li>Also, I liked that these are considered &amp;#34;green,&amp;#34; or eco-friendly.</li>
      <li>And it comes with a handy petty tube to put it in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice quality for the price, and it&#x27;s very pretty with a nice protective case.</li>
      <li>Colors appear in person exactly as pictured (so very nice looking) and comes with protective case and tube for travel.  </li>
      <li>I read about these crystal glass files being much better for your nails but had never tried one.  </li>
      <li>I am 100% satisfied.</li>
      <li>excellent quality, well designed tool sure to last &amp; provide what is was purchased to do.</li>
      <li>like these much better than the sander type, metal ones, even the stone ones.</li>
      <li>Does a much better job of filing my nails.</li>
      <li>Much better than the plastic ones found in stores.</li>
      <li>Just rinse it with warm water after each use to keep it Clean</li>
      <li>You only file in one direction and it gives you a perfect smooth finish.</li>
      <li>Easy to disinfect with alcohol and doesn&#x27;t lose its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove nail residue from surface.</li>
      <li>It files your nails VERY quickly, but so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t shred the nail at all.  </li>
      <li>It files the edges of nails so nicely, and also was very effective when I carefully filed the top of the nails particularly on my thumbs where I get ridges.</li>
      <li>Only con is that these break easily if dropped, so maybe a good idea to have an inexpensive, good quality metal file as a back up.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see this one on Amazon at a more reasonable price than what I&#x27;d paid for my original one.  </li>
      <li>I loved it enough I&#x27;m now repurchasing, getting the set of three files.  </li>
      <li>Adequate for traveling and carrying in my purse.  </li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s much better than one I bought at Sephora for several dollars more.)</li>
      <li>Very nice, hasn&#x27;t gotten dull after many uses like cheaper ones do after one or two uses.</li>
      <li>These are very pretty</li>
      <li>This one is 95% as good as the other, which is good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>In addition to a sheath for the file, it comes with a clear plastic tube/case to better protect it from breakage..</li>
      <li>File surfaces are nicely eteched, with medium coarse and fine sides - have had no issues with wearing down so far and it is easy to clean -</li>
      <li>Love it for my nail and the only way to go.</li>
      <li>Love the individual containers.</li>
      <li>I really like this nail file!  </li>
      <li>I liked the smoother ones I had previously gotten better, but they were not double sided.</li>
      <li>Very well wrapped and as describe.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH</li>
      <li>like the way it &#x27;smooths&#x27; out the nail and any instead the typical more abrasive nail files.</li>
      <li>Nothing ever left the edges of my nails feeling so silky smooth; and it lasted for years before I finally lost it somewhere.  </li>
      <li>Normal file length so comfortable to handle, point is sharp enough to clean under nails but not too sharp and file is thick enough to be sturdy but not too thick - altogether a well-thought out design, implemented with good quality materials.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re sick of shredding your nails on regular files, order this--it&#x27;s far superior.</li>

    <li> now I see what all the fuss is about in buying Czech made nail files. there shouldnt be any other nail files but these. no more rough spots after filing and no more broken nails for this girl.i have worked this file HARD since ive gotten it and the surface is still as good as new.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT FILE I LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT BOTH MY DAUGHTERS ONE AND GUESS WHAT?  YEP, THEY ARE GOING TO ORDER SOME FOR THEIR FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> Lovely!  It files your nails VERY quickly, but so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t shred the nail at all.  Unfortunately I broke mine in a matter of weeks (user error).  I loved it enough I&#x27;m now repurchasing, getting the set of three files.  If you&#x27;re sick of shredding your nails on regular files, order this--it&#x27;s far superior.</li>
    <li> I looooove this....will buy another!!!</li>
    <li> The best file I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Very nice, hasn&#x27;t gotten dull after many uses like cheaper ones do after one or two uses. Easy to remove nail residue from surface. JUST DON&#x27;T DROP IT!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of glass nail files for sale on Amazon, and it&#x27;s hard to choose. This one was a reasonable price, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. (It&#x27;s much better than one I bought at Sephora for several dollars more.) This file is thin enough to file corners, and I like that both sides are useable.</li>
    <li> My mother in law gave me a glass nail file in my Christmas stocking and I have not looked back! You only file in one direction and it gives you a perfect smooth finish. I was so sad when it broke in half In my purse, so I purchased this one to replace it because it comes with the plastic tube to protect it. Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my husband, now he also is a fan of Czech etched crystal glass files.</li>
    <li> I liked the smoother ones I had previously gotten better, but they were not double sided. Love the individual containers.</li>
    <li> excellent quality, well designed tool sure to last &amp; provide what is was purchased to do. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order again</li>
    <li> I love this nail file! I had never seen a crystal nail file before, but started reading about them and had to check it out. It&#x27;s a very nice quality for the price, and it&#x27;s very pretty with a nice protective case. It files the edges of nails so nicely, and also was very effective when I carefully filed the top of the nails particularly on my thumbs where I get ridges. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Just do not forget about the case, as the saw blade can break. I&#x27;m happy. Will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> Adequate for traveling and carrying in my purse.  Easy to disinfect with alcohol and doesn&#x27;t lose its effectiveness.</li>

Colors appear in person exactly as pictured (so very nice looking) and comes with protective case and tube for travel.  Does not rust like metal files and is gentler on nails than emery or metal.  Only con is that these break easily if dropped, so maybe a good idea to have an inexpensive, good quality metal file as a back up.</li>
    <li> I have several of these glass fingernail files. They all work extremely well.</li>
    <li> Great nail file had one like this before. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Amazing nail file  my nails are stronger and don&#x27;t chip anymore. Regular nail files would chip my nails. This doesn&#x27;t wear down. Just rinse it with warm water after each use to keep it Clean and so no nail dust builts up. I&#x27;m Getting the foot file as well  I&#x27;ll post me review after I use it l. But i f your looking for a amamzing nail file this is it.</li>
    <li> Happy with it. Does a much better job of filing my nails. Does not tear them, they don&#x27;t split and are never ruff feeiing when I am done filing. like these much better than the sander type, metal ones, even the stone ones. These do the best out of all I have tried over the years.</li>
    <li> I really like this nail file!  I read about these crystal glass files being much better for your nails but had never tried one.  Also, I liked that these are considered &amp;#34;green,&amp;#34; or eco-friendly.  I bought this one because it was in the mid to lower price range since I had no idea if this would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it &#x27;smooths&#x27; out the nail and any instead the typical more abrasive nail files. Also, I liked that these are considered &amp;#34;green,&amp;#34; or eco-friendly. The coordinating sheath and case that it comes with are a helpful bonus - apparently these can break if dropped on a hard surface (or stepped on?). I have not used on artificial nails but am going to try on my dog&#x27;s nails and will update with how that works.&lt;br /&gt;I already purchased one for my mom who was still using one of those horrible metal files!  I am planning to give more to friends and family as gifts!</li>
    <li> Love it for my nail and the only way to go. And it comes with a handy petty tube to put it in. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!!!!</li>
    <li> Very well wrapped and as describe.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty but I expected a larger size nail file.  These are tiny.</li>
    <li> This works great with newborns</li>
    <li> Beautiful file! It works great. Much better than the plastic ones found in stores.</li>
    <li> The item was as described and arrived promptly.  I am 100% satisfied.</li>
