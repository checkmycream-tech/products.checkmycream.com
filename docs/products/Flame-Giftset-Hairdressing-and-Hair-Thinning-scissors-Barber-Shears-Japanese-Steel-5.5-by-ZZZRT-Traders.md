<li> They just stop cutting right and got loose</li>
<li> I figured that scissors didn&#x27;t matter much because I&#x27;m only cutting a little bit of hair on a monthly basis.</li>
<li> They grab at the hair, and to get them working you might have to loosen or tighten the screw, and add a little scissor oil.</li>
<li> After I&#x27;ve tried these scissors, I realized what I had been missing out on.</li>
<li> If these ever go dull I will reorder.</li>
<li> so if your cutting alot they become uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> so i didnt want to purchase very expensive shears.</li>
<li> and then they got stolen :(</li>
