      <li>Best price I have found here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>AWESOME???</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found for hair \\&quot;control.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Very good product.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
      <li>Wife wanted it, I found it, she&#x27;s happy - happy wife happy life!  </li>
      <li>This has a great hold which lasts all day its non flaky and looks great on hair this product is legit.</li>
      <li>It gives great body when you use your curling iron and I have never found anything that works as well.....</li>
      <li>It works great to touch up day-old hair as well.</li>
      <li>So great, in fact, that people would often stop me to ask what product I used in my hair.</li>
      <li>, this is a great price too</li>
      <li>Good scent as well.</li>
      <li>Amazon order confirmation indicated Nexus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered Nexus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel....to replenish my supply.</li>
      <li>contrast, the Nexxus brand has no odor or smell, and the hold is every bit as good as the KMS product.  </li>
      <li>Since Nexxus is a good brand, I don&#x27;t foresee any problem.</li>
      <li>Nexxus, why ruin a good thing?</li>
      <li>Not any cheaper than KMS, but a superior product in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I loved it</li>
      <li>It gives great hold and volume and your hair is not stiff when it dries....if it is, just run your fingers through it and it&#x27;s perfect!  </li>
      <li>so GLAD Amazon had this!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Great gel with strong hold without feeling like a helmet head.</li>
      <li>Yes it is a nice product and i am still using it.</li>
      <li>This could very well be the best gel ever made, until now.</li>
      <li>When I found it online, I was so thrilled -</li>
      <li>and I found this gel to be the best I&#x27;ve tried, including many high end salon gels.  </li>
      <li>Best to purchase in sets like a set of two or three, if using frequently.</li>
      <li>And the old formulation was so GREAT!</li>
      <li>Definitely the best gel product I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried MANY!).</li>
      <li>Great product and fast service!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I call control without an grease ball look :-)</li>
      <li>She says it helps her style her hair much better than comparable products.</li>
      <li>I love this hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>Love it, have ordered it more than once.</li>
      <li>I love this gel.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite gel.</li>
      <li>The only place we can find it, I&#x27;m just happy I still can!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>love it, keeps my hair in place all day</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more runny.</li>
      <li>Ago the great reviews are for the old formula.</li>
      <li>This gel slicks into hair and combs through easily.</li>
      <li>Its more watery and doesn&#x27;t give you a clean finish like it used to.</li>
      <li>Strong stuff</li>
      <li>(the old smell was so nice!)</li>
      <li>This has been a great product for 18 years until they recently changed the product.</li>
      <li>It feels cheap.</li>
      <li>The product used to be great, until they changed the formula recently.</li>
      <li>If you need extra hold, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>I have been using the old product for over 20 years and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I used the OLD formula for over a year or two and LOVED it.</li>
      <li>This product is different than Nexus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel</li>
      <li>have tried many (expensive) gels, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever had (for the kind of hold I want).</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal customer for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years and have been very satisfied with the lasting hold and pleasantly mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>have loved this gel for years, I have long curly hair</li>
      <li>It is now hard to find the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; gel that I have used successfully for many years.</li>
      <li>The new formula is cheap alcohol filled jelly water.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, and most gels leave it crunchy or flakey.</li>
      <li>It is not too powerful yet it holds the hair all day.  </li>
      <li>but it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>the scent is miserably powerful.</li>
      <li>Once it dries and is combed again, it doesn&#x27;t look like anything is in your hair, but it stays right where you want it to stay.  </li>
      <li>The old formula kept the frizz away, didn&#x27;t flake, held for up to a week and was flexible enough to comb thru by adding water to the hair and left me with nice corkscrew ringlets that I loved.</li>
      <li>If someone finds a suitable alternative please let us know as lot of former Nexxus customers will be singing your praises.</li>
      <li>The new fragrance is refreshing and adds a bit of flare to this high end hair care product.</li>
      <li>I am very upset that they have changed the formula of the exxtra gel, I have used this product for many years and loved it above any other, the product worked, what have you done?</li>
      <li>Leaves hair shiny, soft, and frizz free.</li>
      <li>This product is my first choice for my hair.</li>
      <li>The old one was fragrance and alcohol free</li>
      <li>Not that it matters much at this point, but the new fragrance they added in reminds me of a cheap knock off</li>
      <li>This new version I find to be just as good as the original if not better.</li>
      <li>your are better off buying a bottle of alcohol for 0.75 cents, used to be good, this formula sucks!!!</li>
      <li>Shipping is fast.</li>
      <li>and it really does the trick</li>
      <li>In the afternoon, if I need to redefine or lift my flips, I just wet my hands, shake off the excess and run my fingers through my hair from the bottom up, scrunch the top</li>
      <li>so I called the company only to find that they confirmed a change in formulation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cheap odor, not perfume, odor is nauseating enough to send me to another company&#x27;s product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years and would recommend to anyone that needs a styling gel and wants to avoid flakes</li>
      <li>After applying the hair gel, the realization hit that not only was the color of the tube different but the hold, the scent, and everything I&#x27;d liked about the hair gel had been changed.</li>
      <li>I just tried this new formulation yesterday for the first time and am REELING.</li>
      <li>The old formula was alcohol free and had a nice subtle scent.  </li>
      <li>Been using Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years, usually buying it locally but with the great deal that Amazon had on it, I started a subscribe and save.  </li>
      <li>Unless the old formula is brought back Nexxus has lost a very loyal customer</li>
      <li>I need a new product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many gels over the last several years, from the supermarket brands to beauty salon versions.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product if you like Nexxus Gel.</li>
      <li>This gel has a manly fragrant, is highly concenstrated</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I recommended the old formula to everyone, but this one not so much.</li>
      <li>the next day, your hair has just as much volume as the first day.....</li>
      <li>Off to find a new product line.</li>
      <li>New formula.</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this NEW formula 0 stars...</li>
      <li>I have to find a new product.  </li>
      <li>New formula does not work.</li>
      <li>I have to find a new styling Gel now . . . .</li>
      <li>No excessive residue, and the hold lasts all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars! I&#x27;m African American without a relaxer and have been using this gel for yearrrrrssss! The old formula kept the frizz away, didn&#x27;t flake, held for up to a week and was flexible enough to comb thru by adding water to the hair and left me with nice corkscrew ringlets that I loved. The new formula is cheap alcohol filled jelly water. If I set my hair with the new stuff and go outside in the humidity my hair is a frizzy, shrunken bush almost instantly. The old formula was alcohol free and had a nice subtle scent.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> New formula. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> love it, keeps my hair in place all day</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for a while now, I have no complaints. No excessive residue, and the hold lasts all day. Or even the next day for those crazy times you wake up wasted in someone elses room in vegas, and have to wet ur hair and go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, slightly curly hair and I found this gel to be the best I&#x27;ve tried, including many high end salon gels.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and the hold is strong.</li>
    <li> This gel has a manly fragrant, is highly concenstrated so it last a long time and hold my hair in place without \\&quot;looking\\&quot; or feeling sticky.  It is my favorite gel.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and can&#x27;t remember a time when I didn&#x27;t use Nexxus Exxtra Gel - I would guess 25 years, if it&#x27;s been around that long. I just tried this new formulation yesterday for the first time and am REELING. Why did you change it??! I hate the smell (the old smell was so nice!) - it&#x27;s so sickly sweet - and this new formulation is like putting plain old water on your hair. After using it, my hair essentially looked exactly the same as it would have had I used nothing at all. And the old formulation was so GREAT! So great, in fact, that people would often stop me to ask what product I used in my hair. I have told hundreds, if not thousands, of people over the years about Nexxus Exxtra Gel. But not anymore. Now I will have to tell them sadly what I used to use, and that they should, under all circumstances, avoid this new formulation. Oh, and by the way, I can&#x27;t help feeling tricked since the product name on this new formulation is EXACTLY the same as it was on the old formulation. You&#x27;ve made a serious mistake here, Nexxus, and I hope you will undo it and bring the old product back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Just an FYI to would-be Nexxus consumers: I tried posting this review on Nexxus website, and they wouldn&#x27;t publish it, saying that &amp;#34;it did not meet all our website guidelines.&amp;#34; Talk about adding insult to injury!</li>
    <li> I love this hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Gives you a stiff hold after it has dried&lt;br /&gt;2. No stickiness after it has dried&lt;br /&gt;3. Just run your hand through your hair to release the hold&lt;br /&gt;4. No white flakes after hold has been released&lt;br /&gt;5. If you use the gel when your hair is wet, it will give your hair the \\&quot;Wet Look\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The items in the \\&quot;Pros\\&quot; section are definitely subjective...They could definitely be considered as \\&quot;Cons\\&quot; by some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many (expensive) gels, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever had (for the kind of hold I want).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 20+ years.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found for hair \\&quot;control.\\&quot; Once it dries and is combed again, it doesn&#x27;t look like anything is in your hair, but it stays right where you want it to stay.  That&#x27;s what I call control without an grease ball look :-)</li>
    <li> have loved this gel for years, I have long curly hair and it really does the trick, this is a great price too</li>
    <li> I ordered Nexus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel....to replenish my supply. Been using this product for years. The UPC on the package is 05592 00009&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon order confirmation indicated Nexus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the product I received was Nexxus Exxtra Gel Style Creation Sculptor, with UPC 55451 80450. This product is different than Nexus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting Gel....and even has a different ingredient statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did Amazon ship me the wrong product?&lt;br /&gt;I think Amazon should ship me the correct product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;New formula is awful! WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU CHANGE A PRODUCT THAT WORKS AWESOME??? The perfume smell gives me a headache and the alcohol dries out my hair. Off to find a new product line. You suck for changing this product Nexxus.&lt;br /&gt;If someone has found a close &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; please comment here.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Works well.  Lasts longer than other brands I have used. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The only product that works for me.  Great product and fast service!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the new formula. Please save yourself and your hair.  Ago the great reviews are for the old formula. This stuff sucks</li>
    <li> This new formula is awful.  They should be sued for keeping the same name.  It does not work and the smell is overpowering.  The occasional recent good review, in a line of 1 stars means it is a fake review, or the person has been fortunate enough to be using the old one (in the tan tube).</li>
    <li> I have been using Nexxus gel for years, and I have stuck with it through two formula changes.  However, this last formula change they did made the product go from a 4 star product to barely worth a single star.  It leaves hair feeling dry, frizzy and scortched.  I am not sure if it contains alcohol, but it dries hair up as if I were soaking it in a bottle of pure alcohol.  There is no shine or bounce to my hair anymore.  I even tried suplementing it with other products to add shine, but it&#x27;s hopeless.  Not that it matters much at this point, but the new fragrance they added in reminds me of a cheap knock off perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORST PRODUCT CHANGE EVER!</li>
    <li> This new version I find to be just as good as the original if not better. The new fragrance is refreshing and adds a bit of flare to this high end hair care product. Highly recommended. Copped a two pack for $21.00 which is a steal.</li>
    <li> Love it, have ordered it more than once. It is not too powerful yet it holds the hair all day.  Will reorder again!</li>
    <li> I might to someone you doesn&#x27;t have my type of hair. I recommended the old formula to everyone, but this one not so much. VERY Disappointed and I have searched every store around me to find the old one. I have super thick long tight curly hair. This formula still makes my hair fizzy,  and makes it feel like hay. I have been using the old formula 8 years. .. I loved it and I&#x27;ve tried every type of gel known to man..... I want my old formula back. Thought I could get it on Nexxus website site, but I now know why completely ruined it by changing the formula...</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this NEW formula 0 stars...I used the OLD formula for over a year or two and LOVED it. The new kind dries out my hair, loses it&#x27;s hold throughout the day, and smells awful! I wish there was a way to ask them to CHANGE IT BACK!!!!</li>
    <li> Have to agree. Why did they change it ? You are wearing a perfume in your hair. It&#x27;s a lot more runny. It feels cheap. I need to find another product.</li>
    <li> your are better off buying a bottle of alcohol for 0.75 cents, used to be good, this formula sucks!!!</li>
    <li> I love this gel. I have naturally curly hair, and most gels leave it crunchy or flakey. This gel slicks into hair and combs through easily. Leaves hair shiny, soft, and frizz free. It works great to touch up day-old hair as well. Definitely the best gel product I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried MANY!).</li>
    <li> My expectations were met. I was unable to get the product off the shelf after visiting many outlets. Amazon was my answer, I received it as promised at an affordable price. This product is my first choice for my hair. It does for me what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal customer for years. I recently bought the gel in the fancy new copper package (at an increased price). Pretty on the outside, worthless on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the product with the new packaging  home only to find that the consistency seemed watered down and the perfumemy smell was overbearing. Worse yet, it did not work with my hair. I thought I had gotten a defective tube so I called the company only to find that they confirmed a change in formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula is more alcohol based, leaves my hair dry and does little to hold my tight curly curls in place. Unless the old formula is brought back Nexxus has lost a very loyal customer forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly the same marketing fiasco that years back almost brought down Coca~Cola when they rolled out its horrible New Coke and thought the public wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. Well we did and we do now. You&#x27;ve taken away everything that made your product stand out above the rest. It&#x27;s not too late to apologize and bring back the original but time is fleeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve resulted to using Loreal&#x27;s Overworked Hair Putty cut down with a dab of water. It&#x27;s not exactly the same but it&#x27;s the only alternative that works for me and it&#x27;s cheaper too. If someone finds a suitable alternative please let us know as lot of former Nexxus customers will be singing your praises.</li>
    <li> the new gel is horrible!!!!  It does not do anything for my hair.  I have been using the old product for over 20 years and loved it.  Why did you change the formula???  Will definitely have to look for something else.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Terrible!  I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus Exxtra Gel for what seems like decades.  Why change it?  I have to find a new product.  I hate the smell and the hold is nowhere near as good.  Someone in product marketing messed up.</li>
    <li> Yes it is a nice product and i am still using it. Shipping is fast. Highly recommend this product if you like Nexxus Gel.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other bad reviews. The product used to be great, until they changed the formula recently. The new formula does have alcohol, completely ruins my hair texture, makes it brittle and dry. Nexxus, why ruin a good thing? Do yourself a favor folks, do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> This could very well be the best gel ever made, until now. The new formula in the bronze tube is a big failure. The reason for this is the horrible over-perfumed babyish scent. It downright reeks and the scent is miserably powerful. Somebody help! I need a new product! Nexxus let me down big time!</li>
    <li> Hello everyone&lt;br /&gt;...I hate the new formula. I just thought it was me. I hope they switch back because it no longer works for my hair. Too watery and it leaks out the side where it is suppose to be sealed.</li>
    <li> If you need extra hold, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Been using Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years, usually buying it locally but with the great deal that Amazon had on it, I started a subscribe and save.  The recent shipment, they canceled the subscribe and save, when I re-added it, the price had gone up considerably and I noticed the gel is not the same on the recent shipment.  Its more watery and doesn&#x27;t give you a clean finish like it used to. It&#x27;s even more of a wet icey look which I&#x27;m not really a fan of.  I&#x27;m going to have to try other avenues.</li>
    <li> I agree with everyone else - horrible re-formulation.  They ruined it!!!  I have been using it for YEARS and now it is CRAP.  Lots of alcohol and fragrance.  And it makes my hair STICKY and impossible to style.  I have to find a new styling Gel now . . . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years. When I found it online, I was so thrilled - it beat the Walmart price!  The product arrived on time as promised.</li>
    <li> I have short hair. This gel holds up my flippy hairstyle all day without feeling ANY yucky residue. In the afternoon, if I need to redefine or lift my flips, I just wet my hands, shake off the excess and run my fingers through my hair from the bottom up, scrunch the top and I&#x27;m good to go!  Strong stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years and have been very satisfied with the lasting hold and pleasantly mild fragrance. Recently, after using the last of the gel, I attempted to purchase another tube. I was surprised that I had difficulty finding the product and was relieved when I finally located the gel, which was in a different colored tube. The next day I began using the new tube of hair gel and immediately noticed the strong fragrance (which I thought was very unpleasant) I then noticed that the hair gel felt different to the touch. After applying the hair gel, the realization hit that not only was the color of the tube different but the hold, the scent, and everything I&#x27;d liked about the hair gel had been changed. The Nexxus company made a terrible mistake by changing the formula, it does not work!</li>
    <li> New formula does not work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and would recommend to anyone that needs a styling gel and wants to avoid flakes</li>
    <li> Now i regret not buying up all the old formula.  This new version is the worst revision.  The cheap odor, not perfume, odor is nauseating enough to send me to another company&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted it, I found it, she&#x27;s happy - happy wife happy life!  buy two and stash one away for a &#x27;gift&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This has been a great product for 18 years until they recently changed the product. The hold is the same but the new fragrance makes me sneeze all day. Not a good fragrance selection!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many gels over the last several years, from the supermarket brands to beauty salon versions.  I had settled on using KMS&#x27; gel, but they recent changed formulas, and the scent smells like chemicals (but hold was great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, the Nexxus brand has no odor or smell, and the hold is every bit as good as the KMS product.  Best price I have found here on Amazon.  Not any cheaper than KMS, but a superior product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Our daughter asked for it, so I&#x27;m assuming she likes the product. Since Nexxus is a good brand, I don&#x27;t foresee any problem.</li>
    <li> Great gel with strong hold without feeling like a helmet head. Have bought this product before and will continue using it. Best to purchase in sets like a set of two or three, if using frequently. Good scent as well.</li>
    <li> I am very upset that they have changed the formula of the exxtra gel, I have used this product for many years and loved it above any other, the product worked, what have you done?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so bad that dried up my hair :( I called nexxus company and complained about it, I also asked them if they can bring the old extra hold gel back. It&#x27;s so disappointing to replace good product with something like this.</li>
    <li> New formula is terrible!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at Walmart and suddenly they stopped selling it....I almost panicked!  I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands and they were all just horrible....I looked on Amazon and there it was!!! It&#x27;s a little more expensive on Amazon (it was $9.99 at Walmart) but it was worth it.  I love this stuff!  It gives great hold and volume and your hair is not stiff when it dries....if it is, just run your fingers through it and it&#x27;s perfect!  It gives great body when you use your curling iron and I have never found anything that works as well.....the next day, your hair has just as much volume as the first day.....so GLAD Amazon had this!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was just like the old Nexxus gel. It was awful! The scent caused me to sneeze, it made me hair oily and I returned it to the store. It is now hard to find the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; gel that I have used successfully for many years.</li>
    <li> The only place we can find it, I&#x27;m just happy I still can!</li>
    <li> Horrible new formula with alcohol! !! The old one was fragrance and alcohol free but they messed it up this one is not anymore.... such a shame! !</li>
    <li> The new formula is terrible. Cheap perfume and lasts less time than the old formula. They ruined a product I&#x27;ve used for years. Unbelievable but now starts the product trial for a new product. Update!!!!! Nexxus said too bad it&#x27;s gone and here&#x27;s a coupon. L&#x27;oreal has a new lock it extreme style that works well. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried lasts past 2 pm.</li>
    <li> My  wife loves it!!! She says it helps her style her hair much better than comparable products.</li>
    <li> This has a great hold which lasts all day its non flaky and looks great on hair this product is legit.</li>
