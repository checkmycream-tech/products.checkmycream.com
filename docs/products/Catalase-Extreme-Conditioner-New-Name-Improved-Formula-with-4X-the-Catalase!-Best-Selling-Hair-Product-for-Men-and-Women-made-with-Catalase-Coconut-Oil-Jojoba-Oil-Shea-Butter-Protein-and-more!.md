### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I decided against my own best judgement to buy it.  </li>
      <li>I think the conditioner is working good for me .My</li>
      <li>Some days it appears to me that it is working; some days it appears that it&#x27;s not and on some days it appears that my hair is getting more gray.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Especially when there are so many reviews telling you...</li>
      <li>I just dont want take many oral medication.</li>
      <li>Rinses out ok.</li>
      <li>Note that the conditioner is better than the shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make their gray hair go away.</li>
      <li>Okay product.  </li>
      <li>I ordered more once mine ran out.</li>
      <li>Sound&#x27;s to good to be true?</li>
      <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - this did not work at all and is very speculative at best as to why it might help.  </li>
      <li>But I still try who knows maybe this will help; I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>As far as conditioners go, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I thought this conditioner might since its more of a topical treatment.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will actually make gray hair problems better.</li>
      <li>This is a waste of good time.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really think that this will.</li>
      <li>And my hairs feels much healthier and shinier.</li>
      <li>THANKS  &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; &amp;#60;l&amp;#62;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; k&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;</li>
      <li>It absolutely did not change a thing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny because when you first start using it you could almost swear it is actually doing something, but if you take pictures and look closely, you will find that is</li>
      <li>Maybe it was because my normal color is blonde/light brown.  </li>
      <li>I have to applaud this company for having the first, and so far only product on the market that contains the enzyme &amp;#34;catalase.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>It made my hair silky and feel soft.  </li>
      <li>This enzyme is found naturally in almost all animals and plants.</li>
      <li>You should get a hair cut before using the first time, and keep it short until all the pre-existing gray hair (before you starting using Go Away Gray) is gone.</li>
      <li>Please note the conditioner can only stop the graying on newly grown hair--not existing hair that&#x27;s already gray.</li>
      <li>False advertisement, I should have known better anyway, to know its another one of those money making product,&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Maybe all those others just didn&#x27;t do it right, or they are not the chosen few...</li>

<li> I suspect though that the amount of time that the catalese has to work in the scalp is pretty small compared to how long hair is being produced (24x7).</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but it does seem to have reduced some of the gray.  </li>
<li> I wish I knew how long it would take for it to start working.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
<li> I stopped using it after a few washes because it didn&#x27;t clean my hair well, and they started looking dull in comparison to my other shampoo, which leaves my hair extremely shiny.</li>
<li> hair start to change after several months  by using it everyday by itself w/out&lt;br /&gt;the capsule.</li>
<li> Gray capsules missed, but when I used it too frequently (daily), it really dried my hair out.</li>
<li> Yea keep telling yourself that, if you are looking for false hope, and have money you&#x27;d like to flush down the toilet, then I highly recommend this product for you.</li>
<li> I have the two other products as well (shampoo and capsels)</li>
<li> For that reason, I think this product is probably a waste of time.</li>
<li> I was disapointed that my money was wasted.  </li>
<li> buy it waste of money ..</li>
<li> This product does seem to help but progress is slow.</li>
<li> sorry on other items, i don&#x27;t plan to write  BOOK, I RATED THE ITEMS,</li>
<li> So maybe its not a fair comparison.</li>
<li> But very slow.</li>
<li> Eventually when you do finally come to the realization that it is worthless</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the way it was presented, as well as the name go away gray I hope it will work for me. I tried a lot of different hair products nothing worked for me and I don&#x27;t really think that this will. But I still try who knows maybe this will help; I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Sound&#x27;s to good to be true? And why do you suppose that is? It&#x27;s funny because when you first start using it you could almost swear it is actually doing something, but if you take pictures and look closely, you will find that is just you deluding yourself with wishful thinking. Eventually when you do finally come to the realization that it is worthless you are too disgusted and embarrassed to want to come back and admit you were suckered by this con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when there are so many reviews telling you... Oh but there are some who claim... Maybe all those others just didn&#x27;t do it right, or they are not the chosen few... Yea keep telling yourself that, if you are looking for false hope, and have money you&#x27;d like to flush down the toilet, then I highly recommend this product for you.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. it does work and I do not like the smell. It is stick in my hair. ....................................................................................................</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will actually make gray hair problems better. I stopped using it after a few washes because it didn&#x27;t clean my hair well, and they started looking dull in comparison to my other shampoo, which leaves my hair extremely shiny. So maybe its not a fair comparison. But still- my hair just felt grungy.</li>
    <li> It helps reduce the gray along with the shampoo and pills. It&#x27;s a bit greasy though so I use it once and a while.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of good time.</li>
    <li> I have to applaud this company for having the first, and so far only product on the market that contains the enzyme &amp;#34;catalase.&amp;#34;  This enzyme is found naturally in almost all animals and plants. It reduces bleaching hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water (H2O) and oxygen (O2).  Please note the conditioner can only stop the graying on newly grown hair--not existing hair that&#x27;s already gray. You should get a hair cut before using the first time, and keep it short until all the pre-existing gray hair (before you starting using Go Away Gray) is gone.</li>
    <li> Okay product.  It made my hair silky and feel soft.  But my hair color didn&#x27;t change,</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make their gray hair go away.</li>
    <li> As far as conditioners go, it&#x27;s fine. Rinses out ok. As to it&#x27;s gray go away promise...not visible after 3 weeks&#x27; use.</li>
    <li> This product definitely helped with the resistant stragglers that the Go Away Gray capsules missed, but when I used it too frequently (daily), it really dried my hair out.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just conditioner.  Nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> This is a joke!!! False advertisement, I should have known better anyway, to know its another one of those money making product,&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it waste of money ..</li>
    <li> Not working as promissed</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but it does seem to have reduced some of the gray.  And my hairs feels much healthier and shinier. I ordered more once mine ran out.</li>
    <li> sorry on other items, i don&#x27;t plan to write  BOOK, I RATED THE ITEMS, THAT&#x27;S ENOUGH.  THANKS  &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; &amp;#60;l&amp;#62;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; k&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> This product does seem to help but progress is slow. I have noticed a difference and I believe in this product. I would purchase again. Note that the conditioner is better than the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - this did not work at all and is very speculative at best as to why it might help.  It was inexpensive so I decided against my own best judgement to buy it.  Also, adding insult to injury, I bought the shampoo and the pills to take.  zero result after taking all three products as directed until finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snake oil here folks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this has any effect on gray hair, there&#x27;s no claims whatsoever from the company that I could find, either substantiated or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catalese is supposed to help. I passed on taking capsules, as I read that catalese does not survive digestion. I thought this conditioner might since its more of a topical treatment. I suspect though that the amount of time that the catalese has to work in the scalp is pretty small compared to how long hair is being produced (24x7). For that reason, I think this product is probably a waste of time. I haven&#x27;t personally seen any change, in any case.</li>
    <li> I think the conditioner is working good for me .My hair start to change after several months  by using it everyday by itself w/out&lt;br /&gt;the capsule. But very slow. I just dont want take many oral medication.</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully as per the instructions.  It absolutely did not change a thing.  Maybe it was because my normal color is blonde/light brown.  I was disapointed that my money was wasted.  I suggest just to dye your hair.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew how long it would take for it to start working.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a couple of weeks.  Some days it appears to me that it is working; some days it appears that it&#x27;s not and on some days it appears that my hair is getting more gray.  I have taken pictures and tried to compare.  I am just going to keep waiting and hope that this product does work for me.  I have the two other products as well (shampoo and capsels)</li>
