      <li>Very satisfied with this item!</li>
      <li>I happy</li>
      <li>Quality is great.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Works great in my small space bathroom where I do not have counters... and it works great with my HSI Iron!</li>
      <li>or it has suction cups on the bottom to keep it stable on the counter top.</li>
      <li>I love this holder.</li>
      <li>but I am sure I will soon.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my girl, and to prevent her from burning herself or the counter top.</li>
      <li>I still haven&#x27;t use the top wire for straightening irons or curling irons</li>
      <li>Very useful and compact!</li>
      <li>it makes life so easy.</li>
      <li>, just be warned that the box says that you shouldn&#x27;t have your hot tools up to more than 400 degrees when using this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do:  holds your hot styling appliances while you style your hair so that they remain off of the countertop and within easy reach while styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this little handy dandy helper.</li>
      <li>It has a hanging hook on the back if I ever wanted to hang it the wall (which would be handy)</li>
      <li>But since I mainly use my flatiron, it works fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it so far with my 1\\&quot; flat iron, my 19mm curling wand, and my 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron, and it works great with all three.  </li>
      <li>Does what its supposed to, and shipping was right on time.</li>
      <li>But I originally got this for a Herstyle Extenso curling iron, and it barely holds it securely.  </li>
      <li>Holds her curling iron off the counter, and the metal loop secures the iron so that the hot surface is never in contact with either the counter of the caddy.  </li>
      <li>I dont have to fish out my burning hot irons from the sink anymore.</li>
      <li>I wish it was a bit bigger and more sturdy...</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for to organize my wife&#x27;s dressing area.  </li>
      <li>and I think that it is pretty durable.</li>
      <li>This caddy fits my 1\\&quot; wide Chi flatiron perfectly with the metal wire/bracket down.  </li>
      <li>like this so much and the price is so great that I might pick up a second one since I like to flat iron my bangs when I curl my hair.</li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant to purchase this item since there were no reviews for it, but I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
      <li>it can also easily hold my 1 inch flat iron and my curling iron!</li>
      <li>It really does stay in place, even when moving a tool in and out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does not take much space.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t really need it to though</li>
      <li>It can fit my 1 1/2 inch flat iron and by simply flipping down the latch</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for flat irons big shallow for curling irons.  </li>
      <li>it does hold the flat iron in place if its heavy none the less.. its an okay product for the price</li>

<li> yeah, it doesn&#x27;t stick to any surfaces for very long.</li>
<li> /&gt;This device has a little metal clip that you can flip over to hold curling irons or wands, and flip up to hold larger flat irons.  </li>

<li> Suction is mediocre on the glass countertop that I put it on, and always comes un-suctioned after a few days or week.</li>
<li> Now if I can only find a way to get her to turn the stupid chi off when she leaves for work.  </li>
<li> Bought this for careless wife&#x27;s purple chi.  </li>

    <li> I love this holder. it makes life so easy. I dont have to fish out my burning hot irons from the sink anymore. I love this little handy dandy helper.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this item since there were no reviews for it, but I&#x27;m glad I did!  It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do:  holds your hot styling appliances while you style your hair so that they remain off of the countertop and within easy reach while styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has suction cups on the bottom that hold it in place on the counter so it doesn&#x27;t slide around.  It really does stay in place, even when moving a tool in and out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has a little metal clip that you can flip over to hold curling irons or wands, and flip up to hold larger flat irons.

    <li> Bought this for careless wife&#x27;s purple chi.  Doesn&#x27;t move around or tip over.  Now if I can only find a way to get her to turn the stupid chi off when she leaves for work.  (why doesn&#x27;t chi make an auto off switch?!?!!?)</li>
    <li> This saves my life ! The best !</li>
    <li> I had another caddy that broke when I tried to kill a bug with it (HA). I searched and found this caddy and I think that it is pretty durable. It is not to big so it is out of the way so my boyfriend never really notice it on the counter. It holds all my flat irons. I still haven&#x27;t use the top wire for straightening irons or curling irons but I am sure I will soon.</li>
    <li> its okay,good quality i tried to stick it to my dresser but it just slides.. i have to hold it down hard for it to stay. it does hold the flat iron in place if its heavy none the less.. its an okay product for the price</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My husband hooked it to the wall since I have no room on a dresser and it works great. I use my 1 3/4 inch flat iron and the temp is 390 degrees and it warms up in it and stays in it and it doesn&#x27;t melt the caddy . It&#x27;s great. Going to buy another one for our fifth wheel so I won&#x27;t have to bring this one with me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for flat irons big shallow for curling irons.  I wish it was a bit bigger and more sturdy...but I guess it gets the job done for the amount paid for it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Keeps my iron in place so nothing gets burnt or melts on my counter. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for to organize my wife&#x27;s dressing area.  Holds her curling iron off the counter, and the metal loop secures the iron so that the hot surface is never in contact with either the counter of the caddy.  Quality is great.</li>
    <li> Makes and excellent holder but yeah, it doesn&#x27;t stick to any surfaces for very long. You don&#x27;t really need it to though, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause us any issues!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get a product like this, since I use my flat irons all the time. It doesn&#x27;t get heated when I let my irons rest, it has plenty of vents to prevent my irons from melting the plastic. I would recommend this to anyone who uses their ironing tools on a regular basic.</li>
    <li> I hold the large and small irons I have with no problem.  I happy I got it so as not to lay my irons down.</li>
    <li> We have a Chi hair straightener and for some reason it doesn&#x27;t have a stand on the unit that will keep it from burning a counter.  This product solves this problem.  The straightener goes up to 400* and works with the Caddy (even though the temp is rated to 350*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the suction cups don&#x27;t stay put over time.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my girl, and to prevent her from burning herself or the counter top. Does what its supposed to, and shipping was right on time.</li>
    <li> Very stylish and well made! It can fit my 1 1/2 inch flat iron and by simply flipping down the latch it can also easily hold my 1 inch flat iron and my curling iron! It has a hanging hook on the back if I ever wanted to hang it the wall (which would be handy) or it has suction cups on the bottom to keep it stable on the counter top. Very satisfied with this item!</li>
    <li> This caddy fits my 1\\&quot; wide Chi flatiron perfectly with the metal wire/bracket down.  Fits a 2\\&quot; Conair curling iron as well. But I originally got this for a Herstyle Extenso curling iron, and it barely holds it securely.  If the Extenso isn&#x27;t pushed to the very back of the caddy, it will fall out.  But since I mainly use my flatiron, it works fine. Suction is mediocre on the glass countertop that I put it on, and always comes un-suctioned after a few days or week. I recommend cleaning the suctions and adding couple drops of water to help it stay on longer.</li>
    <li> Very useful and compact! Does not take much space. Now only if my iron didn&#x27;t stop working a day before it arrived!</li>
    <li> Works great in my small space bathroom where I do not have counters... and it works great with my HSI Iron!</li>
