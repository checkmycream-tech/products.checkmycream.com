      <li>I ordered one for myself, but I should get one more for my sister too!!</li>
      <li>It works very nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;may be good for crocheting stuff that is not your hair</li>
      <li>this works good for putting a lot of beads on each braid at one time.</li>
      <li>If using it for beads, seems to do the job fairly well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is great, however I&#x27;m looking for a metal one.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>Great and easy to use</li>
      <li>The product would be great if your hair can fit through the plastic one without breaking it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of brittle in the thicker handle section.</li>
      <li>Comes in handy</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Wish they were more sturdy...but does the job</li>
      <li>Much better than a latchook.</li>
      <li>I know, most are used to using this for beading, but it comes in handy for doing crochet braids, its just easier to use and it does not get snarled in hair, since it is plastic and has a full loop at the end.</li>
      <li>We have to say that this is an awesome buy for the money we spent including and shipping and handling fees.</li>

      <li>Quick delivery!!!!!!!!!!XD</li>
      <li>I already broke it, but luckily it was in a spot that allows me to keep using it.</li>
      <li>It broke the first time I tried to use it!</li>
      <li>easy, useful, fast.</li>
      <li>Have several available for slumber party fun :)  </li>
      <li>great for fine thin hair though</li>
      <li>It broke first time I used it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very flimsy !</li>
      <li>First of all, I received 2 of these about 10 days after I ordered them.  </li>
      <li>It broke as soon as I used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>This really helped me out a lot when doing my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Saves me soooo much time putting beads on my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>When you see items like this selling for so much cheaper than the stores, you question.</li>
      <li>#34;I got more than what I expected.</li>
      <li>It made putting the beads on so much easier.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but from some simple playign around with it, looks simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Good but not durable especially with thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I can happily go down to the corner hair store and buy those cheap plastic ones for $.99 each.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping- got here 4 days before expected.</li>
      <li>It literally broke in half, where the eye meets the wand, the FIRST TIME i used it.</li>
      <li>so it broke within the first few times of using it.</li>

<li> so it broke within the first few times of using it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ok but is very thin.</li>
<li> and my daughters hair is pretty thick</li>
<li> I use it to bead my daughters hair and since she has really long hair</li>
<li> Much bigger than expected</li>
<li> this did not work for crocheting hair - too wobbly and long.  </li>
<li> I should have purchased this beader long ago, instead of the crochet need for doing hair.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t break but feels loose.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very flexible.</li>
<li> Stupidest thing I&#x27;ve ever spent money.</li>
<li> i guess i cant be too mad because it was cheap</li>
<li> It can also be used to add beads to crochet or other art creations.  </li>
<li> I have used this beader several times on my daughters&#x27; hair but it is not easy to use unless it grab very little hair at a time.</li>
<li> This was a cheap piece of crap, $4 horribly spent.</li>
<li> Half way through this thing broke.</li>
<li> A little flimsy.</li>
<li> i used it for tree braids and it worked but was a little flimsy.</li>
<li> Either way, this is a SHADY seller</li>
<li> However, some say you get what you pay for but others like myself I can usually say &amp;</li>
<li> The loop was a thin piece of plastic that broke when I looped the hair through..</li>
<li> I gave it 1 star because the seller is shady between the postage hike and cutting off the tops of the packaging!</li>
<li> but i was still mad that it broke</li>
<li> Horrible product.</li>

    <li> Stupidest thing I&#x27;ve ever spent money. It literally broke in half, where the eye meets the wand, the FIRST TIME i used it. The delivery was fast, no problems there but the wand itself is very cheaply made. Its back to twisting and wetting the hair before beading i guess.</li>
    <li> I have used this beader several times on my daughters&#x27; hair but it is not easy to use unless it grab very little hair at a time.</li>
    <li> Good but not durable especially with thick hair.  Bends easily</li>
    <li> I love this product. I do crochet braiding It very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I used this for my crochet braids and I must say it was a wonderful tool. Much better than a latchook. If you are looking for something to install crochet braids then USE THIS!</li>
    <li> Half way through this thing broke. Not work my money.</li>
    <li> Thanks it is great no question about it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping- got here 4 days before expected. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but from some simple playign around with it, looks simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!!!!!!!!!!XD I ordered one for myself, but I should get one more for my sister too!! I love it! &amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> This beader was way bigger than I thought it would be but it gets the job done so I wont complain.</li>
    <li> it broke while using it and it kept tangling in my hair and making it frizzy.  i guess i cant be too mad because it was cheap but i was still mad that it broke</li>
    <li> It probably would have worked great for beads but I purchased it for crochet braids. It was too big for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Comes in handy but it&#x27;s very flimsy !</li>
    <li> This is a great and fun to use product. Makes threading beads onto hair very easy.  Great fun for Tweens. Have several available for slumber party fun :)  I can&#x27;t wait to use this on my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using this</li>
    <li> We have to say that this is an awesome buy for the money we spent including and shipping and handling fees. When you see items like this selling for so much cheaper than the stores, you question. However, some say you get what you pay for but others like myself I can usually say &amp;#34;I got more than what I expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but is very thin. i used it for tree braids and it worked but was a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> I am a lover of braids, must be my Indian blood.  This is an amazingly simple device that works like a charm.  It can also be used to add beads to crochet or other art creations.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this did not work for crocheting hair - too wobbly and long.  Bummer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;may be good for crocheting stuff that is not your hair</li>
    <li> I love it. This really helped me out a lot when doing my daughter&#x27;s hair. It made putting the beads on so much easier.</li>
    <li> Kind of flimsy but most of them are. It works well though. I use it to bead my daughters hair and since she has really long hair this works good for putting a lot of beads on each braid at one time.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. It broke the first time I tried to use it!</li>

I know, most are used to using this for beading, but it comes in handy for doing crochet braids, its just easier to use and it does not get snarled in hair, since it is plastic and has a full loop at the end.</li>
    <li> It broke as soon as I used it for the first time. I suggest going to a beauty store to get a metal one instead.</li>
    <li> Expensive but does the job, wish they made it more sturdy</li>
    <li> This thing does the trick. It&#x27;s not very flexible. I already broke it, but luckily it was in a spot that allows me to keep using it. It&#x27;s kind of brittle in the thicker handle section. The loop section seems like it will last me though. If I get another one I will likely go for a metal one.</li>
    <li> very cheap and flimsy. and my daughters hair is pretty thick so it broke within the first few times of using it. great for fine thin hair though</li>
    <li> It broke first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters, because they love beads in their hair. It works very nicely. You can fit a lot of beads on it at once.</li>
    <li> This was a cheap piece of crap, $4 horribly spent. The loop was a thin piece of plastic that broke when I looped the hair through.. Won&#x27;t order from this seller again</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break but feels loose.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy. Not durable enough for longevity if you&#x27;re apply hair. If using it for beads, seems to do the job fairly well.</li>
    <li> Love this tool. Saves me soooo much time putting beads on my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Wish they were more sturdy...but does the job</li>
    <li> Much bigger than expected</li>
    <li> easy, useful, fast. great as a first time bead user.</li>
    <li> I did not know these were made of plastic, ahead of time, therefore have requested to return these, for a full refund.  First of all, I received 2 of these about 10 days after I ordered them.  They came in a regular envelope with a postage listed of $.46, however the seller charged me $4.97 for shipping...and it took 10 days to get to me!  Secondly, the 2 came with the tops of the packaging cut off....literally...both packages were opened and had their tops cut off, as to hide the brand or price, maybe.  Either way, this is a SHADY seller and I want a full refund!  I can happily go down to the corner hair store and buy those cheap plastic ones for $.99 each. I want a metal one, which will actually last longer. The product would be great if your hair can fit through the plastic one without breaking it.  I&#x27;m sure this product is great, however I&#x27;m looking for a metal one.  I gave it 1 star because the seller is shady between the postage hike and cutting off the tops of the packaging!</li>
