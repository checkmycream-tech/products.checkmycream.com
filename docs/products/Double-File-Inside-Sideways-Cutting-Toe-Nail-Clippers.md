    <li> These are sharp and clip nicely.  They are just too small.  The ad for them doesn&#x27;t adequately show their small size.  For clipping the big toe - forget it.  OK, for the little toe.  That&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I bought a pair of slant edge clippers at a drug store a few years ago and loved them. My husband wanted a pair and I never could find them again. Finally found them through Amazon and bought several. These are great for those hard to get hang nails and torn cuticles.</li>
    <li> I searched several stores including Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply but I could not find a slant tip clipper to replace the one that was confiscated by airport security. (The world is safer now, right?) I was glad to find these on Amazon and ordered two. They are excellent quality.</li>
    <li> They work great! A little thicker than the one a bought several years ago. I use them for my manicure and for my husbands pedicure. Great to trim dead skin and cuticles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this clipper for &amp;#34;hang-nails&amp;#34;. Clips close without cutting you! Hard to find in stores so when I needed a new one found it here.</li>
    <li> My toe nails are so thick, I thought my nails where going to break the clipper. would buy again if i had to.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be longer and stronger...worse buy ever!I wish I would of never bought this, but since this came from over&lt;br /&gt;seas Im stuck....</li>
    <li> This this is cheap in every sense.  It was dull and the little screw was loose making it hard to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these they are very durable and long lasting also have a long lasting metal nail file on the inside you must take off the blue sticker tape</li>
    <li> The slant edge is perfect for trimming tiny baby finger nails as well as adults and anyone in between. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I order six of them at once as no place else had them and I had been looking for them a long time. I use them to trim the skin on the side of my nails.</li>
    <li> Horrible clippers. Not sharp and fat blades.</li>
    <li> nice, sharp, good grip but did break after just a few uses.  I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;i took part off an old clipper to continue to use</li>
    <li> As a clipper it is okay although you can probably find something cheaper.  It is angled.  The file is absolutely useless, so if you need a file get something else.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding these in the store around here so when I saw it on Amazon I had to get it.  These are perfect for hang nails and cuticles.  This particular clipper is not quite as sharp as I would like but it works well.</li>
    <li> These are surprisingly long and sharp and work great on my toes and fingers.  Very happy with this product and for such a great price!</li>

    <li> I like these particular type of clippers....They are incredibly hard to find so when I ordered I ordered double because I tend to misplace them.</li>
    <li> Got these for my fingernails and love it.  I like square nails and this works like a charm.  I&#x27;ve used it on my toes but it seems a wee bit tiny for my big toes.  Very strong and love the fact it is straight and not curved.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I expected and am very satisfied with the shipping speed.</li>
    <li> OkOk really like this hate that there is a requirement for words. I have 8 more to go. Don&#x27;t like being required to writ lot</li>
    <li> I have one similar product and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. Now I see this here and got 2. Turned out quality is very poor. Yes it&#x27;s sharp but the lever is so weak and yielding, it bends when you press hard to cut cuticles, what more if nails? If they used better quality steel, it would have worked great.</li>
