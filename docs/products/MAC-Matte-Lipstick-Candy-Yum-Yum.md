<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My all time favorite color.  I get compliments all the time from both men and women.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lipstick. This was my first matte lipstick and it could not be more perfect! Color is VERY pink, I love it. Stays on for a while but will need to be reapplied throughout the day, especially after eating or drinking, This color is very pink, you have been warned!</li>
    <li> After searching for this shade in several MAC stores, and always being told it was sold out, I turned to Amazon, and there it was!  Beautiful intense color, nice matte finish, wonderful vanilla cookie fragrance.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is that it tends to dry my lips out, especially if I wear it for two or more days in a row.  This is a really intense pink--not for the faint of heart-- but LOTS of fun to wear!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the lipstick, it&#x27;s just what I wanted and the little note from the seller was a nice personal touch!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments with this lipstick! I use the Warm #4 Loreal foundation to give you and idea. More a summer color but i wear whenever it fits my look.</li>
    <li> Fake product. Isn&#x27;t even the same packaging as Mac Cosmetics. Very slimy when applied, nothing like the original Mac lipstick.</li>
    <li> Best lipstick ! Wear it al the time</li>
    <li> absolutely love this lipstick came when it was supposed to real Mac and fits me perfectly will be ordering more</li>
    <li> original lipstick the color is awesome, it is matte and it last the whole day</li>
    <li> I have not worn it yet.  I feel that it is a summer color lipstick.  Can&#x27;t wait.  Thanks and i will enjoy wearing it.</li>
    <li> Love candy yum yum it&#x27;s the perfect pink</li>
    <li> Truly an awesome color, stands out. Not subtle at all, but I can&#x27;t wait to wear on a night out!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice color. I really love it, but I just gave 4 coz it&#x27;s not good on my lips. After I put this, my lips  always cracked.. I need to work more on my lips because it matte lipstick maybe that&#x27;s why. But it&#x27;s really good and the color I love it!</li>
    <li> Product shipped on time &amp; looks great whether you apply lightly or heavy! Also great and affordable prices! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this shade! It lasts a long time too. Love the color! MAC is a great product!</li>
    <li> This is my fav lipstick, its matte so it may dry your lips a bit. The color is very beautiful</li>
    <li> the expiration date on this lipstic seems to have expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I am unhappy. why do I think so?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it smells bad. the good smell has disappeared.</li>
    <li> Great pink neon color. IT is a cult favorite so I had to have it because its not sold in my international MAC store. I have only used it a few times because it requires lips to be well conditioned so it doesn&#x27;t dry cracked.</li>
    <li> Mac is one of the best long lasting lipsticks that I have found.i saw this new shade and didn&#x27;t know if I would like it when I first saw it but after I applied it I loved it .Now irksome of my new favorite colors!!!</li>
    <li> This lipstick was all that I expected in color. I gave it a four because it goes on a little dry. I find by putting some kind of lip moisture on before putting this lipstick on helps with the dryness.</li>
    <li> it is so nice and fits very good on the lips... perhaps a little gloss if you dont like the dry sensation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only myself to blame -- I bought the lipstick after asking an Ultima associate about it and, of course, hearing about it on Wendy Williams. It looked clownish on me. Perhaps I could mix it with some other color to make it work, but that&#x27;s just too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: very, very light, bright pink.</li>
    <li> Great color, on time delivery and I am in love with this color!!! Get it!</li>
    <li> It was not for me. But for my cousin&#x27;s 20-year-old daughter. She chose it and loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick! I always get a lot of compliments when I wear it. I like to wear it when I&#x27;m working out because you can look good when lifting weights and it makes me feel girly.</li>
    <li> First off....I LOVE THE COLOR!  It was just what I was looking for.  However, it has no luster or shine.  It is flat and my lips don&#x27;t look good at all.  I was very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve seen this hue in so many magazines and on TV, I could hardly wait to get it.  Now, I&#x27;m trying to find the same color, but something with a shine to it.  Recommendations are welcomed!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lipstick 💋 Also it smells great 😁</li>
    <li> Got to me fast (2-3days) &amp; the color us great u cab tell its real</li>
    <li> Fabulous in love with this color</li>
    <li> Not original mac lipstick do not buy its a waste of money</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick! Great buy.</li>
    <li> love the color just seemed a little dryed out</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color ! It&#x27;s not all dry on my lips, love how matte it is. The color matches the pic, its bright and gorgeous. Fits me and im a tad dark. Oh &amp; it arrived on time !! Great deal . Can&#x27;t wait to wear it at school</li>
    <li> I honestly wanted to like this lipstick, I really did.    Everyone (Bloggers and Youtubers) talks about it, and it looks cute online and in pictures. However, in person... it&#x27;s definitely another story. I feel that this lipstick is for professional use, ex: photography, runway, modeling, TV anchors, youtubers! etc.    I don&#x27;t know anyone who would actually wear this for something basic like going to work, school or a date (unless your job is modelling) It is way too bold for any basic activity (in my opinion).    The color is a very bold hot pink that has a tiny tiny hint of like purple. It is a matte lipstick.    This is really great quality though, and it WILL last ALL day long. This can also work for you if you are looking for something bold for a special event. I am only reviewing the color NOT the seller.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. I love it on me !!</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected, the same lipstick you walk up the the MAC counter and purchase only at a cheaper price! Loved it !</li>
    <li> I GOT A FAKE CANDY YUM YUM LIPSTICK FROM THESE GUYS!&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES NOT SMELL LIKE VANILLA (LIKE ALL OTHER MAC LIP STICKS)&lt;br /&gt;the formula is all wromng)&lt;br /&gt;and even the color is off compared to one in store.&lt;br /&gt;I wnat my money back</li>
    <li> LOVED the color of this lipstick! Wonderful texture too! Had to find&lt;br /&gt;out what all the fuss was about ?! lol Very nice color. It took a while to&lt;br /&gt;receive it ... but the company sending it, after finding out I hadn&#x27;t received&lt;br /&gt;it, shipped it immediately. Thanks for the follow up. Will order this color again!</li>
    <li> I love the texture and the color brightens up my entire face. I found it strange how it smelled like vanilla cake, not that its a bad thing (not in the least), just a little funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips smell like cake and they look like barbie. This is excellent.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what i want, nice color, i like it very much, same color with the tv show i watched</li>
    <li> Re-ordered this product a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Loooove this lipstick and shipping was really quick</li>
    <li> THIS PERSON GAVE ME THE WRONG SHIPPING  UPS NUMBER ?????</li>
    <li> It is a veautiful color, I love to mix it with other pinks and peaches, and I think its gorgeous with all skin tones. Packaging was lovely. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I love it fastest shipping ever I recommend  to EVERYONE!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick the color is bright and I love that it&#x27;s not glossy...the only bad thing is that the flakes on my lips show because its matte.</li>
    <li> I love this color it looks so cute. I know is a little expensive, but it will stay on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I loooovvvveeeee this mac lipstick,I get a lot of comments on this color, and plus it looks fabulous on me...I will soo order this again ,I love how it feels on my lips...love ittttt...lol</li>
    <li> WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER ITEM IS LACED WITH SOMETHING SMELLS LIKE CAR OIL AND IT IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT BY MAC.. U CAN TELL WHEN U HAVE THE REAL MAC CANDY YUM YUM IT SMELLS LIKE COTTON CANDY AND IT IS NEON PINK VERY BRIGHT AND MATTE FINISH.. THE PRODUCT I RECEIVE SMELLED LIKE CAR OIL AND IT WAS GLOSSY AND VERY OILY NOT SURE WHAT THEY DID TO THIS PRODUCT THREW IT AWAY</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas. She is quite thrilled with it. The colour is beautiful!</li>
    <li> ^___^ love it ! will only wear mac now !</li>
    <li> mine was melted at tip</li>
    <li> Please do not buy ladies. You can get the real thing from Mac for 16 dollars and shipping is always free. You have been warned ladies</li>
    <li> Love, love love this lipstick. Is the exact color you see, looks great and doesnt look dry on your lips.</li>
    <li> The color is nice and bright. I personally love MAC products but I must admit I was left a little disappointed with this lipstick. It will accentuate any dry areas on your lips so you need to make sure you exfoliate your lips before applying otherwise your lips will not look very appealing. Otherwise like I said the color is awesome and very eye catching.</li>
    <li> I love all mac products but this lipstick looks so good on.  I cant wait for the new spring colors.</li>
    <li> Thankfully, MAC has made this permanent.  I LOVE this color...it is easily the one that stands out the most in the lipstick area in MAC.  It&#x27;s the crazy neon pink color that would probably make you think, \\&quot;this would look ridiculous on me!\\&quot; I am a NW15 (very pale with pink skin) and thought this would look awful...tried it on and fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually pulled it off quite well, and if you go to my profile - I&#x27;m wearing this lipstick.  It&#x27;s a hot pink for sure, but I think it brightens up my face and gives me a genuine barbie doll look.  It&#x27;s a bit intimidating, but didn&#x27;t look clownish on me at all.  I wear it a lot, but if you want to go a bit tamer try Pink Nouveau.  It&#x27;s often touted as the \\&quot;Barbie pink,\\&quot; and it satin and a bit less bright than Yum-Yum, yet still gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember...this is matte AND bright, so it can DRYYYY out your lips so bad and look veryyyyy obvious.  So keep your lips moisturized if you really like this lipstick, otherwise it will end up cracking after an hour and look awful.  I use MAC&#x27;s Lip Prep and Prime, which is awesome and has stopped this problem altogether.</li>
    <li> I Really Love This Lipstick, Its Really A Great Pink Lipstick! It Makes Your Lips Appear Fuller And It Stays Moisturize Until You Get Ready To Take It Off For The Day.</li>
    <li> I love this bright vibrant lipstick. It applies well and stay on long even when you eat. This is fabulous.</li>
    <li> REALLY PRETTY AND NEON AND BRIGHT</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to be a PRO member to purchase this color from MAC. They now offer it on their website and I think in stores also.</li>
    <li> Stay on for a long time</li>
    <li> Lovely but you must use a light touch and blot!</li>
    <li> The color is gorgeous, but it really drys out the lips and sticks to any dead skin. You should absolutely exfoliate before using and consider having some sort of lip balm underneath.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a real MAC product not an imposter like others on here! Love the color!  got to me very quickly. :)</li>
    <li> WOW. Beautiful color!!! Of course, MAC can be relied upon for great quality lipsticks. This one is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> MAC is my favorite lipstick. This color is exactly as u see it very bright and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Love this color and lasts a long time. Great product</li>
    <li> tr&amp;eacute;s belle couleur rose ce  rouge a l&amp;egrave;vre couvre parfaitement bien les l&amp;egrave;vre  tien assez bien je le recommande et envoi rapide</li>
    <li> I loved it very mach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good color and the touch very cool&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Worth every dollar paid&lt;br /&gt;That color is not available in my country</li>
    <li> Love this color!!! MAC lipsticks are the best, by far!  This color is so bright and amazing!</li>
    <li> Great color for you brave spring chickens out there. Very young and vibrant just like I wanted. You won&#x27;t regret this color. A must have!</li>
    <li> This is not Mac lipstick this is a cheap version. This broke the first day. I will not order this again. This is not worth ur money.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLOR AND FEEL</li>
    <li> Mac is the best i will recommend this 4 anybody but u must have smooth lips for it to look fawless or put a tip of greese first b4 applying it dem your gud to go</li>
    <li> Finally got this item</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick 3/23/15 and it drys your lips and doesn&#x27;t stay for a long time. I would have loved to spend my money on something else that could actually help me.</li>
    <li> Must try at least once. This color is great on olive skin tones. I love how much compliments I received using this product. You put this on and mascara and that is all. You are done with trying to hard to get stared at. You get it instantly and not to flashy for work.</li>
