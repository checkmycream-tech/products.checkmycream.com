<li> This &amp;#34;body splash&amp;#34; is very long lasting, if you like smelling like chemicals all day.</li>
<li> I spray this on my hair when its dry.</li>
<li> The 2 bottles I ordered came as promised, but both caps were cracked and both leaked partially.</li>
<li> For me, it is a strong, unpleasant odor that smells nothing like Freesias.</li>
<li> I read that people had complained on the BBW site that the fragrance mist didn&#x27;t last as long as the body splash...</li>
<li> I spray a little on the air conditioning filter and that allows the scent throughout my house.</li>
<li> I was sad to find out that it was discontinued at BBW</li>
<li> And the packaging was flawed, since the product leaked into the packaging and lost a substantial amount.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant fragrance, it is just not for me, I had to give it away.</li>

    <li> I love freesia, I&#x27;ve had freesia body mists before, but this one gave allergies.  It&#x27;s not an unpleasant fragrance, it is just not for me, I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I learned of this fresh and clean scent from a union attorney at work who leaves a  clean, soft, pleasant scent whenever she comes to our office.  When I complimented her she was nice enough to tell me about Bath &amp; Body Works Freesia.  I ordered it and it was shipped in a week.  I love it!  I must say that S&amp;H was actually more expensive than the product itself.  And the packaging was flawed, since the product leaked into the packaging and lost a substantial amount.  Hey Bath &amp; Body you owe me.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what we were looking for, and was recieved even quicker than I expected</li>
    <li> I have been using this body splash for many years. Thank you for keeping the fragrance the same and for making it available for purchase.</li>
    <li> This has been a signature scent for me since Bath and Body carried it.  It&#x27;s light, fresh and soft.  My children wouldn&#x27;t know it was me if I wasn&#x27;t wearing it</li>
    <li> Love ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Not sold in stores anymore.Great buy. This spray is one of my favorites and is a  classic. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. The 2 bottles I ordered came as promised, but both caps were cracked and both leaked partially. Other than that, I was very pleased with the product and service. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am some one who is very sensitive to smell and Freesia is the only Body Splash I can use that does not irritate my skin or sense of smell.  Why Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued this fragrance is beyond me.  The Best!</li>
    <li> While I love this light fragrance, it just doesn&#x27;t last, but fades within minutes.  Wish I could find Freesia in more of a perfume type.</li>
    <li> I love this body spray! It smell really nice! I&#x27;ll be ordering one really soon for my daughter. She also love the scent!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I found the sheer freesia on amazon! It was discontinued on the bath and body site.besides the fact that it smells incredible.. I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> You might say, &amp;#34;WHAT?!&amp;#34;. I spray this on my hair when its dry. My husband loves it! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> the only comments I get are good ones...What&#x27;s that smell? You smell good, what IS that? Smells flowery but not too perfumey or overpowering.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll smell pretty, oh so pretty!  And you can spray this on your linens and when I&#x27;m trying to make my house smell fresh  I spray a little on the air conditioning filter and that allows the scent throughout my house. Love it. Get a lot of compliments when it&#x27;s worn as a perfume and I get a lot of compliments on the smell of my house. It&#x27;s a win-win. Has a light linen and blossom smell.  NOT A FRUITY SCENT!  Wonderful. Not overpowering just very light and clean.</li>
    <li> After 20 years, this is still my favorite scent.  I read that people had complained on the BBW site that the fragrance mist didn&#x27;t last as long as the body splash...I actually have some left of the body splash of this scent and it seems overall the same to me...i get about a good 5 hours when I spritz 5 sprays on my undershirt...and the scent still lingers after that but subtle.  I&#x27;d still recommend it</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best fragrances that Bath &amp; Body Works has to offer. If you love the smell of freesias as much as I do, this is the perfect fragrance for you!!</li>
    <li> Light refreshing fragrance.</li>
    <li> excellent product,fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this fragrance the first time I smelled it about 5 years ago. I was sad to find out that it was discontinued at BBW but I was extremely pleased to find it here on Amazon!!! They never seem to let me down when it comes to finding all my old favorites</li>
    <li> I love this scent so much. It&#x27;s subtle, unique, kind of floral, and very fresh. Even when I&#x27;m not going anywhere I put it on after a shower to feel amazingly refreshed. My college roomate would come into my room and spritz it on before seeing her boyfriend; She even tried to buy it off of me a couple of times. I can never seem to get this at the actual Bath &amp; Body Works store even though I think it&#x27;s their best creation ever. I hope they NEVER discontinue it. Shipping was speedy &amp; great as well.</li>
    <li> This sent had always been one of my favorite,  I love light soft scents.</li>
    <li> I kind of wish I&#x27;d purchased the lotion instead.  Happy to have somewhere to buy this scent though.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;body splash&amp;#34; is very long lasting, if you like smelling like chemicals all day. For me, it is a strong, unpleasant odor that smells nothing like Freesias. I contacted the seller, but never heard back. Throwing it out since I would never even give it away.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts forever, and is easy to throw in a bag and take anywhere. I wish I&#x27;d bought more.</li>
