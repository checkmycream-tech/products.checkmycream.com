      <li>Very nice smell.</li>
      <li>Very nice and pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>It may be best to buy more than one type of twin pack</li>
      <li>I used it and loved the smell.</li>
      <li>I specifically do not get anti-antiperspirants because the aluminum isn&#x27;t good for your body.  </li>
      <li>Product smells good.  </li>
      <li>So I ordered twin pack for myself and I love it!</li>

      <li>Best smelling of the entire lineup - trust me.  </li>
      <li>I used to use my boyfriend&#x27;s deodorant when I needed too and enjoyed this scent the most.</li>
      <li>It is great to be able to get daily use products through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Dissipates quickly though, which leads to using more volume.</li>
      <li>as it&#x27;s available</li>
      <li>The fragrance is smooth light smell.</li>
      <li>Great deal-smells terrific, but I can&#x27;t use it because it burns my armpits.</li>

      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>What exactly is value sized?  </li>
      <li>But the scent is pretty good and not too unique for too many people to hate it.</li>
      <li>It arrived promptly and was very well packaged.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast</li>
      <li>The description was very misleading and quite frankly</li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t use the product, it really doesn&#x27;t matter if I like the scent.</li>
      <li>However, I would advise purchasing a twin-pack of the same fragrances unless you&#x27;re familiar with the scent.</li>
      <li>I regularly use it specially in summer time.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is decent.  </li>
      <li>In general I like Axe products, just be aware when ordering this that it is 2-4oz cans, not 2-8oz cans.  </li>
      <li>I found very little Exiciting about the Excite fragrance, it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
      <li>On January 12, 2008 12 year old Daniel Hurley from Derbyshire, England died in a hospital five days after collapsing at his home.</li>
      <li>Videos on social networking sites depicted teens lighting themselves on fire.</li>

    <li> She loves this so need i say more.  This is what i like about ordering online.</li>
    <li> The description says Twin Pack (meaning 2), 8 ounce.  Well, I did receive 2 of the sprays, but they were each 4oz, for a total of 8oz.  The description was very misleading and quite frankly I found very little Exiciting about the Excite fragrance, it&#x27;s just ok.  In general I like Axe products, just be aware when ordering this that it is 2-4oz cans, not 2-8oz cans.  Also, it says \\&quot;Value Size Pack\\&quot;.  What exactly is value sized?  4 oz is the same size sold in the stores.  There is no value here.</li>
    <li> Best smelling of the entire lineup - trust me.  Get compliments often</li>
    <li> On time...love the fragrance</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great twin-pack which lasts about two (2) months. The fragrance is smooth light smell. However, I would advise purchasing a twin-pack of the same fragrances unless you&#x27;re familiar with the scent. Like myself, I tend to use different fragrances on different days. It may be best to buy more than one type of twin pack fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- MMS</li>
    <li> Wonderful great product</li>
    <li> Nice deal. Very nice smell. It arrived promptly and was very well packaged.</li>
    <li> On January 12, 2008 12 year old Daniel Hurley from Derbyshire, England died in a hospital five days after collapsing at his home. The medical coroner ruled that he had suffered from cardiac arrhythmia and died from heart failure as a result of spraying large amounts of Lynx in a confined space.[37][38] Videos on social networking sites depicted teens lighting themselves on fire. The trend resulted in multiple injuries.[39] In response to the possible safety concerns,[citation needed] the company created two ads, one against the use of Axe as an inhalant, and the other warning of its flammability.[40]</li>
    <li> Product smells good.  It is great to be able to get daily use products through Amazon.  This twin pack is about the same or better priced than what you would find at a store.  So convenient!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. I had stopped using deo longtime ago. I was using regular stick gel ones but recently we had a college reunion and one of my friends persuaded me to use this one. I used it and loved the smell. So I ordered twin pack for myself and I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the scent as I do as well!! Will continue to buy it as&lt;br /&gt;Long as it&#x27;s available</li>
    <li> this is a great deal.It has a very nice smell to it and last for hours.Will defiently buy again.Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Great deal-smells terrific, but I can&#x27;t use it because it burns my armpits. Otherwise it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is decent.  Dissipates quickly though, which leads to using more volume.</li>
    <li> Although I like the scent, I&#x27;m done buying Axe products. The plastic &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; on the top of the can frequently breaks, making it virtually impossible to spray. Five of the last six cans I bought did this. If I can&#x27;t use the product, it really doesn&#x27;t matter if I like the scent.</li>
    <li> This is usually the best deal for axe so I was not sure about it. But the scent is pretty good and not too unique for too many people to hate it. I&#x27;d say give it a shot if your on the fence.</li>
    <li> Very nice and pleasant aroma. Very strong presence so use sparingly.</li>
    <li> for my boyfriend he luvs it,,great price for two compared to store prices!!!</li>
    <li> Nice smell with price combination</li>
    <li> smells like raid, but it did attract bugs,</li>
    <li> Husband loved the scent of this and also got it at a great price here on amazon!</li>
    <li> I got the great deal on this. I regularly use it specially in summer time. Worth buying from Amazon. Go for it.</li>
    <li> This is a spray on deodorant.  It is a deodorant only and NOT deodorant with anti-perspiration.  I specifically do not get anti-antiperspirants because the aluminum isn&#x27;t good for your body.  It may help you sweat less in the meanwhile but is destructive to your body in the long run by not allowing your body to flush out toxins (possibly causing Alzheimer&#x27;s, etc.).  I am a woman and I think this works well for male or females alike.  I used to use my boyfriend&#x27;s deodorant when I needed too and enjoyed this scent the most.</li>
    <li> I didn’t like the smell of these deodorants. It smells like coconut oil on your body. I wish I can change it.</li>
    <li> My hubby smells sooo good!</li>
    <li> Axe Body Spray Twin Pack, Excite. nice sent</li>
