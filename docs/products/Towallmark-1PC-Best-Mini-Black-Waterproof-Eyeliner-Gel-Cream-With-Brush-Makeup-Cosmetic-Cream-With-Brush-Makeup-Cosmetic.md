      <li>Very good  </li>
      <li>Good day!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but it should be good .</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It was amazing.</li>
      <li>guess this is what I should expect for purchasing a cheaper kind of eyeliner.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very easy to put one I had no problem with&lt;br</li>
      <li>and that was a big part of why I got this product but the gel liner itself is amazing!!!</li>
      <li>but not a problem since i have more</li>
      <li>I was so glad to see my order</li>
      <li>and I love this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and easy to apply although</li>
      <li>But overall its a great product</li>
      <li>quality of the eyeliner may not be perfect in fact I did had a hard time applying them,</li>
      <li>thats so true here.</li>
      <li>wow love it</li>
      <li>But it was totally worth it because they sent me a M.A.C eyeliner gel.</li>
      <li>I love how pure of a black this is and it looks great when it actually applies well, but it never dries, causing it to smear.</li>
      <li>This is my first gel-eyeliner.</li>
      <li>smears off too fast.</li>
      <li>it works really well</li>
      <li>the price was okay, its a small waterproof eyeliner with a brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This took a while to come to my house and is a lot smaller than I expected it to be, it also doesn&#x27;t go on well and come off really easily</li>
      <li>do not waste your money .</li>
      <li>When I got it the brush was already having what my elementary school art teacher would call &amp;#34;a messy hair day&amp;#34;.</li>

<li> a complete waste.</li>
<li> but when i applied it on it looked a little weird stroked one more time and the product came off</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> the eyeliner smudged down my face a little bit 10 minutes after applying.</li>
<li> , I wish it came with a small pouch to store it in.</li>
<li> The brush is hard to use</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to even apply.</li>
<li> the brush was hard and is junk.  </li>
<li> Very hard to put on gel eyeliner with a frayed brush.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s thin and oily and the brush is of really bad quality with natural fibers which are terrible for lining.</li>
<li> This product is horrible the shipping was late and when it came the brush was disgusting</li>
<li> but I hate the brush.</li>
<li> brush was horrible!!!</li>

    <li> This product is horrible the shipping was late and when it came the brush was disgusting</li>
    <li> The brush was horrible!! and that was a big part of why I got this product but the gel liner itself is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> it works really well and i like it.. might have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s so smooth and easy to apply although, I wish it came with a small pouch to store it in. But overall its a great product</li>
    <li> Very good  I would repurchase this product</li>
    <li> I love how pure of a black this is and it looks great when it actually applies well, but it never dries, causing it to smear. You could touch your eye four hours after you applied this and it would still rub off. The brush is hard to use so it&#x27;s hard to even apply. When I got it the brush was already having what my elementary school art teacher would call &amp;#34;a messy hair day&amp;#34;. Very hard to put on gel eyeliner with a frayed brush.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to see my order and I love this it&#x27;s very easy to put one I had no problem with&lt;br /&gt;Smearing wow love it thank u</li>
    <li> This took a while to come to my house and is a lot smaller than I expected it to be, it also doesn&#x27;t go on well and come off really easily</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars because it took about 36 days to get here. But it was totally worth it because they sent me a M.A.C eyeliner gel. It was amazing. I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but it should be good .</li>
    <li> smears off too fast. Not worth it</li>
    <li> brush was horrible!!! but not a problem since i have more but when i applied it on it looked a little weird stroked one more time and the product came off</li>
    <li> do not waste your money . i know you get what you pay for and thats so true here. the eyeliner smudged down my face a little bit 10 minutes after applying. the brush was hard and is junk.  a complete waste. do not buy.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is like children&#x27;s face paint, it smears, it&#x27;s thin and oily and the brush is of really bad quality with natural fibers which are terrible for lining. You get what you pay for, save your money.</li>
    <li> This is my first gel-eyeliner. I like it but I hate the brush. Good day!</li>
    <li> the price was okay, its a small waterproof eyeliner with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;the quality of the eyeliner may not be perfect in fact I did had a hard time applying them, guess this is what I should expect for purchasing a cheaper kind of eyeliner.</li>
