      <li>MOST people, even seniors, this pill box is an over kill.  </li>

      <li>I work at my desk most of the day, so</li>
      <li>Works great as a medication reminder for this old soldier.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to program, easy to use</li>

      <li>I am not fond of the sliding pill carrier, so we use a weekly pill tray which works fine.</li>

      <li>Even on a day when you&#x27;re relaxing around the house a gentle reminder comes in handy...</li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s time to take your pill), an alarm, or a light.  </li>
      <li>i liked it so much that i bought another one for my cousin.  </li>
      <li>I use the light at meetings so not to interupt the meeting.</li>
      <li>Does not work and we cannot get a sound out of it.  </li>
      <li>You can set up to 4 timers per day and set the timer to beep, to speak, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s time to take your pill&amp;#34;, or to flash the light.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the light.  </li>
      <li>They were made of cheap plastic and had a wimpy sound.</li>
      <li>Not user friendly</li>
      <li>I bought 2 sets of brand new batteries, very good ones, and it would set the time and alarms, but they never alerted me at the specific times set; I tried all three type settings, and all it ever did was blink, blink, blink.  </li>
      <li>They are pretty easy to set and operate</li>
      <li>easy to use and exactly as description states</li>
      <li>Other than the defective one these are great pill reminders.</li>
      <li>It is easy for him to carry where ever he goes,it is compact fits in his pocket and very durable..</li>
      <li>The first one lasted about 13 years!  </li>
      <li>and I thank you ever so much for having this available.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s rarely missed a dose</li>
      <li>Had I not still had the remaining six days to put a week&#x27;s worth of pills in at once</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to set current time and the four separate reminder times are just as easy.  </li>
      <li>But if you have to take medications at exact times, up to four a day, it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>we bought this for my son who has Autisum &amp; seizures , he take medication on his own when he is not at home .</li>
      <li>User has a choice of light only, electric sound, or voice.as reminder sounds.  </li>
      <li>I chose this pill box because I have to take medication four times daily and accuracy in timing is very important.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re pretty durable too.</li>
      <li>I got this timer as a replacement for my mother&#x27;s first one that quit after 10 years of use.</li>
      <li>after checking out many different pill alarms, i decided to get this one for my mom.  </li>
      <li>It is loud with the 3 choices of sound but often not in the room I&#x27;m in when it goes off.</li>
      <li>When the pillbox part is attached to the upper part (for instance when you are out for the day and need to put it inside a handbag), the MEDglider is cumbersome and, on more than one occasion, the compartments have slipped off the lid, spilling the tablets everywhere</li>
      <li>Inexpensive device – arrived quickly and so far works like a charm!</li>
      <li>This device is simple to operate and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This alarm pill box has been very helpful for my friend to remember to take her pills on time.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>This medport has to be filled on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>This is working out very well.  </li>
      <li>In view of the high cost of the Timex pill box, I decided to try the MEDglider instead.  </li>
      <li>Love the e-pill, my mom is reminded to take her pills without me having to remind her, half the time I would forget to remind her myself!</li>
      <li>The other two seem to be working fine.</li>
      <li>The item shipped promptly and even when I emailed the seller with a question, they responded quickly and professionally, I would definitely buy from this seller again, I give them a two thumbs up!</li>
      <li>Tried brand new batteries</li>
      <li>and I had recycled mine, we opted for a new TracFone which cost $7.99 on sale.</li>
      <li>An absolutely TERRIFIC system for managing multiple daily meds accurately without losing ones mind!</li>
      <li>So, if I come back to my desk and see a large X over one of the timers, I know I missed that dose.  </li>
      <li>The case is to large even when seperated from the alarm to carry outside with me.</li>
      <li>If this is for someone wanting to carry it in their pocket, it is much too big.</li>
      <li>They were marked with each day of the week and thus assured that you did not miss a day.</li>
      <li>I have now resorted to turning off the bell tone and using the voice reminder but have given up on the pillbox, and am using the pill container from the old Timex Medication Manager for my medicines.</li>
      <li>In addition to these 5 I have bought at least 4 more over the years</li>
      <li>I needed a replacement for my old Timex pill timer.  </li>
      <li>well worth the money, which is minimal considering the usefullness it gives.</li>
      <li>Our first one finally died after several years.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this timer for anyone, but especially diabetics and epiileptics.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This device is simple to operate and easy to use. It holds the medication securely in place in the easy to fill and access compartments. The beeping/talking alarm is loud enough to hear when your not in close proximity to the device but not annoyingly loud. I would recommend this device to others.</li>
    <li> I got this timer as a replacement for my mother&#x27;s first one that quit after 10 years of use. My mom loves it. It has a tray with 4 sections for pills that slides onto the back of the timer part and she carries it with her all day long.  I hope they continue to carry this style timer or something very similar to it.  I do wish the pill holder parts were a little bigger but we like it as it is also. It is a very nice convenience.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000QYZSFM e-pill MEDglider Medport System 1. 4 Alarm Pill Box Talking Timer. DAILY Medication Manager.]]The med timer that I bought through Amazon is wonderful.  It reminds me when it&#x27;s time to take the next pill.  However, the first med timer that I purchased at a drug store years ago cost less than $10 and it included 7 containers to clip onto the timer, one for each day of the week. This med timer included only one container and it cost me $39.95.</li>
    <li> About ten years ago, I had purchased this at a pharmacy and it came with pill holders for seven days a week.  I had lost one case with the timer when it fell out of my pocket.  Had I not still had the remaining six days to put a week&#x27;s worth of pills in at once, I would have returned it.  The price was about $10.00 back then.</li>
    <li> easy to use and exactly as description states</li>
    <li> This pill reminder/box is fantastic! The only way to improve upon it would be to make it with a seven day holder that is still small. This is wonderful though!</li>
    <li> This pill reminder box does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively easy to use.  Is slightly bulky but does provide enough room to place doses of several pills into 4 separate compartments with four beeping or talking reminders.  The reminders can be set for any minute on the clock.  A very good value at the reduced price of $10.</li>
    <li> There is no comparison between the MEDglider and the Timex Medication Manager, which I have used for the last 5 years but with which I recently started to have problems (unable to switch off the alarm).  In view of the high cost of the Timex pill box, I decided to try the MEDglider instead.  However the four compartments of the MEDglider pillbox are too small to contain some of the large capsules I have to take and I find it extremely fiddly to get the pills which are in the two &#x27;internal&#x27; compartments.  When the pillbox part is attached to the upper part (for instance when you are out for the day and need to put it inside a handbag), the MEDglider is cumbersome and, on more than one occasion, the compartments have slipped off the lid, spilling the tablets everywhere and of course mixing them up!  The alarm is VERY loud and annoying.  I have now resorted to turning off the bell tone and using the voice reminder but have given up on the pillbox, and am using the pill container from the old Timex Medication Manager for my medicines.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive device – arrived quickly and so far works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I cannot remember to take pills 12 hours apart.  This has been the greatest help I have ever had and well worth the money, which is minimal considering the usefullness it gives.</li>
    <li> I like that you can enter the time for up to four doses of medication at a time.  However, this is for my husband who has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and the pill compartments are a bit difficult to maneuver for him.  He is not able to open and dispense the pills without assistance.  For someone with good dexterity, it would be a really nice system.</li>
    <li> An absolutely TERRIFIC system for managing multiple daily meds accurately without losing ones mind!</li>
    <li> This alarm/pillbox is great if you need to be reminded (nagged) to take your pills. You can choose between a regular alarm and a voice. I chose the voice and find it helpful to hear: it&#x27;s time to take your pill</li>
    <li> A must for anyone who needs to have multiple reminders about taking medicine, or even just to use as a reminder for anything for that matter.</li>
    <li> I have had one for at least 25 years.  Actually I&#x27;ve had two. The first one lasted about 13 years!  Just change the batteries!</li>
    <li> This is working out very well.  My husband  is having some memory problems and this is a very good and loud reminder.</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price!</li>
    <li> This alarm pill box has been very helpful for my friend to remember to take her pills on time. It works very well.</li>
    <li> This is great.  I only wish it had a cord, so I could hang it around my neck and not lose it.  Maybe a beeper that goes faster or louder when I am getting close to finding it.</li>
    <li> This was a \\&quot;case\\&quot; where I should have been wiser. The case is to large even when seperated from the alarm to carry outside with me. It is loud with the 3 choices of sound but often not in the room I&#x27;m in when it goes off. Unlike even water bottles it doesn&#x27;t come with a hook or anyway to attach it if I wanted. Now I have to remember to keep up with the case and the pills.</li>
    <li> I chose this item because I needed help in taking my medications, this has come in handy and I thank you ever so much for having this available.</li>
    <li> after checking out many different pill alarms, i decided to get this one for my mom.  it is wonderful.  the alarms are easy to set and easy to change if you need to switch the time of alarms.  i like it that i don&#x27;t have to pull out the instructions and re-read everytime i need to change something.  i liked it so much that i bought another one for my cousin.  however, i am disappointed that the first one i bought came with the 7 day tray  and the second one i bought only came with one pill box.   for the price, i think the 7 day tray should be included.</li>
    <li> Its very light  and great reminder for taking the pills since I bought this I have not forget to take my pills. I recommend it to all</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for over a year Just to bad it did not come with the 7 day tray inserts</li>
    <li> I chose this pill box because I have to take medication four times daily and accuracy in timing is very important.  It&#x27;s easy to set current time and the four separate reminder times are just as easy.  User has a choice of light only, electric sound, or voice.as reminder sounds.  The actual pill storage box is a slide-out compartment of generous size for each of the four times,  I use it to store enough pills for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For MOST people, even seniors, this pill box is an over kill.  But if you have to take medications at exact times, up to four a day, it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that the alarms are not very loud.  Also, it might need help setting it if your hands are weak or you have trouble concentrating.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s easy to program, easy to use and it&#x27;s portable. I gave this to my mom as a gift because she was always missing medication doses. She&#x27;s rarely missed a dose and it&#x27;s been 3 years!</li>
    <li> Our first one finally died after several years.  Were most happy to find it available thru Amazon, as it keeps my wife&#x27;s medications organized and assures that she does not forget one or more throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years so I knew it was a good product which is why I bought 5 of them when they were on sale. I would have given it 5 Stars but 1 of the 5 does not work properly. The alarm has a very different sound and it randomly beeps when there is no alarm set. Tried brand new batteries but it still did it. In addition to these 5 I have bought at least 4 more over the years and I&#x27;ve never had that problem before so I obviously got a defective one which can happen with any product. I should have contacted the seller about it but I procrastinated and then never got around to it. Other than the defective one these are great pill reminders. They are pretty easy to set and operate and they&#x27;re pretty durable too. I&#x27;ve dropped them on tile floors quite a few time and the most that has happened is the battery compartment opened up (didn&#x27;t break though) !!!</li>
    <li> Works great as a medication reminder for this old soldier. Bought a second one to cover the entire 24 hour day and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> My caveat is that I don&#x27;t actually use this to house my medication.  I think I could, I just haven&#x27;t done so.  If you had several types, you&#x27;d have to fill it often.  I work at my desk most of the day, so I just put this next to the prescription bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer has different alarms - audio (It&#x27;s time to take your pill), an alarm, or a light.  I haven&#x27;t tried the light.  There are four timers you can set and you can set them to different alarm settings if you want.  The alarm goes off a few times - maybe 4 or 5 beeps - then stops for maybe 30 seconds.  Then it goes off again.  It does this 3 or 4 times.  If you do not press the off button, the display shows that you missed it.  So, if I come back to my desk and see a large X over one of the timers, I know I missed that dose.  It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s not intrusive to the people around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY easy to use and has a cover over the controls so you can&#x27;t inadvertently change a timer.</li>
    <li> did not work at all.  Not user friendly</li>
    <li> we had one for my father and now my mother is taking pills at different times also. so we decided to purchased a second one. and its so handy. i recommend it. we love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The last one we had lasted about 10-12 years. Had been looking for another one. Amazon came through. Would recommend to anyone that has pills to take and sometimes forgets.</li>
    <li> The pill container could be larger.  I have to put wills in 2 spots.  I got one made by Timex that was better, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Love the e-pill, my mom is reminded to take her pills without me having to remind her, half the time I would forget to remind her myself! The item shipped promptly and even when I emailed the seller with a question, they responded quickly and professionally, I would definitely buy from this seller again, I give them a two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t bother with the little boxes as I used a Mon-Fri stick with seven boxes.  Only improvement would be if you could get this with a seven box stick instead of a four box for different meds.</li>
    <li> This medport has to be filled on a daily basis.  Previously, the Medport had separate containers that you could put the medications in on a weekly basis and just transfer to the medport each day.  They were marked with each day of the week and thus assured that you did not miss a day.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for 10 years.  My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s and needs to have his pills on time.  This device helps us remember.  I am not fond of the sliding pill carrier, so we use a weekly pill tray which works fine.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife so she could keep better track of her medicines and the time to take them.  She has really enjoyed this product and if this one should break down I am assured we will be looking for the same replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets of brand new batteries, very good ones, and it would set the time and alarms, but they never alerted me at the specific times set; I tried all three type settings, and all it ever did was blink, blink, blink.  Was not worth the money I paid for them, and I will not order anything else from you.</li>
    <li> we bought this for my son who has Autisum &amp; seizures , he take medication on his own when he is not at home . This timer is great to remind him when to take his medication 3 x a day. It is easy for him to carry where ever he goes,it is compact fits in his pocket and very durable..</li>
    <li> We tried a couple of different pill timers: one worked a short while and the other didn&#x27;t work at all. They were made of cheap plastic and had a wimpy sound. My husband has to take meds 5 times a day and needed something reliable. The e-pill timer is the one I was going to try next. Then a friend suggested getting a used cell phone and just using the alarm feature. Since no one I knew had a used phone and I had recycled mine, we opted for a new TracFone which cost $7.99 on sale. It&#x27;s an LG phone and has 5 alarm settings which was perfect!  It came with a car charger, wall charger and hard case with a belt clip. It took about 3 minutes to set the 5 alarm times to ring daily; it has adjustable volume and can be set to vibrate. We also have the option of getting a phone card and using it to make calls. This was a great solution for us. The only thing lacking is a pill container so he carries a small one in his pocket when he leaves the house.</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY IS NICE, I LIKE IT,  U GET WHAT PAY FOR. YES I REC</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad to replace one he had used for years.  It was bulky which he immediately didn&#x27;t like.  After using only one week, the alarms quit working.  I am going to try to return it.  If this is for someone wanting to carry it in their pocket, it is much too big.</li>
    <li> Thanks&lt;br /&gt;It is very good</li>
    <li> Does not work and we cannot get a sound out of it.  Due to the low cost it was not worth while returning it.  I will just refrain from purchasing any more products from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limited instructions vague in nature.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for my old Timex pill timer.  The Timex was outrageously priced, so I bought these, instead.  I bought 3.  One was defective and had to be returned.  The other two seem to be working fine.</li>
    <li> Have bought several of these for travel and everyday use. I can&#x27;t ever remember to take pills on time but these remind you with an insistent signal. Easy to set clock and program for medicine or use as an alarm clock. Travels well too.</li>
    <li> This pill box reminder keeps is great. It keeps us on top of my husbands meds that are required 4 times a day plus 30 minutes before meals. I love that it can beep or light up depending on how you want to be reminded. I use the light at meetings so not to interupt the meeting. The pill holder slides easily and is easy to insert pills. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these i have had and neither one worked. Out of the box I could not set the 4th alarm. And the volume is so terrible you cannot hear it across one room.  Not worth any amount.</li>
    <li> was never able to figure out how to set it up...</li>
    <li> works great and arrived early</li>
    <li> If you take medication and have to maintain a specific schedule this timer will really be great for you!  I have several meds that require specific timing and having a reminder is necessary on a busy day.  Even on a day when you&#x27;re relaxing around the house a gentle reminder comes in handy...And the MEDglider is the perfect answer.  You can set up to 4 timers per day and set the timer to beep, to speak, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s time to take your pill&amp;#34;, or to flash the light.  The speaking timer works best for me personally, and can even wake me in the morning.  I highly recommend this timer for anyone, but especially diabetics and epiileptics.</li>
