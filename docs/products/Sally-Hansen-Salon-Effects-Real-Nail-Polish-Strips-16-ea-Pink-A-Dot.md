      <li>I was surprised that these worked as well as they did!  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;d buy them again because the price was so slow, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for them.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use them right away, and store them for a month or so, they do have the tendency to dry out a little.</li>

    <li> I unfortunately did not get the polka dotted ones, I got cheetahs print ones. Their okay but still not what I expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always getting these Salon Effects and getting complements on them. They are easy to apply and last about two weeks on my nails.</li>
    <li> The nail strips are definitely cute but way too much of a hassle to remove the excess (at least for me) I paint my nails faster with Sally Hansen insta-dri polish</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cute, but the pink spots are bigger than in the picture. still very cute, but i get the feeling it&#x27;ll look strange on tiny fingers.</li>
    <li> The Sally Hansen Salon Effects nail stickers are FANTASTIC!!!  They last well over a week, are easy to apply, easy to get off with nail polish remover, and come in so many cool designs!  I get complements on my nails all the time!!</li>
    <li> This is 99% the ONLY brand I use for basic nail cover. You can get more time than they say even. It just depends on how fast your nails grow. I use a good base and then cover it with a nice top coat to get more out of the look. I don&#x27;t think that this kind of pattern has as much clarity and punch as an ombre&#x27; or glitter, but it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that these worked as well as they did!  And buying them from Amazon was definitely cheaper than anywhere else.  If you don&#x27;t use them right away, and store them for a month or so, they do have the tendency to dry out a little.</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of practice to master application but lots of cute designs available.  Can get up to two weeks wear if initial application is good.</li>
    <li> last a very long time and is cute. be careful about buying nail strips online because some are dry. but this one is good.(:</li>
    <li> favorite nail decorations ever! Easy to use! Although some of the boxes I bought on amazon of different colors were more &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34; and a  bit harder to adhere to nail.</li>
    <li> I really like the concept of these strips. When I first put them on, they look great. They&#x27;re easy to put on and the design is cute. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they start to chip a couple days after you put them on. I&#x27;d buy them again because the price was so slow, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for them.</li>
    <li> I applied these to my nails and they only lasted 2 days before chipping. The pattern it&#x27;s cute in the package but applied to nails, I hated it. I&#x27;ve tried many other nail strips such as sephora OPI and they lasted way over 10 days without any chips.</li>
    <li> Stays on forever, cute design and looks like a salon manicure without the price.  With practice the application gets easier and easier.</li>
    <li> I was pretty scared of getting these but they turned out to be beautiful!!! beautiful colors, easy to put on but a little harder than normal polish to remove.. either way I was pleasently surprised!</li>
    <li> I love these.  I have tried the butterfly, purple zebra stripe, and now pink-a-dot.  Much more cost-effective then getting a manicure.  And they look great, got plenty of compliments.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Salon Effects strips are not a bad product, but I do not recommend purchasing them online. &amp;#34;Pink-A-Dot&amp;#34; looks cute in the picture, but the pink dots are bigger and more dull than I expected.</li>
    <li> So fast and easy with no drying time. Could not be any easier, especially for a new mom. . .</li>
    <li> Very nice product...this selection of color is great. I will definitively buy this product again. Product was shipped fast too!</li>
    <li> Pretty design; looks just like on the picture. Once you get the hang of placing these, it&#x27;s cool how hassle-free these are.</li>
    <li> Easy application, no mess, no stress! Last for about 10 days before nail starts to grow out. Don&#x27;t chip very easily IF you apply a top coat after application</li>
    <li> Strips did not stick at all! Not worth the money,would not recommend what so ever. Will not repurchase this junk I advise you don&#x27;t either.</li>
