    <li> This stuff faded my acne scars and is leaving my skin smooth and very clear.  I can go without make up!  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Acnefree Retinol Renewal Complex is a skin saver!  I have some areas that have not responded well to other treatments.  When I used this one, I had significant improvement the first couple of days, and holding!  Acnefree Retinol Renewal Complex made my skin smooth, soft, and even relieved irritation.  I was very pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who may have problem areas with or without irritation.  I have been using it for about a month.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I got the worse acne, when i got this cream, it work me fine, I guess i need all the steps to be completely satisfied</li>
    <li> Helps clear skin up from new and old acne and scars . It refreshens your face. Love that I can buy just this item and not the whole kit which I don&#x27;t need . Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my skin--give it a few weeks to see a difference, but worth the effort.  Also seems to improve firmness.</li>
    <li> I have always been pretty sensitive to benzoyl peroxide, but this retinol renewal complex delivers more impressive results without the harsh effects on sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m a fair-skinned woman just over 40 yrs old with combination skin.  I even got some for my teenage son, who is starting to experience mild breakouts.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a night cream to refine my skin texture and to reduce the size of pores.  Acnefree Retinol produced visible results within a week.  My skin is smoother, tighter and clearer.  Unlike a lot of retinols, this one is gentle--no redness.  It spreads quickly, using a small amount.  It&#x27;s a great buy and one that I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used to use Retin-A, but at 36 I wanted something a bit milder, and this is perfect, seems to really be clearing my skin up without all the irritation and redness of Retin-A.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Now to the ones who have severe acne, or break out often should try the whole 4 step kit. This order for just the renewal is only if you need extra on the step 4 system or if you just want the renewal cream by itself. I like it because you don&#x27;t have to buy the whole kit just to get another cream! You order this one specific product and it&#x27;s a good price:)  You can buy this stuff at Walmart but you would have to get the 4 step kit. It&#x27;s a yellowish cream and it has kind of a sweet smell. I like it because it&#x27;s light weight and you don&#x27;t have to put  a lot, it goes a long way so don&#x27;t put to much.  The cream makes the skin feel soft and gives yourself a glow in the morning. It evens out the skin . It&#x27;s also good for sensitive prone skin. It might not work for everyone but It really works good on my face and I don&#x27;t have any breakouts with this stuff. I really recommend this product to any one who has acne and needs something to keep your skin looking young and vibrant!!!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this stuff! Hands down the best acne medicine I have used, due to both its affordability and effectiveness. I pretty much never use benzoyl peroxide anymore. This stuff does wonders for my skin, and even though I have naturally dry skin and live in a desert climate, this doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make me flaky like every other acne medicine I have tried. With nightly use, I rarely have a breakout now. One tube lasts over a month for me.  I highly recommend you give this a go before trying the more expensive prescription-only products.</li>
    <li> This product is normally sold as part of a kit but was glad to find it here where I could just get the product I need. This works great and has made a difference in my skin.</li>

    <li> Great stuff, fast delivery.  This is one beauty product that delivers more than promised.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, waited two weeks to make a review, so i could give my honest opinion,  really good for old stubborn acne scars I swear  by this stuff now, definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent product, smooths skin and clears acne.</li>
    <li> is a very good product&lt;br /&gt;removes the red and leaves skin soft&lt;br /&gt;not irritate the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the 4 steps AcneFree&lt;br /&gt;this is the best product I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 34 years old and suffer from adult acne and this product keeps my skin clean</li>
    <li> Bought this for you three children who have moderate acne.  It worked initially but then stopped working after 3 weeks.  It was nice while it lasted.....but save your money!</li>
    <li> For me personally, this wasn&#x27;t anything spectacular. It stings which is expected. Not worth the cash really. I would fork out more for something that showed a significant difference. This just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Everyone is different though. I guess you just have to try and see for yourself. If you have severe acne issues, I do not suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great for my acne and pimple but it also works for wrinkle as well since it has retinol.</li>
    <li> Better than ROC!  love it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, works great</li>
    <li> This is the one for you! Add a cleanser and acne medicine regimen and this puppy will take care of the rest! We men can&#x27;t hide like women do under makeup but this retinol complex takes care of the things acne meds won&#x27;t so that&#x27;s neither here or there. I consider it my secret weapon when it comes to having unblemished skin. You should definitely use this. The difference by day 3 is easily noticible. Day 7 you&#x27;ll want to post a selfie hahaha.</li>
    <li> Good product. Had cleared my skin up quite a bit. Prevents new spots appearing over night</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a short time....not long enough to see a big difference.  I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Stumbled upon it by accident, but it works better than many other night time repair lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I use the 4 step system and go through this step quicker than the other 3. I love being able to order this step separately and for a good price.</li>
    <li> My teen tells me, with continued use, this is the only product that helps repair her skin from acne damage and prevents bad break outs.</li>
