      <li>No longer moves to effectively brush.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fit pefactly, and the price is good.</li>
      <li>That &#x27;s what you want to hear rather than: When it&#x27;s too good to be true</li>
      <li>they make more noise ,&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>I love Oral B products.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t deterred by these when I needed more brush heads.</li>
      <li>Needs more R&amp;D.</li>
      <li>nice clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>For the price the quality is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Good thing they&#x27;re not expensive.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re used to hearing these choices when the price seems too good to be true: This is not bad at all for the price.</li>
      <li>The official oral b heads pop off easier, and fit much better.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless I think it&#x27;s overall, a good deal...for the price!</li>
      <li>They fit and are a lot cheaper than the Oral-B replacements.  </li>
      <li>They are cheap, but they need to be replaced after a week.</li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>It does not snap in like the original but just slides in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are not bad at all for the price.</li>
      <li>Very cheap, it has not, because the first wife of the brush head is very strong, can only be used again evaluated.</li>
      <li>price worth buying</li>
      <li>Work as the original but at a very affordable price.  </li>
      <li>the quality isn&#x27;t even half as good.  </li>
      <li>Work just as good as the brand name ones for a whollllllle lot less.</li>
      <li>However, they have only side/profile photos of their heads for a very important reason.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Up until now, it worked pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I installed the first head on my electric tooth brush in May 2015.  </li>
      <li>First two toothbrush heads stopped moving after about a week.</li>
      <li>The heads fit the brush and move with the motor, but the bristle are weirdly soft and irregular lengths and stick out.  </li>
      <li>These brushes don&#x27;t stay on the head of the toothbrush all of the time and their bristles are not as full as the original Oral-b deep sweep brushes.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on stem of Braun holder, but works, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Form, fit and function are exactly the same.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are exactly the same as the original product but at a fraction of the price&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>They fit and work with my Oral-B Pro just as the Oral-B Deep Sweep brush heads do but without the pain in my wallet.</li>
      <li>This is where I differ from most of the other reviewers.</li>
      <li>Older oral-b and this replacement worked.,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all about buying generic because I strongly think that generics are usually the same (sometimes better) than the real thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy and again and again each time I needed new brush heads.  </li>
      <li>The brush action is genius!</li>
      <li>The plastic material is more brittle and harder making it less snug even when it was first placed.</li>
      <li>DO NOT FIT EASILY</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the 4-pack first rather than the bigger pack because I&#x27;m sad to say that these were kind of a waste of money.</li>
      <li>They have such a great range but are somewhat expensive.</li>
      <li>The bristols are too soft.</li>
      <li>did not like electric brush action, gave away</li>
      <li>The plastic is apparently also very soft and after a couple of weeks rounds out on the inside so that the toothbrush head does not operate correctly.</li>
      <li>had to replace the first head after about 4 days because it stopped moving from side to side, it was stuck in one position which did nothing for cleaning my teeth, the second head lasted 2 days, same problem.</li>
      <li>The speed your handle is capable of is unaffected.</li>
      <li>Only the real Oral B brushes work correctly and last for three months.</li>
      <li>While considering ordering I was a little suspicious but the overall good reviews and the unbelievable price convinced me to go forward.</li>
      <li>Once I received them and compared them side by side to my original Oral B heads, the reason there is not a single photo showing bristles pointing at you is that the difference in tight dense appearance is very obvious.</li>
      <li>Is this product worth buying at an insanely low price of about less than $1 a head?</li>
      <li>The sweep double action is the same.</li>
      <li>The bristles were a little harder than the original</li>
      <li>Expect the brush head to last half as long as the original in effectiveness and firm cleaning action.</li>
      <li>They are nearly half as dense as the original and not as firm.</li>

<li> Too loose!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very happy to find the products at the price and the delivery was great also.</li>
    <li> they made bottom too big and they will fall off the toothbrush ,&lt;br /&gt;also heads are smaller&lt;br /&gt;also they make more noise ,&lt;br /&gt;for price worth buying , I buy them again ,</li>
    <li> These work great with my Oral B toothbrush!  They&#x27;re a little harder than I like my bristles, but much cheaper than the name brand.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Work just as good as the brand name ones for a whollllllle lot less.</li>
    <li> nice clean feeling.  Ive been using them for about 2 weeks and yes, the bristles have been falling off and I doubt it will last 3 months.  I will NOT repurchase though, since they fall to the 3rd party curse-- they are difficult to take off your toothbrush.  I have to grab it and yank it off.  The official oral b heads pop off easier, and fit much better.  I did however find out I like the deep sweep style and will probably rebuy the official version.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too soft...should be corrected.</li>
    <li> Very disappointment. This is where I differ from most of the other reviewers. I usually conform but not with this product that keeps popping out during use after the first two weeks. The moving part of the brush hurt my lips when this head popped out on two different occasions and that was when I gave up. The bristles were a little harder than the original but that was no biggie. The failure to stay on and random out popping did it for me. It does not snap in like the original but just slides in. The plastic material is more brittle and harder making it less snug even when it was first placed. Is this product worth buying at an insanely low price of about less than $1 a head? Maybe, if you are a deal chaser like me but when it almost landed me in and emergency room, I had no choice but to go back to the insanely overpriced $7 each originals. I gave it 2 stars b/c the makers did put in the effort and they do mean well. Needs more R&amp;D.</li>
    <li> I installed the first head on my electric tooth brush in May 2015.  Yesterday I had to replace it.  I did this because the brushes stopped vibrating/moving.  Up until now, it worked pretty well.  We&#x27;ll see how long the second head lasts.</li>
    <li> Older oral-b and this replacement worked.,</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the Oral B brush head. Unfortunately, the bristles don&#x27;t fade like the original. But can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads are horrible. If I get 3-4 uses from them before they break and stop moving.</li>
    <li> Does not fit Oral B sonic electric toothbrush!!!!</li>
    <li> Bristles did not last nearly as long as the Oral-B brand.  They began falling out after 2 to 3 weeks usage.</li>
    <li> very good !! it&#x27;s fit pefactly, and the price is good.</li>
    <li> They work until 3 or 4 uses and then nothing moves anymore and they stop working. I replaced with another and the same thing. Horrible!</li>
    <li> Very cheap, it has not, because the first wife of the brush head is very strong, can only be used again evaluated.</li>
    <li> These work great.  As good as originals.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> DO NOT FIT EASILY AS THE ONE&#x27;S FROM THE MANUFACTURER</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t last as long as any other toothbrush I have ever owned.  They are cheap, but they need to be replaced after a week.</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than the &amp;#34;branded&amp;#34; replacement heads, but work just as well. My whole family is using them without complaint. Form, fit and function are exactly the same.</li>
    <li> as good as brand name. last fairly long time. i bought third time.</li>
    <li> Work as the original but at a very affordable price.  Change them every 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about buying generic because I strongly think that generics are usually the same (sometimes better) than the real thing. I&#x27;m never deterred by generics so I wasn&#x27;t deterred by these when I needed more brush heads. Unfortunately these are NOT like the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;, the bristles feel very weird and that&#x27;s understandable for the price, but even with the price point, if I were to keep buying these, I would spend more money than buying the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace the first head after about 4 days because it stopped moving from side to side, it was stuck in one position which did nothing for cleaning my teeth, the second head lasted 2 days, same problem. Everyone knows that you need to take off the brush head and rinse it off after a brush because toothpaste does get inside it, it&#x27;s even in the instructions of the tooth brush itself that you should take off the brush head and rinse it off. These are not built to be taken off and on the brush, like the originals are, because by the time I got to the third brush head I decided I&#x27;d stop rinsing the brush head by taking it off the toothbrush, this has worked and the third brush head has been going for around a week. Nevertheless, this seems kind of gross because I don&#x27;t want there to be stale, dried up toothpaste inside the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered the brand name brush heads and should be getting them soon, I think I will have the remaining brush head from this pack as an emergency replacement. I&#x27;m glad I bought the 4-pack first rather than the bigger pack because I&#x27;m sad to say that these were kind of a waste of money. Good thing they&#x27;re not expensive.</li>
    <li> They fit and work with my Oral-B Pro just as the Oral-B Deep Sweep brush heads do but without the pain in my wallet.</li>
    <li> Did not fit Braun 3D Excel. Too loose! Wrapped tape around Braun where it attaches to brush to keep it from slipping off.  Will use these and not order again.</li>
    <li> The bristols are harder than the manufacturer ones. Othewise, fits well and works well.</li>
    <li> I love Oral B products. They have such a great range but are somewhat expensive. So this pack of replacement heads for an a deep sweep toothbrush at this low price is a bargain not to be missed&lt;br /&gt;They are exactly the same as the original product but at a fraction of the price&lt;br /&gt;Great item and will buy again</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re used to hearing these choices when the price seems too good to be true: This is not bad at all for the price. That &#x27;s what you want to hear rather than: When it&#x27;s too good to be true it usually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not bad at all for the price. I&#x27;ve been using the Sweep Away electric for about 8 months. It&#x27;s without question the best electric I&#x27;ve ever used. The brush action is genius! However, I&#x27;m writing to inform you that this item fits perfectly and operates identically to the original. The difference is the quality of the bristles. They are nearly half as dense as the original and not as firm. The brush head is the same size. The speed your handle is capable of is unaffected. The sweep double action is the same. Expect the brush head to last half as long as the original in effectiveness and firm cleaning action. Let&#x27;s face it, at 8 bucks for four heads, they&#x27;ll still last longer dollar for dollar than the originals at their price. Once I received them and compared them side by side to my original Oral B heads, the reason there is not a single photo showing bristles pointing at you is that the difference in tight dense appearance is very obvious. While considering ordering I was a little suspicious but the overall good reviews and the unbelievable price convinced me to go forward. However, they have only side/profile photos of their heads for a very important reason. From that angle they look identical to Oral B. Nevertheless I think it&#x27;s overall, a good deal...for the price!</li>
    <li> Use these to polish metal.  These brushes will rip your teeth apart.</li>
    <li> did not like electric brush action, gave away</li>
    <li> For the price the quality is pretty good.  I have only had them a few days but so far so good. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll buy and again and again each time I needed new brush heads.  Quality is four star and a half for me but I gave five due to the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good job and excellent bus. ethic.</li>
    <li> First two toothbrush heads stopped moving after about a week. Returned product.</li>
    <li> After 4-5 use the head stops spinning, won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> After brushing my teeth 3 times, the bristles stopped rotating, which defeats the purpose of an electric toothbrush. I went back to the name-brand replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> They fit and are a lot cheaper than the Oral-B replacements.  Would have been nice if they had come in one style so you could have alternated to get the best results.</li>
    <li> Less than half price compared to the brand name one but the quality isn&#x27;t even half as good.  The heads fit the brush and move with the motor, but the bristle are weirdly soft and irregular lengths and stick out.  I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are getting cleaned by these brush heads.</li>
    <li> These brushes don&#x27;t stay on the head of the toothbrush all of the time and their bristles are not as full as the original Oral-b deep sweep brushes. Would not purchase them again.</li>
    <li> The bristols are too soft. The plastic is apparently also very soft and after a couple of weeks rounds out on the inside so that the toothbrush head does not operate correctly.No longer moves to effectively brush. Very poor and waste of money. Only the real Oral B brushes work correctly and last for three months.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on stem of Braun holder, but works, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
