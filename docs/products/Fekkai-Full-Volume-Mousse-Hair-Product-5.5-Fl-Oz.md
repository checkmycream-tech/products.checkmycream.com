      <li>great feel in the hair!  </li>
      <li>It works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>It works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>but i think its great.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job in adding body to my styling experience</li>
      <li>The result: great volume and holding power with no stiffness or stickiness.</li>
      <li>Fekkai Products are costly, but they are good.</li>
      <li>This line of products is really good at a fair price for what you get as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but the dealer was prompt with delivery and it arrived in good condition.</li>
      <li>Fekkai is a good brand.</li>
      <li>LoVe Love Love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>but glad it didn&#x27;t leak!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I so love the Fakkai product line for hair styling!  </li>
      <li>Great hold, easy to use,</li>
      <li>set on low-volume warm.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the seller, I got it and at a great price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the best volumizing products out there for over a decade: In my experience, mousses labeled \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; fall into one of three categories: The first type seems to attempt to add \\&quot;volume\\&quot; by filling your hair with static electricity and fly-aways.</li>
      <li>So far, the best mousse I&#x27;ve tried is Kenra&#x27;s Maximum Hold Volumizing Mousse.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Love the hairspray too.</li>
      <li>love all of Fekkai&#x27;s products and this one did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>This is the Great really makes your Hair Fuller.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the hair spray is, but this was OK.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel thicker with a lot more volume</li>
      <li>when I first bought this product in a name brand drug store I loved it,  held my hair, gave it bounce and body.  </li>
      <li>with the great shampoo that does not destroy my color in the process</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I find it works best when applied sparingly to clean wet hair -- just blot after shampooing -- that is then blow-styled with a hairdryer (and diffuser attachment)</li>
      <li>It gives body to my fine hair so that I can style it to stay in place.</li>
      <li>This product also lets me refresh a &#x27;do easily; I just mist my hair lightly with water and then restyle as desired.    </li>
      <li>have fine hair and appreciate this light airy type of product that does not&lt;br /&gt;weigh</li>
      <li>This light mousse gives my fine hair volume.</li>
      <li>I do not care for the updated &amp;#34;foam mousse product&amp;#34; that is available on Fekkai&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>I like this because it is light and the fragrance is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>this stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Fortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair, but when I apply it it smells like grass or something...not exactly a super feminine smell.</li>
      <li>This feels so natural in the hair, that I fell instantly in love!  </li>
      <li>It is a light mousse that adds just the right amount of body.</li>
      <li>This product gives my thin fine hair the best volume ever.</li>
      <li>This mousse is light but never fails to give my baby-fine air full volume.  </li>
      <li>The only issue I had was one of them didn&#x27;t have a top!</li>
      <li>no stickiness, your hair is still light and flowy, but when used right all the sudden you have a ton more volume at the roots.  </li>
      <li>This mousse is the latter type, and since I have very fine hair with no volume whatsoever, it basically doesn&#x27;t do a damn thing for my hair.</li>
      <li>The third type doesn&#x27;t actually add anything of substance to the hair, it&#x27;s just a super light formula, which I suppose would be great if you&#x27;re pretty satisfied with the natural texture of your hair and just want to add a light product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have used it for several years.</li>
      <li>Next time around, I used five or six pumps, and was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>my hair down and has a nice smell to go with</li>
      <li>Using two to three pumps, as the directions specify did absolutely nothing for my hair...</li>
      <li>i will say it does have a bit of an intense herb-y smell to it, but doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL.</li>
      <li>My wife can&#x27;t  live without it!</li>
      <li>Although the mousse is super lightweight, it provided plenty of volume without weighing my hair down or making it super sticky.</li>
      <li>I have tried many items and no other brand hair product works as well to volumize my fine thin hair.</li>
      <li>and voila, apparently natural healthy volume (for a little natural looking hold too, follow it up with rusk weightless hairspray).  </li>
      <li>I have fine slightly wavy hair</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will do: gives thin, limp hair great body and volume without stiffness or stickiness.</li>
      <li>It is therefore a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>This particular product really didn&#x27;t do anything, and seem to dry my hair out.  </li>
      <li>It was old and did not have the lids on either both.  </li>
      <li>and it really gives me extra bounce and curl.</li>
      <li>the key for me has been DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH, or it will not work and your roots will look almost greasy.  </li>
      <li>And currently, I have pretty short hair.</li>
      <li>I love this mousse and it is very hard to find in stores</li>
      <li>First, because I have to use so much of it to achieve decent results, this tiny little bottle (which generally retails for about $22) is not going to last very long at all.</li>
      <li>i use just 1-2 pumps tops and rub it directly into my roots only.  </li>
      <li>It is also rather expensive, but having tried almost everything else out there without success to cope with the heat and humidity of the Deep South, I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.    </li>

<li> Reviewer Amanda&#x27;s negative comments about the mousse indicate that she may have tried it on dry hair and/or used too much product.</li>
<li> blow dry upside down</li>
<li> The cost was comparable to Fekkai merchandise in other stores.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t way down my hair like some mouses.</li>

<li> I was extremely disappointed with this product at first.</li>
<li> Hard to travel with a bottle with no cap!</li>
<li> I have thin hair but a lot of it</li>
<li> One supply is exhausted I will be so sad ....</li>
<li> Secondly, this stuff smells NASTY.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Amazon.com forgot to included the cap to the bottle when they sent it to me.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t believe Fekkai still makes it.  </li>
<li> Sorry it is being discontinued</li>
<li> i also hate the feel of sticky hair products and feel like in the end my hair usually still falls and then just looks dirty from the product.  </li>

    <li> It is a wonderful product.It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or dry,I will continue to use it.LoVe Love Love!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love!</li>
    <li> I looked for this product all over Atlanta but could not find it.  It is a light mousse that adds just the right amount of body.</li>
    <li> This is the Great really makes your Hair Fuller.</li>
    <li> Fekkai Products are costly, but they are good. I don&#x27;t think the hair spray is, but this was OK. I probably won&#x27;t buy again, but the dealer was prompt with delivery and it arrived in good condition. The cost was comparable to Fekkai merchandise in other stores.</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t  live without it!</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product at first. Using two to three pumps, as the directions specify did absolutely nothing for my hair...it was like I didn&#x27;t use any product at all. And currently, I have pretty short hair. Next time around, I used five or six pumps, and was pleased with the results. Although the mousse is super lightweight, it provided plenty of volume without weighing my hair down or making it super sticky. There are two major down sides to this product, though. First, because I have to use so much of it to achieve decent results, this tiny little bottle (which generally retails for about $22) is not going to last very long at all. It is therefore a huge waste of money. Secondly, this stuff smells NASTY. Fortunately the scent doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair, but when I apply it it smells like grass or something...not exactly a super feminine smell. Bottom line, the product does work if you use enough of it, but there are enough drawbacks to it that I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> It was old and did not have the lids on either both.  Just were taped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the best volumizing products out there for over a decade: In my experience, mousses labeled \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; fall into one of three categories: The first type seems to attempt to add \\&quot;volume\\&quot; by filling your hair with static electricity and fly-aways. The second type adds \\&quot;volume\\&quot; by plumping it up with product, making it seem thicker. The third type doesn&#x27;t actually add anything of substance to the hair, it&#x27;s just a super light formula, which I suppose would be great if you&#x27;re pretty satisfied with the natural texture of your hair and just want to add a light product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.

I&#x27;ve used up like 15% of the bottle already in just a few days just trying (to no avail) to get some sort of texture from it. Definitely won&#x27;t buy again! So far, the best mousse I&#x27;ve tried is Kenra&#x27;s Maximum Hold Volumizing Mousse.</li>
    <li> I love this mousse and it is very hard to find in stores so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.com.  Unfortunately, Amazon.com forgot to included the cap to the bottle when they sent it to me.  I have signed up for auto ship.  I hope they remember to include the cap in future orders.  Hard to travel with a bottle with no cap!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best mousse that my spouse has ever used. This mouse will not cause your hair to ger oily or lumpy.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastic. i&#x27;ve got thin flat hair that, unfortunately, i also like to keep long. i also hate the feel of sticky hair products and feel like in the end my hair usually still falls and then just looks dirty from the product.  not with this product.  it is very lightweight, some have said this is a bad thing but i think its great.  no stickiness, your hair is still light and flowy, but when used right all the sudden you have a ton more volume at the roots.  the key for me has been DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH, or it will not work and your roots will look almost greasy.  i use just 1-2 pumps tops and rub it directly into my roots only.  blow dry upside down and voila, apparently natural healthy volume (for a little natural looking hold too, follow it up with rusk weightless hairspray).  i will say it does have a bit of an intense herb-y smell to it, but doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many items and no other brand hair product works as well to volumize my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that will help give it a lift.  This particular product really didn&#x27;t do anything, and seem to dry my hair out.  Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, just a dab will do ya. But too pricey now. The search for a replacement is on!</li>
    <li> This light mousse gives my fine hair volume.</li>
    <li> This line of products is really good at a fair price for what you get as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and appreciate this light airy type of product that does not&lt;br /&gt;weigh my hair down and has a nice smell to go with&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job in adding body to my styling experience&lt;br /&gt;along with the great shampoo that does not destroy my color in the process</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t believe Fekkai still makes it.  I do not care for the updated &amp;#34;foam mousse product&amp;#34; that is available on Fekkai&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> Love it! Especially on windy days!</li>
    <li> This mousse is light but never fails to give my baby-fine air full volume.  I use it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or build up.  Great product!  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Fekkai is a good brand. My Granddaughter is a stylist. She gave me a different brand that I prefer to use.</li>
    <li> Any other mousse that I have tried leaves my hair crunchy and does nothing for me (regardless of how much or how little I have used).  This mousse is perfect.  I have thin hair but a lot of it and this mousse creates volume at the roots when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all of Fekkai&#x27;s products and this one did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used. It does exactly what it says it will do: gives thin, limp hair great body and volume without stiffness or stickiness. It is also rather expensive, but having tried almost everything else out there without success to cope with the heat and humidity of the Deep South, I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.    Reviewer Amanda&#x27;s negative comments about the mousse indicate that she may have tried it on dry hair and/or used too much product. I find it works best when applied sparingly to clean wet hair -- just blot after shampooing -- that is then blow-styled with a hairdryer (and diffuser attachment) set on low-volume warm. The result: great volume and holding power with no stiffness or stickiness. This product also lets me refresh a &#x27;do easily; I just mist my hair lightly with water and then restyle as desired.    I&#x27;ve just discovered Amazon&#x27;s lower-priced subscription option on this page. Fekkai doesn&#x27;t offer such a discount anywhere else that I know of. This is where and how I&#x27;ll buy this product from now on. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Using this mousse for years. It gives body to my fine hair so that I can style it to stay in place.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is light and the fragrance is not overpowering.  I have been using this for 2 ears.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore! Thanks to the seller, I got it and at a great price! The only issue I had was one of them didn&#x27;t have a top! No big deal but glad it didn&#x27;t leak!</li>
    <li> Was so distressed when this was discontinued. This product gives my thin fine hair the best volume ever. I try a lot of products and always come back to this. One supply is exhausted I will be so sad ....</li>
    <li> I so love the Fakkai product line for hair styling!  This feels so natural in the hair, that I fell instantly in love!  Great hold, easy to use, great feel in the hair!  What else do you need??</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for several years. Makes my hair feel thicker with a lot more volume</li>
    <li> gIVES VOLUME TO HAIR-WORKS VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair. Doesn&#x27;t way down my hair like some mouses. I have been buying for over 4 years now. Love the hairspray too.</li>
    <li> when I first bought this product in a name brand drug store I loved it,  held my hair, gave it bounce and body.  but when I tried to find it again, the drugstore said it had been discontinued so I found it on Amazon coming from a beauty supply company and it just does not seem the same.  Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have fine slightly wavy hair and it really gives me extra bounce and curl.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair. Sorry it is being discontinued</li>
</ol>
