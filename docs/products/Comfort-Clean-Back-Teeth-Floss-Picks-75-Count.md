      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled this came in a pack of like 6 bags -- I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
      <li>But I definitely made the right choice -- the price per items is excellent, and they do a great job.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll bet a lot more people are flossing because of them.</li>
      <li>The latest ones (in the blue bag) are just perfect.</li>
      <li>NOW ABLE TO GET MY SAUSAGE FINGERS INTO MY MOUTH TO FLOSS</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last 3 years and think it is the best way to floss ever made.  </li>
      <li>The front facing angle is much better than what I have seen and used elsewhere</li>
      <li>These are a most ingenius invention.  </li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>When I called their customer hotline, 800-433-6835, and spoke to MIchelle, I had to go through 10 hoops, emails, questions, more questions, call backs, oops</li>
      <li>Glide makes a better product.  </li>
      <li>I bet they are not going to be any better.</li>
      <li>Nothing is better than this product at the moment.</li>
      <li>There is nothing enjoyable about flossing so the faster you can get done with it, the better and these flosses allow you to do just that.    </li>
      <li>For the earlier flosses I would have given a rating of 2 or 3 but these ones are just perfect hence 5/5 for them.</li>
      <li>2 more words</li>
      <li>I subscribed to them :)</li>
      <li>so I was quite pleased to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The perpendicular floss-to-handle of these &amp;#34;back teeth&amp;#34; ones is a better construction.</li>
      <li>Took a lot of trial an error to buy the flossers that weren&#x27;t cheap and glide nicely without shredding.</li>
      <li>The curve is perfect to floss back teeth with ease.</li>
      <li>The nylon floss feels wider, like it removes more plaque.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more like dento-tape not floss</li>
      <li>I bought these because I love the angel.  </li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>and I love the savings and the model.</li>
      <li>will continue to use these until I find a better product, which I hope will be soon...</li>
      <li>I love the design of these picks.  </li>
      <li>Some are better than others but most break</li>
      <li>and it seems to work better.  </li>
      <li>I used these at a friends bbq and fell in love.</li>
      <li>These are great for your back teeth, but also good for front as well :)</li>
      <li>It takes 4 or more just to floss one time.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found these on amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>these help me do it more often.</li>
      <li>But after my dentist told me he was worried I might develop gum disease, I got my butt in gear and have been flossing more often.</li>
      <li>At night, when it&#x27;s time to floss, I just go ahead and grab a handful of these as I know that most are going to break during the process.</li>
      <li>Love Dentek products.  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;easy angle\\&quot; design makes it very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Much easier to use and more apt to use since they are so handy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These floss picks break too easily. When I try to floss my back teeth, it is very easy to reach, very sturdy picks for disposable, but they just SNAP without much force being applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Floss doesn&#x27;t stretch, it just snaps. The pressure I feel when the floss breaks is about the same as the pressure when slicing a knife through warm butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Dentek Easy Angle Floss Picks - those are great. They don&#x27;t break, they reach back teeth. Buy the Easy Angle Pick instead; avoid these Back Teeth Floss Picks, they are unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Good angled shape, easy to reach back teeth&lt;br /&gt;* Sturdy and strong plastic feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;* Unusable fragility of the floss. (6 flossers broke before I decided to return it, 0 teeth were flossed)&lt;br /&gt;* The pick is also fragile, it is good for 1 or 2 teeth before completely bending out of shape.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate development of the flosser!!!  Heck no I&#x27;ll never floss with anything else again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fast and easy to use, I floss after nearly every meal!  I keep these flossers in my backpack, and a few in the car, so I can floss easily in most places in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tape is best!  Right angle is best!  Floss for life, floss for health, easy, fast, often!!!  Buy in bulk and save!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip!  Smear a little toothpaste around your teeth before flossing, and feel the difference!  Soooo good!  The floss tape picks up some toothpaste and cleans even better!</li>
    <li> I mean, I don&#x27;t have horrible teeth, but i also never got braces or anything, so they&#x27;re not perfectly straight either. In any case, one floss pick isn&#x27;t enough, as usually it will break before i can finish my whole mouth. Granted, I bought a 6-pack of 75-count, so i have plenty, so its no big deal. usually i just use one for the top and one for the bottom as even after just finishing one, though its not broken, it will be stretched out a bit and not as useful. Ultimately, if you hate using floss the old fashioned way, this is a quick and easy way to make sure you don&#x27;t ignore your teeth too badly.</li>
    <li> perfect for angles and for those with braces. doesn&#x27;t shred like regular floss haven&#x27;t broken one yet. been excellent product</li>
    <li> Floss picks are the only way I can floss; conventional flossing not only cuts off the circulation in my fingers , but makes it extremely awkward to try to reach back teeth.  This floss is relatively strong and holds up well without breaking if you ease it in gently by moving it back and forth as you insert it between close teeth.  Pleasant minty flavor.</li>
    <li> I love the design of these picks.  If you have trouble reaching teeth, or your hands that don&#x27;t cooperate, these are ideal and much better than conventional floss.  I floss with them after brushing and I have more success.</li>
    <li> The curve is perfect to floss back teeth with ease.</li>
    <li> After using this product for nearly 2 months, I am quite disappointed. Although the design of the floss pick is good, in one flossing session, I find myself using 2 or 3 floss picks because the floss breaks. At first, I thought this was due to my teeth but after using these picks nearly every day for two months, it was apparent that it was just poor construction/design. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar design by this company in the past and really liked them. However after my first try with this batch it is clear their quality standards have changed. The handle flexes far too easily and makes it difficult to get down to the gumline, and that&#x27;s made even harder by the floss coming loose almost instantly. With all picks I&#x27;ve used in the past, one pick suffices for my entire mouth, these seem to typically require 2 or 3. I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> While I like that these are angled, making it easier to reach my back teeth, they aren&#x27;t really designed for tight teeth! When I was finally able to force the floss between my very tight molars, I began bleeding, but then the floss frayed to the point of being unusable after I managed to pry it out. Of course, my teeth are so tight that dental floss usually snaps when I try to pull it out. Frustrating, to be sure, but at least the Dentek picks get me to floss more often!</li>
    <li> Love these little guys. Makes flossing effortless and the nice thing is they&#x27;re recyclable.</li>
    <li> These are a most ingenius invention.  When I floss with regular dental floss, there are some areas that are difficult to get to.  These picks make it easy.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing but these make it bearable.  If these didn&#x27;t exist, I would never floss my teeth.  Makes it much easier.</li>
    <li> Floss is too loose and stretches too much. Worse than using your fingers with regular floss.</li>
    <li> These floss sticks are easy to use even for my children as young as 8 yrs. old.  No having to tear off yards of floss string, making it easier to use and dispose. Amazon usually has a better price than in the stores, too.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I love the angel.  It&#x27;s hard to find the right angel flossers.  I have a small mouth and my teeth are very tight.  These flossers are not good for tight spaces.  On a good day, I can floss my entire mouth only using 3.  More often than not, I end up using 5-10 because they constantly break.</li>
    <li> These do not work on tight back teeth. My teeth are very tight; glide satin floss doesn&#x27;t work on them. Even the dental assistant has a hard time flossing my teeth. That said, this product completley shreded in my teeth. it took me 5 minutes to get out the shreds. If you have tight teeth, do not buy this. I returned the package.</li>
    <li> Figured out what? Make a thread of uniform thickness. Yes, that was a constant problem I had with the earlier easy angle floss picks. I&#x27;ve been using this since mid 2006 so I&#x27;ve pretty much seen it all and there&#x27;s hardly ever a day I don&#x27;t floss. The latest ones (in the blue bag) are just perfect. I finished the first bag just yesterday and I had barely 2 flosses that shred. This was a regular problem with the older ones (the purple bag). The other problem was the varying thickness of the thread itself. Sometimes they were a little too thick (which made it extremely difficult to floss between the 2 bridges in my mouth because I would feel scared that it might almost take the bridge out) and sometimes they were a little too thin. But with these newest ones I&#x27;ve not had this problem even once. The other problem with the older flosses was that they would quite easily rip. There had been nights when I went through 3-5 flosses because of how poorly they were made. In between they were even giving 90 instead of 75 and those were the very worse...kinda explained why they were giving those extra 15.    But irrespective of how bad these flosses were in the past, I continued using them since truth be told...I&#x27;d much rather use these than not floss at all. There is nothing enjoyable about flossing so the faster you can get done with it, the better and these flosses allow you to do just that.    For the earlier flosses I would have given a rating of 2 or 3 but these ones are just perfect hence 5/5 for them.</li>
    <li> I once tried this product from Walgreen. Then I found it much cheaper here. I really like the design of this product,especially the angle. It makes flossing much easier than ever. I will keep using this brand and would recommend anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item here hoping these DenTek picks would be the same as available in the drug stores, but unfortunately they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, so far I have opened only 3 of the 6 bags, but the first bag I opened had an oily, slimy substance over all the picks. I had to throw that bag away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the picks I&#x27;ve actually been able to use, however, they are too poorly made to be worth purchasing again. The floss itself stretches out and breaks off the pick instead of being strong enough to actually floss between my teeth. And the pick end of the plastic is so flimsy it bends and warps instead of being useful as a toothpick. Also, the shape is less well designed than the drugstore version of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this item, and will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> As we are training my 3-year old daughter about the importance or oral hygiene, we carry a pack of these picks in each of our cars, my wife&#x27;s purse and at my desk at work.  No excuses.  These are my favorite picks because the floss is waxed so it moves easily between teeth.  The pick side is also textured to remove stubborn stains.  I have a subscription to this item and I love the savings and the model.</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps my back teeth cleaner than any other floss pick. Very durable although it may snap sometimes. Still the price gives a better value than the more expensive picks that break sometimes as well. Mint flavor is subtle so I deal with it even though I hate mint flavor. Good Buy!</li>
    <li> The floss is good, but it seems about 1 in 5 of them break before I am done flossing my teeth. They also seem really sharp compared to other floss I have used. Other than that, I am used to them now and they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Dentek really needs to work on their quality control. These things are cheaply made and break easily. At night, when it&#x27;s time to floss, I just go ahead and grab a handful of these as I know that most are going to break during the process. It typically takes 5-9 of them to successfully floss my teeth. Ironically, they always break when I&#x27;m flossing my back teeth, i.e. exactly what they are designed to do. A few times I&#x27;ve even had them shred, leaving pieces of the floss between my teeth at the gums that I must now use another 5 or so to remove the excess floss material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s not just one bag that is bad. I&#x27;ve gone through 3-4 bags of this 6-pack, and they are all just as cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my wisdom teeth taken out, so I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are abnormally close together. Thus, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m the problem in this relationship.</li>
    <li> I feel guilty about the excess waste inherent with dental floss picks, but they make sure I actually floss, so they are worth it to me.  These are the only ones that work for me because of the curved shape.  So easy to get all the way to my back teeth with these.  No other pick shape allows me to floss so easily!  in the end they are worth the extra expense, because I use them.  Cheap floss or picks don&#x27;t do me any good sitting in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I am wondering if these have a shelf life or if they have been stored in extreme heat or if I just got a bad batch?? I usually purchase DenTek Easy Angle Floss Picks from a drug store and have had no problems with them but the ones I purchased from Amazon break the first time they are used which makes them worthless? I wish Amazon would add the feature of contacting the seller so I could try and find out what has happened to this product or at least be able to let the seller know of the problem.[[ASIN:B002WTCK1E DenTek Easy Angle Floss Picks 75-count,   (Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> I order this product on routine basis. It is the best dental picks that I have found for my teeth and I receive great reviews at my routine cleanings. Product delivered on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about five years now. I love these, so easy to floss now. My hygienist has made comments and my cleanings go quicker</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it  was not the same of DenTek comfort Clean. Thanks for the ability that I can use these as well as DenTek Comfort clean. It made it very worth while</li>
    <li> Easy flossing with these little things.</li>
    <li> the angle makes it very convenient -- the reason i did not give this a 5 star is because it is difficult to open the bag with wet hands (which is mostly the case when you are brushing and flossing)</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY floss i use because it really gets in the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and won&#x27;t hurt or cut your gums but at the same time it is tough in getting all the food out.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  I hope they won&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They make getting to hard to reach back teeth so much easier plus they are sturdy yet easy to get in between tight teeth which has always been my issue with floss.</li>
    <li> The only way to floss!!</li>
    <li> These are the most confortable toothpicks ive used, i went and got them online because they stop selling it in my local pharmacy .</li>
    <li> Agree with many of the other reiviews.  It is more easily broken than I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;ve learned to \\&quot;see saw\\&quot; it between the tight teeth and it seems to work better.  Sometimes have to use two to get all the teeth flossed, but it beats pulling out long string and wasting it.  For me their older version that wasn&#x27;t angled was better for getting between the teeth, but then again, the string did fray more easily.</li>
    <li> For me, these are the best flossers around. The floss is the strong, flat one that fits between tight teeth and the curve in the handle lets me reach all the way to the back teeth. And instead of sorting through all the brands and options at the drugstore, I just click the button at Amazon and they get delivered at a competitive price.</li>
    <li> These pics are not up to par.  They are not effective and hurt your hand.  Glide pics are far superior.</li>
    <li> I really like these. I have a small mouth, but also small teeth. Only a few of my teeth are incredibly tight. I like that these are angled so I don&#x27;t have to mess with opening my mouth super wide and sticking my whole hand in. I am, shamefully, really bad about flossing my teeth. But after my dentist told me he was worried I might develop gum disease, I got my butt in gear and have been flossing more often. I don&#x27;t know why, but these help me do it more often. Something mental about not having to hold the floss myself I guess. I haven&#x27;t had problems with breakage so far. I am happy with these and will continue to purchase them.</li>
    <li> They shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to sell this product.  The floss breaks easily, and it doesn&#x27;t break when using anyone else&#x27;s brand.  A useless, inferior product - a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers I&#x27;ve ever used. I floss everyday, but I don&#x27;t think I would be doing so if I had to wrap a string of floss around my fingers.    These flossers are much more convenient, and they give you fine control to clean your teeth.  The \\&quot;easy angle\\&quot; design makes it very comfortable.  This is the best tool for the job!</li>
    <li> These are advertised as being for tight teeth. I have tight teeth, and they frequently get stuck in my teeth. A couple of times I&#x27;ve had to reach in with scissors (carefully) and cut the cord just so I could get the floss pick out.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve somehow changed the product, as the older pack I had did not have this problem (but they also weren&#x27;t angled or infused with flouride and mint like these). If you have tight teeth like me, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I just got these and and have used a good number of them already. Amazon was pretty prompt in shipping the order.&lt;br /&gt;Like many people, I can&#x27;t use rolled floss and have been using the Y shaped (green and white)floss picks for several years. Well, these are a very cheap imitation of those. The body of the pick is so flimsy you have to grip it so close to the top of the [Y] curve, which can be uncomfortable when cleaning in between your back teeth. The floss itself is somewhat OK, but does break when cleaning in between tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are not as bad as how other users put them out to be, but there is a huge room for improvement. Having used the green &amp; white floss picks (also made by Dentek, but are no longer available anywhere), using these feels like downgrading from a Lexus to a 10 year old Ford.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these until I find a better product, which I hope will be soon...</li>
    <li> These are great for molars.  I have other ones for the front teeth as well, but I had never really had problems with those. These make it so easy to floss in the back. Will definitely buy again when I run out.. which will probably be a while.  Great bulk deal.</li>
    <li> Have trouble finding these in the stores. Like the tip and the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s more like dento-tape not floss so it doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Simply put, the floss breaks way too easily.  If you have to push even a little bit to fit the floss between your teeth chances are it pulls out from one side of the pick.  Other than that huge flaw, they work like they should.  The sharp end is great and the minty taste is good as well.  I would look elsewhere though before buying these again or recommending them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, I use it on both young kids (7yo and 10yo) who need help with flossing the very back teeth which are close together. This is a Y design different from other P shaped picks, this is much easier for me as a parent to help with flossing as I don&#x27;t feel the need to put my hand in their little mouths--the shape is perfect for quick and effective flossing. Saved my life as a parent of 2 kids!</li>
    <li> Always needed.  can not always find in stores.</li>
    <li> Only design that has the correct angles to easily reach your back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss is right thickness for tightly spaced teeth.</li>
    <li> What I don&#x27;t like about these is that the &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; end (plastic pointed end) breaks off&lt;br /&gt;very easily and quickly and the very small piece ends up stuck between your teeth or inside your&lt;br /&gt;mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put; They don&#x27;t last long if you use the pick end.</li>
    <li> I like the floss picks but was only shipped one resealable package of 75 picks out of the lot of six offered for $19.47 .&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago I sent a message to Amazon.com about the deficiency and ,as of today, have not received a reply.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to do next.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this specific shape of toothpick. its very effective. i dont care about the different shapes of these kind of picks, but he says they are way more effective and comfortable than the others</li>
    <li> These really are the best. They glide between teeth very easily and don&#x27;t break very often.  These are the only flossers I will use.</li>
    <li> These are the only picks that work for me.  I am a big guy, and my hands wont fit far back enough in my mouth to reach the molars.  So, I need the extra reach these guys provide. Also, others commented about the floss breaking.  I have had it happen, maybe its one out of every twenty, sometimes I&#x27;ll hit 4 or 5 that break in a row.  Whatever, I am not gonna cry cause a $0.05 floss pick broke.  Anyhow, I bought these from Amazon cause I am getting tired of chasing em down when they are out of stock at local retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy pick&#x27;n people.</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;ve used Dentek floss products before with no issues at all. I purchased the Back Teeth version and what a huge mistake. As I was flossing, it got stuck in between my molars. Other flosses would usually snap when stuck between tight teeth but this sucker is made out of adantanium or some godly material that it refuse to budge. The odd handle also made it awkward to grip. As I try to pull it out, it took out my filling! What a horrible product. Do not waste your money on this. I will never buy another Dentek product again.</li>
    <li> There are two DenTek flossers in a purple bag.  One works great, the others are flimsy and break often.  The one with the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; font on the front is the one to avoid.  The other ones are fabulous.  Would have given 5 stars, but I got the flimsy ones first time.</li>
    <li> Simply enough I am not dextrous nor deft with floss and my dental hygienist recommend I look for these. To floss regularly I need these or the like so I was quite pleased to find them on Amazon. The shape allows me to reach all of my teeth without hurting my fingers and the wide tape floss is much kinder and sturdier than thinner varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, nothing else will do. I subscribed to them :)</li>
    <li> These are flimsy, hard to operate and they can actually break while you are flossing. Pay the extra money for the pro-health from crest.</li>
    <li> I bought some of these a good while back and liked them. When I ran out I bought this one thinking it was the same. They are but they aren&#x27;t. The new ones are more brittle instead of flexible and the new ones have small ridges on each side of the tips. The news ones tip because they are more brittle break off in your mouth easily and one could unknowingly swallow them which could cause major health issues. I also don&#x27;t like the rough edges on the tips.</li>
    <li> Fulfills needs perfectly! Nothing is better than this product at the moment. Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
    <li> worse batch I got shreds first time you use it or comes apart at one end poor quality and made in China. Went through one bag in 2 days do to this crap.  The other bags didn&#x27;t last much longer I have 2 bags left I bet they are not going to be any better. I noticed from recent order those were starting to go bad fast or come apart this shipment worse</li>
    <li> First, its got a flat ribbon-like piece of floss instead of a more rounded one. Not sure if that good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;The floss string starts splitting up after you have flossed between 3 to 4 teeth, so sometimes it feels you need 2 or 3 picks to finish the entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The floss string starts to sag petty fast, so that its no longer tightly strung.&lt;br /&gt;over-all not a great choice. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great. They use the dental tape instead of the floss so it doesn&#x27;t break apart or fray like the floss.</li>
    <li> I have tight back teeth and all other flosses either get stuck or break.  This is the best I have used.  Easy to use with one hand.  i pack these with me everywhere.</li>
    <li> I like these much better than regular floss, much easier to get to the back teeth.</li>
    <li> These are our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; picks - none other works this well.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews about half a dozen of these kinds of products, and it was frankly way too much time to spend on something so trivial. Also, compared to dental floss, I wondered if I was spending way too much. But I definitely made the right choice -- the price per items is excellent, and they do a great job. SO much simpler than floss, and it&#x27;s got the toothpick end, which you often need. Solid, well made. The toothpick part at the end is bumpy, the first time I&#x27;ve seen it. Really makes a difference. I&#x27;m thrilled this came in a pack of like 6 bags -- I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about a year now. Full disclosure: I used to have pretty terrible dental habits. I would often brush only in the morning and not before bed. I rarely flossed. It was always fun to go to the dentist and have the age old &amp;#34;How often do you floss?&amp;#34; conversation. &amp;#34;Oh, a few times a week.&amp;#34; As if the hygienist couldn&#x27;t tell from my slightly bleeding gums that I only flossed when there was something between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I started Invisalign clear braces at the beginning of 2014. They are great because you take them out when you eat, so you can eat whatever you want. However, you have to brush and floss before putting them back in otherwise they are basically incubators for acid, bacteria and cavities on your teeth. So I basically had to overhaul my dental habits. You can only have the aligner trays off your teeth for about two hours a day. So if I&#x27;m at a restaurant, I have to go to the bathroom after dinner and brush/floss. This makes speed/ease a priority, as I don&#x27;t want to have people waiting for the weird guy brushing his teeth in the public bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the floss picks are a lot easier and quicker to use than regular floss. I&#x27;m a big guy (6&#x27;3&amp;#34;) and have big hands, so I always found regular floss difficult to fit in my mouth. These make it much easier. You can do it one handed and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Does a good job cleaning (according to my dentist at least) if you follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;-Small and easy to carry in a pocket&lt;br /&gt;-Resealable pouch keeps the dust out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;-Slide pretty easily between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I would say I break the floss on about 2 out of every 10 picks and usually on the first tooth. I have crowded teeth (hence the Invisalign), so it can be a tight fit. But honestly, I think some are just poorly made. This can be really frustrating if I&#x27;m away from home and I only have one in my pocket. Once that isbroken: no flossing for me.&lt;br /&gt;-The &amp;#34;pick&amp;#34; function of this is not great. It is somewhat flexible which makes it pretty ineffective. Not like a wooden pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going with four stars because I agree with other reviewers that they are somewhat cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 3 years and think it is the best way to floss ever made.  For some reason this specific design is no longer at any of my local stores.  Yeah!! Amazon you have it and lots of it at a fabulous price !!</li>
    <li> This is the only type of floss I find pleasing and comforting to floss.  Strong enough to endure tight space, yet comfortable enough it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gum.</li>
    <li> Since I have started using these, my periodontist and dentist have told me I am doing a great job.  They slide between the teeth fairly easily, and are long enough to reach between and behind wisdom teeth.</li>
    <li> Good item, great price.</li>
    <li> My husband and I cannot live without it now LOL</li>
    <li> My dental tech recommended these and I&#x27;ve been a big fan.  They are a bit too thick to easily go between two fillings.  Much quicker, easier, and cleaner than floss.</li>
    <li> So the local Target stopped carrying these - the only brand of flosser my dental hygeine obsessed parter will use - and my first thought was of course... check amazon. And here it is and they arrived great, and cheaper than at a retail store. They&#x27;re still the perfect flossers.</li>
    <li> These are great to carry with you for use at any time.</li>
    <li> These floss picks are so great.  My kids had so much trouble flossing with their fingers (as did I in their tiny mouths) and the kind where you replace the floss were tedious, so I was glad when I found these.  They make flossing a breeze now.</li>
    <li> These are great for people who have trouble reaching their back teeth with dental floss and really convenient  for everyone.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> These flossers are strong enough for tight and back teeth. They have a slight mint taste and travel well. Use them every day.</li>
    <li> These use the ribbon-style floss but still rely on friction fit to keep the floss from slipping out of the holder - it doesn&#x27;t work.  It took us 3-6 picks to floss each time.  If you have gaps between all your teeth, I think these might work OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones I find work very well are the Kroger store brand \\&quot;Fine Flossers.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great for front &amp; back teeth, especially for tight teeth</li>
    <li> Best dental floss, cant use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I am a stroke survivor and suffer from partial paralysis on my left side and cannot use regular floss due to only being able to use one hand, so these are extremely handy and allow me to maintain my pearly whites as I should with no problem reaching those troublesome back teeth!</li>
    <li> Exactly what he buys (although sometimes cannot find) at the local drugstore, but are cheaper here.  He has trouble using the other flat kind of flosser and finds this angled one much to his liking.</li>
    <li> I have tight spacing between my teeth also and this product DOES NOT do the job. The pick is fine and the packaging states that the floss is waxed. REALLY? Will not be buying this product again. Back to CVS for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased these after trying one from my dental office, and liked that the angle makes it easier to reach the back of my mouth. HOWEVER, these things are so cheap and break so easily I have to use 4 just to do my entire mouth!  Whenever I try flossing in one of my tight spaces between teeth, it&#x27;s guaranteed to break the string off. I thought these would be so good to use in the car at lights one-handed (flossing without thinking!) but now I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking. And using up these stupid things, since I now own 500.</li>
    <li> These are a great idea as the ones I had before also had the triangle type tip &amp; now this one with the curved piece for flossing which does make it easier to get at those back molars. But the way the floss is attached could be stronger as it seems to pull out of one side or loosen into a V shape fairly easy, so that could have been better.</li>
    <li> the right angle pick makes this product easier to use and perfect for travel.  unlike some other brands i&#x27;ve tried, this one glides smoothly between teeth without ripping or snagging.  i will definitely be buying more when i run out.</li>
    <li> NOW ABLE TO GET MY SAUSAGE FINGERS INTO MY MOUTH TO FLOSS THOSE BACK TEETH WHERE EVERYTHING TRIES TO HIDE.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS WELL ON ALL TEETH. ONE CON: FLOSS DOES NOT STAY AS TIGHT AS I WOULD LIKE.</li>
    <li> The angle is a little better for back teeth, but the floss comes loose right away -  making them practically impossible to use.</li>
    <li> The curved Floss pic is key for me. A handheld flosser is much better for me than the two handed old fashioned floss. I am not sure what is the correct thickness of floss though, but this seem to be fine enough.</li>
    <li> The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end breaks off in between your teeth within seconds, absolute garbage. The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
    <li> I like the right angle feature of the floss holding end of the pick. I have been using these for over 5 years, and these are the best I have found but some packages have production flaws like the floride coating on the floss has crystalized. I use a finger nail to remove the crystals before I floss and no problems. Also, I have gone through 25 or so packages of these picks and one package about half of the flossers had a defect where the floss attaches to the pick, and the floss would seperate from the pick with little pressure, rendereing the pick worthless. Flossing is an essential part of good oral health, and this product works for me.</li>
    <li> These make flossing so much easier. The front facing angle is much better than what I have seen and used elsewhere</li>
    <li> The floss in this flosser does not stay tight.  After one or two flosses, the floss stretches and becomes floppy.  This is the first time I am using this kind of product.  Before I bought the string and wrapped it around my fingers, but now I wanted the convenience.  I don&#x27;t know if there are flossers that will stay taut, but as for the dentek flossers,  I am going to call the amazon and see if they will take back the unopened bags.</li>
    <li> The floss breaks too easily.  I need to use at least 3 each time i floss.  The worst floss picks I have used.</li>
    <li> Great product; Great Price.</li>
    <li> It was first time I tried this floss and  just used  1/5 of the package.  At first I found this floss was not strong enough and sometime it broke off.  Today I used it again just like normal day, When I put the floss in my back teeth, I didn&#x27;t pay attention of the side of the plastic was so sharp, it cut my side of inner mouth.  I  bleeded so much to a point I had to put some crushed ice in my mouth to slow and stop the bleeding.  I have used other brands and was very satisfied.  The quality of this product is not good and will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great for on-the-go flossing.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I have bought defective DenTek products. When I called their customer hotline, 800-433-6835, and spoke to MIchelle, I had to go through 10 hoops, emails, questions, more questions, call backs, oops I forgot this, oh, and that.....then they sent me the wrong replacement product. After all that they wanted be to go through the hassle to send them back the wrong product sent me. I will be happy to spend my money on a company that cares for its customers, not a big corporation.  Oh, the plastic tips were breaking off, a serious swallow hazard for kids. Maybe I should have called 1-800-Lundy-Law.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it would be. Not great to use-can&#x27;t recommend it. Glide makes a better product.  2 more words</li>
    <li> I have to use two or three each time I floss.  They break, stretch and are overall flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are the best type of floss picks in my opinion, because their design provides the easiest handle for my wrists and fingers. I don&#x27;t like the regular ones where the floss is parallel to the handle. I think that those are very awkward to hold. The perpendicular floss-to-handle of these &amp;#34;back teeth&amp;#34; ones is a better construction. And I don&#x27;t just use them on my back teeth--I use them on all of my teeth. And they certainly work well, given the commendations my dentists have given me over the years and the length of my yearly checkups, which is usually around 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I like the ones in the green package better for tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Best dental picks on market.  Hard to find.  I carry them wherever I go and floss after each meal/snack.  Great for keeping gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Theses are hard to find in stores. There are similar ones, but those are usually the flat ones. I have a small mouth and it&#x27;s difficult to get regular floss all the way to the back teeth, these do the trick!</li>
    <li> So easy to use, maybe the dentist will compliment my flossing habits now :)  The pack of 6 also means we&#x27;re not going to run out for quite a while!</li>
    <li> It needs to be flat.  Other floss picks I have used in the past are flat and it makes it easier to use and also easier to carry around.</li>
    <li> Bought these to encourage our kids to floss.  Yes, they work well for that purpose but NOTHING comes close to Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss.  I reviewed that product as well.  So for grown-ups who have teeth that are NOT too close together I&#x27;d recommend Clean Burst.  [[ASIN:B005C4WQS8 Reach Clean Burst Dental Floss, Waxed,  Cleanburst, 55 Yard  (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really for our family just serve the purpose to get young ones to floss</li>
    <li> It is hard to find flossers that do not shred or break.....This one WORKS.  And the angle is a good one. I am a dental hygienist and know how important  flossing is. This mets the specs.</li>
    <li> Gotta keep the gums clear of food!</li>
    <li> Whose idea was it to make the HANDLE of the flosser SHARP? Probably the same guy who couldn&#x27;t manage to keep the floss attached to the flosser. Horrible design. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> I love these flossers, and you cannot beat the Amazon price! (and the fact that certain other stores never have them in stock).&lt;br /&gt;A few of them do shread from each pack, but overall I find them to be the best flossers for my teeth.</li>
    <li> One of the bags I received was not the comfort clean back teeth, but the Comfort Clean Floss Picks.  I haven&#x27;t checked all the bags yet, and the others are okay, but I prefer and ordered the back teeth type.  Color me disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product was very helpful in flossing of back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It helped me maintain a daily plan of dental health.</li>
    <li> Save your teeth. Dentist don&#x27;t like these but I&#x27;ll bet a lot more people are flossing because of them. You can even floss while driving.</li>
    <li> We have used these for years.  Love that they don&#x27;t break as easily as some other brands.  Much easier to use and more apt to use since they are so handy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any floss other than the Back Teeth products from DenTek. I sitll have all of my wisdom teeth, and it is nearly impossible to floss accurately in the corners of my mouth. These floss picks make it a trivial process. I have yet to have these shred or break yet as well, which is pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> Some are better than others but most break and you&#x27;ll be using 2 or 3 to floss all of your teeth.</li>
    <li> I like these the best of the disposable floss and toothpicks.</li>
    <li> I used these at a friends bbq and fell in love. The string is strong enough to go in between my tight teeth and smooth enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums. These are great for your back teeth, but also good for front as well :)</li>
    <li> The sharp end used to clean between the teeth is too flimsy to clear any trapped food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the floss part is good!</li>
    <li> These are awful.  The break instantly.  It takes 4 or more just to floss one time. This is the worst product I have bought in a very long time.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found these on amazon.com.  I had been looking all over for them and could not find this particular style.  I use these faithfully and am very pleased with how they work.</li>
    <li> Love Dentek products.  Makes flossing easy.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this 6 pack. They&#x27;re excellent for what they are and have a much better design than most disposable flossers. My husband loves them, and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase them in bulk through amazon for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, regular floss will be better for people with teeth that are very close together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree wholeheartedly with reviewer C. Stokes. With those tight, back teeth there are two options. I can quickly, forcefully snap the flosser down, which is painful and frequently breaks the floss or leaves it frayed. The second option is to slowly wiggle the flosser down, but then it is totally stretched out, and I have to do the other side with a new flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still buying these for my husband though! They work perfectly on his teeth, and he loves their convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Now with amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; program, I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out of these. A definite plus!</li>
    <li> I like the wider nylon floss and the angle these give for my back teeth. The nylon floss feels wider, like it removes more plaque.</li>
    <li> Took a lot of trial an error to buy the flossers that weren&#x27;t cheap and glide nicely without shredding. Love these! And yes, they shred sometimes, but work well for the most part!</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I now use.  I never leave home without a couple in my makeup bag! The curved arch is a great improvement over the flat designs!</li>
    <li> Very strong and thin floss.</li>
    <li> Picks teeth, works as intended.</li>
