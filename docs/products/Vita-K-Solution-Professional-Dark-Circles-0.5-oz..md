      <li>This product really works!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using VitaK for many years, and really found it effective in greatly reducing dark circles if used regulaly.  </li>
      <li>I hope you all find a very good dark circle cream</li>
      <li>Try it - it&#x27;s not expensive, and it may work better for you.</li>
      <li>When I read the reviews of this product, I got really excited.</li>
      <li>Your eyes are worth it!</li>
      <li>There has been significant improvement.</li>
      <li>Please note this product hasn&#x27;t completely cured my under eye problems, but it sure has made them better.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to use it consistently morning and night with what I would consider, good results so far.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always been good about following instructions to the letter.  </li>
      <li>- Takes awhile to get full effects  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product; mostly because of some of the product reviews and the price.</li>
      <li>Works so much better than the high priced products.</li>
      <li>You get results from the very first application as advertised.</li>
      <li>After it dries, use a good face lotion, as it can dry out your skin.    </li>
      <li>This is first time in my life I will let people see me with out \\&quot;pancake concealer\\&quot; on!</li>
      <li>I will keep using it until the bottle runs out maybe it takes longer for some people, but for 10 bucks it was worth the try.</li>
      <li>it wasnt worth the price or the wierd side effect.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think any product on the market will COMPLETELY cure under eye problems, but this one makes them a lot better.</li>
      <li>Oh well, for the price it  was worth a try.</li>
      <li>The stuff also looked gross (kind of like...sperm..) and BURNED my eyes a bit, to the point they watered (and prob washed some stuff away).</li>
      <li>Even after a week of using the product, I&#x27;ve noticed significant improvement, and hopefully it will only get better with time.</li>
      <li>It slightly lightened the dark circles, but even more, it keeps skin very nicely hydrated, soaks in very quick and leaves no sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>But, after the first 2 uses, the burn stopped.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfect but it works the best for me.</li>
      <li>and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I am now done with my first bottle and will re-order.</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work!</li>
      <li>And sure enough, it is.   </li>
      <li>It took about a month of using twice daily to notice the difference but my eye area looks a lot better.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this product and plan on buying it again once my bottle runs out.</li>
      <li>For the price you really should give this one a try if you are still looking for a good product to diminish your dark circles.</li>
      <li>Most of these beauty cremes and stuff are all just a waste of money,but i would highly recommend this one to a friend &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Started using the product about two weeks ago haven&#x27;t notices any difference as of yet but will use it until it&#x27;s done to see if I got any positive results</li>
      <li>nice product but did not change any dark circles.</li>
      <li>Quite effective within the first few days.</li>
      <li>- Makeup can easily be applied on top (but only when product is dry and you&#x27;ve used lotion!)  </li>
      <li>I have very pronounced pinky-purple undereye circles which I think are genetic.</li>
      <li>and like I said, I probably didnt use it as much as they instructed.    </li>
      <li>I still have to use concealer, but not as much as I used to.</li>
      <li>I have to wait &amp; see if it really works, to soon to tell.</li>
      <li>After doing what the instructions said, and really TRYING to see results, there just weren&#x27;t ANY at all.  </li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I used this one night and it made my eyes really water even though I did not get any in my eye.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> do lighten eyes but may dry them out.  I think they dried out the area around my eyes and then I got more wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Seriously, guys if you have very serious dark circles do you really think the diminisher would be this cheap.I have the most horrible dark circles theyre almost black and i tried everything so i decided this wouldnt hurt.I spent about 15$ on this crap and its absolutely pointless.Im trying to get hylexin beauty samples .Im trying things out before I spend my money on it.I hope you all find a very good dark circle cream but this isnt it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed with Vita-K. As a male in my early thirties, I started to develop dark circles, almost a blotchy darker tone under my eyes, along with subtle under-eye bags. Don&#x27;t be deceived by the cost and cheap packaging of Vita-K, this stuff actually works! And instantly! Even after a week of using the product, I&#x27;ve noticed significant improvement, and hopefully it will only get better with time.</li>
    <li> I have only being using this stuff for bout a month, but being pregnant my baby was taking all my nutrients away. I of course had lack of sleep and even began getting really dark circles from it. Im only 28 so i should not have this yet, so i started using this stuff and it has ligtened up extremly! I took pictures of before and after, the after i just took 3 days ago and it has made a difference and i am very satisfied with that. Most of these beauty cremes and stuff are all just a waste of money,but i would highly recommend this one to a friend &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> After reading the mixed reviews on this product, I was on the fence about trying it. I found it on sale at my local Rite Aid, so I decided to try it. I&#x27;m really glad I did! I&#x27;m in my mid-20s but have had pretty bad dark circles and puffiness under my eyes since I was a kid. I think mine are largely due to genetics, but allergies and lack of sleep definitely makes them worse.     This product seems to help a little when you first start using it, but its full benefits definitely build over time. You won&#x27;t wake up one day and be cured. It&#x27;s much more gradual and you may not notice it right away. I have been using it about two months now. It has reduced both my dark circles and puffy eye bags. When I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, it isn&#x27;t as evident. Please note this product hasn&#x27;t completely cured my under eye problems, but it sure has made them better. I still have to use concealer, but not as much as I used to. Before I couldn&#x27;t even cover them completely with concealer! I like the tight feeling it gives me while it is drying. Be sure you use after you wash your face and before you use any other products on your face. After it dries, use a good face lotion, as it can dry out your skin.    Pros:  - It works better than any similar product I have tried  - It has noticeably reduced both my puffiness and dark circles  - The little bottle seems to last a long time  - No smell  - Easy to use  - Has a nice tightening sensation  - Makeup can easily be applied on top (but only when product is dry and you&#x27;ve used lotion!)  - Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause skin irritation or clog pores    Cons:  - Does not completely cure under eye problems  - Must use lotion or your skin will dry out  - Can burn if you get it too close to your eyes  - If you use too much at a time or without lotion, it will turn into a film that flakes off  - Takes awhile to get full effects  - You MUST use twice a day  - A tad expensive, especially considering you must keep using it to keep the benefits  - Can take a coupleof minutes to fully dry   - Bottle can sometimes shoot the product out much faster than you want    Overall, I love this product and plan on buying it again once my bottle runs out. Judging by the other responses, it seems to work for some people and not as much for other. I recommend giving it a try. Be sure to give it some time to work, and you must follow the directions. Also be realistic about what you expect as far as results go. I definitely notice a huge improvement, but I still have under eye dark circles. I don&#x27;t think any product on the market will COMPLETELY cure under eye problems, but this one makes them a lot better.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me, and you can&#x27;t use it anyway because it leaves a visible white film under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong I really like this stuff. I only bought it though because at the time couldn&#x27;t find the regular Vita-K. I feel that the regular version works better, also I like the lack of pump in the regular Vita-K. This professional bottle is smaller and comes with a pump that makes getting that last little bit a challenge.</li>
    <li> I have dark under eye circles hereditary they are kind of purplish. I have been using this cream for 4 weeks and the only thing i have noticed is the skin under my eyes is firmer but the circles have not gotten any better, not even a little bit.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have found for getting rid of dark circles.  I had very dark circles under my eyes and I used this product and they have lightened to almost gone.  People tell me how good I look.  Great stuff.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used it twice daily, every day for a solid 6 weeks and my dark circles still greeted me each morning when I looked in the mirror. Oh well, on to the next product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some purple colored circles under my eyes for a while now so I tried this. I was especially skeptical when the product itself says that you can see a noticeable difference after the first application. Sounds too good to be true. And sure enough, it is.   I&#x27;ve been using it for probably near/around a month and have not noticed a single difference in the colored circles under my eyes. The only thing it&#x27;s done is create a firmer area of skin under the eyes, but that hasn&#x27;t helped the circles (and it also seems to only be temporary) so to me, this is worthless.  EDIT: I also would like to state that even the packaging is deceiving. The dark circled eye vs the non-dark circled eye is so obviously doctored that even a kid could tell that photoshop had done the trick. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product according to instructions, two and sometimes three times daily, for six weeks -- which should be long enough for a product that promises fast results. When I started, I had dark circles, and the usual amount of under-eye wrinkles.  After six weeks, I have dark circles -- no difference visible even with 10x magnification mirror.  If anything undereye wrinkles are slightly increased, probably because this product has a drying effect.  I consider this a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for almost 5 weeks and I cant say that I have noticed any results. I will keep using it until the bottle runs out maybe it takes longer for some people, but for 10 bucks it was worth the try.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything for my dark circles and I keep coming back to the vita k. It&#x27;s not perfect but it works the best for me. For the price you really should give this one a try if you are still looking for a good product to diminish your dark circles. Works so much better than the high priced products.</li>
    <li> What a real let down this was. I used it for 3 months and the only thing I can say it did was make my eyes sting and tear up. Might be better off buying something else. Try at your own risk. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all was verry Unsatisfied with this product wouldn&#x27;t recomend to anyone waste of money and time !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this produt for a few weeks and I really like it. I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have had dark circles ever since I was a kid, I haven&#x27;t been using it day and night only when I remember and I have noticed a differece... The only down is the pump, it shoots out far so now I just use it without the pump.</li>
    <li> i used this product as directed and it did not work at all.. i read other reviews and thought id give it a try but its definetly not worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I was born with dark circles under my eyes. I became self-concious about them in the fourth grade. I tried using this stuff when I was in my mid-teens and I&#x27;ve always been good about following instructions to the letter.  After doing what the instructions said, and really TRYING to see results, there just weren&#x27;t ANY at all.  I&#x27;m 28 years old now and I&#x27;m still searching for something that will work. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for couple weeks now and to be honest - I don&#x27;t see the difference. I&#x27;m really hoping, that the effect shows within months, so I just keep using it, impressed by some of the reviewers.</li>
    <li> This gives a shiny glimmer to the area where it was applied--almost like I put egg whites under my eyes and let it dry. And, it burned. But, after the first 2 uses, the burn stopped. I have to use this for a few more wks to see if it helps. My darkness is milder and due to having severe allergy/sinus issues.</li>
    <li> pump doesn&#x27;t work. burns eyes. and gets crusty around eyes when it dries. watery and somehow makes eyes water even when i tried to avoid getting close to my eyes. haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference. maybe a little bit</li>
    <li> Well in all honesty, I didnt use this product as instructed (twice a day... i thnk), but I did like the way it felt.  It has a tightening feeling to it.  Dont really think it helped with the darkness, but not sure if anything can and like I said, I probably didnt use it as much as they instructed.    A little bit goes a loooooog way though.  I might try it again.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles since I was a child and I think they are genetic. I have tried so many products to cure or cover them up but nothing works as well as this! The directions say to use it twice a day, but I do not use it in the morning because it messes up my makeup (still have to wear concealer under my eyes but no big deal). besides the makeup issue, my other complaint is that it really stings when i put it on at night, but it stops within a few seconds. the irritation feeling does not leave any puffiness or red marks. but i do notice an INSTANT improvement in my dark circles the moment i put it on. been using this product for years and i swear by it!</li>
    <li> I thought that this would do a better job that it claims to do, but it was just OK. I will continue to use the rest of the product up and see if I get any better results. Try it - it&#x27;s not expensive, and it may work better for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this really does anything. I didn&#x27;t notice any visible difference. A dermatologist recently told me the only thing eye creams can really do is moisturize, everything else is just marketing. Something tells me I will still end up trying a few more before I give up.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for me. As soon as I apply it, it tightens my skin and creates a thin dry layer that makes my dark circles even worse. I tried it with moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t work either. Can&#x27;t use it under makeup because it becomes sort of like a dead skin layer that looks horrible. Even though it was horrible, I still used it twice a day for about two months and got no long-term results either. Splurge a little and buy Clinique All About Eyes for daytime and Clinique Reapairwear Intensive Eye Cream for night time or for those days when your eyes look particularly unrested. Your eyes are worth it!</li>
    <li> I used this product twice per day for weeks.  It did marginally help with my dark circles but nothing to write home about.  Btw, I&#x27;m 26 and my dark circles aren&#x27;t that bad but they are noticeable.  Still noticeable after using the product for weeks but they have faded a little.  I keep using it to maintain the little bit of fading that occurred but no more progress is being made.</li>
    <li> I have very pronounced pinky-purple undereye circles which I think are genetic. They look a lot like allergy shiners actually, but I&#x27;ve tested negative for allergies and eliminating typical dietary causes has had no effect. As I&#x27;ve entered my thirties and the skin under my eyes has thinned, the circles have worsened and I&#x27;ve been desperate for a solution, but unfortunately this is not it. I used this cream morning and night for over 6 weeks and saw no change whatsoever. In fact, I actually worried that this product was damaging my skin because once dry it left my undereye area feeling very tight, and not in a good way. As other reviewers noted, there is some burning if this product gets too close to the eye, but for me it wasn&#x27;t anything that a few blinks/eye squeezes didn&#x27;t help. Another big problem was that my concealer did not go on as smoothly over this product which made my whole undereye area look all the more tragic. I have thrown this out and will continue my search. *sigh*</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING VITA-K PROFESSIONAL DARK CIRCLE CREME AND AM OVER-JOYED WITH THE RESULTS! I WAS SO TIRED OF PEOPLE ASKING ME WHY I LOOKED SO TIRED! THE CREME STARTED TO WORK IN 2 WEEKS AND I HAVE REALLY DARK CIRCLES. MY EYES HAVE NEVER LOOKED THIS GOOD- NOT EVEN WHEN I WAS IN MY TWENTYS AND HAD SOMETHING TO BE TIRED ABOUT. I AM SO DELIGHTED, I JUST ORDERED 3 MORE.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading the other reviews, but I was disappointed. I tried using this every night for one month and only saw a minimal difference. I have used products that worked in the past, this brand doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I use it every morning as soon as I get up.  I just dap a little under my eyes, and let it sit on the skin under my eyes until I am ready to shower.  I make sure I wash it off.  It tends to flake if you don&#x27;t wash it off.  I apply concealer and the dark puffiness is gone.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to rid my dark circles for my wedding.I used it twice a day for 3 weeks, and although the darkness went away slightly it wasnt worth the price or the wierd side effect.&lt;br /&gt;One pump of this stuff is too much for both eyes, so becareful not to waste it. Besides leaving a wierd flim under my eyes (when i slept with it, other reviews say to leave on for 10 mins, but the product DID NOT come in a box, or with directions, just wrappped in bubble wrap, i didnt really know what to do) The stuff also looked gross (kind of like...sperm..) and BURNED my eyes a bit, to the point they watered (and prob washed some stuff away). WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have to wait &amp; see if it really works, to soon to tell. It takes awhile, but it goes on easily but is a little flaky for daytime use.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product 4 times and only once a day for the past three because I didn&#x27;t like the way my makeup went on over it. The instructions say morning and night, I am using it only at night.  I have had dark circles my entire teenage and adult life.  They have gotten worse over time and are hereditary.  This stuff has lightened them significantly already!  I saw results the second day.  I could not be happier with this product for the price and the difference I see already.  I took a chance on it after reading the reviews here on Amazon and thought I would add my experience here for others thinking it&#x27;s too good for the price.  I wish I had taken before pictures so I can compare in a month.</li>
    <li> Used whole bottle of Vita-K Dark circle solution, saw no difference at all. Was very disappointed, it didn&#x27;t help. Oh well, for the price it  was worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product helps to lighten dark circles as well as to tighteni the area around the eyes. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but the pump lasts for a good while.</li>
    <li> I have had DARK under eye circles since I was about 6 years old.  I even look \\&quot;tired\\&quot; in my middle school pictures.   I have tried a bunch of products and this is the only under eye circle product I have ever tried that works!  Be patient when you use it because I did not see results until about 4 weeks in. Also, it can cause burning when it gets in your eye, so apply carefully.   I am not complaining.  This is first time in my life I will let people see me with out \\&quot;pancake concealer\\&quot; on!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product many years ago and it worked perfectly in my dark circles, however when I bought the &amp;#34; improve formula&amp;#34;,I didn&#x27;t get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle  I have been using twice a week for the last 4 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any change on the appearance of my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Vita-K Solution, when smoothed onto the undereye skin and the skin becomes light and highlight-friendly, it is no more than a miracle in process.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a several months and haven&#x27;t noticed any long lasting effects. It does have a reflective immediate effect due to Mica that is the main component in it. So it&#x27;s just a shiny cover up more than any other thing.</li>
    <li> Within a matter of days I saw improvement in the dark circles.  Now they&#x27;re gone.  I apply it each night before bed to maintain.</li>
    <li> seems to help remove the dark circles</li>
    <li> Started using the product about two weeks ago haven&#x27;t notices any difference as of yet but will use it until it&#x27;s done to see if I got any positive results</li>
    <li> I love this product and I will order it again and again.  I have received great results from using his product.  My dark circle are a little lighter.</li>
    <li> not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> This works very well for such a short time.  However, I think I will receive excellent results with long-term care.  I purchased the Eye-Bryten and I use both products which I think is giving me good results sooner.</li>
    <li> I saw no improvement at all. Waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it would babe worked for me. Maybe it will work for others though</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s only like a thin fake skin. when it peels off it&#x27;s back to the same color.</li>
    <li> I saw no change in my dark circles with this product.  I did not like the way it dried, either.  It felt stiff and sticky.  Just an FYI...it has parabens in it.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I started using Vita-K solution for my undereye dark circles on November 6th.  I can honestly say I started to see some results within a week.  I have been applying the solution twice daily as directed.  The darkness under my eyes has lightened up..but I will continue using this product daily for the best results.  I have used it in the past and it worked then.  I havent been able to find it in stores so I decided to look online.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to pay and arm and a leg on Amazon.  Can no longer find this for sale at Walmart or Walgreen&#x27;s.  Must be Vita-K&#x27;s decision, because I cannot find it anywhere.  Boo-hiss....</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles all my life (I&#x27;m 34). I have tried various creams over the years to reduce my dark circles. Most of them did not work. This one does. There has been significant improvement. It took about a month of using twice daily to notice the difference but my eye area looks a lot better. In addition to dark circles I also had bags under my eyes. This cream has tightened and lifted the bags. I would recommend this to anyone that is like me.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Stings your eyes if it accidentally gets too close and it has no lasting effect on dark circles. It does have some reflective abilities which makes circles look either less dark or a tad sparkly depending on the light. I will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> Had I not already used this product, the reviews I read regarding it would have scared me away.  I&#x27;ve always found it to be effective in my use of it for at least 5 years.  At 60+ years old, I have enough baggage without bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have ever found that actually gets rid of my dark circles under my eyes.  The price is right and since you only need a tiny amount under each eye, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any result after 2.5 month using this product. It didn&#x27;t work on me as the similar product did a few years ago. About 5 years ago I used to use a similar product with the same name but from a different company which is no longer around. That one did work better and I could notice a more brightness around my eyes after a month use. I expected the same result from this one too, but Alas!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product; mostly because of some of the product reviews and the price. However,I was unsatisfied with this product and did use it 2x a day for 5-6 weeks. Compared to other products I used it never burnt my eyes and it is not oily so that is a plus (those products obviously didn&#x27;t work either).  On to the next product!</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of eye creams that claimed to help dark circles.  My dark circles are hereditary and thought that I would be stuck with them for life.  As I got older they got darker and concealer wasn&#x27;t working.  I tired this product on a whim and have been AMAZED at how much it has helped.  I have been told I look 10 yrs younger and I have been getting carded when I buy wine.  I am 50 yrs old.  I bought a bottle for my mom and she has had the same results.  It takes about 3-4 weeks for the results to really complete.  I use it am and pm, followed by eye serum and face cream.  I love it! I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Used for three weeks now-no difference at all with dark circles.  Try another product is my advice-this doesn&#x27;t cut it, and don&#x27;t let the bargain price tempt you.</li>
    <li> I am now done with my first bottle and will re-order. It slightly lightened the dark circles, but even more, it keeps skin very nicely hydrated, soaks in very quick and leaves no sticky feeling. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it sure helps.</li>
    <li> This product really works!!! I didn´t believe at first that a face cream would actually reduced the appearance of eye dark circles. My wife dark circles were huge and very obscured and this product really reduced them to normal levels.  The dark circles didn´t dissapear, and I think it was because they were very severe, but my wife is very happy to have just very mild dark circles now instead of really black ones.    The process is very simple, just use it as directed. Twice a day for 4-6 weeks and once a day there after. You get results from the very first application as advertised. My wife says that you don´t feel the cream arround your eyes, no discomfort at all (not oily, not dry). It´s like having nothing at all on you.    I totally recommend this product, and I am giving 4 stars because it didn´t remove the dark circles completely but I am very satisfied (so is my wife).</li>
    <li> I used this one night and it made my eyes really water even though I did not get any in my eye. When I woke up the next morning my eyes where so red. The didn&#x27;t hurt but I&#x27;ve never had that problem before. Never using this again.</li>
    <li> Quite effective within the first few days. Noticeable reduction in puffiness and circles. After a week, the circles had lifted to 50% visibility, but as I kept using it, wrinkles started forming that I&#x27;d never had before. It seems to make the flesh weaker, and also irritates sensitive skin. If you do buy this, use it with multiple lotions and be ready for the results.</li>
    <li> Worked like a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me not so good to have at all don&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t work at all don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know whether it works, but the pump action applicator has not worked since I first tried it - you have to open the bottle and use  the pump wand to smear it on! I emailed the company who said they would &#x27;look at their stock&#x27; after Labor Day, but I have heard nothing since.&lt;br /&gt;Very poor. Don&#x27;t bother buying it!!!</li>
    <li> The product is good. I actually noticed a difference under my eyes, but it didn&#x27;t actually  remove the black circles it helped reduce the wrinkles under the eye thats the difference I noticed.</li>
    <li> You have to use this for awhile to see the result, I actually liked it. It burned my eyes a bit at first, but it slowly goes away after you are used to the product. But I only finished one bottle . I was never used to the burn in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Vita k works great. I ve used it for over 5 years.  It really does make under eye darkness disappear</li>
    <li> it is work for me will keep using it</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over two weeks now and have not noticed any difference with my eyes..i used it both day and night. i guess i&#x27;ll keep searching..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works wonders on my dark circles. Thank you for the timely shipping and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using VitaK for many years, and really found it effective in greatly reducing dark circles if used regulaly.  But it is totally changed--new formula, new packaging!  It is not working at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Have used it for many years for darkness under eyes. This product really works.  would like to buy item in a larger container though.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. I know better!  It&#x27;s hereditary and those dark circles are here to stay!</li>
    <li> nice product but did not change any dark circles.</li>
    <li> I bought Vita-K at Walgreens a week ago.  I have been trying to use it consistently morning and night with what I would consider, good results so far.  I have noticed the puffiness I normally wake up with under my eyes is reduced.  I&#x27;m post-menopausal, in my fifties and I work a very stressful job and often don&#x27;t get proper sleep and worry alot: the perfect recipe for bags and circles under the I eyes LOL.  Only time will tell with the dark circles which I think may be part of my Italian heritage. LOL again.  For now, I&#x27;m going to adhere to my serum regimen and just see what happens.  I have a bad picture my S.O took of me a few months ago that showed how bad the under eye bags are.  I&#x27;ll have him take another and see if there&#x27;s any difference.  I&#x27;ll post it soon.</li>
    <li> I know that there is NOTHING that can cure dark circles short of expensive cosmetic procedures. But I have had dark circles virtually my whole adult life.  I tried this product several years ago and find that I need less under eye concealer when I use it regularly.  I used it 2x a day for several weeks and now I just use it once, at night. Is it a cure? No. Does it improve the dark circles? For me, it did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for oh, seven weeks... I&#x27;m currently on my second \\&quot;bottle\\&quot;. So I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference of my dark circles, but didn&#x27;t totally go away, maybe about 50% gone.  As I had said before I&#x27;m on my second one, and am expecting my dark circles to be almost to completely gone when i&#x27;m finished with this one. My dark circles from before were more on the bad side, because I lost a lot of weight, and was I guess dehydrated.  So I would give this product 5/5!! It really does work, for me, but I would encourage anyone who has dark circle to purchase! you&#x27;ll be glad you did :)</li>
    <li> for the price its good</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work! I suddenly developed dark circles under my eyes - they appeared almost overnight. I&#x27;ve tried several different products and supplements to alleviate them. When I read the reviews of this product, I got really excited. But I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and see no improvement. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I have used it every day, twice a day as directed with no results. I still have my dark circles and my crows feet. I will continue to use it since I paid for it. Will not order it again. Sorry, you asked me to rate it and I did.</li>
