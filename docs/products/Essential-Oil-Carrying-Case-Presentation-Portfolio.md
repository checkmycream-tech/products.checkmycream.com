      <li>Love this case.</li>
      <li>I love this case.  </li>
      <li>I will buy more of these as my oil collection increases.</li>
      <li>My sister in law loved this for her large collection of oils.</li>
      <li>Other raters say it doesn&#x27;t hold the bottles, but I found that it holds them great!</li>
      <li>It comes with a shoulder strap for easy carrying.  </li>
      <li>The strap makes it  easy to carry the oils, and they are well protected.  </li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s so easy to find them.</li>
      <li>It worked well for my 15ml and fine for my 5ml bottles.</li>
      <li>Great bag for essential oil bottles.</li>
      <li>Not all 15ml bottles fit in it.  </li>
      <li>Does Not hold oils right!</li>
      <li>Pretty case, but misread and thought my books would fit inside as well.  </li>
      <li>Easy to organize your essential oils and easy to grab and go!</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>Holds all my oils and performs exactly as stated in sellers comments!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really found a better product for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It is much better than storing and carrying oils in a wooden  box.</li>
      <li>I found the zipper pouch good to hold a few page of labels.</li>
      <li>I only use it when traveling, but with over a hundred oils and wanting to be able to read the labels this is pretty much it.</li>
      <li>I always know where my oils are as I&#x27;ve pretty much memorized their spot.&lt;br /&gt;The case zips in case you want to take them with you.  </li>
      <li>I wish that some were included that were the pure oils and not the blends.</li>
      <li>Really??  </li>
      <li>I use longer 15 ml bottles and it can&#x27;t hold as much because the elastic is too close together.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to have my oils to sell on one side, and my oils I use on the other.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this organizer for storing your oils.</li>
      <li>While I love the color, and the quality of the case itself, the little elastic bands to hold the bottles DON&#x27;T.  </li>
      <li>As if that was not bad enough, the elastic that holds the bottles stretched out within the first week.  </li>
      <li>In order for everything to fit it needed to be a 5 ml row of oils on top and at least one other row of 5 ml bottles and the other 2 rows could fit 15 ml bottles.  </li>
      <li>The first one only held 30.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it even higher is that I had to play with figuring out that I couldn&#x27;t use all four rows with 15 ml bottles.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hold my young living 15ml</li>
      <li>I use frequently.</li>
      <li>, It has  help me so much, before I used to go thru all my essential oils in order to find the one I need  it</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils Set (Essential Oil Gift Pack)- 64/ 10 ml]]</li>
      <li>Not impressed with the quality of the stretch cords and really will only fit 5ML bottles or its crammed in..</li>

<li> As long as you properly cap the bottles, you should have no problems.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My sister in law loved this for her large collection of oils.</li>
    <li> Beautiful case for carrying all my oils.  Not all 15ml bottles fit in it.  I use longer 15 ml bottles and it can&#x27;t hold as much because the elastic is too close together.</li>
    <li> I love it but had to return it due to elastic being broken and the shoulder strap was missing. Will update review when I receive next order</li>
    <li> Does Not hold oils right! Don&#x27;t hold my young living 15ml</li>
    <li> While I love the color, and the quality of the case itself, the little elastic bands to hold the bottles DON&#x27;T.  I&#x27;ve had bottles fall out when I unzip.  For the cost, I expected it to last longer than this.  I don&#x27;t put them in/out a lot -- well, let&#x27;s put it this way, some of the ones falling out are not oils I use frequently.</li>
    <li> Seems to be well made.  Great for travel and keeping my oils safe.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Love this case. Easy to organize your essential oils and easy to grab and go!</li>
    <li> I purchased this portfolio case to hold the Edens Garden Supreme Set that has 64/ 10 ml bottles.  I don&#x27;t know if it was designed for this case, but it sure works great.  I am very happy with both purchases.  Thanks![[ASIN:B00475M3TU Supreme Aromatherapy 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils Set (Essential Oil Gift Pack)- 64/ 10 ml]]</li>
    <li> Very nice carrying case.</li>
    <li> For the people into aromatherapy this is a very good way to get organized, It has  help me so much, before I used to go thru all my essential oils in order to find the one I need  it and now it&#x27;s so easy to find them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Its an ok case for the price. Only problems I can see happening down the road are the zipper stitching breaking loose and the elastic holding the bottles getting too loose over time.  For the money, it will serve its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I can just grab and go with.  It has a handle on the spine or I can use the shoulder strap.  It fits a lot of oils.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it even higher is that I had to play with figuring out that I couldn&#x27;t use all four rows with 15 ml bottles.  In order for everything to fit it needed to be a 5 ml row of oils on top and at least one other row of 5 ml bottles and the other 2 rows could fit 15 ml bottles.  Once I realized how to fit everything, it was great!</li>
    <li> Love this case! Holds all my oils and performs exactly as stated in sellers comments!</li>
    <li> My wife likes it and holds the doterra bottles well.</li>
    <li> I love this case.  It holds the oils well.  The strap makes it  easy to carry the oils, and they are well protected.  It says there is room for pocket/ small book.  It would need to be a VERY small book. I expected to case to be a little larger, it reminds me of a high school binder, covered with a leather-like.  I found the zipper pouch good to hold a few page of labels. It is much better than storing and carrying oils in a wooden  box.</li>
    <li> Great bag for essential oil bottles.</li>
    <li> Well, when I received this item I thought it was perfect.  I got all my YL oils put in it to travel and the second time I zipped it, the zipper broke!!  Really??  As if that was not bad enough, the elastic that holds the bottles stretched out within the first week.  Most&lt;br /&gt;of the bottles will not stay put now.  This was supposed to look Professional, it looks terrible!  Broken zipper with the bottles falling out all over.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  This was not cheap in Price for a piece of JUNK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year and I love it!  Keeps my EO&#x27;s nicely together in one convenient place. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> There are so many oils and it is refreashing to go through them. I wish that some were included that were the pure oils and not the blends. Say for instance Neroli. I really hated the adoration. Will never use it because it is foul smelling.</li>
    <li> It worked well for my 15ml and fine for my 5ml bottles. A year later the elastic is not working on about 1/4 of the spots and continues to get worse. UPDATE 2 years later. I haven&#x27;t really found a better product for a reasonable price. It&#x27;s definitely a case of you get what you pay for. I said it was about at 1/4 that don&#x27;t work but it&#x27;s really only 2 that are unusable. I keep my 5mls in the tighter elastics spaces. I only use it when traveling, but with over a hundred oils and wanting to be able to read the labels this is pretty much it.</li>
    <li> Great product and ordering ease</li>
    <li> The straps that hold the bottles stretch after placing a bottle in them and doesn&#x27;t hold them well after that.</li>
    <li> All my bottles fit perfect and it is professional looking.</li>
    <li> This case has come in handy.  I&#x27;m able to have my oils to sell on one side, and my oils I use on the other.  The only thing I&#x27;d like to improve is have a strap or something to help keep it braced when flipped open to display the oils.  I have to be careful on how I set it up so it will not fall over/flat.</li>
    <li> Pretty case, but misread and thought my books would fit inside as well.  Not impressed with the quality of the stretch cords and really will only fit 5ML bottles or its crammed in.. Haven&#x27;t yet used and plan to return it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this case!  Other raters say it doesn&#x27;t hold the bottles, but I found that it holds them great!</li>
    <li> I purchased a lot of oils here from Amazon! This organizer is great holding all the oils I have purchased.  I use it to store and carry my oils with me.  It comes with a shoulder strap for easy carrying.  Highly recommend this organizer for storing your oils.</li>
    <li> Perfect for all my oils. Well made. Extra pockets inside. Holds a ton. Great color too.</li>
    <li> It holds our bottles very good.  We might have to get another just to hold all of these Do Terra vials/bottles.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for!  It does hold both the 5 &amp; 15 ml bottles though the bottom rows (it opens up like a clam shell with elastic loops to hold 32 bottles on each side) will only hold the smaller 5 ml bottles.  It travels well even through the abuse that checked luggage endures.  I would purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  The first one only held 30.  I grew out of that one.  This one holds 60.  It works for me because I like to see the labels.  As long as you properly cap the bottles, you should have no problems.  Also, they stay in the same place.  I always know where my oils are as I&#x27;ve pretty much memorized their spot.&lt;br /&gt;The case zips in case you want to take them with you.  I also have a travel case if I don&#x27;t want to bring them all with me.</li>
    <li> Great.  Only had a few of the bands  break  but I use it  everyday.</li>
    <li> The zipper is not as easy to guide around the corners as I would like, but the capacity is awesome.</li>
    <li> I Iove this! Comes with a removable shoulder strap. Has oil sections on the inside of the front &amp; back, with a black center zippered page, where you can store brochures/recipes, papers, and a small transparent ID or business card holder space. I will buy more of these as my oil collection increases. Thank you!!</li>
