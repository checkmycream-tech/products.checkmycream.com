      <li>As a straightener this item might work fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice compact size, and it heats up fast.  </li>
      <li>I bought this item to use primarily as a curling iron when I travel.</li>
      <li>For touch-ups or styling short or medium length hair, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It pulls my hair, and doesn&#x27;t move through the hair smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right size for her to be able to take to sleepovers and sporting events.</li>
      <li>got it on 04/08 and tested it on 04/11: it heats up quickly and works fine for me and on my hair (fine, wavy).</li>
      <li>It came super quick and the packaging was cute and compact.</li>
      <li>The curling is great for the ends of your hair, but if you have really long hair and want ringlets/waves all the way through, this is not the tool for you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really small, perfect for throwing in a purse or bag.</li>
      <li>This thing is fine for quick straightening touch ups on vacation if you want to save space.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for and I love it.</li>

      <li>Good travel size, because the barrel is smaller</li>
      <li>I found that it did not get too hot for fine hair.</li>
      <li>It heats up really quick.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I got it elsewhere on sale and used a coupon.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly,  a plus.</li>
      <li>It works great and is compact enough to not take up too much room for travel.</li>
      <li>There is no room to comfortably place your hand while it is HOT...</li>
      <li>and it works good for my long hairs.</li>
      <li>Easy to use - fast heat up.  </li>
      <li>but after using it omg my hair is so straight and smooth</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Plugs in nicely abroad without need of a converter--but, and it is a big</li>
      <li>It is almost instantly ready to use, it does both straightening and curling, it&#x27;s very small, and it has automatic dual voltage, all of which make it perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>It may be just my hair that does not mesh well with this particular product, but I have heard it works well with those that have shorter, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Just the right size for traveling and touch ups.</li>
      <li>It is nice to use with the front section of my hair which is not too long.</li>
      <li>Great for thin fine hair which I have.</li>
      <li>Works decent as a straightener; heats up quickly, but there&#x27;s no 2-in-1.</li>

      <li>I was hoping it would be more \\&quot;standard size\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It did straighten my hair pretty well, it would not curl.</li>
      <li>I love this product at the same time it has its faults</li>
      <li>:), but it definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>have pictures showing it next to a ruler for better perspective, but it&#x27;s not giving me an option to attach pictures (posting this review using a Mobile phone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot and doesn&#x27;t clap all the way shut.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>it takes some practice to figure out how to use the unit, the exposed plates on the &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; side of the unit can easily cause burns if you are not careful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It pulls out my hair.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting.  It is very \\&quot;miniature\\&quot;...there is almost not a purpose for this item.  There is no room to comfortably place your hand while it is HOT...I assumed it was a small \\&quot;curl\\&quot; but it&#x27;s only about 6 inches long and 4 inches is HOT IRON...and the curl is so small its almost useless.  I was hoping it would be more \\&quot;standard size\\&quot;.  My fault...but the product is not accurately described.  *sigh* I will have to give it to my 2 yr old to play dress up, Unplugged of course.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a negative rating I would. Besides being doll size small, it does not heat up; warm not enough to straighten or curl.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I brought it because I&#x27;m going on a 3 month long trip to Europe. The size is perfect! It heats up really quick. Makes perfect curls! And straightens well too! It took a little longer than normal but that&#x27;s the prize for it being so small. In this picture the curls are  about 2 and half hours old with hair spray. It didn&#x27;t come with the carrying case but oh well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mini flat iron in June for an upcoming European trip and cruise. I just returned from a fall trip and now the verdict is in: this was a great purchase. Lightweight and compact- perfect when every pound in your suitcase matters. It heats up quickly and had no trouble using it with my outlet adapter since it works on 110/220 volts. I have thick hair so I just took smaller layers of hair at a time using some long clips. No more bad hair days when traveling abroad. Great gift for the traveler.</li>
    <li> Yes, it small and convenient. Plugs in nicely abroad without need of a converter--but, and it is a big but, it does not heat up to a temperature (here in the US or abroad) that would actually nicely straighten your hair.</li>
    <li> Still have yet to make curls with it. It is the mini. Disappointed not in the summary.</li>
    <li> It works fine and I did want a compact iron to take on motorcycle trips, just not big enough for my thick hair. Would be better on fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel and works well, even for long hair.  Mine did not come with a travel case. Was hoping this would be included, but noticed that a lot of others did not receive it either. So I was not surprised by this.</li>
    <li> This mini styler is perfect for short hair styles. Great for travel.  Heats quickly and easy to use for small hands.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use primarily as a curling iron when I travel. I have medium-length, thin hair (but a lot of it), and it&#x27;s naturally straight. As a straightener this item might work fine. As for the curling, it basically would only &#x27;kink&#x27; the end of my hair. I simply wanted it to curl under and it couldn&#x27;t even do that. It also left my hair looking dry and dull. I do not recommend this as a curler.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for traveling and touch ups.</li>
    <li> Odd little thing ripped my hair out with each pass.  The plates have a ridge to one side.  Then there is a curved piece that is only on one side.  Not sure what the goal was here, but it sure made a mess of my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife thinking it would be perfect since she wanted an appliance to curl, as well as straighten her hair.  The thing actually works according to my wife.  But I was really surprised, and so was she, at how small this was, almost toy-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be warned, the styler works well.  But it is tiny.</li>
    <li> Creates great waves and curls, but doesn&#x27;t straighten well and the little pieces on the outside to help add wave keep ripping out my hair :( I find hair stuck in between the plate and the iron each time i create a new wave or curl :(</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. It didn&#x27;t style hair well.</li>
    <li> Works decent as a straightener; heats up quickly, but there&#x27;s no 2-in-1. The side plates aren&#x27;t heated, so if I try to use it to curl, it puts a weird crimp and frizzes my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my trip to Europe since I&#x27;m only bringing a carry on! I have long, thick hair - and it works great! Takes a little bit longer than a regular sized iron (obviously...) :), but it definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It did not come with the carrying bag though. That was a bummer.</li>
    <li> Great for thin fine hair which I have. Easy to use - fast heat up.  Had to buy a second one!  Travel size is perfect.</li>
    <li> Extremely tiny and flimsy.</li>
    <li> I got this to help me while I was growing out a pixie cut. It&#x27;s PERFECT for short bangs, short hair around the ears or neck, even longer hair in weird places! I still use it to iron out my cowlick without burning my face.</li>
    <li> Love this! Such a great space saver for traveling! I haven&#x27;t used it to straighten because it&#x27;s very thin but I have been rocking surfer waves all vacation without a hassle</li>
    <li> Very convenient for travel</li>
    <li> If you want a nice size Styler don&#x27;t buy this one, it is pretty small, but it works for my bangs.</li>
    <li> Good travel size, because the barrel is smaller the waves/curls produced are tighter (smaller) so the look is not a big loose curl.  I will continue to use it though for the convenience of traveling and not having to bring a converter and needing only a plug adapter when traveling abroad.</li>
    <li> I purchased for travel, but now I use it all the time - love the flat and curl feature for taming my tiny curls.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot and doesn&#x27;t clap all the way shut. Useless piece of junk</li>
    <li> I wanted a small straightener that I could use when my hair is wet. I only use this to straighten my side bangs. (The rest of my hair air dries.) It is perfect for that. If you are looking for something to use straighten all of your hair, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. Unless perhaps you have short, thin hair. I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price. Luckily, I got it elsewhere on sale and used a coupon.</li>
    <li> Upon its delivery I realized it was a Mini styler, however I was expecting a regular one :( The product information is very poorly advertised. One can hardly spot the word \\&quot;Mini\\&quot;. I did replace this for a regular 1\\&quot; styler by Remington and it works good for my long hairs. This product is definitely for thin and short hairs.</li>
    <li> It is very small and heat up fast. But the curl flip is kind of useless. It is nice to use with the front section of my hair which is not too long. But when  it goes to the area that below shoulder, it does not make any different to the hair at all. But if your hair is short I would recommend to use it as a straightener. It is kind of cute also.</li>
    <li> This is ridiculous. It does not close nor have a spring action to make it even possible to hold it closed while trying to curl the hair. Even as a straightener you have to hold it so tight to keep it closed that it is uncomfortable. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> metal doesn&#x27;t go all the way around so you can only curl with iron pointed in one direction, which is difficult with left hand.  Size is perfect just too bad it difficult to use and wish it got little hotter.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it since it doesn&#x27;t have the required heat to straight my hair. I bought another one and saved this one, but I could&#x27;ve thrown it away by now . Don&#x27;t buy if you have curly or difficult hair.</li>
    <li> I read in other reviews of this product and people said it came with the case. I have also seen this product in the store with a case. Mine however did not come with one, so I&#x27;m a bit bummed about it. It would be a lot easier to travel with, so now I have to go out and purchase one separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because I have thin hair that is on the shorter size, and the size of this iron will work well for me. I would not suggest this if you have long or thick hair.</li>
    <li> It works on my short hair but the blades with the side plates are almost too fat to turn over easily and the plats go all the way to the end so I can&#x27;t hold the tip to help rotate it for a curl.</li>
    <li> It burned my fingers every time I tried to use it.  I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic, short hair can be straightened or curled</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. Personally I have thick long hair. It may be just my hair that does not mesh well with this particular product, but I have heard it works well with those that have shorter, fine hair. But I will not be recommending this for people with my similar hair. Heats up quickly,  a plus. And it does curl, no doubt about it. It does do what it is intended for, but for me it just took more time &amp; repeating over &amp; over just to get it to curl. Purchased a separate curling iron from Amazon that I am highly pleased with. This little one just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Conair MiniPro ceramic styler to help teach my daughter how to straighten her own hair as well as to use to travel. It is light weight and so easy to use!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this really was ... this is kind of hard to use to curl being it&#x27;s so small. Works well !!</li>
    <li> Maybe once I get the hang of this little thing I&#x27;ll like it more, but not now.  It pulls my hair, and doesn&#x27;t move through the hair smoothly.  I can&#x27;t get it to curl my hair nicely it just looks half down.  It is very travel size, which I don&#x27;t mind so much.  My hair is thin and just below my shoulders, I don&#x27;t need anything big.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take on vacation.  It&#x27;s small and it&#x27;s supposed to be a straightener / curling iron in one so I thought it would save space in my bag.  It is small, but not functional.  I could use it somewhat for straightening, but the plates did not meet completely so it did not clamp firmly on my hair.  I was not able to use it as a curling iron at all.  The design does not allow for your hands to be in a place to use it that way.  Plus, the curling plate is only on one side of the iron, not both sides.  One plus is that it comes with a silicone bag to put it in after use.  This thing is fine for quick straightening touch ups on vacation if you want to save space.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron for quick curls at the gym after shower.  Small and compact and insulated pouch to insert while iron is still hot.</li>
    <li> i have very thin hair, baby fine shaft as well...this did not get hot enough. took me about 20 minutes to get a couple trouble spots to just flip under no matter how slow i went through it, it just wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
    <li> Too Small to do anything with</li>
    <li> I have incredibly fine hair, and this straightener does heat up hot enough to do anything for my hair. Also, it&#x27;s fairly easy to accidentally burn yourself, because of the wrap around plates. It&#x27;s a great size; I wish it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Used it on our international trip. Worked great! Nice size.</li>
    <li> I love this product at the same time it has its faults I think its my hair though. It works but after awhile , but hey cannot complain still works and gets my wild and curly hair in place when I prefer beautiful straighter hair. Its a perfect travel size to stick in your purse when you have something to do and your in a rush. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Several reviewers stated that it comes with a travel case. They must be referring to an older version of this product. It does not come with a case.  it takes some practice to figure out how to use the unit, the exposed plates on the &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; side of the unit can easily cause burns if you are not careful.  There are no temperature adjustment settings. I found that it did not get too hot for fine hair. If you have thicker hair it might not work for you.</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron from Shopko for the sole purpose of straightening my bangs after I got my hair chopped. It works alright and gets the job done. I&#x27;ve never owned another iron before so it&#x27;s hard to compare but it does get sufficiently warm and straightens small amounts of hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When plugged it, it will not warm until the switch is turned on which is nice. The curling elements on the outside obviously get hot as well so be careful where you place it and how you grab it. I&#x27;ve never tried curling my hair before with it but sometimes I&#x27;ll roll my wrist and pass the outside plates over my hair to try and get some frizzies down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is my &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; light never actually turns on and sort of faintly glows instead. It does not help at all to tell me if it&#x27;s on or even warm. Bummer but not worth returning or exchanging it over.</li>
    <li> I needed a curling iron as well as a straightener for UK and thought this was the answer. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is somewhat wavy and shoulder length. It was not hot enough to straighten properly. Also, the curling function is very awkward. The picture is misleading... The heated curved part is only on one side so there is some weird technique to try to achieve a curl. Didn&#x27;t work.  I returned this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really small, perfect for throwing in a purse or bag. There is only one level of heat, I wish there were an option to change the temp. I think for the price, you may be able to find a better straightener.</li>
    <li> This things is a POS. It does not get hot AT ALL &amp; certainly will not straigten your hair. What a waste of money...</li>
    <li> I like this product. I wanted a straightener for short hair and bought it on a whim at Walgreen&#x27;s for $20. Heat&#x27;s up quickly, straightens hair, and goes right back in the heat proof bag while taking up minimal space due to it&#x27;s compact size. It will not straighten wet hair, but does straighten dry hair to a shiny finish. Good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome travel size and it gets good and hot, but my hair gets caught in the ends of the plate between the plastic a lot! Ow!</li>
    <li> With \\&quot;MiniPro\\&quot; in the name, why are the previous reviewers surprised by it&#x27;s size? It&#x27;s very small and compact, but that&#x27;s the POINT. Exactly what I was looking for and I love it. Really great for traveling and comes with a case. The straightener is just as good as any larger size I&#x27;ve found. The curling is great for the ends of your hair, but if you have really long hair and want ringlets/waves all the way through, this is not the tool for you. Overall, for the price, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 12 year old to use on the go. It is perfect. It&#x27;s just the right size for her to be able to take to sleepovers and sporting events. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed... Should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews posted. Does not straighten well, could be because my hair is wavy/frizzy type. Perhaps is best used for touch ups on already straightened hair which I have not tested. I would save your money.</li>
    <li> As described, it is dual voltage so it requires only an adapter, NOT a voltage converter for use outside of the US. It curls really well and packs easily-- great for travel. Straightening is fine but not great-- I used it mostly for fixing frizz/flyaways while on vacation rather than actually straightening my hair (it&#x27;s not quite big enough or hot enough for that)</li>
    <li> cute little rascal.  heats up great.  size fits easily in medium purse for travel or touchups</li>
    <li> I love the color.  It works great and is compact enough to not take up too much room for travel. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, and therefore, doesn&#x27;t work as strong as other stylers might work.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for travelers, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and my cut is a little above the chin. It does what I need it to do if I use small sections of hair. I wish it had a heat setting on it like my large one. It is great for travel -came with its own travel pouch. Light weight, heats up quickly. just takes a little longer for me because my hair is so thick.</li>
    <li> Wen i first got this indidnt know i oreder such a sml product but after using it omg my hair is so straight and smooth i do not regret this at all</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this mini straightener. I bought it today from Walgreen and it heats up immediately. No exaggeration. I can flip my hair under,  flip my hair out, curl my hair, or straighten my hair in seconds (depending on what im doing). My hair is already naturally straight though. I would highly recommend this straightener if you want something that gets the job done but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm or a leg.</li>
    <li> This is really good and portable, exactly what I was looking for to travel!&lt;br /&gt;I got it on 04/08 and tested it on 04/11: it heats up quickly and works fine for me and on my hair (fine, wavy). I didn&#x27;t try curling it as I&#x27;m not very skilled with these things.&lt;br /&gt;They should update the picture and remove the case since it doesn&#x27;t come with it, hence minus one star; I wanted the case too!&lt;br /&gt;I have pictures showing it next to a ruler for better perspective, but it&#x27;s not giving me an option to attach pictures (posting this review using a Mobile phone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04/16: UPDATE - Just to post pictures from my computer. Hope it helps!</li>
    <li> Too small and awkward to use</li>
    <li> It is very small. I suppose that is the point. My ceramic styler did not come with a carrying case which was kind of a bummer.</li>
    <li> The concept of this is great, the product not so much at all. It doesn&#x27;t close around your hair enough to do anything and the curling barrel is literally only on half of the item. It makes it look like ponytail hair when you can close it. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
    <li> This won&#x27;t do anything with my hair. Will only work as a straightener, will not curl at all.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron that I&#x27;ve had, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it does exactly what I need.  I just use it to give my bangs a little curl.  It&#x27;s a nice compact size, and it heats up fast.  My hair is already straight, so I haven&#x27;t tried straightening.</li>
    <li> Easy to carry when travelling</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and although she likes it she wants a bigger version :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very compact and easy to travel with to say the least.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough!  Just makes hair frizzy!  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have short hair, and the mini flat iron is manageable and good for my short hair. A regular-sized flat iron is too large to use on my short hair. With the mini iron I can keep the hair straight or add a little twist of a curl at the ends by turning the iron. It gives me height and volume (I have very soft, fine, thin hair) ... and it always makes the hair more manageable and shine. After I dry my hair I go over every strand of it with the mini iron and it works miracles, again, in volume, shine, and manageability. Great product! It makes me look great, and I always get compliments on my hair, not just the style, but the shine which I don&#x27;t have if I don&#x27;t use the mini-styler.</li>
    <li> Pinched me when using.  Gave them away to Goodwill</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes that it would curl and straighten my hair for an upcoming trip, where I will only have a carryon bag. It did straighten my hair pretty well, it would not curl. The barrels on the outside only get about half as hot as the inside plates, and it just wasn&#x27;t hot enough to do anything. I could actually touch the barrels they were so cool. Returned.</li>
    <li> Works good just wish it got hotter.</li>
    <li> For touch-ups or styling short or medium length hair, it&#x27;s great. It is almost instantly ready to use, it does both straightening and curling, it&#x27;s very small, and it has automatic dual voltage, all of which make it perfect for travel. I had no trouble getting used to how to hold it and I haven&#x27;t burned myself so I&#x27;m not sure why other have had problems.</li>
    <li> great with touch ups or in a hurry</li>
    <li> Awesome works great, doesn&#x27;t burn hair and it does a beautiful curl! It came super quick and the packaging was cute and compact. Love love love!</li>
