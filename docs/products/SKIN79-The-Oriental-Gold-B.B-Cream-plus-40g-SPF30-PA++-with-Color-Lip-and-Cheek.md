      <li>The color is a bit bright and kind of orangey on the lips, but really really nice on the cheeks :) (con)</li>
      <li>Titantinum dioxide listed on top meaning the UVB block is effective</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>and I have been mixing this with day cream to get better result. . .</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased that I have to write a review.  </li>
      <li>is lovely.</li>
      <li>bonus is, I absolutely, positively LOVE the cheek and lip tint.</li>
      <li>I tried the lip stain and it&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>I love this product and will  be buying again.</li>
      <li>The product is lightly scented and comes with a nice rouge.</li>
      <li>lip tint is what I like the most about this BB.</li>
      <li>I think this bb cream would be better for people with oily skin that want a matte finish without having to powder.  </li>
      <li>and I like the lip/cheek color better.</li>
      <li>is leaning towards more of a grayish skin tone</li>
      <li>This is one of by favorite BB creams.  </li>
      <li>It has more coverage</li>
      <li>When I looked at myself in the mirror, it looked more like zombie makeup...</li>
      <li>That one works ok, but this one--\\&quot;Oriental Gold Plus\\&quot;--is much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it will perform better as the weather warms.  </li>
      <li>so so since they&#x27;re more like tinted moisturizer with some sun protection.  </li>
      <li>I decided to change as, per their website, this BB Cream might be more of what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But whatever love the product anyways.</li>
      <li>I find that if I rub my clean hands together for about 10 seconds to warm them, then hold them on my face for about 20 seconds, it helps to blend it quicker.  </li>
      <li>it has good moisture that moisturizes and at the same time has good coverage with skin.</li>
      <li>I also thought it made fine lines more noticeable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect amount of coverage; I have an Asian complexion with a really uneven skin tone and this evens it out perfectly.</li>
      <li>This cream is rich and very comfortable on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice, feminine pink shade that may appear brightened by comparison with the BB and can seem orange-y in bright light.</li>
      <li>The last thing I wanna say is that this product smells good!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean, so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I like how it smells and how light it feels on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I can use it without makeup also with the color lip that is so smooth to the lips and so protective.</li>
      <li>I lightly set it with my mineral foundation (Skinn cotton and mineral powder foundation which has sheert to medium coverage).  </li>
      <li>My skin looked smooth and dewy this morning, and now it&#x27;s 5pm</li>
      <li>but it was TOO light for my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This BB Cream is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It applies and covers well while remaining fairly light against the skin.</li>
      <li>She kept gushing about how amazing it was and how those makeup gurus on YouTube were using it, and I didn&#x27;t really understand all the hype about it.</li>
      <li>The Color looks great, especially on my lips, but I still prefer my Cargo blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Korean, Light to Natural Beige, 20 yrs, Fair w/ no acne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love this product because it is ideal for everyday use.</li>
      <li>So it does end up matching my skin tone pretty well after a bit :)</li>
      <li>I actually didn&#x27;t buy any until I started seeing commercials about the stuff on TV :P</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this after reading reviews.</li>
      <li>I love this product but to be quite honest I&#x27;m really unsure since this BB cream I revived does not have an authentic sticker on the back</li>
      <li>That bb cream is a full coverage cream.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much.</li>
      <li>I wish it came with more haha.</li>
      <li>I really like the lip and cheek color that came, for free, with the BB cream!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous strawberry/raspberry tone (somewhere in the middle of those 2!)</li>
      <li>but really it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, creamy texture but initially, it goes on a bit pasty (too light) for me.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that it works nicely and fit&#x27;s my  pale/ yellow skin complexion</li>
      <li>love, love, this product 3rd time ordering!</li>
      <li>This has a creamy formula that is great for delicate skin, simply love this BB Cream .</li>
      <li>(i normally wear medium foundation but leaning more toward lightest shade of medium).</li>
      <li>I like it very much!</li>
      <li>It will show up VERY much on camera-this is significantly noticeable on camera compared to the U.S brand of SPF makeup products.</li>
      <li>Its such a cute color!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian and have fairly  warm, tan undertones.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite out of all of the skin 79 BB Creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This works for me colorwise (yay another rare hit), but the texture leaves something to be desired.</li>
      <li>Having it all in the same package is handy.</li>
      <li>so you have to apply about 1-2 teaspoon&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>However, it seems to &#x27;melt&#x27; into a more natural looking skin tone after a couple of hours.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other skin 79 bb creams, this one does not adjust to my skin tone (fair).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really concerned if it&#x27;s a true product or not although the pump at the bottom looks tampered with</li>
      <li>It even covers up my dark circles fairly well on its own.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You push from the top of the container, and the product is dispensed from a little hole up top.</li>
      <li>but they quickly disappeared after using this and it made my skin very even.</li>
      <li>pros outweigh the cons, I&#x27;d definitely buy this again! :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> skin 79 oriental gold BB cream is so nice for the skin and I can use it without makeup also with the color lip that is so smooth to the lips and so protective.</li>
    <li> This has a creamy formula that is great for delicate skin, simply love this BB Cream . Anyone from any age can use it.</li>
    <li> This product was a fake rip off of the real brand (it did not come in the proper packaging as described by website for this product). The color of the make-up is WAY too light for my skin tone--you basically have to be pretty pale for it to blend well with the color of your skin.</li>
    <li> Well, its finished tone looks weird with too much of yellowish tone. . . I have oily combination skin. When I purchased this one, I expected rather smooth and rich B.B. cream finish. To my disappointment, it turned out to be dry even for my oily skin and I have been mixing this with day cream to get better result. . . Definitely, this was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> this product is bad...i used it twice now my skin is full with acnes and too dry because of this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, creamy texture but initially, it goes on a bit pasty (too light) for me.  However, it seems to &#x27;melt&#x27; into a more natural looking skin tone after a couple of hours.  I find that if I rub my clean hands together for about 10 seconds to warm them, then hold them on my face for about 20 seconds, it helps to blend it quicker.  This cream is supposed to be moisturizing, but it has a dry, matte finish when I apply it (maybe because my skin is drier in winter).  By the end of the day, the cream definitely looks more natural.&lt;br /&gt;The blush is a pretty pinkish/rose color - not much is needed to color your cheeks/lips.  But the color doesn&#x27;t seem to last throughout the day unless I apply powder blush over my cheeks as well.  I&#x27;m wondering if it will perform better as the weather warms.  It&#x27;ll probably feel less dry in the summer, when my skin is oilier.</li>
    <li> The color matches my skin perfectly and living in California where it&#x27;s always sunny the SPF was really what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t have problem skin so the BB Cream smoothes out my skin-tone. I tried the lip stain and it&#x27;s okay, but I guess it&#x27;s just a little extra goodie thrown in with the product.    Overall, I love this BB Cream and will probably try the Oriental Gold BB Cream next.</li>
    <li> I was told by a friend to buy BB cream. She kept gushing about how amazing it was and how those makeup gurus on YouTube were using it, and I didn&#x27;t really understand all the hype about it. I actually didn&#x27;t buy any until I started seeing commercials about the stuff on TV :P It&#x27;s not the same brand I saw, but I suppose it&#x27;s better that way. This company, SKIN79, is, to my understanding, a well established BB cream manufacturer, so obviously they know what they&#x27;re doing. So! (con) The dispenser is a little weird. You push from the top of the container, and the product is dispensed from a little hole up top. The area around the dispenser gets messy, but (pro) it&#x27;s easy to clean, so that&#x27;s fine. (pro) I really like the lip and cheek color that came, for free, with the BB cream! The color is a bit bright and kind of orangey on the lips, but really really nice on the cheeks :) (con) And I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the climate or if it&#x27;s supposed to be that way, but it&#x27;s a little too. . .creamy? I tried applying the lip and cheek color with my fingers and ended up squishing it :( I really do wish the BB cream came in different shades. (con) See, the thing is, it makes me look kinda grey at first :/ (pro) It oxidizes! So it does end up matching my skin tone pretty well after a bit :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros outweigh the cons, I&#x27;d definitely buy this again! :)</li>
    <li> LOVE! haha I am Mexican-American but I have pretty pale skin. I thought this would work out but it was TOO light for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;This is leaning towards more of a grayish skin tone and i&#x27;m that type of Mexican-American who&#x27;s pale but not too pale (fall in between warm and cool tones but learning more towards the cool) Also DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT take photos with a flash! Especially if you can barley get away with this color. It will show up VERY much on camera-this is significantly noticeable on camera compared to the U.S brand of SPF makeup products. You will look like a ghost. haha&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAYS- despite it not being my skin tone I really like this product. I am pretty confident I did not get a fake! As the product actually works! It improved any wrinkles, whitened dark spots and it worked wonders with my acne. I had a lot of visible pores on my nose but they quickly disappeared after using this and it made my skin very even. I don&#x27;t wear this product out but I continue to use it as part of my skin care routine!&lt;br /&gt;ALSO-i love the little lip&amp;cheek compact on it. Its such a cute color! I wish it came with more haha. The last thing I wanna say is that this product smells good! Which is always a plus in my book because I hate when makeup has that weird strong makeup smell. I like how it smells and how light it feels on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can really say is that it seems to be a little dewy ask it will come off easily, very noticeable when speaking on the phone haha I personally don&#x27;t like that. But whatever love the product anyways. I recommend you give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of coverage; I have an Asian complexion with a really uneven skin tone and this evens it out perfectly. It covers really well, especially given how light the texture is. You only need a little to cover your whole face. I just use it like a foundation and set it with powder.  I&#x27;ve used this for nearly 6 months now and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out. And yes, it doubles as a moisturizer in the morning.  DON&#x27;T get the \\&quot;Oriental Gold B.B. Cream\\&quot; that has a purple container. That one works ok, but this one--\\&quot;Oriental Gold Plus\\&quot;--is much better. It has more coverage and I like the lip/cheek color better.</li>
    <li> This cream is rich and very comfortable on. It applies and covers well while remaining fairly light against the skin. I&#x27;d compare its weight to that of a light facial moisturizer. It lasts decently long on the skin, enough to get through a full shift at work (unless you are prone to oily skin), but will likely need a little touch-up before a night out. I have dark under-eyes and was surprised to find that this conceals that area very well. The product is lightly scented and comes with a nice rouge. I love this product and will  be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fair skin, caucasian but with a neutral undertone. This works for me colorwise (yay another rare hit), but the texture leaves something to be desired. My skin type is combination normal to dry cheeks and normal to oily T-zone. This did not sit well with either of them. The oily part felt heavy and the dry part felt almost gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said it might work for people who are mature and very thirsty skin. As long as you moisturize well, first and and refresh often. I don&#x27;t suggest powdering over this at all if you can help it, though. It just makes the texture worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bonus is, I absolutely, positively LOVE the cheek and lip tint. It&#x27;s a gorgeous strawberry/raspberry tone (somewhere in the middle of those 2!) and it&#x27;s texture is lovely. I gave 2 stars for that alone. I wish they sold it separately, but if I have to buy this just to get the tint, I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit June 1st- I tried it again, and it just looks awful. It makes my pores more noticable and sinks into any lines, aging me and making my skin look... well rather corpse like. Not a fan at all.</li>
    <li> This product is a little on the thick cakey looking side. Unlike other skin 79 bb creams, this one does not adjust to my skin tone (fair). It looks like I rubbed zink oxide into face. It is good for blemish coverage.</li>
    <li> I hardly write reviews unless I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my order. I live in \\&quot;Korean town\\&quot; in the US and I got a lot of samples from the local stores and I also bought the skin79 diamond from Amazon previously.  But all of them is just only so so since they&#x27;re more like tinted moisturizer with some sun protection.  I received this one yesterday, put it on this morning and I&#x27;m so pleased that I have to write a review.  It&#x27;s quite a bit more pigmented than the diamond, the color is a little darker than the skin79 diamond, so it&#x27;s a little closer to my skin color (i normally wear medium foundation but leaning more toward lightest shade of medium). It has a great coverage, better than ANY mineral powder, and comparable to Lancome ageless minerals, which is the #1 priority in selecting a foundation because I have really bad hyperpigmentation, both from acne scars and melasma.  And it&#x27;s SPF30 which blocks 98% of UV.  Titantinum dioxide listed on top meaning the UVB block is effective and it also has zinc oxide, which is very effective in blocking both UVA and UVB, list about 1/4 way down the ingredient list.  And a lot of natural ingredients too!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on about 10am this morning.  I lightly set it with my mineral foundation (Skinn cotton and mineral powder foundation which has sheert to medium coverage).  My skin looked smooth and dewy this morning, and now it&#x27;s 5pm, it still looks and feels exactly the same as it was this morning. My search for BB cream ends here.</li>
    <li> I received the order in a timely manner and I loved the lip/blush cream that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 is the actual product. It has a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feel to it. Even after you have put your moisturizer it&#x27;s hard to blend because of how dry it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;Truly a shame.</li>
    <li> So I just bought 7 different BB&#x27;s on Amazon recently to decide which ones I liked the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin: Korean, Light to Natural Beige, 20 yrs, Fair w/ no acne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB is great. If you put on too much it&#x27;ll make you look like a white faced ghost because of the sun screen so you have to apply about 1-2 teaspoon&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s matte and on the runny side which is good for me because it makes my skin have that healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip tint is what I like the most about this BB. It goes very nice with my skin tone and complexion. It&#x27;s a very nice, feminine pink shade that may appear brightened by comparison with the BB and can seem orange-y in bright light. However for the most part, it&#x27;s pink. The less BB you put on, the more pink shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great fall/winter BB. I&#x27;m not sure about summer because it&#x27;s runny but if used with a pact or powder press, maybe. I can use the tint with other BB&#x27;s so that&#x27;s also a plus.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT, THE BLUSH GIFT IS CREAMY AND COOL AND COMES WITH  SAMPLES !!!</li>
    <li> love, love, this product 3rd time ordering!</li>
    <li> Execellent product. I like it very much! Thank you.</li>
    <li> love it, but it is a little drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is fantastic. It&#x27;s by far my favorite out of all of the skin 79 BB Creams I&#x27;ve tried. It has great coverage, and is very thick. A little pump goes a long way. It even covers up my dark circles fairly well on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip and cheek color is just whatever, I never use it, so I can&#x27;t review it. I think from the one time I tried it as a gloss it faded really fast, but that&#x27;s the nature of glosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may be put off a bit by the smell... the only way I can think of to describe it is &#x27;old ladyish&#x27;, but really it&#x27;s not bad. I actually like it. Maybe I&#x27;m an old lady.</li>
    <li> This BB cream really works wonders.  Great consistency and color.  Stays on for the entire day with just a touch near the nose.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My first impression about this BB, It is soft and has good recovery in my skin, but my skin is oily and this product say: for dry and exhausted skin. I loved my sample, thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes: very light in color, went on nicely, exactly what I expected from Skin 79 regarding quality. Smells great. Good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: packaging (the pump is weird) cream blush/lip color (it&#x27;s a good color but doesn&#x27;t stay on well) I have oily skin and this BB  didn&#x27;t have staying power to it. I also have sensitive skin and this caused a rash, however I do not blame the product for this just know if your sensitive this might be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will be good for light complected, dry skinned people, who are not sensitive.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews decided to try the product and have been using it for 7 days. Well, the pump worked twice, now it doesn&#x27;t, so I unscrew the top, dab a little on finger and then apply it to my face. You don&#x27;t need a lot of the product a small dab will suffice.  There is no dewiness to the product; it goes on grayish and with a matte finish. Thinking this product is for oily skin not dry. I do apply moisturizer first, wait a few minutes for absorption, then apply the product. Will continue to use it for another week or two, reevaluate and then post an update.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this after reading reviews. But, alas, when I tried this on... first of all the design of the pump is really messy (I don&#x27;t like that you have to wipe away all the excess every time you want to use a little), and secondly, I found the color of the cream on my skin to be so gray. When I looked at myself in the mirror, it looked more like zombie makeup...it just took any brightness in my skin and turned it a dull grey. I&#x27;m Asian and have fairly  warm, tan undertones.  I have used the blush independently and it&#x27;s good. But not worth buying the whole thing. Overall, disappointing purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this from SeoulGlamour and they would not combine shipping even though I bought 6 items from them at the same time. So, that was disappointing as well.</li>
    <li> This product has a whitening effect and makes your skin look pale.  I also thought it made fine lines more noticeable.</li>
    <li> A medium coverage buildable be cream. Loved the lip/cheek tint built into the lid. Makes a really nice space saving addition to an overnight bag.</li>
    <li> I love this product but to be quite honest I&#x27;m really unsure since this BB cream I revived does not have an authentic sticker on the back I&#x27;m really concerned if it&#x27;s a true product or not although the pump at the bottom looks tampered with I have to say that it works nicely and fit&#x27;s my  pale/ yellow skin complexion</li>
    <li> Amazing BB cream, it goes perfect on my skin, and I am Hispanic.</li>
    <li> i love this product because it is ideal for everyday use. it has good moisture that moisturizes and at the same time has good coverage with skin. i will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this bb cream because a youtuber I follow raved about it but this just didn&#x27;t look good on me. I typically wear a natural beige for most bb creams and this was too light for me.  It also emphasized dry flakes on my skin and looked a bit cakey. I think this bb cream would be better for people with oily skin that want a matte finish without having to powder.  Personally, I prefer a bb cream with a slightly dewy finish</li>
    <li> This is one of by favorite BB creams.  I&#x27;m really pale and this blends to my color, can&#x27; be slightly ashly if I use to much, Half a pump works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Skin79&#x27;s products; previously I used their VIP Label BB Cream. I decided to change as, per their website, this BB Cream might be more of what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fair-skinned girl, been mistaken for Natalie Dormer on too many occasions if that tells you anything about my skin tone, and this works wonderfully. It is long lasting and it covers minor blemishes beautifully. It goes on very smoothly. The Color looks great, especially on my lips, but I still prefer my Cargo blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the container itself. The foundation coming out the top makes things really messy -- I don&#x27;t know why this stuff doesn&#x27;t come in a pump similar to their other products. I&#x27;ll buy it again because it&#x27;s good, I just wish they&#x27;d fix this flaw.</li>
    <li> The only other bb cream I have tried is dr. Jart black label. That bb cream is a full coverage cream.  This cream is great! It offers better coverage than a tinted moisturizer, evened out the slight rosacea and any small blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and am very irish looking. The color of the cream was perfect. I usually buy the &#x27;natural ivory&#x27; foundation colors, so i was worried about the color of this cream,  as it appears to be marketed to a mainly Asian populaion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did after applying this cream, was to use a translucent mattifying powder, as I was a little shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! And the lip and cheek tint is great! Loved the color on that too. Having it all in the same package is handy.</li>
