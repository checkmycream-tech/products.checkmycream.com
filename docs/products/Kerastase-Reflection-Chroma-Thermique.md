      <li>I love everything about this product...</li>
      <li>I love spoiling my hair and don&#x27;t mind spending the money for better products</li>
      <li>me that this would be better to use since I color my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is looking better and seems to be healthier</li>
      <li>Buying it off this website was a better deal than through my hairdresser.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon.</li>
      <li>My still-brown hair has never looked so great, thanks to</li>
      <li>But I do love the idea of having UV protection in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have I said I love this product?</li>
      <li>From my perspective, the Chroma Thermique is the best conditioner on the market and is money well spent.  </li>
      <li>Even on the most humid day my hair was frizz free and had bounce.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair more sleek and smooth after blow drying.  </li>

      <li>It does have a strong floral fragrance when applied, but that dissipates.</li>
      <li>The leave in conditioner is wonderful - my hair does not feel weighted down or oily after using it, and no residue makes it way to my pillow even if I apply it just before going to bed.</li>
      <li>I had to search a bit on line to fine a list of ingredients  in this stuff (</li>
      <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>

      <li>Got great comments by the second day I used this product.</li>
      <li>this is more money, but worth it.</li>
      <li>It smells great and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel as dry as I know</li>
      <li>Tried it and it made my hair feel great without weighting my fine hair down.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hesitant to give them up to see if the Protecting Milk alone can keep my color full of life.</li>
      <li>it smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft, shiny, healthy and very manageable.  </li>
      <li>and I think I&#x27;ve found it in Kerastase Reflection Chroma Thermique Thermo Radiance Protecting Milk (try saying that quickly five times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair very manageable and easy to style.  </li>
      <li>It has a very nice smell, goes a long way and works very well at protecting your hair.  </li>
      <li>Another $$$ product well worth</li>
      <li>Sure it makes your hair feel soft but it&#x27;s not a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>One tip: you only need about a pea sized amount of product to be effective.</li>
      <li>but this was a far more reasonable price for the product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old and have fine hair that tends to get oily so conditioners are something I stay away from, until I tried this.</li>
      <li>which is what I should have done in the first place).  </li>
      <li>My hair was silky smooth and felt like I had a professional blow-out.</li>
      <li>I love this product since I use a flat iron almost every time I do my hair.  </li>
      <li>I bought a travel sized container and ended up using it over all my other thermal protectant products long after my vacation because I liked it so much better than the others.</li>
      <li>My stylist recommended that I treat my highlighted hair a bit more gingerly this summer, as I have long and abused tresses.</li>
      <li>, the product is really nice, not heavy works well with blowdry, curling, and flat ironing.</li>
      <li>I first received this as a free sample and applied it only on my ends.</li>
      <li>Helps my dry hair looks shiny and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t even know it is in my hair except that my hair is super soft.  </li>
      <li>It makes blow drying easier and makes my hair super soft.</li>
      <li>Also, it really reduces flyaway, brittle hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I have very frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Now I use the whole line.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very luxurious.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something new to help my hair not be so dry from all the blow drying and found this through my hair dresser - love it.</li>
      <li>Hands down my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>The next morning, my hair is light, voluminous, soft and shiny...</li>
      <li>Great if you have thick coarse, color treated hair.</li>
      <li>Kerastase products are always dependable; this one is exceptionally good for helping my wavy hair maintain a straight sleek look with no fly aways.</li>
      <li>This is the leave in stuff for beat up thick hair, love the smell, texture and the way it leaves my hair!</li>
      <li>Really helps mature and color treated hair.</li>
      <li>Now, I use it all the time and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>and they were EXACTLY the same, so why not go cheaper and have it come to your door?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> WIFE USES IT. I TRIED IT. IT WAS GOOD BUT STICKING WITH DOVE WHICH DOES THE JOB. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT IF YOU WANT TO SPURGE ON SHAMPOO.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this prior to my vacation as a product to protect my colored highlighted hair from the sun as well as one that protects from heat styling. I bought a travel sized container and ended up using it over all my other thermal protectant products long after my vacation because I liked it so much better than the others. It smells so good and leaves my hair super shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Works great.  Don&#x27;t even know it is in my hair except that my hair is super soft.  And it styles great with no additional products.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended that I treat my highlighted hair a bit more gingerly this summer, as I have long and abused tresses. He got me started with this Kerastase Chroma Reflection line. The leave in conditioner is wonderful - my hair does not feel weighted down or oily after using it, and no residue makes it way to my pillow even if I apply it just before going to bed. The next morning, my hair is light, voluminous, soft and shiny... everything you hope for when you wake up.    I had previously thought that expensive \\&quot;salon\\&quot; hair products were the same as what you buy at the grocery store, just with a much larger price tag, but this line, and specifically this leave-in conditioner have changed my mind. It&#x27;s amazing what one month of use has done to my hair!    I would give this product 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the steep cost, but even with that I&#x27;ve been converted!</li>
    <li> I like the way this product makes my hair shine and feel.  I have used it before but this was a far more reasonable price for the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and have fine hair that tends to get oily so conditioners are something I stay away from, until I tried this. I first received this as a free sample and applied it only on my ends. As I was blow drying my hair I could tell this was something different.

    <li> I really like this product. It makes blow drying easier and makes my hair super soft. It smells good too!</li>
    <li> If you color your hair then you need this product, you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair after use it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> I had used this in the past then switched to something else. Nothing works as well for brittle hair like this does! Kudos to Neon &amp; Noble. Fastest service ever!</li>
    <li> I have colored hair- use a blow dryer every day .  I LOVE  this product - it&#x27;s not the least bit heavy- or greasy, and helps protect my hair from the hot dryer❗️</li>
    <li> Love this product for color treated or non color treated hair.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Great styling product for my course, curly, greying hair.  It gives lots of shine and helps shape my curls.  Very expensive, though.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my curly hair.  Buying it off this website was a better deal than through my hairdresser.  It has done an excellent job keeping the color from fading or changing.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I have wave, unattractive curl and frizz. This product tames my hair, conditions it and gives great shine.</li>
    <li> It took over a month for me to get the product in the mail. When I inquired about what the hold up was, they simply said it is because they are in Europe... hmmm I would have been better of buying it at a salon and spending a few extra bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product is really nice, not heavy works well with blowdry, curling, and flat ironing. I am happy with the product</li>
    <li> This is one of the top thermal protective products in my opinion.  It has a very nice smell, goes a long way and works very well at protecting your hair.  Makes my hair more sleek and smooth after blow drying.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The very best product to protect your hair when blow drying or using any heated devise!</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair. I have probably tried two dozen other products. I received this Kerastase product as a gift. Love it! First product I&#x27;ve used that actually continues to work the next day. Very expensive, but one bottle lasts me for about a year. One tip: you only need about a pea sized amount of product to be effective. I have medium thickness hair and that amount does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I went to the hair salon, and my stylist greeted me, saying that my hair was bouncy!  My still-brown hair has never looked so great, thanks to this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the money.  Shipping took 3 weeks, as it came from England.  I could buy it at my hair salon, but I save a little money buying it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a leave-on product.  I use a nickle-size amount on my chin-length hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something new to help my hair not be so dry from all the blow drying and found this through my hair dresser - love it.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite hair product. Smells divine. I put it in damp hair prior to brushing it out which totally eliminates snags. Also, it really reduces flyaway, brittle hair.</li>
    <li> I had used the Kerastace Nectar Thermique, prior to purchasing this product.  The person selling it&lt;br /&gt;advised me that this would be better to use since I color my hair.  To my disappointment, it is not half&lt;br /&gt;the product the Nectar Thermique is and for the same money, I&#x27;d like to return it to exchange it for the&lt;br /&gt;Nectar Thermique.  No comparison..</li>
    <li> This product was a huge disappointment!  The results were good to average - not spectacular which is what I would expect from a &#x27;premium&#x27; product that costs a premium price.  I got the same if not better results from Tresamme Thermal leave in spray I already had.  I had to search a bit on line to fine a list of ingredients  in this stuff (which is what I should have done in the first place).  There is nothing &#x27;premium&#x27; about the ingredients - just lots of silicone. It&#x27;s the same type of stuff that is used to caulk your tub. Sure it makes your hair feel soft but it&#x27;s not a moisturizer. That crazy slick feel is not because your hair is suddenly healthy - the polymers are just filling in the little cracks and making the shaft feel slick. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that but why pay a ton of money when you can get the same feel for less? Maybe the extra bucks were for the fancy container.</li>
    <li> Several years ago my straight hair developed some frizziness in weird places. Since then, I&#x27;ve been looking for something to reliably tame those frizzies and I think I&#x27;ve found it in Kerastase Reflection Chroma Thermique Thermo Radiance Protecting Milk (try saying that quickly five times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Milk” is a bit of a misnomer. This is a thick, white cream. It&#x27;s very luxurious. It does have a strong floral fragrance when applied, but that dissipates. I used it this morning and 12 hours later, I don&#x27;t smell it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has added shine since I started using the protecting milk and my frizzies are gone! Have I said I love this product? My worst hair problem has been resolved.  My hair feels soft and silky, yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already collected an arsenal of products to keep my color from fading. I&#x27;m hesitant to give them up to see if the Protecting Milk alone can keep my color full of life. But I do love the idea of having UV protection in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product. It smells great and it works to keep my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It allows me to blow dry and use the hot iron without damaging my hair and it decreases any frizz. Love it!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price, but the Amazon price makes it a little less painful. I would recommend this to someone who has color treated hair and is looking for a little extra shine.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product...it smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft, shiny, healthy and very manageable.  I have very dry and course hair...this works miracles for me!</li>
    <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very manageable and easy to style.  I have fairly thick medium-texture wavy hair and this allows me to style it straight.  My hair feels healthy and clean after using the product.  No heavy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. It has completely changed my hair&#x27;s texture in a matter of a couple months, also I have used the more expensive product purchased direct from a high end salon as well as this which was cheaper and they were EXACTLY the same, so why not go cheaper and have it come to your door?</li>
    <li> I like this product for its smoothing properties but will be looking at less expensive choices when I buy in the future.</li>
    <li> A must for color tx hair. Great if you have thick coarse, color treated hair. Use every other day, but you should alternate shampoos because your hair becomes to use to it and then gets a bit limp.</li>
    <li> Best hair product on the market, my hair is always soft, shiny and manageable. I couldn&#x27;t live without this!!!</li>
    <li> This is the leave in stuff for beat up thick hair, love the smell, texture and the way it leaves my hair! Another $$$ product well worth the money bottle last forever! Just need a dab.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and love it.  It really helps with daily hair drying and use of the curling iron.</li>
    <li> This is a real Kerastase product, which is the best for my hair. Blond color-treated hair, thin. Way above Redken, which was my previous favorite this is more money, but worth it. Now I use the whole line.</li>
    <li> Product was used, and appeared to be altered. I will not purchase from seller again and do not recommend</li>
    <li> This product has been a Godsend for my hair.  It makes it shiny and managable. However, if you use too much it can look dull so be careful.  I use 1/2 teaspoon and blow dry my hair and this seems to maximize it&#x27;s benefits.  It also lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Even helps detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> While on a cruise to Hawaii and Tahiti, my hair became rather dried out and the spa on the ship had this product and gave out samples.  Tried it and it made my hair feel great without weighting my fine hair down.  Just use a dime size.  Gives lots of shine too.</li>
    <li> I love this product since I use a flat iron almost every time I do my hair.  It smells great and my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel as dry as I know it should with all of the heat I put on it.  I&#x27;m also glad I can get it on Amazon.com because the only other place is Gene Juarez.</li>
    <li> Got great comments by the second day I used this product. Will continue to purchase this product as long as it remains&lt;br /&gt;at this great price!</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars but it is way over priced! My hair is looking better and seems to be healthier but I am using the KERASTASE Reflection Bain Chroma Riche Shampoo also so who knows which one is working or if it is the combination..I won&#x27;t pay that price again, if it were cheaper I would keep using it but I am not going to keep using it at that price..Now that my hair is in better shape I think it will be okay, I had damaged it using bleach..</li>
    <li> After I got my hair highlighted for the very first time, my hair stylist recommended Redken as a leave-in conditioner but it left my hair stringy and hard to manage. I looked around for an alternative product and found this. Now, I use it all the time and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  I can blow dry my hair with a high heat setting without worrying about drying my hair out.  It always comes out soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great product. Luv the way it helps with blow drying my hair. Don&#x27;t need a lot to help you tame the dry , unmanageable hair</li>
    <li> Kerastase products are always dependable; this one is exceptionally good for helping my wavy hair maintain a straight sleek look with no fly aways.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner but very pricey! I would buy it again but not after I do some serious price searching first.</li>
    <li> This product really helped tame frizz and adds softness and shine to my normally curly thick hair when used before blow drying or straightening. Love it!</li>
    <li> While this product has been used on me at the salon I go to, I did not feel I got even close to the same results. At the salon this product leaves my hair with fantastic shine. At home, even using a small amount, it made my hair feel almost dirty and it did not deliver any shine at all. I would say it is just a matter of a stylist vs me putting it on but I followed the same routine and used the same amount (very sparing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerastase is a l&#x27;oreal product. I love spoiling my hair and don&#x27;t mind spending the money for better products but personally, I will continue to use a less expensive l&#x27;oreal product that I have much better results with.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this because I&#x27;m so used to paying $45 for it at my salon.  I figured &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll buy it and if it&#x27;s fake I&#x27;ll throw it away but if it&#x27;s real, I will have scored BIG time!  Well it&#x27;s the same exact Kerastase that I pay tons of money for at the salon.  I definitely will be buying it on Amazon from now on.  I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kerastase hair products for many years.  From my perspective, the Chroma Thermique is the best conditioner on the market and is money well spent.  A little bit of the conditioner goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product ! I have used it for several years, and it works well. It keeps my hair from getting fried when using a hair dryer and flat-iron every day !!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Helps my dry hair looks shiny and healthy.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Really helps mature and color treated hair.</li>
