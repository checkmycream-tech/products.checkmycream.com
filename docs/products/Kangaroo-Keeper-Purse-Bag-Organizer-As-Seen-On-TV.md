      <li>This organizer works great.</li>
      <li>they are great organizers...</li>
      <li>they are still in great shape..</li>
      <li>Great concept, but the material isn&#x27;t all that pleasant...</li>
      <li>good luck getting it out.  </li>
      <li>They are good for organization.</li>
      <li>but you have to find the perfect bag to fit this.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the perfect fit for my Juicy Couture Daydreamer Tote.   </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Bought the Kangaroo Keeper and haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet!  </li>
      <li>whichcan&#x27;t be healthy for us to be smelling!</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a nice purchase for my purse, but I regret spending the money.  </li>
      <li>You can get Velcro to hold in place, but kind of defeats the ease of use benefit.</li>
      <li>Nice idea, but not well executed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like that it cannot stand on its own</li>
      <li>Nice idea</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s VERY strong.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these from Wal-Mart&#x27;s \\&quot;AS SEEN ON TV\\&quot; aisle, and am pretty happy with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been almost a week, and I think it is getting better.  </li>
      <li>otherwise I&#x27;d be a lot more upset.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these and am hoping to find more at BB&amp;B for Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>She carries more things in her purse then a soldier preparing for overseas duty.</li>
      <li>But I am glad I purchased them because I am sure I can make some adjustments to make them work.  </li>
      <li>It looks like there are better designed ones out there.</li>
      <li>I love the aspect of this product.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife for Christmas to swap out with her MANY handbags.  </li>
      <li>The tan is SOO much better because it allows you to see your items better.</li>
      <li>Sure there were places for all my pens</li>
      <li>So strong, that it can&#x27;t be healthy.  </li>
      <li>There are two different size organizers that I thought would be ideal for my purses.</li>
      <li>I tried stretching to fit things in but you can stretch the top all you want</li>
      <li>Other than that, great!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s as strong as when I opened it.    </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to use it yet, because after two weeks of airing out, and febreezing, the chemical odor is still so strong</li>
      <li>The odor was so strong</li>
      <li>My washer and dryer reek of a strong toxic smell.  </li>
      <li>These have no drawstrings... but have the light..</li>
      <li>Also none of my items (cell phone, check book, etc) fit into the pockets inside the carrier.</li>
      <li>The pockets don&#x27;t fit anything in them....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any bags that fit that size the way I&#x27;d like.   </li>
      <li>but that was about all I could fit in the pockets.</li>
      <li>I got home took everything out of my bag and started trying to fit things into the pockets.</li>
      <li>It would not even fit my blackberry or eyeglasses.  </li>
      <li>You cannot even fit a water bottle in the two end pockets as advertised.</li>
      <li>I have tried both sizes and found that the pockets that are built in to each bag are not the right sizes for most things that I have.</li>
      <li>One item I like to be able to retrieve fast from inside my bag is my cell phone and its gets lost in all of the pockets.  </li>
      <li>At first it had a strong odor</li>
      <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t notice an odor</li>
      <li>Mine is well made and came with no unpleasant odor.  </li>
      <li>Beyond the smell, the actual product is made with very cheap material that will easily rip.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to find that out, however, because the inserts have such a strong chemical odor that I do not want to put them into any of my purses.</li>
      <li>A few things fit fine, but most items just don&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>they just aren&#x27;t useful.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve aired it out for a week, washed, soaked, powdered, baking soda, more air etc.  </li>
      <li>The large one fits in my smallest purse!</li>
      <li>I saw this and since it had a large and small size I thought it would be great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought several sets as I&#x27;m giving them for Christmas!</li>
      <li>and a frame around the top to keep it open.  </li>
      <li>The previous reviewer is right, there is a vinyl-like smell that is very strong.</li>
      <li>Its overall design, size (I have the large) is great and functional, but I am going to have to take the loss and buy another all due to its odor</li>
      <li>The key clip is extremely convenient, and the ability to hop from purse to purse is very nice.      </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as many things as they show in the pictures and the pockets are too small to fit anything in there.</li>
      <li>The pockets are too small to fit most of the items I carry.</li>
      <li>I wish some of the pockets were of a different size, but overall the organizer fits my needs and I&#x27;m very, very glad I took a chance on this item.    </li>
      <li>I use a large eyeglasses case in the large compartment to give it stability.     </li>
      <li>What a shame it has such a strong odor as many other reviewers have said as well.  </li>
      <li>The smell is absolutely horrid.  </li>
      <li>The manufacture should step up and be responsible and take the product off the market.</li>
      <li>and I really, really need something to help organize my bags.</li>
      <li>And really?  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;organizer&amp;#34; is very flimsy and does not stand up in your purse to help organize.  </li>
      <li>I absolutly 100% reccomend these to everyone who wants to stay organized.</li>
      <li>We ordered two of these for our trip to Alaska this fall and they were better then we expected.  </li>
      <li>They kept items organized in our backpacks they we kept with through the whole trip.  </li>
      <li>I wish the materials used were of a better quality, but other than that, I find it really does help to organize my purse.  </li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about sneaky S&amp;H charges etc, and as a minimalist, I only need one set, not two, and I certainly didn&#x27;t need their \\&quot;special bonus gift\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Was excited to see this on sale at a local store.</li>
      <li>It took me a good hour to do this upgrade, but now I can use purses that I was about to throw away because they&#x27;re too deep (and dark) to find things.  </li>
      <li>The price compared to other purse organizers is much more economical and I like that it has a bottom-it makes switching purses much faster than if I had to fish out the organizer and then move my loose items.     </li>
      <li>So far for the LARGE size</li>
      <li>I was using several smaller cosmetic-type zipper bags to move my things from purse to purse, so when I saw this product, it looked as though it would do the job a little more easily.</li>
      <li>I was happy and excited but was quickly disappointed.</li>
      <li>All in all, I would recommend the Tan, Large size for a little extra organization until I find something better suited for this.</li>
      <li>I did not encounter that at all, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.</li>
      <li>nearly toxic!  </li>
      <li>Sure it can hold up to 70 items but they&#x27;ve got to be small</li>
      <li>The first time I tried to use one, I found that the pockets were so deep, I could not remove the items from them.  </li>
      <li>Easy to organize all the little things.  </li>
      <li>It made out of very flimsy nylon not substantial enough to hold its shape.</li>
      <li>I bought my first set about 12 years ago and they lasted so long..</li>
      <li>I almost returned it, but I gave it a chance, aired it out a bit and then placed in my bag.</li>
      <li>The pockets are okay, but some are so narrow and deep</li>
      <li>so my checkbook didn&#x27;t fit, I always carry a little spiral notebook (the little ones that are about the width of a checkbook or smaller), that didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>After reading some of the reviews on this item, I was wary of buying this item, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance because the item really does live up to its promise to help organize your purse.</li>
      <li>The smaller organizer fits into my standard size purses and really does help keep me organized.</li>
      <li>I can barely smell any odor at all.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t understand why companies can&#x27;t use plain old cotton or natural products!</li>

    <li> The previous reviewer is right, there is a vinyl-like smell that is very strong. I have not had this item long enough to see if the odor goes away over time, but I will not keep the Kangaroo Keepers for a different reason. There are two different size organizers that I thought would be ideal for my purses. I have tried both sizes and found that the pockets that are built in to each bag are not the right sizes for most things that I have. A few things fit fine, but most items just don&#x27;t fit. Nice idea, but not well executed.</li>
    <li> I bought my Kangaroo keepers from their website and it did take FOREVER to get them. They had a vinyl odor but within a few days it had dissipated. I&#x27;m glad I bought several sets as I&#x27;m giving them for Christmas!</li>
    <li> What a shame it has such a strong odor as many other reviewers have said as well.  Its overall design, size (I have the large) is great and functional, but I am going to have to take the loss and buy another all due to its odor whichcan&#x27;t be healthy for us to be smelling!</li>
    <li> I love the aspect of this product.  I wish the materials used were of a better quality, but other than that, I find it really does help to organize my purse.  The smell, that so many others complained about, was not that bad at all.  I do however wish that, they had lined the pockets with a fabric.  I put my reading glasses in those pockets, and they are starting to get small scratches on them.  Other than that, great!</li>
    <li> Was excited to see this on sale at a local store. I was happy and excited but was quickly disappointed. Product \\&quot;large\\&quot; holder is so small it is funny. Also none of my items (cell phone, check book, etc) fit into the pockets inside the carrier. Hence, product does not live up to advertisement. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I bought this organizer for my wife. She carries more things in her purse then a soldier preparing for overseas duty. The last time she cleaned it out she found things that had been missing for years. This organizer works great.</li>
    <li> The pockets don&#x27;t fit anything in them....if you do get something in a pocket.....good luck getting it out.  They are a lot smaller than expected.   Not functional.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a nice purchase for my purse, but I regret spending the money.  The smell is absolutely horrid.  It&#x27;s VERY strong.  So strong, that it can&#x27;t be healthy.  In fact, it&#x27;s now making my purse itself, wallet, and everything else inside smell bad.  I thought the smell would go away, but it&#x27;s been over a week now and it&#x27;s as strong as when I opened it.    Beyond the smell, the actual product is made with very cheap material that will easily rip.  The pockets are okay, but some are so narrow and deep they just aren&#x27;t useful.  Avoid this product.  It&#x27;s a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how small this item is. I got the large size and the small size. The large one fits in my smallest purse! Doesn&#x27;t hold as many things as they show in the pictures and the pockets are too small to fit anything in there. Definitely not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a local store that has an \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; section. It&#x27;s always a trial and error with those products but I figured there was no way this could go wrong and I really, really need something to help organize my bags. I&#x27;m a \\&quot;tote\\&quot; girl rather than a purse girl but with tote&#x27;s there&#x27;s barely any pockets and everything is just loose on the bottom. I saw this and since it had a large and small size I thought it would be great. I got home took everything out of my bag and started trying to fit things into the pockets. Sure it can hold up to 70 items but they&#x27;ve got to be small so my checkbook didn&#x27;t fit, I always carry a little spiral notebook (the little ones that are about the width of a checkbook or smaller), that didn&#x27;t fit. Sure there were places for all my pens but that was about all I could fit in the pockets. Some of them even had  elastic tops, totally misleading. I tried stretching to fit things in but you can stretch the top all you want, it&#x27;s the rest of the pocket that actually matters. I&#x27;m going to be returning this as soon as possible.     Luckily, I didn&#x27;t notice an odor otherwise I&#x27;d be a lot more upset. As it is, I&#x27;m out $10 bucks and 15 minutes of deciding whether to try it or not.    [[ASIN:B003XF8RWC KANGAROO KEEPER (Tan)]]</li>
    <li> I just bought the Kangaroo Keeper just a few weeks ago.At first it had a strong odor but then after about 2 weeks it went away.I \\&quot;love\\&quot; these bags.I absolutly 100% reccomend these to everyone who wants to stay organized.</li>
    <li> We ordered two of these for our trip to Alaska this fall and they were better then we expected.  They kept items organized in our backpacks they we kept with through the whole trip.  I used mine to keep track of my medications that I need to take everday.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Kangaroo Keeper at Walmart.  I haven&#x27;t tried to use it yet, because after two weeks of airing out, and febreezing, the chemical odor is still so strong, I won&#x27;t put one in my purse.  I thought perhaps Walmart got the \\&quot;rejects\\&quot; to sell, but after reading the other comments, I&#x27;m just grateful I can return mine, and not lose money on shipping charges.  My recommendation is to purchase locally, and check the odor before buying.  Personally, I will look for a different product.</li>
    <li> Just got mine..I ordered a black and tan set. there was no toxic smell? I don&#x27;t know where the reviews are from?? Possibly a competitor.. they are great organizers...I&#x27;ve had these before and I reluctantly Gave them away to my daughter in laws&lt;br /&gt;this time I&#x27;m keeping them for myself!!  I bought my first set about 12 years ago and they lasted so long.. they are still in great shape.. they came with a drawstring and no mini lights... These have no drawstrings... but have the light.. but them,  you won&#x27;t regret it..</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and there was no odor or a scent.  The items were in a plastic bag within the box.  I absolutely love these and am hoping to find more at BB&amp;B for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas to swap out with her MANY handbags.  PROS: Easy to organize all the little things.  CONS: Not good for even a medium deep purse as the edges keep falling in. You can get Velcro to hold in place, but kind of defeats the ease of use benefit.</li>
    <li> i like the idea of this product.  I would like it to be a bit wider.  The draw strings are hard to pull.  The worst part is that it smells terrible!  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Kangaroo Organizer and have used it for a month. It made out of very flimsy nylon not substantial enough to hold its shape. The inside pockets are random sizes and placements that make no sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was a waste of my $$$</li>
    <li> I found the Kangaroo Keeper locally, so didn&#x27;t have to pay the exorbitant shipping they want online.  Nice idea but it falls flat.  Or rather it falls in a bunch unless you keep it stuffed with tall items.  I knew about this flaw from reading reviews so I bought it with the intention of reinforcing with coat hanger wire.  Now mine has a frame to hold it UP (the way it LOOKS in the pictures!) and a frame around the top to keep it open.  It took me a good hour to do this upgrade, but now I can use purses that I was about to throw away because they&#x27;re too deep (and dark) to find things.  I say, don&#x27;t bother with this item.  It looks like there are better designed ones out there.</li>
    <li> The kangaroo pocket was recommended to me by a friend.  The first time I tried to use one, I found that the pockets were so deep, I could not remove the items from them.  The next thing I found was that the entire pocket would not stay in place inside my deep bag I use for a purse.  I am going to try some two-sided velco patches to see if they will hold the pockets in place inside my bag.  And I may have to do same with the pockets that are too deep.  One item I like to be able to retrieve fast from inside my bag is my cell phone and its gets lost in all of the pockets.  But I do I have another big purse that has stiffer sides and it may work in that one.  But I am glad I purchased them because I am sure I can make some adjustments to make them work.  I do like big purses.  Three stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased these from Wal-Mart&#x27;s \\&quot;AS SEEN ON TV\\&quot; aisle, and am pretty happy with it.  The pouches are plentiful, although a little cramped.  I might have preferred slightly fewer but larger pouches.  The key clip is extremely convenient, and the ability to hop from purse to purse is very nice.      Now...the smell...is rather overpowering.  I left it open overnight, and it was still bad.  I flipped it inside out, hoping to air it out, and it was still pretty bad.  I put it in my purse anyway, and have left the purse open every night in an effort to air it out.  It&#x27;s been almost a week, and I think it is getting better.  Either that or I&#x27;m just getting used to it.      Great concept, but the material isn&#x27;t all that pleasant...</li>
    <li> I just washed the Kangaroo Keeper.  The odor was so strong I thought I would be sick.  My washer and dryer reek of a strong toxic smell.  I took the KK outside to the garage until the morning.  I will be returning the toxic waste product as soon as the sun comes up!!!  Yesterday I purchase a black KK and had to return it unopened.  The bag either had mold or sand inside.  I made my purchase at Office Depot.  I returned it and went to Bed-Bath and Beyond.  They only had the beige KK.  The manager said they had to send back the black KK&#x27;s as they all had mold!!!  So, I went back to use my credit at Office Depot and bought the beige KK home.  Little did I know I had made such a dangerous purchase.  The manufacture should step up and be responsible and take the product off the market.</li>
    <li> I was using several smaller cosmetic-type zipper bags to move my things from purse to purse, so when I saw this product, it looked as though it would do the job a little more easily. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to find that out, however, because the inserts have such a strong chemical odor that I do not want to put them into any of my purses. I&#x27;ve tried spraying them with Febreeze and setting them outside to air out, and I have also sent them through a machine wash with extra detergent, but the odor persists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps over time, the smell will finally dissipate, but until then, I can&#x27;t review the performance of the product. It&#x27;s too bad, because the insert looks as though it would be quite useful... if only it didn&#x27;t smell like a vat of dry-cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews on this item, I was wary of buying this item, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance because the item really does live up to its promise to help organize your purse. The item is made of durable, quality material, and I can see it holding up for years to come. The price compared to other purse organizers is much more economical and I like that it has a bottom-it makes switching purses much faster than if I had to fish out the organizer and then move my loose items.     A concern listed in a couple of the other reviews is that the organizers smell-I did not encounter that at all, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells. The smaller organizer fits into my standard size purses and really does help keep me organized. I wish some of the pockets were of a different size, but overall the organizer fits my needs and I&#x27;m very, very glad I took a chance on this item.    I bought it through Amazon instead of the TV offer so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about sneaky S&amp;H charges etc, and as a minimalist, I only need one set, not two, and I certainly didn&#x27;t need their \\&quot;special bonus gift\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The pockets are too small to fit most of the items I carry. It would not even fit my blackberry or eyeglasses.  Lots of pockets that are useless.  You cannot even fit a water bottle in the two end pockets as advertised.</li>
    <li> Bought the Kangaroo Keeper and haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet!  This thing wreaks of moth balls... nearly toxic!  I&#x27;ve aired it out for a week, washed, soaked, powdered, baking soda, more air etc.  Still, I cannot bring myself to put it into my purse. I&#x27;ve never smelled any product so rank in my life!  What a bummer!  And really?  What in the world did they do to it?!  They must have totally soaked it in a mothball solution for MONTHS before shipment!  And made in China... hmmm... are we surprised that we may just have a seriously toxic item on our hands?</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Mine is well made and came with no unpleasant odor.  Pays to see some things for yourself.  I change handbags often and this has added some order to my life.</li>
    <li> I received the tan and black keepers. The tan is SOO much better because it allows you to see your items better. I don&#x27;t like that it cannot stand on its own but you have to find the perfect bag to fit this. I use a large eyeglasses case in the large compartment to give it stability.     So far for the LARGE size it&#x27;s the perfect fit for my Juicy Couture Daydreamer Tote.   The small versions are pretty useless so far. I don&#x27;t have any bags that fit that size the way I&#x27;d like.   There are a lot of very small pockets (pens, mascara maybe) that aren&#x27;t useful if you need to carry bigger items with you.     The smell is bad. VERY BAD! I almost returned it, but I gave it a chance, aired it out a bit and then placed in my bag. It&#x27;s been over a month and the smell has tapered off. I can barely smell any odor at all. I can&#x27;t understand why companies can&#x27;t use plain old cotton or natural products! It can&#x27;t be that much more expensive!     All in all, I would recommend the Tan, Large size for a little extra organization until I find something better suited for this. Ladies, also look into Jen Grover&#x27;s Butler Bags. They are good for organization.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;organizer&amp;#34; is very flimsy and does not stand up in your purse to help organize.  It&#x27;s a joke....  I gave my to Goodwill.....probably should have just thrown them in the trash</li>
