      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s very easy to use and a great idea for back scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>So far these have been a great replacement.</li>
      <li>Items are amazing, perfect for getting hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>The color has faded a bit, but the mesh and handles are still strong.</li>
      <li>that are much like the ones I liked.</li>
      <li>Adequate.</li>
      <li>Nice, but woven a little loosely, but still work good!</li>
      <li>but after a few times using it, it works great.</li>
      <li>I found that they stretch much more than my old one</li>
      <li>It is not too abrasive either - it is just right.  </li>
      <li>Great for elderly folks who need a little assistance washing their backs!  </li>
      <li>I like these because they make washing your back very easy.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>These are sturdily made - I am still using the first of the set.  </li>
      <li>So, be sure to wash them prior to using the first time.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>Exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But the purple colored one I have used so far emits a strong odor similar to the ink odor of some freshly printed magazines.</li>
      <li>thankfully it doesn&#x27;t make the whole bathroom smell like magazine ink.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Too high of price!  </li>
      <li>i have purchased a similar bath strap to this before and liked it enough</li>
      <li>Longer than some so is easy to grip with a bad shoulder and able to give myself a good back scrub.</li>
      <li>I love that I can scrub my whole back and not worry about wood spoiling in the shower from a wooden handle on a scrub brush</li>
      <li>They do a great job of exfoliating the skin while getting to the hard places on your body--like your back, etc.</li>
      <li>like them a  little more abrasive.</li>
      <li>VERY rough...not soft at all...</li>
      <li>These are very well made, much stronger than others I have bought locally.</li>
      <li>after washing this with towels, it was much, much better - no more sandpaper feel.</li>
      <li>At first they seemed short but they stretch quite a bit after you&#x27;ve been using them for a while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Short of a real girlfriend, nothing else scrubs your back quite as well.</li>
      <li>I have another review on a nearly identical product.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t a soft sponge</li>
      <li>Unless you have extremely sensitive skin you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
      <li>Soft and hangs on shower handle.</li>
      <li>First found these ten years ago and bought several.</li>
      <li>Could not find locally and old one just fell apart!</li>
      <li>I hoped it would air/wash out as I used it and let it hang to dry in the shower each day, but after a few days of use it still emits the strong chemical odor.</li>
      <li>No one, apparently.  </li>
      <li>My wife said at first it was a little scratchy and didn&#x27;t hold a lather well</li>
      <li>Buy the Cure Series Japanese Exfoliating Bath Towel From OHE - Super Hard Weave.</li>

<li> helps my 89 year old dad wash his back easier than any other tool/aidwe&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t find these long, braided, mesh straps anyway in my area, so I went to Amazon.  </li>
<li> It is only noticeable when wet and lathered with soap, so  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;much better but less expensive too.</li>
<li> I had searched the local store where I had previously purchased, but found only puffs.  </li>
<li> Wal*Mart and K-Mart, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and other related stores take heed!</li>
<li> It is long and wide, just use, rinse and dry.</li>
<li> Maybe they are braided too loosely.  </li>
<li> I tried several other devices, but none can compare to the ease of use and thoroughness of the braided bath rope!</li>
<li> These straps are soft, and well constructed, not like other straps I purchased that fell apart in a few weeks, and were rough and scratchy to boot.</li>
<li> They are not soft, very rough</li>
<li> Like the texture too, not too soft or too hard.</li>
<li> Driest, hardest, most inflexible loofas I&#x27;ve ever used - no matter how many times you try to soften them, they are painful and extremely frustrating to use.</li>
<li> They break in with time and aren&#x27;t quite as stiff after enough uses.</li>
<li> Only criticism is that it is hard to pull taught to get a hard scrubbing action.</li>
<li> The mesh that is on a curbed plastic handle is hard to get the middle of your back, and if you have trouble with your shoulder&#x27;s forget it.</li>
<li> Other than that, I like it.</li>
<li> but they aren&#x27;t abrasive either like some other people mentioned.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not too rough like some previous reviews.  </li>
<li> so tightly it&#x27;s hard to get a soapy lather going and hard to know if it&#x27;s completely rinsed out after using.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m ordering another version that appears to be not quite as tightly woven.</li>
<li> Got tired of trying to find locally.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to get the pressure to scrub.  </li>
<li> Why are they so hard to find on store shelves?  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re hard to find in the stores (</li>
<li> Silly of me, I know, but I saw the 4 bath straps in the illustration and even though the description says, &amp;#34;pack of 3&amp;#34; I expected 4.</li>
<li> at least the ones I&#x27;ve been in)</li>
<li> If you have bad shoulder&#x27;s this product is for you.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out a way to shorten or tighten the braid and plan tol keep them; but I am disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Junk!  Too high of price!  I got a better deal at the Dollar store and the quality of the ones at the Dollar Store are superb!</li>
    <li> These are so handy. I love that I can scrub my whole back and not worry about wood spoiling in the shower from a wooden handle on a scrub brush</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the stretchiness of these.  They would be great if it wasn&#x27;t for that.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> Adequate. Will scrub a guy&#x27;s back but not with rigor</li>
    <li> I have another review on a nearly identical product. So far these have been a great replacement.</li>
    <li> perfect, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for years. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Longer than some so is easy to grip with a bad shoulder and able to give myself a good back scrub. Like the texture too, not too soft or too hard.</li>
    <li> Some of these mesh straps wear out very quickly, but these are good quality.  I can tell they will last a while.  It is not too abrasive either - it is just right.  A good purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a worn out bath strap that looks exactly like these and thought I had found  perfect replacements.  I found that they stretch much more than my old one and it&#x27;s hard to get the pressure to scrub.  Maybe they are braided too loosely.  I&#x27;m trying to figure out a way to shorten or tighten the braid and plan tol keep them; but I am disappointed.  The colors are rather gaudy too.</li>
    <li> helps my 89 year old dad wash his back easier than any other tool/aidwe&#x27;ve tried. Gave a second pack to a friends mom and&lt;br /&gt;bought some for myself as well.</li>
    <li> These are very well made, much stronger than others I have bought locally. But the purple colored one I have used so far emits a strong odor similar to the ink odor of some freshly printed magazines. I am guessing it is the dye used. I hoped it would air/wash out as I used it and let it hang to dry in the shower each day, but after a few days of use it still emits the strong chemical odor. It is only noticeable when wet and lathered with soap, so  thankfully it doesn&#x27;t make the whole bathroom smell like magazine ink. The package I received has a white one in it. I haven&#x27;t tried that one yet, but am hoping it won&#x27;t have the same dye, or whatever this chemical smell is. Other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> Items are amazing, perfect for getting hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Could not find locally and old one just fell apart!</li>
    <li> These are great for the shower and feel really good on your back. The price is good and I will order more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I prefer these to the loofah balls.  Makes cleaning your back simple.</li>
    <li> If you have bad shoulder&#x27;s this product is for you. The mesh that is on a curbed plastic handle is hard to get the middle of your back, and if you have trouble with your shoulder&#x27;s forget it.</li>
    <li> Good bang for the buck.  The braided ropes hold their tension well.</li>
    <li> My wife said at first it was a little scratchy and didn&#x27;t hold a lather well but after a few times using it, it works great. It just had to break in</li>
    <li> i have purchased a similar bath strap to this before and liked it enough&lt;br /&gt;to try and replace it. I could not find it at the time so I ordered bath straps&lt;br /&gt;that were different. I ended up throwing them away because they were&lt;br /&gt;unsatisfactory. I gave up for some time then tried again. This time I found&lt;br /&gt;these that are much like the ones I liked. They turned out to be not only&lt;br /&gt;much better but less expensive too. I love these.</li>
    <li> I love these braided mesh bath straps. They do a great job of exfoliating the skin while getting to the hard places on your body--like your back, etc. They&#x27;re hard to find in the stores (at least the ones I&#x27;ve been in) and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It&#x27;s a no-brainer in my opinion. I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I like them a  little more abrasive. Bit it&#x27;s not too rough like some previous reviews.  Got tired of trying to find locally.</li>
    <li> Excellent products.  Why are they so hard to find on store shelves?  Wal*Mart and K-Mart, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and other related stores take heed!</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely and as described.</li>
    <li> great product...thanks</li>
    <li> These are sturdily made - I am still using the first of the set.  The color has faded a bit, but the mesh and handles are still strong. I had searched the local store where I had previously purchased, but found only puffs.  I am very glad to have found them here and have recommended to my friemds.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my parents. They love it. I personally prefer something rougher, and just for that reason I don&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> Great for elderly folks who need a little assistance washing their backs!  Soft and hangs on shower handle.</li>
    <li> First found these ten years ago and bought several. I ran out about three years ago. I tried several other devices, but none can compare to the ease of use and thoroughness of the braided bath rope!</li>
    <li> Buy the Cure Series Japanese Exfoliating Bath Towel From OHE - Super Hard Weave. Ilike it better. It is long and wide, just use, rinse and dry.</li>
    <li> Nice length and a good price.  I would buy it again.  Only criticism is that it is hard to pull taught to get a hard scrubbing action.</li>
    <li> They are not soft, very rough</li>
    <li> Driest, hardest, most inflexible loofas I&#x27;ve ever used - no matter how many times you try to soften them, they are painful and extremely frustrating to use. These belong in the garbage, and not in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and I couldn&#x27;t find them locally anymore so I bought them on Amazon. If you&#x27;ve ever used these sorts of mesh bath scrubbers before you know what to expect. They aren&#x27;t a soft sponge but they aren&#x27;t abrasive either like some other people mentioned. Unless you have extremely sensitive skin you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. They break in with time and aren&#x27;t quite as stiff after enough uses. At first they seemed short but they stretch quite a bit after you&#x27;ve been using them for a while. Once you break them in they are perfect. I like these because they make washing your back very easy. I&#x27;ve bought the scrubbers that are ball shaped before and those are a pain to use when you&#x27;re trying to reach your back. They are perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Silly of me, I know, but I saw the 4 bath straps in the illustration and even though the description says, &amp;#34;pack of 3&amp;#34; I expected 4. I realize the picture is only for the purpose of letting you know what colors you might receive. I had to double check the listing when I opened my package</li>
    <li> Things bath straps are wonderful and really hard to find, thanks Amazon for having them and great price!</li>
    <li> No one, apparently.  These are exactly what I was looking for.  Good luck finding them in a store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of a real girlfriend, nothing else scrubs your back quite as well.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what i was looking for. The picture shows 4 but the description says pack of 3 which is just what I got.</li>
    <li> Nice, but woven a little loosely, but still work good!</li>
    <li> These are braided so tightly it&#x27;s hard to get a soapy lather going and hard to know if it&#x27;s completely rinsed out after using.  Otherwise it&#x27;s very easy to use and a great idea for back scrubbing.  I&#x27;m ordering another version that appears to be not quite as tightly woven.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these long, braided, mesh straps anyway in my area, so I went to Amazon.  Low and behold I found this Swissco product, and am I happy I did.  These straps are soft, and well constructed, not like other straps I purchased that fell apart in a few weeks, and were rough and scratchy to boot.</li>
    <li> VERY rough...not soft at all...like washing with sand paper. Hoping it softens up over time.  Update to this review...after washing this with towels, it was much, much better - no more sandpaper feel. So, be sure to wash them prior to using the first time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the colors. Outside of not liking the colors or having a choice of colors, it was however shipped quicky and handle well.</li>
