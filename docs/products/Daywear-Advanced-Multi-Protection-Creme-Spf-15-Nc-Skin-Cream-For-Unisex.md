      <li>I love this cream.</li>

      <li>Love the texture and SPF coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Shiseido is much better.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite moisturizer,  love the product.</li>
      <li>Nothing better on the market.  </li>
      <li>Help keep your skin in tip top shape with this anti wrinkle, anti oxidant, no frills, face creme.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it smells good,good consistent, pleasant to apply</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good price</li>
      <li>I also think they work best if you use them together with other Estee  products.  </li>
      <li>but this works wonderfully, and it&#x27;s reduced my redness in a way that the other products couldn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey but the quality of the product is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Ulta&#x27;s fabulous face foundation primer, a bronzer and an illuminizer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cream is absolutely unbelievable, makes my skin feels so good!!!</li>
      <li>I also appreciate the mild scent and the sunscreen protection it provides.  </li>
      <li>It works okay on my skin (I got sensitive skin)</li>
      <li>I wish it had a bit more SPF, but overall a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>It helps my foundation glide right on.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, which is the same thing with that in macy&#x27;s cosmetic shop, however, the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>but after sometime outside specially when it is hot the cream on my forehead &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34;?</li>
      <li>This lotion is very lightweight and smells of cucumber fragrance.  </li>
      <li>but the SPF doesn&#x27;t really protect my skin from the sun.</li>
      <li>Such a light and inviting</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and keeps my face from being dried out throughout the day.</li>
      <li>This cream is either old, discontinued or from out of the country, it&#x27;s not terrible, but it is not the same cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 24 and my skin is very sensitive - it&#x27;s getting red even with a strong sunscreen on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure where this is coming from, but the packaging is not the same and the wonderful cucumber smell is not apparent.</li>
      <li>It is still my favorite as it is really enhanced my skin little bit and felt my skin resist sun damage (I try to minimize time under sun).</li>
      <li>I go right back</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>I actually had a smaller sample version of it that was free with a purchase.  </li>
      <li>Just lather on and scare your significant other.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin amazingly soft too.</li>
      <li>skin is SO ridiculously sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, in fact it has made my skin better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>She said her skin feels so soft and hydrated but not oily.</li>
      <li>Have been using the product for several years and highly recommend the product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>use with other products from Yonka and Clinique and it&#x27;s just the right moisturizer coverage for my normal to dry</li>
      <li>i use unscented products (cetaphil, cerave, simple) because i&#x27;m so sensitive</li>
      <li>I used it ALL up and desperately needed MORE!  </li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry, - it calms and softens.</li>
<li> The SPF is a must everyday to keep your skin looking young, but this product also takes away my dark circles as makes my akin look radiant.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a tad bit pricey (found it less expensive on Amazon), but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
<li> She use to use Clinque, but due to her age now she changed to Este Lauder.</li>
<li> She has oily skin and other moisturizers</li>
<li> Also a good base for a make up!</li>
<li> It moisturizes your face without a greasy or heavy feeling.  </li>
<li> I have used day wear for at least 10 years</li>
<li> at least five - six of the product line</li>
<li> I had a sample from a purchase I made at Dillards that she tried and it cleared up her skin and no more outbreaks!</li>
<li> SPF 15 is not enough sun protection, and I use it as a base layer underneath BB cream w/ sunscreen.  </li>
<li> we tried made it worse.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too expensive if compared with Olay.</li>
<li> down to get to my eyes and I get very horrible time trying to wipe the cream around my eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my oily skin feel oily. So, it is not what I need. Yes, it smells good,good consistent, pleasant to apply but I feel like I used a night cream. Shiseido is much better.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a regular basis. Great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like it or not. It works okay on my skin (I got sensitive skin) but the SPF doesn&#x27;t really protect my skin from the sun. It&#x27;s too expensive if compared with Olay. I used Olay and it worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and my skin is very sensitive - it&#x27;s getting red even with a strong sunscreen on. This cream is absolutely unbelievable, makes my skin feels so good!!! I love the smell and the texture and it protects my skin! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry, - it calms and softens. Also a good base for a make up!</li>
    <li> really nice for my skin.  I am a senior citizen and switched from the lotion to this creme this year.  I have used day wear for at least 10 years</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for awhile and it just makes your skin feel so good and moist!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I actually first tried this because it came in a small Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder gift set I had boughten. The smell is perfect and refreshing, and it leaves your skin luminous and glowy, yet not oily or too shiny looking. Was using Chanel hydramax moisturizer before and I just switched to this one. 10x better and a lot cheaper. I would deff recommend for any skin type.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream.  I actually had a smaller sample version of it that was free with a purchase.  I used it ALL up and desperately needed MORE!  I love the fragrance and it makes my skin feel so silky smooth!  It&#x27;s just a tad bit pricey (found it less expensive on Amazon), but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Very good product, reasonable pricing, convenient &amp; prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I started using it after trying several other moisturizes by different beauty companies.  It moisturizes your face without a greasy or heavy feeling.  I also appreciate the mild scent and the sunscreen protection it provides.  Of course, I will apply additional sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be at a beach or a outdoor event with no protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for several years and highly recommend the product if you have sensitive skin. Great Results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other products over the years, especially if I&#x27;m trying to economize, but I always come back to my Estee Lauder products.  They seem to work for me no matter my age.  I also think they work best if you use them together with other Estee  products.  I&#x27;ve done both, but I get the best results when I use daywear with Estee foundation.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the texture and SPF coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I use with other products from Yonka and Clinique and it&#x27;s just the right moisturizer coverage for my normal to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> I want to let everyone know that this is not the same cream that is sold currently in stores. I&#x27;m not sure where this is coming from, but the packaging is not the same and the wonderful cucumber smell is not apparent. This cream is either old, discontinued or from out of the country, it&#x27;s not terrible, but it is not the same cream. (See picture for comparison).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Day wear for years and I will continue to buy it.  It helps my foundation glide right on.  My skin feels great all day</li>
    <li> I love it.  Estate Lauder product is number one.  I will continue to buy it and recommended to my friend.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter and she loves it.  She always asks for it for a Christmas and Birthday gift.  She use to use Clinque, but due to her age now she changed to Este Lauder.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law uses this product daily. at least five - six of the product line so I guess it wlrks for her....</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer from 20 years. It is the best moisurizer and I worked at Macys and tried them all</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good price</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer,  love the product.</li>
    <li> ESTE PRODUCTO ES SENSACIONAL YO LO USE POR UNA SEMANA Y SE VE LOS RESULTADOS. DEJA TU PIEL TERSA Y SUAVE.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. I use it every morning and sometimes 1/2 way thru the day. The SPF is a must everyday to keep your skin looking young, but this product also takes away my dark circles as makes my akin look radiant.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Not only does it block out the Florida sun.  It keeps my skin amazingly soft too.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It goes on nice and keeps my face from being dried out throughout the day. It keeps me looking younger then I look.</li>
    <li> Have use for years.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen daughter who was having an extreme amount of outbreaks. She has oily skin and other moisturizers we tried made it worse. I had a sample from a purchase I made at Dillards that she tried and it cleared up her skin and no more outbreaks! She said her skin feels so soft and hydrated but not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 3-3.5 years. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin. I tried to replace product several times for one reason..I don&#x27;t put make up when i go out I only use cream with SPF, this one provides what I need but after sometime outside specially when it is hot the cream on my forehead &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34;? down to get to my eyes and I get very horrible time trying to wipe the cream around my eyes. It is still my favorite as it is really enhanced my skin little bit and felt my skin resist sun damage (I try to minimize time under sun). I recommend this product if you find a good way to prevent or reduce cream getting to eyes.</li>

    <li> Do compare to similar products or services and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
    <li> The Best cream I ever had!</li>
    <li> I was given the .5 oz/15 ml sample size by my grandmother and it has changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is SO ridiculously sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, in fact it has made my skin better!&lt;br /&gt;I now no longer use a foundation because it has cleared up my skin and given it a brighter more even tone. I don&#x27;t even need make up!&lt;br /&gt;If i do wear make up, I just apply this, Ulta&#x27;s fabulous face foundation primer, a bronzer and an illuminizer.&lt;br /&gt;It smells so lovely! Such a light and inviting scent.&lt;br /&gt;Normally i use unscented products (cetaphil, cerave, simple) because i&#x27;m so sensitive but this works wonderfully, and it&#x27;s reduced my redness in a way that the other products couldn&#x27;t. I feel amazing with this stuff on, i can definitely tell a difference just one sample size later (i&#x27;m almost out). I will be ordering this again and again. I am in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Estee Lauder and thank you grandma!</li>
    <li> the best- smell is lovely and the product works. love love love</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loved it!!! Just what she had asked for.  It was also with a two-day shipping and it arrived on time. So I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> does my face good! I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Nothing better on the market.  Moisturiser tends to make me break out.  I have been using this for years and every time I try something else I go right back</li>
    <li> Help keep your skin in tip top shape with this anti wrinkle, anti oxidant, no frills, face creme. Just lather on and scare your significant other.</li>
    <li> The best day moisturizer ever</li>
    <li> I love this product, which is the same thing with that in macy&#x27;s cosmetic shop, however, the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Nice face cream.  I recommend trying it</li>
