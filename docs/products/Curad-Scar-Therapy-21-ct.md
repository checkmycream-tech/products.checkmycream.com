### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good luck to you too!</li>
      <li>and they ruined a good product with the changes they made.</li>
      <li>Did not use although it looks like a good product.  </li>
      <li>It falls off very easily.</li>
      <li>The patches themselves are comfortable and move with you and stay put fairly well.</li>
      <li>I liked the product better when it was thicker because it provided better protection.</li>
      <li>The original Curad Scar Therapy pads were great - they adhered and were of significant thickness to apply pressure to the scar.</li>
      <li>The scar is healing nicely and I thank you for the fine product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll spare you the details on the how I got a huge hideous scar, but I will tell you this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>2 knees surgeries, had a &#x27;T&#x27; incision, can not even see the top scar/ incision.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy these...believe it or not BANDAID makes a hydrocolloid blister pad that works better than these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people just not for me.</li>
      <li>I thought since these are kind of self stick, they would be easier to use, but they are so unflexable, they wrinkle up and come off right away.</li>
      <li>product arrived on time and in its own packaging, which to me was important since I&#x27;ve seen sellers just wrap up the patches before and I wasn&#x27;t happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;Definitively a great product for what you can do at home, if you need better results, you&#x27;ll unfortunately need to go to a doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>The Green box of curad scar therapy worked awesome.  </li>
      <li>I never tried it on scars ive had for multiple years, but it worked great on my hypertrophic scars.</li>
      <li>It is not as good as Scar Therapy Clear Pads that I used before.</li>
      <li>My family has used it before, and they are glad that they can continue to use it, thanks to Amazon.</li>
      <li>Worth trying it out.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t skimp on quality, ask you doctor for the professional grade scaraway sheets or get them at a better price here on Amazon.com</li>
      <li>4 yr old scar from a car accident on arm &amp; reduced appearance by more than 75%</li>
      <li>The results however are totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not allergic to latex or rubber and would like to find the Clear pads which worked much better for me.</li>
      <li>They stay on for just a minute and if she moves at all it falls right off.</li>
      <li>Ive tried multiple combinations of shapes and sizes, tried putting bandaids over the the top of the Curad product without any luck.  </li>
      <li>The plastic surgeon did a great job and recommended we use Mederma, sunscreen and silicone strips for the next 1-2 years to ensure the scarring was as minimal as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The whole point of the silicone is not just to smooth the area, but keep air out to keep scar tissue from forming further.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>this is a much thinner bandage than the one they used to sell a couple of years ago.</li>
      <li>I expected more from a Curad product.</li>
      <li>The pad is much thinner than it use to be and the amount of silicon on the pad has been reduced.</li>
      <li>Have &amp;#62; 15 yrs experience as wound nurse &amp; highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Is it hard to be honest in this economy?</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone with a new or existing scar that they are trying to minimize.</li>
      <li>I felt a difference in the softness of my scar in just a few days and the way the height, thickness and color of my scar diminished over a period of weeks was nothing short of amazing.</li>
      <li>They have since changed the product, the old ones stuck and stayed on and worked!</li>
      <li>Let e know if you have the Clear pads.</li>
      <li>I still have old one from two years ago.</li>
      <li>my scar was much softer and visibly smaller.</li>
      <li>Sometimes they would come off within mere seconds of my having applied them.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product.</li>
      <li>Unless you need them on a totally flat part of your body that does not move much, these are not going to work well for you.</li>
      <li>I really regret when companies sacrifice the quality of products while keeping the price the same to make a larger profit.</li>
      <li>and I have notice major improvement to the scar.</li>
      <li>and so far I only used 16 out of 21 and there is a HUGEEEEEE differences!</li>
      <li>The pad barely adheres to the scar (rolls off).</li>
      <li>On one of my surgery scars you can barely see where the surgical cut was.</li>
      <li>My young daughter was the victim of a dog bite.  </li>
      <li>My scars are quite old, and after using The purple boxed ones, I was very scepticle to say the least.  </li>

<li> On one of my surgery scars you can barely see where the surgical cut was.</li>
<li> My young daughter was the victim of a dog bite.  </li>
<li> My scars are quite old, and after using The purple boxed ones, I was very scepticle to say the least.  </li>
<li> but it is now flat &amp; the scar thickness (after 2 surgeries in same cut)</li>
<li> My only issue is that my product was just a box with flat silicon sheets inside.</li>
<li> I finally went to my doctor who recommended Scaraway, which is a professional grade silicone that is thin and like a soft fabric, not stiff like these curad ones are.</li>
<li> When I removed it a few hours later, (you only keep it on a few hours the first time, gradually increasing the length of time each application stays on)</li>
<li> This product didn&#x27;t work on my surgical scar and the box it came in seemed old and beat up like it had been previously opened.</li>
<li> These are such poor quality compared to what they used to be, they are much thinner, they do not blend in to the skin as well due to the cloudier appearance, and they do not stay adhered anywhere near they way they used to.</li>
<li> It takes time and you need to put the patches on every day and leave them on as long as you can, all day or 12 hours+.</li>
<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> Difficult to find in other places, Amazon made it easy to order.</li>
<li> I used these to try to save a few bucks before I finally bought the medical grade ones</li>
<li> I got my cheeks pierced sometime last year, and about a month later i had developed some ugly hypertrophic scars right above the piercing (I have 8 other piercings that healed properly without any trouble).</li>
<li> These new ones don&#x27;t stay on even flat surfaces and are paper thin.</li>
<li> but it covers with minimal make up.</li>
<li> I have used them for a month and see extreme fading of my scars.  </li>
<li> I also couldnt afford to spend $30+ on other scar treatments.</li>
<li> I tried to wrap gauze over it as I have to do with the other types to keep them in place, and they still wrinkled up and came off.</li>
<li> There are now other products that deliver for less money.  </li>
<li> I then began alternating between neosporin and mederma to try to get the tiny raised skin to go down- Not effective.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed that the product is now inferior to other products and cost 2-3 times more!</li>
<li> Dont waste your money.</li>
<li> I do still have very very slight   discoloration from the scar</li>
<li> Not as heavy (thick) as previous form of product.  </li>
<li> the curads in the purple box are useless, they don&#x27;t stick, so its like flushing money down the toilet.</li>
<li> I am still going to continued to use it because I am still not satisfied with the result yet.</li>
<li> The new ones are thin, thin, thin!</li>
<li> Not effective.</li>
<li> is approx 1mm thick if that.</li>
<li> NO MORE FUNKY PIERCINGS!</li>
<li> I have used several different types of silicone pads and these are awful.</li>
<li> Not as effective&lt;br /&gt;too thin</li>
<li> This is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.</li>
<li> It is so thin that it is difficult to find when it comes off in the shower.</li>
<li> These failed on both counts.</li>
<li> Very thin sheets of silicone.</li>
<li> Too bad too as they are a bit expensive.</li>
<li> But the box was taped up like crazy.</li>
<li> I was disappointed because this product is very thin now.</li>
<li> My husband has had a very difficult time getting the skin on his knee to heal.  </li>
<li> I am sick of the emails.</li>
<li> I was accidentally scratched by my cat and had a very bad wound under my eye.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this product on my scar from my C-Section. After my 1st c-section I got a Keloid scar. For my 2nd c-section my surgeon recommended using these. I did, and did not get a Keloid scar the 2nd time.</li>
    <li> Whose idea was it to change this product? I was disappointed because this product is very thin now. It is so thin that it is difficult to find when it comes off in the shower. I never know where to look for it. I liked the product better when it was thicker because it provided better protection.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work on my surgical scar and the box it came in seemed old and beat up like it had been previously opened.</li>
    <li> The pad is much thinner than it use to be and the amount of silicon on the pad has been reduced. The pad barely adheres to the scar (rolls off). I wore the pad for almost 2 weeks with no visible improvement in the appearance of my scar.  I am very disappointed that the product is now inferior to other products and cost 2-3 times more! Furthermore, it is now inferior to what it used to be.  I used to see results within 2 or 3 days and I used to pay under $10 per box.  There are now other products that deliver for less money.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got my cheeks pierced sometime last year, and about a month later i had developed some ugly hypertrophic scars right above the piercing (I have 8 other piercings that healed properly without any trouble). I then began alternating between neosporin and mederma to try to get the tiny raised skin to go down- Not effective. I tried Scar Away gel- Not effective. I also couldnt afford to spend $30+ on other scar treatments. Then my mom brought home one sheet of Curad scar therapy that a friend had given her. i cut two tiny squares and placed them over the scars. When I removed it a few hours later, (you only keep it on a few hours the first time, gradually increasing the length of time each application stays on) my scar was much softer and visibly smaller. i used the scar pads once a day and within 2 weeks the raised tissue was back in uniform with the rest of ,y face. NO MORE FUNKY PIERCINGS! I do still have very very slight   discoloration from the scar but it covers with minimal make up. I never tried it on scars ive had for multiple years, but it worked great on my hypertrophic scars. Worth trying it out.</li>
    <li> Very thin sheets of silicone. I still have old one from two years ago. Is it hard to be honest in this economy? It is healthcare though with people involved. But well you, Curad, know this! Good luck to you too!</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of silicone pads and these are awful. Unless you need them on a totally flat part of your body that does not move much, these are not going to work well for you. My scar is on the back of my left hand. I thought since these are kind of self stick, they would be easier to use, but they are so unflexable, they wrinkle up and come off right away. I tried to wrap gauze over it as I have to do with the other types to keep them in place, and they still wrinkled up and came off. The whole point of the silicone is not just to smooth the area, but keep air out to keep scar tissue from forming further. These failed on both counts. Too bad too as they are a bit expensive. I expected more from a Curad product.</li>
    <li> I used these to try to save a few bucks before I finally bought the medical grade ones and they did not work at all. I followed the instructions to the letter and they showed no improvement at all. I was so upset because I wasted alot of time when I could have been using something that really works. I finally went to my doctor who recommended Scaraway, which is a professional grade silicone that is thin and like a soft fabric, not stiff like these curad ones are. I felt a difference in the softness of my scar in just a few days and the way the height, thickness and color of my scar diminished over a period of weeks was nothing short of amazing. On one of my surgery scars you can barely see where the surgical cut was. I learned my lesson here...don&#x27;t skimp on quality, ask you doctor for the professional grade scaraway sheets or get them at a better price here on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This product dont work&lt;br /&gt;For any use&lt;br /&gt;Is infuncional&lt;br /&gt;I didnt like the scard theraphy&lt;br /&gt;When you have a scar doesn&#x27;t have enough glue</li>
    <li> My husband has had a very difficult time getting the skin on his knee to heal.  We had this product recommended by a plastic surgeon.  We feel if it were not for Scar Therapy he would have had to have a skin graft.</li>
    <li> My only issue is that my product was just a box with flat silicon sheets inside. But the box was taped up like crazy. I didn&#x27;t think that was necessary. I took me forever to get into the box. If I do buy from you again, please make it easier for me to get to my product.</li>
    <li> I had in my medicine cabinet from years ago this product.  They have since changed the product, the old ones stuck and stayed on and worked! The new ones are thin, thin, thin! They don&#x27;t stay on well and they ruined a good product with the changes they made. I won t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I was accidentally scratched by my cat and had a very bad wound under my eye.  My doctor advised me to purchase the Scar Therapy which I immediately did.  The scar is healing nicely and I thank you for the fine product.</li>
    <li> Difficult to find in other places, Amazon made it easy to order. My family has used it before, and they are glad that they can continue to use it, thanks to Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Green box of curad scar therapy worked awesome.  I have used them for a month and see extreme fading of my scars.  My scars are quite old, and after using The purple boxed ones, I was very scepticle to say the least.  the curads in the purple box are useless, they don&#x27;t stick, so its like flushing money down the toilet.</li>
    <li> I could not get these to stay on. Sometimes they would come off within mere seconds of my having applied them.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll spare you the details on the how I got a huge hideous scar, but I will tell you this product is amazing. It takes time and you need to put the patches on every day and leave them on as long as you can, all day or 12 hours+. The results however are totally worth it. The patches themselves are comfortable and move with you and stay put fairly well. I have been using these patches for about two months and I have notice major improvement to the scar. It is lighter in color and smoother and softer than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a new or existing scar that they are trying to minimize.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a keloid scar on her shoulder from a burn about 3 years ago. These bandages will not stick. They stay on for just a minute and if she moves at all it falls right off. Not helpful or at all what it claims to be. DON&#x27;T BUY THEM!!</li>
    <li> Did not use although it looks like a good product.  Please stop asking me to review it I am sick of the emails.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t work at all . I tryed them for over a month... I&#x27;m sure it works for some people just not for me.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my doctor and it truly works! I&#x27;ve been keeping them on for 24 hours and so far I only used 16 out of 21 and there is a HUGEEEEEE differences! I am still going to continued to use it because I am still not satisfied with the result yet. I recommended this to those you have keloid or scar tissue problems like me.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. This product can not work if it does not stick on. It falls off very easily. My dermatologist recommended the product but I regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> It is not as good as Scar Therapy Clear Pads that I used before. I&#x27;m not allergic to latex or rubber and would like to find the Clear pads which worked much better for me. Let e know if you have the Clear pads. Could not find it anywhere.Thanks.</li>
    <li> 2 knees surgeries, had a &#x27;T&#x27; incision, can not even see the top scar/ incision. I used these after both knee surgeries, had a keloid starting but it is now flat &amp; the scar thickness (after 2 surgeries in same cut) is approx 1mm thick if that. Have &amp;#62; 15 yrs experience as wound nurse &amp; highly recommend.  Also I used these on a &amp;#62; 4 yr old scar from a car accident on arm &amp; reduced appearance by more than 75%</li>
    <li> These are such poor quality compared to what they used to be, they are much thinner, they do not blend in to the skin as well due to the cloudier appearance, and they do not stay adhered anywhere near they way they used to. I really regret when companies sacrifice the quality of products while keeping the price the same to make a larger profit. Don&#x27;t buy these...believe it or not BANDAID makes a hydrocolloid blister pad that works better than these. They can be purchased for about $4.</li>
    <li> Not as heavy (thick) as previous form of product.  Doesn&#x27;t stick to skin as well.  Have not noticed improvement in scars.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon. The original Curad Scar Therapy pads were great - they adhered and were of significant thickness to apply pressure to the scar. These new ones don&#x27;t stay on even flat surfaces and are paper thin. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> My young daughter was the victim of a dog bite.  The plastic surgeon did a great job and recommended we use Mederma, sunscreen and silicone strips for the next 1-2 years to ensure the scarring was as minimal as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to whether the product actually helps with scarring because I can&#x27;t get it to adhere to the largest scar.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s necessarily a problem with the product, as the scar is just underneath (about 1mm) one of her eyebrows.  Ive tried multiple combinations of shapes and sizes, tried putting bandaids over the the top of the Curad product without any luck.  I think the eyebrows and the shape of the bones under the scar are preventing the product from adhering to the skin.</li>
    <li> this is a much thinner bandage than the one they used to sell a couple of years ago. Not as effective&lt;br /&gt;too thin</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and in its own packaging, which to me was important since I&#x27;ve seen sellers just wrap up the patches before and I wasn&#x27;t happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;Definitively a great product for what you can do at home, if you need better results, you&#x27;ll unfortunately need to go to a doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
