      <li>The point is to practice with each tool and find unique looks or try and re-create a trendy style.</li>
      <li>The case they came in helps to store them where they are safe &amp; easily found.</li>
      <li>I love to be creative and get really detailed on a couple of nails.</li>
      <li>: Maybe I should have put this at the top, this is the most important in my opinion.</li>
      <li>As an artist, I thought it was very cool</li>
      <li>These are the most cheaply made brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
      <li>The quality is great and I have not noticed any shedding of any sore from these so far.</li>
      <li>Get colors you love, experiment with all the brushes and have fun!</li>
      <li>I love the brushes but they are not as easy to clean as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>This set of nail brushes and dotting tools are easy to work with and had every tool I needed.</li>

      <li>Fantastic brushes, a brush for all nail tasks.  </li>
      <li>I would have been happier buying the $20 sets I&#x27;ve seen, if I had known they were so cheap.</li>
      <li>Feel free to ask if you have any questions.</li>
      <li>So when this set became available for me to try free for review I immediately jumped on the chance.</li>
      <li>If you do acrylics you could use these square-tipped brushes to push the different acrylic colors around for tips or designs but probably not the best brushes for applying a whole acrylic nail.</li>
      <li>Brushes absorb the polish and do not come completely clean.</li>
      <li>Note - clean</li>
      <li>but I wish the brushes were easier to clean off.  </li>
      <li>(Polka dots are by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>Love it fast shipping ..</li>

      <li>, you will find a ton of cool designs.</li>
      <li>It’s really cool for practice and display and costs less than $5 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;-Experiment and be patient: I have noticed that since I started doing my own gel nails that my fine motor control is so much better.</li>
      <li>Item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>and I made all of these designs quickly.</li>
      <li>and I was able to do several interesting designs with the variety of tools.</li>
      <li>I kind of have a ridiculous amount, and even though I absolutely despise the actual nail art nail polish, I love making fun and happy designs on my nails!</li>
      <li>And not just because it has a beautiful pink design in five of the tools, but because I adore the fact that these have the real wood handles instead of the plastic ones.</li>
      <li>so I was pretty excited to try this as soon as it arrived.</li>
      <li>Simple, vintage and so cute!)</li>
      <li>And I love the pouch that it comes in, definitely makes for easy storage.</li>
      <li>She was so excited to open her present and see this new awesome kit.  </li>
      <li>and I am super happy that I have this new art kit, it definitely makes me want to buy some pretty rhinestones because I have the right tool now.</li>
      <li>The case will come in handy in the future when the brushes need to be replaced.</li>
      <li>It used to be strictly paint but recently nail art has been increasingly popular.</li>
      <li>This makes a great gift for any teenage girl or young woman.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although certain brushes are designed for a certain task, I usually mix it up and just use what looks like it would do best for the job.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping as well!</li>
      <li>Don’t get discouraged if something doesn&#x27;t turn out right.</li>
      <li>That way I can move it around to help get the right angle.</li>
      <li>they are much less runny and hold up better than using nail polish on top of nail polish in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;*Note</li>
      <li>I do my own gel nails and previously had a UV light that took 2 minutes per layer to set, now I have an LED one that takes 5-30 seconds, so</li>
      <li>/&gt;The ball tip tools are double ended, and the barrel is a two tone pink twist, really pretty and fun.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good starter set for someone that loves being creative with manicures and pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It comes with a very nice case that folds up pretty small.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I recommend you practice on some paper or unused acrylic nails first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is really a lot of fun</li>
      <li>My first design didn&#x27;t turn out all that well</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:1278b6dc20c782e033fea77ac5fa2f01]]Variety of different nail tools, to create plenty of fun nail art designs! All enclosed in a magnetic case - This brush set is well made and perfect for any girl who likes to decorate their nails - A wonderful gift idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From detail brushes, to dotting tools and fan brushes to apply glitter or powder to my nails this set is complete with every kind of brush needed for the most trendy nail designs!&lt;br /&gt;Included in the set : (3) liner brushes, (1) drawing brush, (1) detailing brush, (4) flat painting brushes, (2) gel nail brushes, (1) dotting pen, (1) curving paint brush (perfect curved lines with this tool), (2) fan brushes (5) double head acrylic dotting pens in various sizes (small to large sized dots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although certain brushes are designed for a certain task, I usually mix it up and just use what looks like it would do best for the job. (example: flat painting brush used instead as a detail brush). The point is to practice with each tool and find unique looks or try and re-create a trendy style. I love to be creative and get really detailed on a couple of nails. This set of nail brushes and dotting tools are easy to work with and had every tool I needed. No hairs were shedding from my brushes as I used them and they worked nicely. I like to practice before painting on my nails themselves which is why you will see all my examples on templates. I could not hold the camera and work on the nail art details, however the nail brushes were a joy to use and I made all of these designs quickly. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> What I expected but I thought it would at least have more acrylic brushes</li>
    <li> I have recently become addicted to nail art. I do my own gel nails and previously had a UV light that took 2 minutes per layer to set, now I have an LED one that takes 5-30 seconds, so I actually feel like I have the time to experiment with designs. I have been using this set for a couple months and love it! It comes with a very nice case that folds up pretty small. There are brushes for everything, thick to thin, soft to firm. They are very good quality. I&#x27;ve tried to experiment with every brush at least once to see what it does. The nail dotting pens are awesome for getting uniform polka dots. Here are my tips, tricks and recommendations for it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Gel: This works for gel nails. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would turn out, but I’m so happy. Gel nail polish is a little more sheer, so I do end up having to do a couple coats of the art colors, but that’s OK. The best think about gel is that when you’re trying a design and it doesn&#x27;t work out, you can wipe it off and everything underneath is still set, so you can keep trying over and over. It also lasts 2 weeks, so all of your hard work can be enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;-Black and white: After I got this nail art set I went to the beauty store to get black and white. Almost all the nail designs I have tried use one or both of them.&lt;br /&gt;-Pinterest: If you search on Pinterest you’ll find a ton of cool designs. Type in “nail” and then keywords like “tutorial”, “designs”, “art” and any holiday, you will find a ton of cool designs. A lot of them will have step by step instructions. I love the Halloween and Christmas designs!&lt;br /&gt;-Fake nails: Maybe I should have put this at the top, this is the most important in my opinion. After experimenting on my nails I realized that it would be handy to try each design on a fake nail first. That way I can move it around to help get the right angle. Then after practicing I can do it on my own nail. This also gives me a way to easily look through the designs that I have tried in case I’m running out of ideas. I also like doing this because I often do my daughter or friend’s nails and this way I can show them their options. The best product I found for this is “Clear Nail Art Tips Color Pop Display Fan False Practice Sticks&amp;#34;. It’s 50 fake nails on a long stick with a hole in the top. A screw goes through all the holes and forms a fan with the nail tips at the end. It’s really cool for practice and display and costs less than $5 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;-Experiment and be patient: I have noticed that since I started doing my own gel nails that my fine motor control is so much better. This takes time though. Think of a baby who tries picking something up and can’t, but over a few months they start using a pincer grasp and can pick small things up. Adults are the same, it takes time to be able to do these delicate designs, but with time you can. Start with simple designs and work your way up. Don’t get discouraged if something doesn&#x27;t turn out right. Practice on the fake nails and be patient. Get colors you love, experiment with all the brushes and have fun! My first design didn&#x27;t turn out all that well, it’s the gray “V” design I’m posting a picture of. It was a learning experience.&lt;br /&gt;-Start small: Start with small lines and small dots. It&#x27;s easier to make a dot bigger or a line thicker. I found that I would chose a dot and then realize it was too big. I start smaller than I think now and then I can either go up a size or spread the dot around a little. Same with my lines, since I do 2-3 coats my lines tend to get thicker anyway. I start with the thinnest I think I might want and then increase the thickness as I go.&lt;br /&gt;-Supplies and time: Set aside a good chunk of time when you’re trying these and make sure you have everything you need. I don’t want to be rushed or end up messing something up because I have to run out of the room for something. I always have these supplies handy: nail art kit, paper towels, alcohol wipes, wood stick to fix edges, Q tips, tin foil to put dots of color on, some good music and a cup of coffee. I make sure I am in a very comfortable position where I’m not having to hold my and up in the air. I also make sure my elbows are resting on something, this gives me more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely give this set 5 stars. I’m posting pictures of some of my designs and the brushes I used. I am definitely no expert and don’t claim to be. I’m in the early stages of learning, but getting this kit has really helped me branch out and try now things. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this nail art kit to anyone!

    <li> I have always wanted to do my own nail art on my own nails but never had the tools to do it so I was pretty excited to try this as soon as it arrived.I use to go to the nail salon every 2 weeks or so to get my nails done.If you go the salon or have been there you know that it costs a lot for a small nail art or charm on your nails.Well at least the place I use to go to use to charge us 3$ for one nail art design, and that is not a detailed design it is a simple flower with some dots around it.This will definitely cut costs on getting my nails done and can now do them at home and dress them up if I wanted to.This professional 20 piece nail art brush set is excellent.You get lots of variety of different brushes for different things.You can do fine details or larger designs if you wanted to.It is all in this set and you would not need anything else.I am a beginner with doing my own nail art but still managed to make them look somewhat cute.You get 5 dotters and the rest are wood handle brushes 2 of which are fan brushes.You also get a carrying pouch which will definitely come in handy to store them safely and all together since they have thin handles and could possibly loose them if you have a little one running around like I do.The quality is great and I have not noticed any shedding of any sore from these so far.I would definitely recommend them for the beginner and professionals.I used acrylic paint to paint the art on my nail they are much less runny and hold up better than using nail polish on top of nail polish in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;*Note: Sample was provided to me for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> Love it fast shipping .. Pro brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes get 5 stars for the value.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does the set include all of the basic nail art brushes, it also includes a set of ball tip tools.&lt;br /&gt;The ball tip tools are double ended, and the barrel is a two tone pink twist, really pretty and fun.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good starter set for someone that loves being creative with manicures and pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. Views and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> For the price these are good. Tips are very loose but they work well.</li>
    <li> Love this set of assorted brushes.  It seems like some of the dotting tool sizes are repeated, but you can never have enough dotting tools, I guess.  Great little starter kit for anyone new to nail art.</li>
    <li> These are the most cheaply made brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I say this because when I unpacked the brushes, 2 of the brush ends had come off. They are just poor quality. If you are getting this for a teen to play around with, fine. Just don&#x27;t expect these to last very long. I would have been happier buying the $20 sets I&#x27;ve seen, if I had known they were so cheap. Even the storage case they come in is cheap. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The only problem with these brushes is that if you use them for nail art you need real paint and not polish because the brushes do not clean easily and fall apart when you use nail polish remover to clean them. Brushes absorb the polish and do not come completely clean. they get hard and are unusable they have to be soaked in polish remover and then they fall apart.</li>
    <li> Great set to do nail art at home! My daughters spend hours doing each other&#x27;s nails with this brush set, and some of their designs are better than our local nail salon can offer. This makes a great gift for any teenage girl or young woman. Handy little storage pouch keeps everything together.</li>
    <li> All that you need for nail designs. The delivery was fast. It comes neatly packaged in a cosmetic size case with a magnetic closure. There are various dotting tools and brushes. The case will come in handy in the future when the brushes need to be replaced. My daughter and I are pleased with the set.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brushes, a brush for all nail tasks.  Great package.</li>
    <li> I love to do my own nails (including acrylics) but I have never done much experimenting with nail art. So when this set became available for me to try free for review I immediately jumped on the chance. I spend a lot of money on beauty stuff and nail glitter, Polish, etc. I thought this brush/dotting set was a great price with a nice assortment. When I got them, the brushes were all in great condition and nicely packed in a folding carrying case. Each individual brush and dotting tool has a separate slot. They look to be comparable quality to other nail brushes I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon. I wanted to try them out and I was able to do several interesting designs with the variety of tools. Please keep in mind I have not done much by way of designs, I usually put some glitter or small nail stickers in my acrylics but I haven&#x27;t done much with painting. I was able to do several different things and I thought they turned out pretty decent for my first try. If you do acrylics you could use these square-tipped brushes to push the different acrylic colors around for tips or designs but probably not the best brushes for applying a whole acrylic nail. This set is definitely a nice thing to have if you are interested in doing your own nail designs! I recommend you practice on some paper or unused acrylic nails first.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of brushes. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my acrylic painting hobby. I needed some small brushes for fine detail work.</li>
    <li> Yes! It was getting too expensive to go to the salon regularly, plus with a baby and 3 kids, who has time? Got this to try out the funky nail art on the ring finger that I see on some of these YouTube videos. This set is awesome because  it is inexpensive, has several types of brushes and the roll up case! I was afraid of clean up after using brushes in nail polish, but with a little acetone they cleaned up great and the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out. My oldest daughter managed to paint wolf paw prints on her nails with these for school spirit days - lots of compliments. Note - clean well immediately after each use! We lost one and found it later. We got the part off but it just wasn&#x27;t as soft and flowing afterward.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes but they are not as easy to clean as I had hoped.  I guess the brushes get too much nail polish when you use them to get completely off.  I love what they can allow my daughter to do with her nails but I wish the brushes were easier to clean off.  I would purchase them again though because they do work very well to make designs.</li>
    <li> I love this set; it has everything this nail art newbie needs to create designs. So far, the brushes have held up well after cleaning.  It&#x27;s a great bundle of tools for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice assortment of small brushes &amp; a few dotting tools. The case they came in helps to store them where they are safe &amp; easily found.</li>
    <li> I do my nails at home, fingers and toes. It used to be strictly paint but recently nail art has been increasingly popular. As an artist, I thought it was very cool but didn&#x27;t really have the tools to implement. This set had provided me with everything I need to rock out some awesome designs. (Polka dots are by far my favorite! Simple, vintage and so cute!) This set it large and everything needed to get started. The brushes and tools are high quality. All kept nice and neat in a protective pouch. I really love this set. *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes as a gift for my friends daughter.  She was so excited to open her present and see this new awesome kit.  Later on in the day she was already using the kit to paint her nails.  The brushes are well made and provide an excellent variety of brush styles.  Thank you for the awesome kit, I am sure it will bring her tons of happy nights.</li>
    <li> I love the quality and variety of the brushes. The dotting tools are wonderful and a necessity for any nail art! The bundle case it came in is a huge help in space saving! Super fast shipping as well! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I seem to have an obsession with anything that has to do with nail polish. I kind of have a ridiculous amount, and even though I absolutely despise the actual nail art nail polish, I love making fun and happy designs on my nails! I just prefer to use regular nail polish instead of the nail art polish. Hence the need for the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way that regular nail polish dries, and using brushes and different nail art tools is way more fun. I think, that&#x27;s definitely my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I absolutely adore this kit. And not just because it has a beautiful pink design in five of the tools, but because I adore the fact that these have the real wood handles instead of the plastic ones. I like wood way more than I like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 20 piece set is amazing for its price. I&#x27;ve never seen a set that has 20 different pieces for this price. And I have been looking, so I am very happy with this! And I love the pouch that it comes in, definitely makes for easy storage. And, since I seem to have an issue with loosing brushes, I feel like this case is going to make me want to keep this set together. Which I appreciate since after I&#x27;m done with my nails the last thing I do is clean and leave them by the sink. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a lot of fun and I am super happy that I have this new art kit, it definitely makes me want to buy some pretty rhinestones because I have the right tool now. And it definitely makes me want to buy some glitter! Doing glitter nails without the right tools is such a paaaaain!!! I can have rock star nails soon!!! Yaaaay!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
