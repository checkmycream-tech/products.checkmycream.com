      <li>This is okay.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this night (and sometimes in the daytime!) cream for many many years.</li>
      <li>Other than purchasing from a friend how makes her own quality products, this was the best place to locate the BB Carrot Night Creme!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, best ever for very dry skin!  </li>
      <li>Since I had almost a full jar left after I decided I didn&#x27;t want it on my face, I happened to be looking for a way to use it up when my cuticle cream ran out...low and behold this stuff is GREAT for your cuticles!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is really good for skin that has had too much sun exposure over the years, helps to repair the damage, re-hydrate, detox the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>This stuff has made a world of difference very quickly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have especially dry skin, but have found an excellent use for this cream--</li>
      <li>, I did not see any difference with my fine lines as others have claimed.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon, but liked it so much that I thought I should leave a review.  </li>
      <li>hope it stays available online.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cheap too.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin, wrinkles, and my mild sunburn!  </li>
      <li>As a former cosmetics and skin care professional I can tell you that this night creme is wonderful!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d go to be with clean hair and wake up with</li>
      <li>I bought this because there were so many positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I love the smell though, and it makes a great hand or foot cream if you use just a small amount.</li>
      <li>so I am not as relentless about catching them in time, but when I have, this prevents it from becoming an actual age spot...</li>
      <li>It might be too thick for some people, but it&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
      <li>Goopy and smells sickenly sweet like vanilla frosting.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes fairly well, but smells so gross,</li>
      <li>will say that my face ends up pretty smooth in the morning, and that I like that there&#x27;s vitamin E and other great oils in this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have dry regular to skin and this works best for me.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, fast delivery, accurate description of what the produce is, this is not the first time I purchased this product and it will not be the last.</li>
      <li>It is excellent to use during winter when my skin gets very dry and even patchy above my eyes.</li>
      <li>Once I washed it off, I think my skin did actually look nice and rosy, but it&#x27;s just not practical.  </li>
      <li>but it is so nourishing for the skin that it&#x27;s worth using.</li>
      <li>jar size...just wish there were a bigger jar of it available because I like to use it on my hands also. :)</li>
      <li>and I guarantee your smile will get brighter and whiter!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that it is almost all natural.</li>
      <li>I was starting to deal with some challenging issues on my face and the other cremes I was using just weren&#x27;t making me look as great as I felt.</li>
      <li>(as in, can&#x27;t exactly sleep on my sides right away unless I want a greasy pillow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this is the first product I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend to anyone with</li>
      <li>This is my favorite facial moisturizer!  </li>
      <li>The vasaline like cream  never gets fully absored so you will  wake up with a layer of it under your eyes unless it rubbed off on your pillow first.</li>
      <li>I love to use this especially in the winter time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and think and normally during the winter I get dry patches on my face.  </li>
      <li>Love it for really moisturizing my now dry skin and reducing wrinkles.</li>
      <li>This product is natural and is great for extra dry spots - or skin that cracks.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much of it</li>
      <li>I really like it after a bit too much sun.</li>
      <li>It smells very carrot-y.</li>
      <li>I really like the way it makes my skin look and feel really refreshed in the morning.  </li>
      <li>wish I figured this out much sooner).</li>
      <li>Very wax-y greasy creme.</li>
      <li>I love the moisturizing aspect, smell is not great but love burts bees products , will continue to use.</li>
      <li>Sits on top of the skin and is not absorbed because it is just like petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>just really gross, sort of like sickeningly sweet play-doh.  </li>
      <li>I would try to hold my breath and just rub it in really quick, but finally I remembered I&#x27;m a grown up</li>
      <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best night creme ever! All other night creams are &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; on my sensitive skin. Not this one. Absolutely the perfect product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell.  I put a little on every night and hope it keeps the wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past.  I really like the way it makes my skin look and feel really refreshed in the morning.  The natural ingredients are a plus.  I have only found it in the 1 oz. jar size...just wish there were a bigger jar of it available because I like to use it on my hands also. :)</li>
    <li> best product Burts Bees has in my opinion. I have dry regular to skin and this works best for me.</li>
    <li> So this stuff is totally a greasy, waxy film that never quite sinks into your skin.  When I tried using it, I would wake up with my face as sticky as it was when I went to bed.  Once I washed it off, I think my skin did actually look nice and rosy, but it&#x27;s just not practical.  It gets all over your pillowcases and your boyfriend will never want to touch your face at night.  Can be a real mood killer, if you know what I mean.  The only person who should really try this is a person who has EXCEPTIONALLY dry skin that LITERALLY nothing else will moisturize.  Otherwise you will just end up a grease ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I found another great use for it.  Since I had almost a full jar left after I decided I didn&#x27;t want it on my face, I happened to be looking for a way to use it up when my cuticle cream ran out...low and behold this stuff is GREAT for your cuticles!  Yes, still a little greasy but just apply it sparingly and it makes your fingers look great!</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizing aspect, smell is not great but love burts bees products , will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with extremely dry skin for years. My face gets scaly and i can&#x27;t wear most makeup. This stuff has made a world of difference very quickly. I use it twice a day, morning and night. It is greasy, so i apply it a little lighter in the morning, let it sit for five minutes or so then blot with a tissue and apply my makeup as usual. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Always a great overnight cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream for years and have not been unhappy with it. I have sensitive skin with some skin problems. It keeps my skin moist throught the night. Would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this creme. When I awake in morning my skin is so soft. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, but this felt like Crisco smeared on my face. I love the smell though, and it makes a great hand or foot cream if you use just a small amount.</li>
    <li> I use this creme not only at night but during the daytime too. I alternate with the carrot day creme. Some people think it is a bit too greasy but after a few minutes it just is absorbed by your skin. It is excellent to use during winter when my skin gets very dry and even patchy above my eyes. Good in summertime too. HIghly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with MSM cream for my day and night face cream.  Works great!  Mix 50/50, on dampen skin.</li>
    <li> yep, it&#x27;s thick and has a greasy/gooey feel but it is so nourishing for the skin that it&#x27;s worth using. For me, I can really only use this at night as intended and definitely not on \\&quot;date\\&quot; night with hubby (too greasy)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really good for skin that has had too much sun exposure over the years, helps to repair the damage, re-hydrate, detox the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it for emerging age spots on the body as well as a spot treatment (if you catch them when they are just a red, scaly patch before turning brown, dab this on several times a day until the spot goes away. Unfortunately, I have fair skin and freckles so I am not as relentless about catching them in time, but when I have, this prevents it from becoming an actual age spot...wish I figured this out much sooner). {note: I have not found this to help already set in brown age spots lighten, just to heal the emerging ones}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I just kept this on hand for the age spot treatments but recently, when it became apparent that my face was showing serious age related conditions, I pulled it out of the cabinet to use as a night &#x27;cream&#x27; and even the first overnight treatment helped immediately hydrate the skin which lessened the deepness of the lines/wrinkes and seemed to have a healing effect on the skin (tone &amp; pores --not tightening but cleansing perhaps). So I&#x27;m going to make a concerted effort to try it each night for the next 30 days to heal my summer ravaged skin and see what happens. (hence being online to buy more)  Also, other reviewers have mentioned this but don&#x27;t be frustrated when you receive a small jar if you&#x27;ve never seen it before...a little goes a long way and is well worth the cost.  I haven&#x27;t tried the day cream yet and may add that to the new regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin, wrinkles, and my mild sunburn!  Feels a little greasy unlike the day cream, but worth it for the benefits I get!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years - but can&#x27;t find at any retail location, so I buy it online at Amazon.  This product is natural and is great for extra dry spots - or skin that cracks.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll use it all over my face at bedtime to help against that icky, dry winter skin.  It&#x27;s even helped areas on my face that get repeated winter after winter as a trouble area - and this clears it right up!&lt;br /&gt;I would freak out if I didn&#x27;t have access to it.</li>
    <li> The carrot night creme is great.  I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon, but liked it so much that I thought I should leave a review.  I am a Black woman in my laaaaate twenties, and was looking for a night creme that was good to stave off crow&#x27;s feet, and deal with the odd problems of combination skin.  I am also allergic to a great many things.  This creme smells fresh and not too carrot-y; it is thick and you only need a little bit; but, when you wake up in the morning, your skin will look great.  It helps to clear up rashes/break outs over night.  I would highly recommend this for problem skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m in my forties, however, I wish I had found it sooner! It&#x27;s thick, so you only need the littlest bit. I was starting to deal with some challenging issues on my face and the other cremes I was using just weren&#x27;t making me look as great as I felt. This product did the trick!</li>
    <li> Goopy and smells sickenly sweet like vanilla frosting. Has an orange tint to it that stains white clothing (and pale skin) Also burned the super dry areas of my face. I like all the other Burt&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried but I&#x27;ll never touch this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, fast delivery, accurate description of what the produce is, this is not the first time I purchased this product and it will not be the last.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes fairly well, but smells so gross, just really gross, sort of like sickeningly sweet play-doh.  I would try to hold my breath and just rub it in really quick, but finally I remembered I&#x27;m a grown up and I can just buy new cream, so I tossed it.</li>
    <li> Putting this cream on your face is like putting vasaline.  It will say bright and shiney as if you used vasaline.  Worse it has a orange yellow color.  I thought if I tap it into my skin long enought it will get absorbed.  Wrong, you will have a yellow tint to your face that comes off on your pillow.  So use it at night or when you are alone.  The vasaline like cream  never gets fully absored so you will  wake up with a layer of it under your eyes unless it rubbed off on your pillow first.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever in night cream dept,  I keep ordering and ordering.  Results are amazing  . 2 ho cares about the color or smell, ir does miracles for a king with acne and other blemishes.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream I have ever used.  I use it as a day cream as well.  In the summer I do not apply it as generously as in the winter</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, best ever for very dry skin!  Sorry its no longer sold in stores, hope it stays available online.</li>
    <li> I bought this because there were so many positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and I will say I do like it.  It&#x27;s nice and think and normally during the winter I get dry patches on my face.  This product takes care of that!  If I feel a dry spot coming on I just put it on and it&#x27;s gone by morning.  I will say, though, I did not see any difference with my fine lines as others have claimed.</li>
    <li> Sits on top of the skin and is not absorbed because it is just like petroleum jelly. Skin feels greasy until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful rich moisturizing creme that i use at night and wake up in the morning with my face feeling wonderful.  A little goes a long way you don&#x27;t need much when applying.  I love to use this especially in the winter time.</li>
    <li> It is a bit oily, and cause acne ...</li>
    <li> This is okay.  A bit heavy.  Nothing special.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night (and sometimes in the daytime!) cream for many many years. It is just the best, in the morning my skin is nicely moisturized. I really like it after a bit too much sun. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores so am very pleased to find it here on Amazon. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and less expensive than purchasing at my local retailer.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the day creme for the best moisturizer duo i&#x27;ve ever used. My face feels wonderful when i wake up in the morning and it isn&#x27;t too heavy or thick only a little does the trick. I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Has always been one of my favorite night cremes.  Doesn&#x27;t take much and works great.</li>
    <li> This cream does seem to help slightly even out skin discolorations and smooth out fine lines; however, it is extremely greasy. I&#x27;d go to be with clean hair and wake up with it stuck to my face and looking like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in weeks. It didn&#x27;t matter how much I rubbed it in, or let it absorb, it was never enough to eliminate the disgusting greasy feel. The effects of the cream were not impressive enough to put up with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this is one I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is definately an individual opinion.  I like it because it IS thick and gloppy and I feel that it traps moisture in.  My face is dry and I am a sun worshiper so it needs all the help I can give it.  It IS very thick--Sorta like cold crisco-- and you need to use it waaay before you go to bed or you will have orange sheets.</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bee&#x27;s products (deep pore scrub, shampoo and conditioner, daily facial cleanser, chap stick, etc) but this is the first product I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the weird smell when you first apply it to your face but after while it turns out smelling like carrot cake which I love to eat but I don&#x27;t want to eat my own face lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does help soften and moisturize my skin but it made me break out on my cheek near the back of my jaw bone. I&#x27;ve had break outs here before but they have been gone for awhile ever since I started using Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;You can buy 16oz for less than this product which is only 1oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a product thats versatile. I recommend Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil. I use it for my skin (my whole body not just face), hair (overnight deep conditioning), and oil pulling (swish a tablespoon a day and I guarantee your smile will get brighter and whiter!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought the 54oz for $25 on amazon. This will last me for months! (Just ran out of my 32oz jar, so you know how much I love coconut oil!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also use the coconut oil for cooking as well! I haven&#x27;t tried but I hear baking or cooking shrimp with it is delicious. I&#x27;ll have to give it a try and update this review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this honest review helps someone!</li>
    <li> The Carrot Nutritive Night creme is amazing! Love it for really moisturizing my now dry skin and reducing wrinkles. It is thick so if that&#x27;s not your thing, then look for something less heavy. A little goes a long way! Can&#x27;t find it on the shelves in the stores anymore and the BB website was out of stock. Other than purchasing from a friend how makes her own quality products, this was the best place to locate the BB Carrot Night Creme!</li>
    <li> my favorite for past 7 years.try it. I am 48. it does it all for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I swear by Burts Bees. Been using it for years. Everyone asks what I use on my skin. Helps you look years younger. Natural without chemicals, it&#x27;s of the few things I can use on my highly sensitive skin. GET IT!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, this cream is VERY thick. I don&#x27;t have especially dry skin, but have found an excellent use for this cream--I put this on to protect and trap moisture in my skin after I have done a facial peel.  It works wonderfully! I would not use this on a daily basis and think that it would be too thick (greasy) to use as a base moisturizer under make-up, but for my purposes, it works great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and feels oily, so unless you have very dry skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> A little melted and the top was off inside the box, but it seems ok. This product smells great but was somewhat discolored. I will probably use though.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling good and moisturized. I&#x27;m buying my second jar.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial moisturizer!  It keeps my skin soft and moist.  It is also really good at healing any skin irritations and patches of dryness.  I used to live where it was cold and dry, and my skin would get chapped patches.  This solved it!  I moved to a dry, sunny climate, and it is just as useful, especially in preventing wrinkles and giving my skin a dewy quality.  My skin tends to be dry, and I respond better to the thick, oily quality of it.  It feels like it covers and protects from the outside elements.  I don&#x27;t need separate eye cream, either.  It might be too thick for some people, but it&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
    <li> This is very hard and you have to run it in hard.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for sunburns!!! Put it on at night and in the morning you&#x27;ll feel 100 times better. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff!  It is extremely thick, smells great, and is wonderful for your skin.  I use it as an eye cream at night because it can also be a bit greasy and that makes me break out around my chin area.  It&#x27;s great for eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 7-year-old has been in the pool every day this summer.  When she isn&#x27;t in the pool, she&#x27;s been outside in the sunshine at day camp.  Between the chlorine and the sunshine, her face got dry and really chapped no matter what children&#x27;s lotion I put on it.  One night I decided to use this instead, and it was a miracle worker.  I only use it on her a couple times a week, and her skin is back to it&#x27;s traditionally baby-soft self.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 10 years as an under-eye creme. Works WONDERS! Fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Very wax-y greasy creme. lt&#x27;s really heavy to cake onto your face and leaves your face sticky for awhile (as in, can&#x27;t exactly sleep on my sides right away unless I want a greasy pillow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that my face ends up pretty smooth in the morning, and that I like that there&#x27;s vitamin E and other great oils in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably use it 3-4x a week. Kind of hard to put on (very thick) but a little goes a loooooong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product SO much more than Burt Bee&#x27;s beeswax night creme also.</li>
    <li> As a former cosmetics and skin care professional I can tell you that this night creme is wonderful! I love that it is almost all natural. The scent is delicious and it is a very rich cream. You don&#x27;t need much of it so the little jar lasts a long time. For anyone with dry or sensitive skin I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial Cleanser, Orange Essence. I was introduced to this by a friend.  She knew I had been struggling with dry flaky skin and refused to go and seek help.  So, she ended up bringing this by my place and said I should try it.  Needless to say, it worked wonders and my face healed quickly.  If you fight with dry skin during the winter months, please consider using this product.  I recently came back to it because of the winter dry skin fight, and has been working wonders on my face!</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry, which causes some issues with acne at times. I put this on at night and it feels amazing. It&#x27;s very thick, feels a bit oily, but it works extremely well. In the morning my skin feels brand new. I combine it with the day creme. The combination of the two gives my skin a nice healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, it DOES have a strange smell to it. My dude is always saying I smell like &amp;#34;Play-Doh&amp;#34;. Not sure if that nails the smell down in my opinion, but those are his feelings on it. I&#x27;ve grown to love the smell.</li>
    <li> If you are not into thick and rich creams, skip this one. However, if you have dry skin like me and are looking for something that&#x27;ll help relieve some of the discomforts of dry skin, you&#x27;ve got your solution here and it&#x27;s cheap too. It smells very carrot-y. I personally like it.</li>
