<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I get pretty dry skin, especially in the winter, and products to exfoliate (so my face doesn&#x27;t look horrible when I apply foundation) only tend to make me peel and get flaky. This product is a godsend. Anytime I have a dry patch, an application and a quick rinse and no more flaky/peeling skin! Bonus is more often than not when I use this product and put on a bit of moisturizer, I feel confident enough in my complexion to just dust on some shine control powder and head out the door. Never experienced any irritation from it.</li>
    <li> INCREDIBLE!! This is a must for anyone who is fighting age! This product takes off all dead skin that you don&#x27;t even know you have. It is a gentle peel, I use it every night and my skin is glowing. I am 51 and my skin lookes better that it was at 30. I LOVE PETER THOMAS ROTH!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Its ubnbelievable how well this works.</li>
    <li> I actually use &amp; like the Aloette peel however it is expensive and hard to find. This product is similar and I feel superior. You will end up with dead skin rolling off---I&#x27;m really not sure if most of those rolls/beads of dead skin aren&#x27;t potentiated by the cellulose which is an ingredient in both of these peels. If you have sensitive skin you may get a little red or pink. I did sample this probably 6 times before I finally decided to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how I feel about this peeling gel. Every time I use it, it looks like it is getting rid of dirt, but at the same time I don&#x27;t feel like it is doing anything. I usually use a face scrub with the grains in it afterwards because it gives me the feeling that it is actually scrubbing the dirt and dead skin off (if that makes any sense). I&#x27;m not sure if i would buy this again, especially considering how expensive it is.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;m a product junkie.  Get this!</li>
    <li> This is a must try... and if you try, you will not be disappointed!! I could not believe the dead skin that came off the first time. I use several other PTR products, however the Peeling Gel is THE FIRST STEP in getting all the components of your skin right..I have sun damaged skin, it has smoothed my skins texture and it&#x27;s working on evening out the redness in my checks. It has also minimized a scar...a horrible scar on my face. My life has changed bc of this step in my skin care routine. PTR products are amazing, you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> As you are applying the product it is already beading, it&#x27;s not dead skin.  There are ingredients that provide a level of exfoliation, but not the most effective product I&#x27;ve ever used.  For these results, you can get something less expensive.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face as smooth as anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I have used a number of PTR products and like them as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.  I find myself panicking when I run out.  It is the best exfoliator there is.  It just keeps sloughing and rolling off dead skin, but only where you need it most.  Totally awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this stuff is a joke.  It is not your skin that rolls off, it is the gel - PERIOD.  I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no change in my skin.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to the product and all I can say is WOW! After just a few uses, my skin looks much smoother, my pores are smaller, and those stubborn blackheads are gone! This product is super easy to use and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin! This has now become a staple of my skincare regimen, and I can&#x27;t wait to explore the other options from Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
    <li> Wow...a skin product that really works. I can feel the dead skin roll off ( I use it in the shower) then my face feels soft &amp; exfoliated. Worth the price in my opinion. Good customer service, too.</li>
    <li> Gentle on the skin but leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the best product you will ever try. Some seem to think that the product itself is just bunching up and that is what the &#x27;skin&#x27; coming off is but I don&#x27;t think so. It has helped me get rid of spots that I had originally thought to be dry skin! My makeup looks a lot smoother. Love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective for removing dry skin cells infact it works more effectively than alot of glycol products. It can be used by people with sensitive skin but you don&#x27;t want to use it frequently. It can be drying at times like glycol is but a grainy exfoliator can used To help with that. I would recommend this product to others to help keep your skin clear &amp; fresh looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I love PTR products - the Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx 3.4 Fluid Ounce New is a MUST have. I also own the Laser Free Regenerating Moisturizing Gel - not really a moisturizer, but more like a smoothing serum THIS product however, doesn&#x27;t thrill me. The name is a bit misleading as it does not &#x27;Peel&#x27; and does not feel like  a &#x27;Gel&#x27;. It is really just a cleanser with some exfoliating material in it. The tube I received has very little exfoliant. It definitely does NOT peel, just washes off like any other cleanser. The reviewers that say they can &#x27;see&#x27; their dead skin coming off are merely seeing the exfoliating material.  There are other cleansers for a lot less money that do the same thing.</li>
    <li> This gel does nothing but ball up on your face. It is not removing dry skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Due to the price, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this product. However, my friend had bought this same product at Sephora (for $50! Definitely more than I paid here on Amazon) and she allowed me to try it. So I ordered it here. A-MAZ-ING. The skin literally just rolls off. It doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive or anything. When applying, you want to use small circles, wait about 45 seconds, then do small circles with your fingertips as well. If you found this review helpful, please click &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; so other women will see it as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I can use the peel 3 x week. on  my face, neck, décolleté.  Best if followed with toner, serum, and moisturizer.  Instant gratification -- skin feels fabulously clean, soft, and firm.</li>
    <li> Believe all that you&#x27;ve read here.&lt;br /&gt;It works like dead skin sloughing lotion used in some pedicures. Of  course the end result is a more hydrated appearance. It feels like there&#x27;s silicone in it, like what&#x27;s found in a BB cream. I&#x27;m skeptical as to whether I&#x27;d buy this regularly, but my curiosity and appearance left me pleased overall.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smooth and shine afterward. Very gentle peeling the result is nice. Doesn&#x27;t hurt or stink at all</li>
    <li> Love what this peeling gel does to my face and neck- skin glows and you truly feel you have gotten a great exfoliation.  Also use it on my hands.  I follow the gel with a good serum and moisturizer and my skin feels like silk.  I do some of the other chemical peels and exfoliators, but this is quick, not messy, and you see immediate results.  Only negative is that it&#x27;s a little high on the price point to use so frequently (1-3 times per week), but definitely worth trying for yourself.</li>
    <li> Too soft to produce any exfoliating effect</li>
    <li> I almost dont want to share this beauty secret! This product leaves your skin soft and smooth without drying. I use a nickel size amount for my whole face (use on dry skin) and its gently peels away dead cells and leaves my face feeling refreshed, moisturized and sooo smooth! I use it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this peeling gel, as it did not perform as promised, but only did a mediocre job.  I think that the next time&lt;br /&gt;I use it I might add some corn starch to help with the peeling of the dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> Forget expensive salon procedures, this will keep your face exfoliated and looking fresh everyday!!  Only need a small amount 1-2 times per week.  Makes make-up go on nice and smooth, great for older skin that can look cakey with foundation.  My niece also uses to help control her acne.</li>
    <li> I have to exfoliate daily, because I use retin-A.  This is gentle enough for daily use.  You can see the dead skin ball up as you use the product.  Some reviewers claim that is the product balling up, but it isn&#x27;t.  We don&#x27;t have dead skin on our fingertips, so when you rub the product between your fingertips, it does not ball up.  Apply to the face, and see the difference</li>
    <li> Great skin peel without the pain, redness or down time.  Really gets your skin looking good!</li>
    <li> I have had extremely oily skin (I will put my oily skin up against anyone else&#x27;s out there) and have been plagued with severe acne since I was 12 years old. I do not remember life without knowing people cannot see me through the blemishes and scars and have heard more than once &amp;#34;you would be really pretty if it weren&#x27;t for your skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I eagerly watched a presentation Mr. Roth gave on HSN, demonstrating how this would exfoliate like nobody&#x27;s business without the usual &amp;#34;red mask&amp;#34; side affect and I was transfixed! I know through extensive research on this medical condition that exfoliation is vital, and especially with very oily skin being able to adequately maintain the necessary level of exfoliation can be a daunting task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled when this product arrived and literally ran to the powder room to change my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aired demonstration, it appears that your dead skin cells immediately exfoliate resulting in a complexion to rival the silkiness of the behind on a newborn babe. I must warn you, most of what those &amp;#34;little miracle balls&amp;#34; consists of is the gel mixture itself and not that pesky blanket of dead skin cells that wreak so much havoc. In reality though, if that much skin came off each time this was used, it would send everyone who used it to the hospital. When I used this that night, I carefully followed the directions and in the morning when I awoke I met someone in the mirror who had fresh skin! Me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem skin and need a break, try this product. While I wish they would not leave the impression that your skin slough off at the rate shown on the demonstration, it does work and I look forward to seeing the improvement over time!</li>
    <li> Perfect for use with Retin-A (tretinoin). I was having a lot of trouble with exfoliation using tretinoin and my skin was looking older rather than better. I use this every second or third morning on a dry face before my shower. It removes the dry skin without irritating my face and doesn&#x27;t leave any redness. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I like this product and feel it works well in conjunction with a couple of the other PTR products.  I use it along with the PTR Clinical Peel and Reveal pumpkin scrub.  I alternate days and my skin is very smooth and it has helped to unclog my pores some but they dont seem smaller which is what I am trying to achieve.</li>
    <li> Wish it worked a little better but I still like it. needs to be a lower price for what you get.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.. This is a must try!!</li>
    <li> Great..absolutely love it, amazing how it works, proof is on your face!</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to this product. In just one use, I could see and feel a difference in my face. I use once a week and use less of my acne product as a result, which being over 40 is a plus considering how harsh anti-acne products can be.</li>
    <li> Hello!! This stuff is amazing!! Buy it and give your face a fresh look every couple days! Instead of picking at dry skin this just rubs it off pain free. I bought a really expensive exfoliator and loved how the skin just rubbed off but when I ran out I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep buying it so I was so excited to find this has the same effect but only 1/4 of the price!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I use it a few times a week and my skin has improved tremendously. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I have always hated my huge pores, especially on my nose. I have bought tons of products and none of them have worked. The first time I used this it completely cleaned out my pores and my face has never looked better! I&#x27;m soooo happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Would purchase again. I have very dry skin and it really helped.  Must use on a regular basis or as directed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and much less expensive at Amazon than at the retail establishment where I have been buying it.  About $12 less so it is worth ordering online.  This product is great for my skin.  I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> Does a good job removing the dead skin and no burn afterwards</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a great fan of PTR products, particularly the stuff for acne.&lt;br /&gt;This product however is just ok for me as I think it&#x27;s just a scrub really.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I get better exfoliation results with Philosphy micro wash.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation is one of the most important part of a serious skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;I found that all subsequent skincare product, such as serum, lotion, etc perform better.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it helps my skin look more clear and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say though, I think it&#x27;s important to use exfoliation products carefully as the under eye area can easily get dry very easily.&lt;br /&gt;To help to avoid this issue, I use Argan oil ( like the Vitaville brand, sold on amazon)  AND a quality eye creme twice every day.&lt;br /&gt;It has made a big difference in keeping my skin looking great.</li>
    <li> Really not sure if this product does anything....it does ball up when you rub it on your face but I think it might do the same thing if rubbed on a table....</li>
    <li> Stopped using it for a while and could tell a major difference in my skin! Won&#x27;t do without it again</li>
    <li> Works great little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I am not sure this is authentic, the texture and smell are completely differect from the same product I bought at sephora, I am not sure but seems like it is not real</li>
    <li> Wish there were more stars to put it is that good !!</li>
    <li> Amazed at how well this product works....My skin just looks so much better overall.  SO much softer, smoother, brighter.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial scrub. It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.  I use it 4-5 times a week. My skin feels so smooth!</li>
    <li> fantastic ... I was thrilled it works and my skin looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> Had a sample size and found it a very effective product for my sensitive skin. Can even use it daily without having a reaction.</li>
    <li> Same story different person.  I bough this product at Sephora for about 15 bucks more then Amazon. However it is an amazing product. I have been derma rolling and needed something that was gentle enough to exfoliate but not scratchy to my skin.  I highly recommend this product... makes your skin like baby skin.</li>
    <li> Seriously. HOLY GRAIL. I bought this at Sephora (for 50 freaking dollars...worth it, though I will definitely order from Amazon from here on out), after the girl did a demo of it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it three times, my skin has cleared up probably 75% (little blemishes on my chin and forehead), my skin is SUPER smooth, makeup goes on 100 times easier as far as blending goes, and my skin is glowing. Like, pregnant lady glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin that hates me for putting basically anything on it, but this stuff hasn&#x27;t caused any redness, left my skin tender or made me break out. In fact, it&#x27;s the opposite of all of that. My skin tone is much more even, my skin feels good for the first time in forever, and it&#x27;s actually clearing up my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy grail, yall. For real.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great.  I love it and both my adult daughters love it.  The product exfoliates without retinol and does it immediately.  Your skin is baby soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I use it twice a week. I love it and makes my skin super smooth.</li>
    <li> One of the best ways to keep skin bright and wrinkle-free is to keep it clean and well-hydrated.  Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products are world class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my older, tender and thin skin, I was so pleased to see the results of the Firmx Peeling Gel. It gently exfoliates without damaging the skin especially around the hair line where hair spray tends to leave a residue and along the sides of the nose where skin is especially fragile.  I&#x27;ve used Lancôme for a long time and love it, too, but think that Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products are superior.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it does, but I love it. It transformed my skin. I have combination skin that has a tendency to get whiteheads (the hardest things to get rid of ever!) and this has almost eliminated them in a short time. I use it in conjunction with the Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  It is satisfying to see the dead skin cells roll off my face... Blackheads get cleared... Skin is soft and glows... Ordering my third tube now before I am out, as no other peel comes close.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Sephora and will definitely re order here on Amazon ( much cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;This gel Its a must have in my every day morning routine, I can see and feel the difference on how my foundation looks, smoother dewy, fresher complexion.</li>
    <li> This does what it claims, but it comes out of the tube already gritty so its hard to tell what is, dead skin and what is product. rolling off your face.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin is soft and tighter after one use</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely excellent product.  Everyone that I have shown it too loves it as well.  I have used exfoliators many times but non compared to this one.</li>
    <li> This peeling gel makes my skin feel very smooth and looking balanced.  I usually use this 3 times a week as instructed.  It is very effective at peeling as claimed.  Currently, I&#x27;ve purchased this for $26 which I feel is more accurate value than the original manufacturer&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> The product kind of congeals after you squeeze it out of the tube. It gives the illusion of sloughing off dried dead skins cells. It really did nothing for me, very expensive trick</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this a while ago.  I have been on the hunt for a good exfoliator for a very long time.that didn&#x27;t require a million steps.  I finally tried it in the shower.  I left it on for a few minutes while I washed.  I rinsed and was blown away by how much dead skin came off.  My skin felt so soft.  I immediately jumped out and went to order this.  I have sensitive skin and this feels great, didn&#x27;t burn at all, and does an amazing job of getting rid of dead skin.  I love all of Peter Thomas Roth, but this is going to be my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have bought a lot things online but this is the first time I have ever written review on anything! I bought this at Sephora for $50 as well as many other people (I will buy from here next time) this item is pricy, but worth every penny! I see a lot of people questioning if the dead skin cells are what&#x27;s balling up or the actual product. Well, the sales associate at Sephora showed this product to me after my trip to Colorado, she let me try it on my hand to get the idea of it. It just so happened that the tops of my hands were so dry and rough from the climate change from FL to CO and a mixture of my accutane medicine that that was the perfect place to test if it works. I rolled the product on the top of my hand until it started balling up I was immediately impressed. So the question is does it really take off your dead skin cells? YES!!!! My hand was so soft once I wiped this product off, every bit of roughness was gone! I was sold ! :)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin but responded well to this peeling gel.  Skin was incredibly soft and notably smoother.  Plus, my skin seemed to absorb face creams even better.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MANY different products and this is by far the best! Feels like a facelift every time I use it as it brightens my skin by gently removing all of the dead skin cells. I have sensitive skin and this is strong enough to be effective but gentle enough not to irritate. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I had also purchased this in s travel size and then decided to buy the larger one was well.  Great product and this large one has lasted me a long time compared to other products.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to take much for it to be effective.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Smooths your skin without a harsh scrub. Several drops and rub your face, neck and tops if your hands and watch the \\&quot; dead shin\\&quot; roll off. Then follow with a great moisturizer your skin will look so smooth.</li>
    <li> I took the product and rubbed it on a clean surface with clean hands and the product did not ball up on itself. I&#x27;m skeptical of products and must try experiments first. I have hyper pigmentation of laugh lines around my mouth and dark marks from acne. After using this for a month once a week my skin has evened out and is slightly lighter in complexion. I&#x27;m lighter skin African American with eczema and sensitive skin. This is one of a few products that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I also use skin effects glycolic peels once a month. No scrubbing of the skin as it makes my pores larger just gentle cleansing and this. Baby face #3 is also good but use sparingly as this product causes peeling if used too much/often. Hopefully this helps someone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. Love the facial !!</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try this, and am so glad I finally did!  It is the softest most gentle peel I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used them all, high-end).  Your skin looks instantly polished and smooth.  I&#x27;m 50 with fair Irish skin, if that helps.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is works really well.  Exfoliates great and does it gently.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an amazing skin exfoliant, buy this immediately! This is the most amazing exfoliant I have ever seen! It is insane the amount of dry skin that will instantly peel off your face gently with the smallest amount of product. The product is very gentle on the skin but still removes a shockingly large amount of dry skin that will leave your face feeling smoother than it has in years! It will also remove dry layers of skin and leave your face looking younger! It is amazing how an exfoliant can remove the appearance of wrinkles. I highly recommend this product! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t drink enough water which causes my face to be so dry, especially around my nose creases where I have dry skin that flakes off which is really annoying and ugly which my electronic face brush doesn&#x27;t always succeed in getting off as its in the crease of my nose.  This stuff is amazing as it visibly and physically lifts away dead skin that you can see rub off.  It also leaves my skin super silky and super absorbent to face creams afterwards.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that you leave on 3 minute peels by La Prairie and I have to say I much prefer this product and its cheaper too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried various peels and has really settled in with this product as her favorite.  She has me reordering it whenever she runs low.</li>
    <li> I use serious skin care extreme c results and it is great like a real facial but this is nothing much more than washing your face hence I didn&#x27;t notice any changes. I was somewhat disappointed...</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. It conditions your skin to receive your moisturizer . It exfoliates the skin so when you put on&lt;br /&gt;your cream afterwards it sinks into your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Not overly drying and gentle --- does a great job.  I actually used this off label to remove residual icky adhesive after plastic surgery.  I am extremely allergic to almost all medical adhesives. Once incision was clearly healed I used this magic stuff to remove the residual adhesive which had given me a very ugly rash.  Next morning rash GONE. Wow. Wish I had this years ago.  So gentle!</li>
    <li> Like other unfortunate overpayers before me, I paid $50 for this product at Sephora.  I&#x27;m thrilled that I was able to find this at nearly half the price (with a fabulous sample of face wash to boot!).  I gave it five stars because this product delivers everything that it promises.  It is not hatsh on my sensitive skin, and my skin has dramatically cleared up since adding this product into my skincare.  Love, love, love this product!!!!  You will not be disappointed, and it will last longer than you think</li>
    <li> The best thing since sliced bread for skin - LOVE PTR products!!!!</li>
    <li> Love, use it every day with Retin A, and after my chemical peel.  Safe, effective, not drying and overly abrasive.</li>
    <li> BEST exfoliate product ever! My face feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum!!! LOVE PTR to begin with but had never tried this. WOW is all I can mutter!</li>
    <li> My skin feels so smooth after using this product. I use tazorac, a prescription retinoid, which makes my skin flaky, exposing fresh new skin underneath. This product helps remove the flakiness easily.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;As with others...not sure if it is product or dead skin that rolls off, but it seems to improve the clarity of the skin.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, can&#x27;t imagine not having it to use.  Feel that it has taken years off of my looks</li>
    <li> This is awesome........totally takes the dead skin off your face........LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;Peter Thomas Roth products are the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;His mascara is one of the best also.......</li>
    <li> Can see dead skin cells being lifted by gel. Peel does exactly what PRT says.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with results. Use 1x week</li>
    <li> I noticed people complaining about the price, well, dont spend 37 bucks on a product you&#x27;re not sure about. BUY THE TRAVEL SIZE FOR SEVEN DOLLARS. I got it and I can honestly say that my skin looks better after using it, less blackheads, clearer. You wash your face, put it on and rub it around and immediately little balls start to roll up which I think the makers of this product want you to believe is dead skin (which I&#x27;m not sure I buy but looking at my skin it seems legit). This is going to sound weird but if you&#x27;re having trouble with your skin RAW UNFILTERED USDA ORGANIC HONEY (if it doesnt say this exactly on the label its probably just sugar water) is seriously a great thing to add to your skin (and diet) regimen. It is antibactertial and antifungal not to mention has some other serious health benefits when eaten. I do two masks a day for ten minutes minimum and if you suffer from acne you will notice the red spots calm down and they heal much faster. Anyways, don&#x27;t spend 37 dollars, go buy the travel size, ya derps.</li>
    <li> Good product. Cheaper here than in stores. By like 10-15 bucks. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love,  will be reordering!</li>
    <li> Being the beauty product junkie that I am, I have tried several exfoliants from the shelves at Walmart to department store brands.  Due to the fact that I have been using strong retinol treatments, my skin is constantly peeling (shedding the dead skin) and while that&#x27;s a good thing, it&#x27;s not good if you&#x27;re having to show your face to the world if you peel like I do.  With that being said, I need a super exfoliant.  I&#x27;ve tried Clinique&#x27;s super scrub stuff and a few other brands in the past but they all left me still having the peeling effect going on.  Not this stuff.  I can actually see the dead skin come off my face when using the PTR gel.  This is a product that has made itself at home in my bathroom and I don&#x27;t even intend to stray from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this exfoliating gel for quite awhile now. This is my 2nd purchase of it. Where as most exfoliating products are gritty and actually rub and grind away the dead skin cells, they leave my skin raw. Not so with Thomas Roth FirmX exfoliating gel. It has no kind of grit that scrubs my skin and makes it raw. It DOES effectively, gently, and THOROUGHLY exfoliate all the dead skin cells away, leaving my skin smooth, very clean, soft and ready for my other topical skincare products. This is GREAT stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.  I thought as first it was fake since it had pulp that balled up but I used it a second time right after the first and there definitely was alot less that came off.  So I think the pulp stuff in it leads you to believe that you are exfolliating more than you really are.  The second use just proved to me that it does work.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!! I recommend this to everyone I know. My pores have become so much smaller since use. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought it, was completely in love with product. The second bottle didn&#x27;t work at all! It was like it didn&#x27;t have enough exfoliation in it?</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It is a little pricy but totally worth every penny. I went to get a sephora makeover where I fell in love with the product. You don&#x27;t have to use a &amp;#34;generous amount&amp;#34; as it says on the tube. I use about a quarter size amount and it is plenty. I&#x27;m assuming this will last me a very long time!</li>
    <li> I thought this product would work a little better. It does exfoliate, but not like it says. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I tried it at a major store and fell in love. I was soo excited to find it on Amazon at a lesser price. I had my hubby try it and he also fell in love with it. Got rid of dead skin, cleaned out a lot of pores. Def worth it</li>
    <li> was what I was looking for and does just what it says it does! would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Sept 25, 2014 and i got it today Sept 26, 2014 such a plus of fast shipping. I love this so much &amp;#60;3 Totally does great things to your skin. I instantly saw the dead skin being removed and im huge on products that have results you can actually see :) I purchased this product from Beautylime and this product is soooo LEGIT will be purchasing this from them on the regular :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s not at all harsh on your skin, and you can certainly feel it&#x27;s helped remove dead skin leaving leaving behind a smoother, softer complexion! So grateful my aunt recommended this product!</li>
    <li> Just ordered the full size tube. I got a free sample at Sephora and loved it. Hope this is the same thing. If you are familiAr with a poo product called pretty feet it reminds me of that product but gentler for the face.  Use on dry face and rub around. The dead skin rolls up.</li>
    <li> I normally only write reviews when I have spare time, but this I am writing, after my first use of the product.  I am a product junkie and have used a myriad of them, and some work and some not so much.  I have combination skin and have been using his other products for oily/problem skin, which are equally effective and impressive (and yes, pricy but worth it if they work).  I would recommend this over his laser free, dragons blood products (which I got in the small sized set, to try out) if you have combination skin.  I was hesitant to buy this in full size, but couldn&#x27;t find it in a small sized set so I took a chance and I&#x27;m really glad that I did.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have rosacea and must be careful with what I use. This works very well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best in my opinion, and I&#x27;ve tried lots.  Have reordered many times.  :)</li>
