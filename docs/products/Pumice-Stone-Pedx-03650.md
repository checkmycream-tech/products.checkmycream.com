<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product, excellent service.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to use.  Great on my feet to  keep those callouses under control.  Also works great on my heels to keep them smooth.  I like the size of this stone as it fills my hand.   Not too small like so many others.</li>
    <li> Mine broke the second time I used it.  Now I&#x27;m looking for a more durable product.</li>
    <li> My feet have not had the care that they needed until the pumice block. The realization of laser heat dry skin blasts from rotten neighbors makes the use of this item along with some lotion excellence essential to everyday existence. The wearing of the orthopedic shoes as a young boy also made understanding of this lotion and stone excellent to learn in care. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Comfortable rounded stone with lots of pockets.  Works much better than my old one.</li>
    <li> Save your money, it doesn&#x27;t work wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I hated this when I first got it.  I read the reviews that said it was too soft and agreed, you could use it on your face if you wanted.  Finally- I was about to throw it out, and suddenly, a second plastic wrapper coating came off...  I&#x27;d used it multiple times in the shower with the wrapper still on wondering how it could be so bad....  Once you get all the packaging off, it is sufficient as a moderately coarse pumice stone.</li>
    <li> I got this not to do my feet, but to clean my cat&#x27;s water bowl which is porcelin.  It&#x27;s soft enough not to scratch it, but good enough to get rid of the stains.  It&#x27;s a fountian and even with filters, the water stains it.  A little scrubbing with this and the bowl is clean.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I can&#x27;t say what it will do for feet, but I bet it would do great.</li>
    <li> This product was ok... It&#x27;s not as rough as I had hoped... And if you get it wet it&#x27;s EVEN WORSE... It just smoothes right out and doesnt remove any dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless there was NOTHING ELSE AVAILABLE... it&#x27;s ok... not great... not bad either... Just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S NOT what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, nice shape, size, fairly fine. Does the job as it suppose to. Do not regret the purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Works well and is relatively smooth for an inexpensive pumice stone (other low-priced stones I&#x27;ve used are too rough).</li>
    <li> I bought a pumice stone at CVS that was flat on two sides and curved on the other two sides with a little rope to hang it. That pumice stone sucked.  I reluctantly bought this one thinking maybe all pumice stones sucked.  Not true! This pumice stone has worked miralces on my dry/cracked feet. I use it lightly everyday to prevent the disaster that my feet were before the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product. I could have bought it locally but hey, I love ordering things on Amazon instead of leaving the house. Why stand in line? Why shop for something that could be inferior? Instead search for the best reviewed pumice stone money can buy and wala! Your showering will be so much better .And indeed, it is. My skin loves me, my feet loves me. One needs good feet every day, so take care of yours and grab a pumice stone like this one.</li>
    <li> These are reorder for 2 that got lost during a move -- and I couldn&#x27;t get them quickly enough to knock my poor pitiful tootsies back into shape! Amazon delivered fast - whew!</li>
    <li> bouth this to defuzz sweaters&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped&lt;br /&gt;worth a try though as the price was good</li>
    <li> Works great for rough hands... just soak it for a minute in the shower and then use it... takes dead skin right off</li>
    <li> Really liked it, it was what I was expecting.  High quality for the money&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it for a friend</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product on my feet, I use it on my legs and bikini line to avoid ingrown hairs. It works well! I cannot tell you whether it gets rid of callouses or other foot related problems.</li>
    <li> Need to smooth out those feet that are rough and have so much dead skin on them? Get this, it works perfectly! Also used it to break in a few pairs of my jeans that I got hemmed...when they hem them, the bottom part looks just like the middle part with no &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34;, so I used this to break the bottoms in nicely so they look natural and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> From being on my feet all day I bought this to exfoliate the hard skin and it works wonders, however I would reccommend using it with foot cream and a foot file for best results</li>
    <li> Rather too soft and not worth the price. I would choose another brand in the future. Not the best choice.</li>
