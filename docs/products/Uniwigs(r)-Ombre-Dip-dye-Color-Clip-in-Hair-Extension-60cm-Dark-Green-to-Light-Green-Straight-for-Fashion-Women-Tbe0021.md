<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s only one piece clip extensions is very easy to put on its great if you just want to add some color to your hair</li>
    <li> I have super thin blonde hair that&#x27;s medium length. I was concerned about this because I didn&#x27;t want it showing through my hair. It&#x27;s really thick and long so I clipped it in the middle of my hair with a messy bun to make it l</li>
    <li> The hair was very silky and shiny but very very thin! The clips started falling off within the first day and they also did not stay in my hair</li>
    <li> Great quality! Came in early too! :) very pretty and love the volume! Pretty happy:)</li>
    <li> I love this ombre hair extensions, made me realize that my hair looks really good when it&#x27;s blue. Great fit. Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome came fast too 🍉</li>
    <li> Very good quality!!! Really long I had to cut mine... Beautiful color... Very thick and soft ... Defiantly ordering more:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful but won&#x27;t latch with my hair. (Very thick) So, great product, but return process is ABSURD! Never experienced a worst hassle getting my money back. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it soft n long just like I wanted maybe to long thou n I love the color though n it goes good with my black hair.. :-)  I&#x27;m happy with it also the clips r really good...</li>
    <li> it didnt come with extra clips but i like the color and its texture is very soft and the uniwigs label was not there</li>
    <li> I love this hair piece!! As long as you know how to take care of them, since there synthetic... But great quality for synthetic!</li>
    <li> Soft, nice color. Only complaint is that they weren&#x27;t as thick as I expected so now I need to order some more. A little long, but nothing some trimming can&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and got lost within 1 week with was great! It&#x27;s really long and pretty!  The colors are exactly like the picture and I don&#x27;t even feel it in my hair! It looks as real as Blue hair can get!</li>
    <li> Came in good condition, great length.&lt;br /&gt;But they were not put together well. Hair kept just falling out.</li>
    <li> Just received this today and it is very soft and like natural hair! It&#x27;s durable and the clips work fine. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love these extensions and they look just like the picture, but they don&#x27;t take hear well, so you can only style them straight.</li>
    <li> a super great modern fashion hairpiece, of great quality, easy to use, and it blends in perfectly just as described by the seller.</li>
    <li> Daughter has had it for three weeks and is still using it non stop. Should have got 3 for three times the fun!</li>
    <li> I really like these extensions because the color is exactly like in the picture and it doesn&#x27;t look that shiny compared to another order I received from a different company. These are believable and blend in with real hair well unless you&#x27;re like me and have thick wavy hair then no but the only way I made it work was by wearing it in a braid or with my hair straight. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t wear these as often as Id like because the extensions are straight and my hair isn&#x27;t but i knew that ordering these so thats on me but other wise if your hair is naturally straight then they&#x27;ll blend in perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product! I already wear clip in extensions and these blend and fit in with them great! I haven&#x27;t used heat on them just yet, the only issues I would really say I&#x27;ve had with these extensions are they are very heavy and pull on your hair a lot and the extensions also look a little too shiny almost like doll hair , but other than that they&#x27;re great! Get tangled easily so be careful.</li>
    <li> My second purchase this time of a different color and love it!  Bought them for my neice and she easily puts them in.  The color is even better than the picture.  The top is more of a nice dark blue with the aqua weaved in very slightly and the aqua at the bottom is very consistent with no discolorations.  Might be shooting for a third set :)</li>
    <li> Color is just as the one in the image, easy to put on, the only thing that I didnt like is that the theres is not the same amout of hair in the top that in the bottom meaning that the light blue comes from the very top as well as the dark blue, but dark blue hair is shorter so it leaves you with half of the hair when you only can see light blue</li>
    <li> i loved it lol. it looks so natural and preety...i git complaments on my hair all the time &#x3D;) .</li>
    <li> These extensions were just like the picture I love them so much! They&#x27;re cheap and convenient :) they were super long touching my belly button almost so I need to trim them a bit but they&#x27;re smooth and pretty</li>
    <li> My daughter is always asking to die her hair.  It is an ongoing battle.  These extensions have been the answer!!  Some days she wears them and others not.  But on special occassions we can have her take them out!</li>
    <li> I love this hair peace!!!!!! Its a lot better than it looks. super thick and soft. love this!!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these!  She has received lots of compliments and people ask where we got them. They are w great color.....just like the picture. She takes good care of them and they have held up fine. We have had them a month now.</li>
    <li> Tangles easy but super cute</li>
    <li> My Extensions earlier than expected x3 I LOVE THEM!! They&#x27;re reallyy soft and don&#x27;t shed as much hehehe :D I am totally ordering more &amp;#62;___&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;m in high school and I wore it one day and I got sooooo many compliments. But first when I got the package I was a bit shocked that it was one track, I thought it was going to be more clip ins. But then I tried it on and it was pretty but it was extremely heavy, keep in mind I had other extensions in my hair which were light on my hair but this product was so heavy because it was really thick I couldn&#x27;t even put it in a ponytail. Another thing was that it became frizzy/napy in 3 hours and I had to constantly brush it. Although this hair was pretty but it was way too heavy. And I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
    <li> wear them all the time. always asked if it is my real hair.</li>
    <li> This hair looks like the pic but was very thin. The shedding was terrible I literally would run my fingers through and so much would come out each time, but the coloring was gorgeous. It&#x27;s just 1 clip in so if you&#x27;re looking for something full buy 2-3</li>
    <li> Perfect! They took two weeks but it was worth it! I curled them and they turned out great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! My friends think it&#x27;s real!!!!!! Just had to cut it down to size it&#x27;s cool and straight</li>
    <li> This product only lasted one day. I know it is not real hair but the quality is very poor</li>
    <li> I ended up cutting these to a better shape so they went with my hair style. The color is great! The only problem is that apparently I have a small head because I can&#x27;t wear these as pictured. I have to set them up really high on my head and I can&#x27;t shorten them to fit either, they&#x27;re on a lace flap thing.They&#x27;re okay, nothing spectacular but you get what you pay for, right?</li>
    <li> Poor quality, poor packaging no care instructions</li>
    <li> Pretty nice but the ombre effect is very fake looking.</li>
    <li> Very long and thick. Came quickly in the mail, I baby powderd them to make them less shiny, it is a ton of hair! Still kinda shiny though.</li>
    <li> Our grandaughter  loved the color of this . When we gave them to her she put both colors of hair extensions on. They did look like her hair.  Was very pleased with the quality. I would order them again.</li>
    <li> Very thick hair feels very soft. The color is exactly how u see it in the pic. You deff have to take the hair with u to a salon for them to cut it according to ur hair bc it is very long and u want it to blend with ur hair so it looks natural.</li>
    <li> I love love love these extensions!! They came about 3 weeks early so I was very happy about that. They look amazing in a braid and I wear them al, the time and it holds up pretty good. I ordered three more and I&#x27;m so excited to get them!!</li>
    <li> Great price, great item. It was suppose to arrive along August 29 and September 9 but it arrived August 23 so shipping was amazing! The hair wasn&#x27;t shiny like other synthetic hair. I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. The only thing I would recemend is buying single blue extensions because the weft does not go all around your head. So I had to but two single blue wefts. Other than that I loved the item.</li>
    <li> The color is vibrant and amazing, the clips hold well. The only problem I had was the extensions were to long but there&#x27;s a simple solution; cut it to the length of it hair</li>
    <li> I bought two if these expecting them to be really thin, but one was sufficient enough for my long thick hair. There are really pretty, i love the color and texture. Only thing is, they are really long, and if I trim them, I lose some of the pretty light teal color. I ended up curling them and my hair to make up for the length difference and keeping the integrity of the extension.</li>
    <li> eh if you want to make your hair longer buy more than one..</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these extensions!  With her blonde hair, they look nice &amp; natural. The color isn&#x27;t shimmery &amp; fake. It&#x27;s matte, yet so vibrant. The lace is secured very well &amp; the clips are sturdy, making them very easy to use. I just had to clip the ends behind the middle of the ears across from each other and let it fall naturally (in a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape) before clipping the rest.  We also left some natural hair underneath her real hair, because it held in place better &amp; didn&#x27;t pull that way. If you clip too high on the head, it shows at the temple area &amp; bunches up, as the extensions are fairly wide across.  We did have to trim the length a little, as well.  All in all, the value of this product was worth the buy.</li>
    <li> The color I perfect with my blond hair. I didn&#x27;t think it would look so good. Love this product so much.</li>
    <li> This purchase was for my teenage daughter. Of course they are into color hair and fashion statements. Good price, delivered on time, and my daughter is happy with the overall quality and appearance.</li>
    <li> This hair arrived a day before it was supposed to and omg its so thick and long and vibrant. I got so many compliments on this hair i love it sooo much definately  worth the price</li>
    <li> The extensions were good its just it really did not match my hair</li>
    <li> Love this its a bit longer then expected but thats okay the only thing it forever to get her i ordered on the 22nd of Feb came only yesterday March 25 Other then that its awesome feels real brushes nicely just wish it came faster</li>
    <li> Its a fine hair piece for the price. Way too bulky where the clips are at and did not smooth down enough to be worn with a regular outfit. I ended up using it for a Halloween costume and I sprayed it another color. Once Halloween was over I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> I received my hair my hair a few days ago and i installed 2 rows of the blue in my hair. IT LOOKS SO AMAZING!! The colors are more of like dark navy blue to a beautiful light blue/teal. Its absolutely perfect. So soft and so long and i DID use a curling iron on it and it did not melt i used it on the lowest heat setting i could and it did not melt. I suggest this to anyone looking for a little color!</li>
    <li> For how cheap they were, the color was beautiful and the quality of the hair it&#x27;self wasn&#x27;t too bad. My only problem was that it didn&#x27;t wrap around your entire head, so when you wear it down it&#x27;s very obvious you are wearing a hair piece. But if you know someone who cuts hair It&#x27;s a really easy fix. I think the best way to wear them is in two braids otherwise, it looks kind of silly.</li>
    <li> Okay so I got this product several weeks early! So I thought I made a mistake and askes for express shipping, but I didn&#x27;t. It has a weird smell but it wasn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
    <li> I have recently been obsessed with hair pieces &amp; it seems I just can&#x27;t get enough! This particular brand is in my opinion the best to purchase. The have many colours to choose from &amp; the length is beautiful. My goal now is to get every colour possible from this company! The ends do get dry so what I&#x27;ve done is gently comb it then a light trim &amp; mist the ends of it with a shine polisher.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected it to look so what I got was curly I would  ver much get this one I expected</li>
    <li> Love this piece.  Perfect to wear with any other clip in extensions.  Very soft hair. Takes a lot to tangel. But dear god#! No curling or flat ironing this... but could not be happier&lt;br /&gt; Very fun.  Goes great with my natural blond hair.  And some blond clip ins...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. The wait was worth it</li>
    <li> Great Buy! you only need one clip! it has a lot of hair!</li>
    <li> The extensions are so nice, pretty and look great! Plus they&#x27;re very easy to brush!</li>
    <li> The color was fantastic and it delivered incredibly fast.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly the same as the picture and has clips and all. I am in love with it, I recommend ordering two for thick hair like me. It&#x27;s also soft and easy to clip on, overall I am content with the extensions.</li>
    <li> Its pretty long for me and I had to cut it but other than that the quality is great and the color is beautiful!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be nice at all, considering the price and them being synthetic, but I was pleasantly surprised by these. I was only planning on using these for accents in my braids but I wear them with my hair down because they look convincing enough to pass as my own hair.They come with sturdy clips and the wefts are sewn together very nicely so you don&#x27;t get weird bumps in the back of your head. You get a lot of hair on this piece. A LOT OF HAIR. It&#x27;s also very long, I had to cut mine to get them to blend properly and ended up cutting almost all of the pretty turquoise color off. It&#x27;s super soft and they don&#x27;t have that weird shiny plastic look that some synthetic extensions have. they can get a little tangled with my other extensions, but its nothing a quick comb won&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but gets too much static, uncontrollable</li>
    <li> I just got mine today. Its so pretty I love the colors. I totally recermend this to everyone. I just have one question can you curl it or apply heat onto it.</li>
    <li> I got the wrong color!!!i was so mad when it came in and please note verry thin not for thick hair. I gave it two stars because it came like two weeks early.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE EXTENSIONS! THEY FIT MY HEAD CORRECTLY!, THEY CAME VERY EARLIER THAN EXPECTED :) WILL BUY MORE EXTENSIONS FROM THEM.. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter as an alternative to dying her hair.  It is ok, She loves it but it does not lay right.  I flat iron her hair and it still looks odd.  If you brush it the ends start getting fuzzy.  I have flat ironed the extension and it seems to do ok with the heat but doesnt really help the frizzy ends.  I did trim the bottom so it looked more natural, but it does not flow well.  I like that it has 5 clips at the top to secure it, we have moved the extension from ear to ear to about an inch above and that helps.  My daughter has light brown hair and it is to the lower back.  If your hair is not super straight it will look odd together.  It was an ok buy, and seems to be decent quality but the fact that if you brush it, the ends start getty bushy and fuzzy makes me not a fan of this one.</li>
    <li> This is very cute in theory, but if you have layered hair it just ends up looking sloppy. The piece is very long as well so be prepared to trim it to the length of your hair. The colors are very bright, though.</li>
    <li> No at all what I expected the shipping was amazing but it didn&#x27;t fit my head two clips broken one fell off.</li>
    <li> I got this 2 weeks early so it only took me a week and a half to get it to me which was awesome! The hair isn&#x27;t super shiny so it blends well with my hair. It does get tangled easily but it isn&#x27;t hard to brush. It&#x27;s a really pretty color. The dark blue has the turquoise kind of scattered in it. I only paid about 6$ but it looks like the price went up since then:( it&#x27;s very very long! It also makes your hair a lot thicker. The clips don&#x27;t make bumps. It doesn&#x27;t wrap around the hair at the middle of my head where the length is good but that&#x27;s okay. Overall, I&#x27;m happy. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> It takes forever to arrive, I waited about a month for the hair to get here. It starts off as beautiful hair, the color is almost exact to the picture and its really long and soft. the longer you have it the more it tangles and sheds. The hair sheds like a dog. after a while the hair starts to resemble the texture of african american hair, so it blends perfectly with mine. I have thicker hair so I ordered two. overall it is worth the price however I wish it didn&#x27;t shed so much. Im not sure how much longer the hair will last.</li>
    <li> No the hair falls out u cant brush it it was knotted and cant get knots out .</li>
    <li> Very artificial looking. :/</li>
