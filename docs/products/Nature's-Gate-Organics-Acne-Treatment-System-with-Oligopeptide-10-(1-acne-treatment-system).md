### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have had some really wonderful results using these products.</li>
      <li>me, Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment is perfect.  </li>
      <li>All of those botanicals makes it smell great, too!  </li>
      <li>I know this may not be the best for your skin....</li>
      <li>And both my girls are very fair and have to slather on the sunscreen when they spend any time in the sun.</li>
      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is great too.</li>
      <li>I should mention that instead of using the toner I used apple cider vinegar, which has always worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve never been happy with the appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>This set is very nice.  </li>
      <li>So, it might not be a fair evaluation of the product.  </li>
      <li>I would not feel good about recommending this product to any of my friends at this time.</li>
      <li>Three, to me it smells really good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on how good my skin looks, too, since I started using Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics.</li>
      <li>We have been trying to find a good product this year.  </li>
      <li>I figured this product being organic would be good for her.</li>
      <li>The best part of it was that it never caused any excess dryness, and it would be great for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>, I can honestly say I&#x27;m very pleased by the outcome.</li>
      <li>One, the ingredients are amazing.  </li>
      <li>The Natures Gate product line did not work as effectively at controlling my acne.</li>
      <li>Acid\\&quot;, which is a effective alternative to Benzoyl Peroxide, which can be quite drying for some individuals.  </li>
      <li>I like this product, but I recommend that you take a good look at the list of ingredients and decide if it is a good fit your.</li>
      <li>but all&#x27;s fair in love and war</li>
      <li>It is a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a three-part system like the ones popular in TV commercials, but it&#x27;s milder and made of organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me, but maybe I have some kind of an allergy or something.</li>
      <li>good for your skin if you have very mild acne problems.  </li>
      <li>They feel nice on my face and they smell ok.</li>
      <li>For people with sensitive skin, this might not be the best product.  </li>
      <li>(According to their packaging, it&#x27;s the combination with the Oligopeptide-10 that makes the salicylic acid more effective.)   </li>
      <li>Best stuff I have found so far.</li>
      <li>She claimed the smell was good, but she didn&#x27;t get a clean tingly feeling once she finished, so according to her, the system was a zilch.</li>
      <li>I found this to be very gentle on my skin, and had a great smell, and no alchol.</li>
      <li>I have been using Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System for just under a year now and absolutely love the results.  </li>
      <li>Salicylic Acid isn&#x27;t rated as being too safe if you are pregnate or want to have kids...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d confidently recommend giving it a try.</li>
      <li>I also like that it contain many heaing herbs and amino acids.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased and would recommend it to others, as I already have.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it is an okay product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing wash</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because there IS a lot that I love about it.  </li>
      <li>Even more dramatically, though, it has evened out the skin tone on my cheeks, reducing inflammation and dryness.      </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with how my skin feels and looks when I use the whole system.  </li>
      <li>This is such a wonderful Acne Kit for me.  </li>
      <li>We used it in the family, so more than one person tried it</li>
      <li>This is an ok product.</li>
      <li>I knew that before trying this product, but thought it looked safe to try despite the \\&quot;drying\\&quot; effects noted in the literature.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that I am very happy with the products, and the moisterizer for me is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Two, my skin felt very clean after use.  </li>
      <li>The first bottle, the Corrective Cleanser, attacks acne with good ol&#x27; fashioned salicylic acid.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild on the skin, and somewhat effective.</li>
      <li>The results were amazing and quick.</li>
      <li>Plus, I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is offering it and at such a good price!</li>
      <li>I find the salicylic acid based formula gentler on my skin but still very effective at clearing up breakouts and preventing new ones.  </li>
      <li>The benoxyl peroxide soap work great to clear up my skin.  </li>
      <li>I resolved to give it the full 6 weeks, but have not seen any improvement!</li>
      <li>My problem is that my skin scars easily from the acne that I do get</li>
      <li>it is a very mild product for your skin....</li>
      <li>but they are very mild.</li>
      <li>She takes very good care of her skin and teeth, is a good student in High School (top 10 percent), and has used this product everyday for almost two months.  </li>
      <li>Within a couple months, all acne was gone and my skin was smooth.</li>
      <li>If you have just regular acne, this might be great.  </li>
      <li>It was gentle and effective.  </li>
      <li>This worked great on my daughter&#x27;s back.</li>
      <li>It took about 6 weeks before I starting to see the great results, so you may need to be patient.  </li>
      <li>While it isn&#x27;t a full-fledged cure to acne problems, it is a good treatment that really cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like so many others.  </li>
      <li>I am overall very pleased with the product and plan to order more when I run out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used salicylic acid products in the past without the greatest results, but however Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics acne product is formulated,</li>
      <li>The best and natural way to fight acne, is to go on a yeast restricted diet, after going on this diet for the first time, my skin was completely cleared within a month.  </li>
      <li>I only purchase organic/animal cruelty free products and while natures gate is a great product, I didn&#x27;t really care for all the steps to cleaning my skin.</li>
      <li>If you want to see my full review visit my blog [...]    </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so nice to have an all natural option on the market.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t recommend this product there are more gentle products for controlling acne on the market.</li>
      <li>Although pricey, I gave this as a gift to a friend and they only reported good things.</li>
      <li>I think most acne products are formulated for teens with really oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I just feel a gentle, refreshing tingling.  </li>
      <li>initially thought is was doing a good job, but she had a flair up and needed to get another product to combat the acne.  </li>
      <li>The only solution is to apply good lotion after acnefree does</li>
      <li>I just feel a gentle, refreshing tingling.  </li>
      <li>But- Nature&#x27;s Gate makes great products, I use a lot of their other stuff.</li>
      <li>From what I have read of other reviews it seems fair, easily sunburned skin can&#x27;t tolerate this treatment.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this product would clear my acne, smooth out my skin and give it a more even tone/feel.  </li>
      <li>There was a noticable change quickly.</li>
      <li>If you feel up to this task, 2x a day then by all means I highly recommend it - the price is reasonable and it is effective.</li>
      <li>The third product is more of a cream based application that seems mild and relatively pleasant enough.  </li>
      <li>The second day I used this product my face began to breakout more!</li>
      <li>I really wanted it to work, but benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid works better than this with my positive attitude.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This may be a good product for oily skin, but it is definitely too strong for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I really did enjoy the face wash portion of the kit but found the toner to be lacking and the moisturizer too oily.</li>
      <li>acne is mostly hormonal - when I started taking birth control pills and using tea tree oil and some soap it completely cleared up.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it was effective enough to want to try again at this point.</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin feel smooth, soft, and clean without stripping it or causing irritation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s right, NOTHING.</li>
      <li>right?  </li>
      <li>If you are prone to dry skin this second step may not be ideal</li>
      <li>Though I rarely have problems with lotions, this isn&#x27;t the first time this happened to me.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to give up so easily on the product as I choose to support natural, non-animal tested brands -</li>
      <li>I always expect great (or at least somewhat noticeable) results with skin care regimens...</li>
      <li>The toner was the first to go...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My thirteen-year-old daughter tried this product for her run-of-the-mill acne.  After four days, she developed a rash and had to stop using it.  I don&#x27;t know what triggered her sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on organic, cruelty-free skincare before choosing this kit, and I&#x27;ve noticed pretty much everything has extreme ratings on all organic skincare products, either good or bad.  Everyone has a different lifestyle, genes, skin type, etc. that factor into their acne causes, but my review is based on the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Clinique, Doxycycline and accompanying prescription treatment system, and all of them only made me worse and rashy/Doxy made me extremely sick.&lt;br /&gt;-I have allergic skin reactions to many chemicals, like those found in standard laundry detergent.&lt;br /&gt;-My acne is mostly hormonal - when I started taking birth control pills and using tea tree oil and some soap it completely cleared up.  I also break out a lot from stress.  I&#x27;m also a professional musician and spend a lot of time on stage in costume, with heavy makeup on, sweating up a storm, which helps me break out as well.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m 25, female, vegetarian, consume very little refined sugar, dairy, wheat, processed foods, exercise daily and avoid OTC medication as much as possible (I DO consume alcohol regularly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, when I stopped taking birth control pills, my weight dropped dramatically, prompting me to not want to get back on them.  However, my acne, after five years of being clear, returned with a vengeance, and tea tree oil no longer cut it.  I had cystic acne up and down my entire back and neck, weird rashlike acne on my upper arms with huge weird bumps that would eventually pop like zits, and tons of breakouts on my face.  It this was worse than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever had, even as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple days of using Nature&#x27;s Gate, my regular acne had almost completely cleared up, and my cystic acne looked like regular acne.  I am, as well, supplementing with vitamins and a homeopathic acne pill (ClearAc), as I read acne can be caused by things like poor blood oxygenation, zinc deficiency or other vitamin-repairable factors.  Someone said they felt burning when they used this kit - I just feel a gentle, refreshing tingling.  As I said before, though, everyone has different sensitivities!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, you DO have to have a religious skin regimen to see results, as with anything, be it Nature&#x27;s Gate, ProActiv, or just plain bathing.  You wouldn&#x27;t expect your deodorant to keep you from stinking if you didn&#x27;t reapply it or bathe for multiple days!  And, for some people, it may take longer than others to see said results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I don&#x27;t usually write long reviews, but I feel very strongly about using cruelty-free, natural products whenever possible, and, as a professional musician, I was having a really hard time being broken out and performing every night, being photographed, filmed for television, etc., as so many people see me daily!  I hope some of you with similar lifestyles/body types read my review and find it helpful.  Btw, I did a little searching online and found this kit for only $17, which is initially why I decided to try it!elt burning when they used this kit - I just feel a gentle, refreshing tingling.

    <li> While not a big fan of three step face regimes, I do like Nature&#x27;s Gate products in general and this Acne Treatment System in particular.  Some reviewers have mentioned reactions to Tea Tree Oil. I have lots of allergies, but apparently no sensitivity to Tea Tree Oil. I only use this if I notice some breakouts, which as it is hot and humid where I live now...is this time of year. My sporadic use may be why I&#x27;m not showing any sensitivity, I don&#x27;t know.  I like that these are somewhat more natural than other products out there.  They feel nice on my face and they smell ok. I like this product, but I recommend that you take a good look at the list of ingredients and decide if it is a good fit your.</li>
    <li> Although pricey, I gave this as a gift to a friend and they only reported good things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little like some of the others who have reviewed.  Though I rarely have problems with lotions, this isn&#x27;t the first time this happened to me.  With an ingredient list a mile long, I&#x27;m not surprised that it burned! ;-)  Just because something is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it still can&#x27;t be toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving this item three-stars simply because it might very well work for some people.  I just wish there were a way to send-off for a sample of the lotion first, to see if it&#x27;s going to irritate your skin before you purchase the kit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once a day for the past 2 weeks and I&#x27;m starting to see some results. I do still have a couple blemishes but they are very mild. The areas where I normally don&#x27;t have blemishes are much smoother than before. So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry skin, which is rare for this type of product. I have used a few other brands and this is by far the best. Just be consistent.</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Acne Treatment System is proof that natural and organic mean nothing in the world of allergic reactions and overly-harsh cleansers. Within the first week of using this product my entire face broke out in a rash that looked like tiny little red dots all over my skin (similar looking to a heat rash). Additionally, my skin itched like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was obviously having a negative reaction to some ingredient in the product - however, I was not sure which. I know I&#x27;m not allergic to salicylic acid because I have used products with it before and did not develop the same rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to find a potential cause, I contacted Nature&#x27;s Gate asking if they had had any other customers write about experiencing the same reaction and/or what the possible cause might be (a company SHOULD know this before selling its product). Guess what they said............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right, NOTHING. I never heard back from the company, even after repeated attempts to get in contact with them. I didn&#x27;t want to give up so easily on the product as I choose to support natural, non-animal tested brands - but their lack of care for their own customers and non-existent customer service coupled with the fact that their product provided me with a nice, itchy red rash, has motivated me to give this product and company a negative review. If I could give zero stars, I would. I have never had such a poor experience before with a skin care system or company. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for the past month or so. She has not really used it every day, nor has she used all three elements every time. In spite of that, she reports a very noticeable difference in her skin tone and the amount of acne. This is all the more significant given the past failure of acne medications to clear up her problem. So, overall, I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Organic does not equal safe for sensitive or allergic skin.  I knew that before trying this product, but thought it looked safe to try despite the \\&quot;drying\\&quot; effects noted in the literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first application, the skin on one cheek became inflamed and a breakout actually worsened.  The rest of the face became extremely dry and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a good product for oily skin, but it is definitely too strong for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really did enjoy the face wash portion of the kit but found the toner to be lacking and the moisturizer too oily. The whole kit lasted about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is an okay product but I rather stick with other face care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years.  Even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin I bought this product because of it&#x27;s all natural/organic image.  I have a few blemishes on my face but I&#x27;ve never been happy with the appearance of my skin.  I was hoping this product would clear my acne, smooth out my skin and give it a more even tone/feel.  I used this product for about 4 days following the directions religiously.  After the fourth day my skin became irritated and my face and neck broke out into a red, bumpy, itchy rash that looks and feels like sandpaper.  I immediately discontinued use and it has been almost a week and the rash has not cleared up! I&#x27;ve read some reviews where the rash can last up to two/three weeks!  not fun!  I was highly disappointed in this product and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products but none of them have caused me break out in a rash like this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to breakouts in the summer months so I gave this a try. My skin had the same reaction initially to it as when I used Retin-A in the past. It got a bit dry and itchy. But unlike with Retin-A, I didn&#x27;t notice any clearing of the area from breakouts in the following days so I stopped using it. Can&#x27;t say it was effective enough to want to try again at this point.</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactive for years but decided to try something new.  The second day I used this product my face began to breakout more! I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After using this for a while on low level acne I&#x27;ve realized Nature&#x27;s Gate is as good as other similar products, without causing some of the staining those products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a magic fix.  There&#x27;s no &#x27;one day there, one day gone&#x27; answer.  However, overall, I&#x27;ve noticed a lessening of inflammation and breakouts, without any side effects at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meaning I&#x27;m quite pleased with it, and once out I will likely look to get this again rather than continue to experiment with other acne treatment systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note, however, that this can&#x27;t be seen as a single approach. Combined with a variety of responses, including diet and exercise, this is a helpful part of a holistic approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased and would recommend it to others, as I already have.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my daughter&#x27;s back. There was a noticable change quickly. It was gentle and effective.  I would buy this product for acne.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne, and broke out worse than a teen after a month of using this. I really wanted it to work, but benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid works better than this with my positive attitude.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I had my second baby because my acne was really severe.  It help to decrease some of the acne, but it didn&#x27;t clear it up completely. So after doing some research I decided to purchase the benoxyl peroxide soap.  The benoxyl peroxide soap work great to clear up my skin.  It drys the skin out, so I decided to give the nature&#x27;s gate acne treatment another try, since my acne wasn&#x27;t as severe.  It same to keep things under control for about 2 weeks, then the acne slowly return.  I should mention that instead of using the toner I used apple cider vinegar, which has always worked great for me.  Instead of using the creme I used shea butter and coconut oil on my face, which keeps my face moisturized.    So this product didn&#x27;t work great for me when I tried it the first time following the instructions, and it didn&#x27;t work the second time even after I added other products that work.    If you want to see my full review visit my blog [...]    I will have to do some research to find a soap that is just as good as benoxyl peroixide soap that I&#x27;m using but is not as harsh to the skin.  The best and natural way to fight acne, is to go on a yeast restricted diet, after going on this diet for the first time, my skin was completely cleared within a month.  I used lemon to clear up the scaring.  I&#x27;m not able to keep up with the yeast restricted diet for very long because it causes you to loose weight and I&#x27;m already small.

    <li> I would not feel good about recommending this product to any of my friends at this time. I know the product says it may take up to 6 weeks to work but...I have been using it for 5 and a half weeks and my skin is broken out worse than ever. It started breaking out the first day I used the product, and in places I don&#x27;t usually break out (jawline, cheeks). I resolved to give it the full 6 weeks, but have not seen any improvement! Also, the toner runs out after about 5 weeks but there is still plenty of cleanser and lotion. Unless there is significant improvement in the next few days, I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a few weeks until one night when my skin had a very strong reaction.  My face turned red as if I had been out in the sun all day and got burned like a lobster.  The experience scared me out of ever using this product again.  I guess Salacylic Acid can be harsh on some skin types, but this was worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Even my Mom was scared when she saw my face and how red it was.  She just kept saying over and over again \\&quot;that&#x27;s scary,\\&quot; as if on replay.  I hope this review my save other people my same fate.  Be careful when using this product, especially the Acne Lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my daughter who is one of those Proactive gotta have types. I figured this product being organic would be good for her. WRONG. according to her, her skin felt greasy when she got to the last step. She claimed the smell was good, but she didn&#x27;t get a clean tingly feeling once she finished, so according to her, the system was a zilch. that is it. not recommended by me at all.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product. We used it in the family, so more than one person tried it and we neither felt it has outstanding effects, nor negative effects. We will probably not re-order.</li>
    <li> NO LONGER BEING MADE.       This is such a wonderful Acne Kit for me.  I have had some really wonderful results using these products. Everyone will get different results, but for me to get the great results, I had to use the system twice a day everyday, and not forget to do it.  It took about 6 weeks before I starting to see the great results, so you may need to be patient.  This is not a cure, once you stop the system, just like any other acne treatment the acne will come back, or is you get lazy and miss a day or two, you might break out.  So remember that you have to keep on it.  That goes for any acne system I have used.  If you want results have have to be diligent. I found this to be very gentle on my skin, and had a great smell, and no alchol. Of course I do have a few things I don&#x27;t like.  I would like to see bigger sizes of the toner and the moisterizer since I go through them so fast.  I would also like to see the salicylic acid be at 2%. Other than that I am very happy with the products, and the moisterizer for me is amazing.  I don&#x27;t seem to sweat it out of my pores like many times happens with other products that I used.  I also like that it contain many heaing herbs and amino acids. As for the comment someone made that salicylic acid wasn&#x27;t organic, I am not sure that is true.  I have always thought it was made from a compond in the willow tree, if I remember correctly. The same stuff asprin comes from.  Can anyone comment on that, that has any knowledge.  Anyways.  Best stuff I have found so far. I only hope it will work for you as well as it has for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and its the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with blemishes and adult acne and have tried many products but this stuff gives me perfectly clear skin. I typically use the cleanser when I shower in the morning and the toner at night. The moisturizer is great too. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> For people with sensitive skin, this might not be the best product.  It is similar to Proactive in price and in application but after using this product for two weeks what looked and felt like a chemical burn appeared all over teenager&#x27;s face. In addition, it didn&#x27;t appear to clear up any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product there are more gentle products for controlling acne on the market.</li>
    <li> I did feel some burn after applying the lotion, but no flaming rashes here thankfully. Nothing unusual, especially if you have used skin scrubs in the past. The smell was pretty neutral for all 3 components, which is a big plus for me. As to the success I had in using it to clear my acne? I have only mild, occasional acne, and it seemed to do the job within 3 days. Then again, would my blemishes have disappeared within 4? Probably.    From what I saw from the other reviewers, I wouldn&#x27;t expect any magical results if you have severe acne. But from my experience, the system&#x27;s worth a try if other brands have failed you.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System for just under a year now and absolutely love the results.  I had been using another kit that uses benzoyl peroxide as its main acne-fighting ingredient, but it really dried my skin out and the bleaching action of the peroxide ruined countless towels and T-shirt necklines. &lt;br /&gt;So when a friend recommended Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Kit, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  After that first kit, I&#x27;ve never even considered using anything else.  I find the salicylic acid based formula gentler on my skin but still very effective at clearing up breakouts and preventing new ones.  I&#x27;ve used salicylic acid products in the past without the greatest results, but however Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics acne product is formulated, IT WORKS.  (According to their packaging, it&#x27;s the combination with the Oligopeptide-10 that makes the salicylic acid more effective.)   &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really important to stick to the complete regimen, though.  When I first started using the kit, I used the three products haphazardly, using the cleanser one day but not the toner and lotion, etc.  I could tell the difference, though, when I followed the package directions and used all three.  The cleanser, toner and lotion each have their function and I&#x27;m really happy with how my skin feels and looks when I use the whole system.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on how good my skin looks, too, since I started using Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics. &lt;br /&gt;This is also the first formula I&#x27;ve found that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I think most acne products are formulated for teens with really oily skin.  For those of us past puberty (I&#x27;m 30+) but still dealing with adult acne, we need products that are effective but gentle. And the fact that it contains natural/organic ingredients is an added bonus.  All of those botanicals makes it smell great, too!  &lt;br /&gt;For me, Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment is perfect.  I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but I felt compelled when I saw it posted here because I really believe in this product.  Plus, I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is offering it and at such a good price!</li>
    <li> Growing up, I dealt with what most would consider normal teenage acne.  As I have matured, the acne has slowly gone away, with only a blemish or two popping up here or there.  My wife also tackled the average teen&#x27;s acne, but after the birth of our second child, her breakouts increased.  Granted, she doesn&#x27;t suffer from severe acne, but she does have a higher degree of breakouts than before she had our second child.  With that in mind, I decided to pick up Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is very simple to use.  So simple, in fact, that the bottles are numbered one, two, and three.  The first bottle, the Corrective Cleanser, attacks acne with good ol&#x27; fashioned salicylic acid.  Fans of Oxy and other cleansers will recognize this stuff.  Coupled with it is encapsulated tea tree oil, which helps unclog pores.  The second step in the process involves the Calming Toner, which contains Oligopeptide-10, more of the aforementioned tree oil and \\&quot;botanical extracts\\&quot; which together supposedly control the amount of oil on the skin and further clean out those pores.  The last bottle is the Controlling Lotion, which uses the Oligopeptide-10 and our old friend salicylic acid to maintain a clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my wife tried this product, she did mention a slight burning sensation.  However, this was expected thanks to the salicylic acid and the tree oil.  I can see where those with sensitive skin could experience an adverse reaction to this, so use this product at your own risk if your skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product a few days, she did notice a slight reduction in acne, but nothing more or less than the results when using Oxy products.  While she liked the Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics system, she saw no reason to abandon her other cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is certified organic, which is a plus, but in this day and age the almighty dollar is what speaks the loudest.  In my opinion, if you get similar or better results using a cheaper product, use it instead of Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System.  The system works fairly well, but nothing makes it stand out from any of the other systems on the market other than its eco-friendliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to anyone with moderate acne problems who prefers to use organic brands.r product, use it instead of Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System.  The system works fairly well, but nothing makes it stand out from any of the other systems on the market other than its eco-friendliness.    Recommended to anyone with moderate acne problems who prefers to use organic brands.</li>
    <li> Our nephew has cystic acne and we got this product for him.  It didn&#x27;t help much (a little but barely noticeable*), but then really, the only thing that seems to help his acne is antibiotics.  So, it might not be a fair evaluation of the product.  If you have just regular acne, this might be great.  It just didn&#x27;t help his much.  *On the \\&quot;barely noticeable\\&quot;, it might have cleared up the parts of his skin that have regular acne but it didn&#x27;t touch the boil-like cysts.</li>
    <li> This is a three-part system like the ones popular in TV commercials, but it&#x27;s milder and made of organic ingredients. If you try to use only organic products, it&#x27;s a workable alternative. It&#x27;s mild on the skin, and somewhat effective. It can&#x27;t compare to the other, less \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; kits on the market, though, and it&#x27;s approximately the same price. I have skin that&#x27;s moderately sensitive, oily and prone to breakouts. It seemed to help healing somewhat, and my face certainly felt clean, but it didn&#x27;t have the stronger healing action or drying action that one of the major brands gives me. The best part of it was that it never caused any excess dryness, and it would be great for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the review by the woman in her 30&#x27;s saying it didn&#x27;t dry out her skin ect.  For me, this product was useless in clearing up acne.  I broke out the entire time I used it.  The cleanser &amp; astringent aren&#x27;t enough.  I used them up over a month ago &amp; have maybe a 1/4 of the cream left.  The only good thing it seemed to do was help to exfoliate my skin keeping away the dry winter flakes that are included with my acne.  Crazy, but that&#x27;s me.  Salicylic Acid isn&#x27;t rated as being too safe if you are pregnate or want to have kids... hardly Organic!!  I didn&#x27;t know this until after I was using it.  I will finish it up so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste but will not purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful user of Pro Active for many years now but decided to give Natures Gate Organics Acne Treatment System a try. If I were to compare the two of them and pick a favorite, it would be Pro Active. The Natures Gate product line did not work as effectively at controlling my acne. When I use Pro Active, I can instantly feel the product working because of the tingling sensation. For now, until I find a better line, I will be sticking with Pro Active.</li>
    <li> This set is very nice.  While it isn&#x27;t a full-fledged cure to acne problems, it is a good treatment that really cleans and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like so many others.  It&#x27;s a refreshing wash and it&#x27;s so nice to have an all natural option on the market.  I&#x27;d confidently recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I barely have any acne, but I thought I&#x27;d try this and see if it improved things. I used it for a few weeks and I think it made it worse. I think it was starting to make me get a rash so I quit using it.    But- Nature&#x27;s Gate makes great products, I use a lot of their other stuff. It didn&#x27;t work for me, but maybe I have some kind of an allergy or something.</li>
    <li> The Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System works really well. It cleared up my sons face within a couple of weeks. The only down side is it takes persistence and using it everyday. So unless I am reminding my son every night to use it he forgets. So if you are going to use this product, to get results you need to use it consitently like other acne products.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 18 year old daughter.  She has very mild acne only on her face....like I did in the 70s.  She takes very good care of her skin and teeth, is a good student in High School (top 10 percent), and has used this product everyday for almost two months.  We have been trying to find a good product this year.  It is a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She initially thought is was doing a good job, but she had a flair up and needed to get another product to combat the acne.  She actually found a product called \\&quot;acnefree temninator 10\\&quot;.  She says the new product really dries her skin....which is not good.  The only solution is to apply good lotion after acnefree does it&#x27;s job.  This is what I did in the 70&#x27;s....use a product that really, really dried out the acne and then I just applied lots of lotion.  I know this may not be the best for your skin....but at 52...and I still use lots of lotion, my skin is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To rap it up...it is a very mild product for your skin....good for your skin if you have very mild acne problems.  If you get a flair up, it does not handle the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product!  Bottom line was that it just did not work for me.  It seemed to be working a little in the beginning, but I am down to the last bit of the cleanser and I am still breaking out.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because there IS a lot that I love about it.  One, the ingredients are amazing.  As far as I can tell, there is really nothing toxic in any of this stuff.  I&#x27;m not an expert and I didn&#x27;t research every little thing on the ingredient list, but there is some really good, natural stuff in here.  Two, my skin felt very clean after use.  The cleanser lathers really well, you hardly need more than a dime sized drop and the toner and moisturizer felt really refreshing as well.  Three, to me it smells really good.  I know a few people had complaints about the smell, but to me it was a natural, clean fragrance.  There isn&#x27;t much I don&#x27;t like about this product besides the fact that it just didn&#x27;t clear up my skin.  Also, the moisturizer was a tad on the oily side...sometimes after applying it my face looked kind of shiny and felt a little greasy...maybe I was just using a little too much.  I also think the reason it didn&#x27;t really work that well for me was because everything ran out at different times.  The toner was the first to go...I used that up within about 3 weeks or so.  Then the moisturizer and like I said, I&#x27;ve only got a bit of the cleanser left...which I am still using, because it does make my skin feel clean and fresh.  I was going to give this a second go around, but ultimately decided not to, even though it is priced really well here on Amazon.  All I know is that I am definitely NOT going back to ProActiv.</li>
    <li> I am a bit conflicted about writing this review because I actually like this product.  I believe Nature&#x27;s Gate Acne Treatment System is modeled after ProActiv, which provides a systematic approach to treating acne (i.e. cleanse, tone, and heal).  The active ingredient is \\&quot;Salicylic Acid\\&quot;, which is a effective alternative to Benzoyl Peroxide, which can be quite drying for some individuals.  I use this product regularly and have reaped the benefits.  Your mileage may vary depending on your skin type and the severity of your acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, a recent problem I have encountered with kits purchased on Amazon, and one which every customer should be aware of, is the expiration date marked on the bottom of the box and on the products themselves.  On two occasions, I received kits that have expiration dates that have already past (some as  much as 10 MONTHS!!!!).  I believe this is TOTALLY  UNACCEPTABLE!!!  The product&#x27;s effectiveness (or lack thereof) may be dependent upon whether or not the product is fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYERS BEWARE!!!  Always check the expiration date on the bottom of the box before opening and using this product.  If the date is expired or close to expiring, send it back to Amazon for a replacement kit or a full refund.</li>
    <li> I have some mild acne from time to time, and I&#x27;ve tried different skin products while most helped a little, hiding and slowing the dryness after trying Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatmen, I can honestly say I&#x27;m very pleased by the outcome. The results were amazing and quick. Within 2 weeks my skin was a lot smoother. Within a couple months, all acne was gone and my skin was smooth. There was a little initial pinkness but that went away after a couple days. There is also a very slight but odd odor after putting it on.</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System really does work if you have mild to moderate acne but there is a caveat - it will dry out your skin if you are prone to such and it does require more effort then I am accustomed to for a daily type treatment.  This kit includes 3 different products that is recommended for twice a day application.  The first product is a basic facewash, lather up and scrub down.  The second step is to grab a cotton ball and squeeze out a dab of a facial toner that you then apply.  If you are prone to dry skin this second step may not be ideal but all&#x27;s fair in love and war right?  The third product is more of a cream based application that seems mild and relatively pleasant enough.  The whole process will take approximately 5 minutes to go through.  If you feel up to this task, 2x a day then by all means I highly recommend it - the price is reasonable and it is effective.</li>
    <li> I always expect great (or at least somewhat noticeable) results with skin care regimens...so that&#x27;s what I was expecting with Nature&#x27;s Gate. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see much change at all (except for a dried out face). Granted, I didn&#x27;t use the product for the entire month--but I figure if I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results after two weeks, I probably wasn&#x27;t going to see any after a month.</li>
    <li> Although I love the idea of a natural acne treatment, this product actually made my face breakout worse than ever.  The last step made my face really oily.  I had to go back to what I was using before within one week of using this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with acne per se, just combination skin that is part oily and part dry, so I have to be careful of the products I use on it.  I was worried about this being an acne treatment irritating the dry skin areas, but it was \\&quot;calming, soothing\\&quot; as the description says to my entire face.  I use it about once a week and it makes my skin feel smooth, soft, and clean without stripping it or causing irritation.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and have tried a number of different vegan and natural products that claim to fight acne  or even out your complexion with generally poor results.  I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now and saw a result within the first few weeks of using it.  I have been faithfully using the product as directed, using all three parts of the kit twice a day.  Following that regimen, I found that it definitely reduced the oiliness and outbreaks on my forehead and chin.  Even more dramatically, though, it has evened out the skin tone on my cheeks, reducing inflammation and dryness.      I don&#x27;t have severe acne and suspect that this product would not be strong enough for someone who suffers from more serious outbreaks.  My problem is that my skin scars easily from the acne that I do get and I tend to suffer from uneven skin tone.  For those problems, I feel this product has worked at least as well as I had hoped, definitely superior to other products I have tried.  I am overall very pleased with the product and plan to order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have two grandnieces with problem skin. The oldest used it for one day and stopped because it irritated her skin so badly, almost like she was sunburned. The other grandniece used it for four days, saw an improvement of a breakout on her forehead, but her skin became so irritated she had to stop. She too looked like she had a sunburn. This product works, but it is also very harsh. From what I have read of other reviews it seems fair, easily sunburned skin can&#x27;t tolerate this treatment. And both my girls are very fair and have to slather on the sunscreen when they spend any time in the sun. Too bad, the girls and I had high hopes for this as a less expensive alternative to Proactive.</li>
    <li> Anyone fighting acne like I have for the past 2 years, theres a procedure called Levulan. It&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s like a peel, but not as harsh or drastic. My skin has cleared 98% after 1 treatment. I only purchase organic/animal cruelty free products and while natures gate is a great product, I didn&#x27;t really care for all the steps to cleaning my skin.</li>
