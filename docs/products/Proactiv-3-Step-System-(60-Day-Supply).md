<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> 1 star for actually working...to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the cost is subsidized into the containers, you actually get a very tiny amount of the actual product, in fact, one of the containers is almost completely hollow. Also, the proportions are completely off, so you&#x27;re left with useless containers.&lt;br /&gt;When trying to cancel, they told me to try it for a while, and that they&#x27;ll delay my next shipping 3 months. I completely forgot about it and they sent me a package that&#x27;s apparently 3X the size, and so 3X the cost. I&#x27;m going to refund it, and see how that goes.</li>
    <li> as good as before... love these products</li>
    <li> My skin was fairly bad. I was using the Proactiv Wal-Mart equivalent to no avail. I bought the real Proactiv, and had no luck with that either. A few months later I decided to give it another shot. I followed the steps by the book- step 1, dry my face, wait a few minutes. Step 2, wait for it to dry (less time than step 1.) And then step 3. This time, it has worked amazingly. I don&#x27;t know that maybe my skin has realized I am no longer 14 and decided to stop ruining me, or that it is because of the Proactiv. I&#x27;m still going to keep using it, because I do not want to find out.     Also, I follow step 3 with Equate medicated acne gel. It&#x27;s not even a gel, but I use it all over my face each time. And, these products WILL bleach your towels/clothes. Definitely wash your hands thoroughly before touching anything else.</li>
    <li> Just like any other acne medicine it works for most, but not for all.  But for me it worked wonders.  Never having an acne issue, I really never worried about my skin.  Then I got pregnant and my hormones knocked me back into puberty I guess.  Zits everywhere.  I have been using Proactiv for 7 years now and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  In fact after using it for an amount of time, I don&#x27;t have to use it near as much as when you begin. I skip days and most days only have to use it once.  If I start to get a zit, just zap some of the \\&quot;mask\\&quot; on it like you would clearasil, and it gets rid of it within a day or two. It is a terrific product and I recommend it so much that I even got it for my 14 year old step-daughter.  Who also swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT get it from the proactiv website unless you want to pay more and just throw your money away.  You pay $30 a month no matter how often you actually get your set.  And if you only get your set every 3 months that is 90 bucks plus other shipping fees, etc. that would only pay $60 at the mall for (or less than that on certain websites)... you are paying way over the price it is really worth!  And if you deactivate your account you still paid that last 30 bucks for nothing, because if you cancel before your next shipment, you are never going to get that money back even though you didn&#x27;t get product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot for a few months and I am certain it will work as well for you as it does for me &amp; my family.</li>
    <li> I have had life-long problems with moderate to severe acne. I&#x27;m 30, and before now, the times when I didn&#x27;t have at least a few blemishes were far and few between. I rarely, if ever, had perfectly clear and balanced skin. My skin was always blemished, oily, and flaky in places. About 2 years ago it got alot worse for some reason, so I went on Ortho Tri Cyclen hoping that would help. My acne got much much worse after that. It exploded all over the place. I looked like I had smallpox. I went to the dermatologist and started doxycycline (which I liked and continued to use as it helped a lot - though I would still breakout) and also tried using several prescriptions topicals, all of which burned my skin all to hell and my skin peeled all over the place in spite of using a very good moisturizer. Then I tried natural remedies: manuka honey, oatmeal, olive oil, witch hazel, apple cider vinager, vitamins, eating very healthy foods, and so on and so forth. Nothing worked. So finally I tried proactive. I use this system in conjunction with two moisturizers that I LOVE by Lush: Vanishing Cream at night and Gorgeous during the day. A top of the line moisturizer is the key to making this system work, imo. I saw results within a week, and now my skin is ALWAYS clear. If I don&#x27;t wash my face at night (I wear Mac Studio Fix) I may get a very small blemish that quickly goes away with regular cleansing/maintenance. My skin is also BALANCED for the first time ever. It isn&#x27;t oily nor dry nor combination. Just soft and balanced. I find that the cleanser runs out very quickly - much faster than the other products ( I only use the toner and lotion - not the mask or anything else by proactiv) - so I use it at night, and use another scrub I like, Aubrey Organics Jojoba Meal and Oatmeal Mask and Scrub with Rose and Lavender for Dry Skin, in the morning. It really, really softens and brightens your skin. I&#x27;ve also found that since using the proactiv and lush moisturizers my acne scars have faded FAST. I bought a skin lightening gel on ebay, but I haven&#x27;t needed to use it. I&#x27;m very please with this system, and I hope it never stops working for me. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do. This has been the only cure for my acne, which I believe might be hormonal. Do not use this system without an excellent moisturizer and expect good results. What don&#x27;t I like about these products: the packaging. The bottles are ugly and cheap looking. But the ingredients do produce results. Eventually I was able to stop using doxycycline and my skin has remained clear. I never worry about acne now, and it&#x27;s such a relief and a blessing. I totally wasted large sums of money at the dermatologist. A+++</li>
    <li> What a horrible product! I tried proactive a couple years ago and first of all every tiny bottle they send you costs an absolute fortune. Second, all proactive did for my skin was irritate and dry it out. Whats funny is their miracle secret formula for killing zits is guess what? Benzoyle peroxide!! Wow what a breakthru thats what every other product uses!!! Only difference is proactive marks up their items about 1000% higher than everyone else. To make things worse after i sent back the bottles for my \\&quot;risk free\\&quot; trial they only gave me a small refund claiming i didn&#x27;t send back all the bottles (which I did) and they said i couldn&#x27;t prove it. Luckily now I actually am using stridex essential pads with vitamins (which doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin) together with a walmart generic benzoyle peroxide gel and i have clear skin for a tiny fraction of the price of proactive and with no irritation. Overall I give proactive a grade F</li>
    <li> First, I do not have acne. I use this product to control mild breakouts that I have from time to time. I only use the system when I see that happening. For that, this product works great. It speeds up the \\&quot;life cycle\\&quot; of the pimple / blemish, and it prevents the spread of others as well.    I do not use this between breakouts. It is way too harsh. It really dries out the skin and, unless I have a blemish in the area, I never apply it around the eyes. I did that once and my fine wrinkles immediately became more prominent due to the drying out of the skin.    In my opinion, only use this product as needed.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and it irritated my skin horribly! It didnt work miracles like the product company claims, and it actually made my face itchy and red.  I returned the product and the sales associate assured me I could use a \\&quot;gentler formula\\&quot; with salicylic acid.  I said okay, I would like to try it, however looking at the ingredients of both this product and the stuff from a normal drug store, there was no difference! They knock up the prices and say they use the best ingredients and they arent, they are cheap! Methylparaben, butylparaben and chemicals like that are used and are known as a cheap chemical used in beauty products, shampoos, lotions etc. Overall, my experience with Proactiv was horrible. I was also constantly being sent new product and charged because unless you tell them they re-send new product every 4 weeks, which is ridiculous because getting a refund takes several weeks! Bad, bad experience!</li>
    <li> I first started suffering from acne when I turned 14 and hit puberty.  I went through a delayed puberty so when I first started breaking out (small blackheads and whiteheads around my nose); I didn&#x27;t know what to do.    I am now 19.  In the 5 years that I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne it has progressively exacerbated.  It reached a peak around 15 and 16.  I was a sophomore in high school and I had a terribly low self-esteem.  I hardly ever had eye contact with my teachers or classmates because I was so embarrassed of myself.  It did take a huge toll on my social life because it totally killed my self-esteem as a person.     I can&#x27;t quite remember when Proactiv Solutions started to become very popular, especially during 2005 or so when it started to become increasingly popular through advertisements.  I will sit in front of my TV and ponder if it really did work like magic as the long commercials made it seem.  Proactiv was advertised very strongly through the use of pathos and by providing testimonies of different patients that truly made it seem like it had changed their lives.  To an extent, I have to admit I started to feel somewhat brainwashed concerning the effectiveness of this product. (Crazy how much advertisement can affect you psychologically).     It wasn&#x27;t until late in my sophomore year of high school when I finally decided to give Proactiv a try.  I had nothing to lose, really...just a few bucks.    When I finally got the kit delivered at my house I was overjoyed with happiness.  I read through the booklet that was included and started to use it as the directions stated.  At first I felt like I had put all my hope and faith into this one product but after a few weeks of use, I started to realize it really wasn&#x27;t as magical as a lot of the commercials made it seem.     I&#x27;m going to be very frank with you...Proactiv might seem to work at first but after repetitive uses it will start to lose efficiency.  For the first 2 weeks or so, my acne definitely got better:  blackheads started to dissipate and I also lost sight of most pimples.    After a month or so, my acne started to gain control over the medication.  It no longer worked as well as it did the first few weeks and I felt I had been shot in the leg once again.  My faith in Proactiv started to decrease and I became frustrated with the medication in general.      What bothered me the most was the fact that Proactiv only works if you use it consistently:  Twice a day and every day of your life, really.  Even Proactiv itself states how you have to use this product on a daily basis.  I&#x27;m not a very diligent person so the 3 step therapy that Proactiv requires started to become annoying.  I found it extremely cumbersome having to wake up early in the morning to go through the entire 3 step therapy, and then setting aside some time to apply it before going to bed.  The second step was the most annoying one because you have to wait until the cleanser (Revitalizing Toner) dries before you can apply the repairing lotion.  After I realized that Proactiv was starting to lose effectiveness, so did my diligence began to crumble.      I&#x27;m now 19 and I must confess that Proactiv has been somewhat of a disappointment for me.  I have learned over 5 years how to cope with acne and minimize it, but I have not completely found a cure or \\&quot;secret recipe\\&quot; to fight it completely. My acne has definitely improved since high school, but it hasn&#x27;t gone away completely.      Proactiv is one of those products that only works as well as commercials and testimonies declare for only a very specific audience.  I feel that this product might not be for you if you suffer from hereditary and chronic acne (this is my case).  If you are one of those people reading this review and still pondering whether or not you should buy it, I will first take a step back and consider what kind of acne you have...    If you have moderate to mild acne, this product might work perfectly for you.  I&#x27;m going to be veryfrank, I&#x27;ve met some people that have truly loved this product because it works for them.  It might not work for you.  The efficiency of this product depends on many factors.  One of them is whether or not you can keep up with it...    Buying a kit every month or so can turn out to be very costly, especially for a person that cannot afford paying $44 + S&amp;H every time you run out of supply.  Another factor is how consistent you are with applying the product properly.  You have to be extremely diligent about it while simultaneously maintaining a healthy lifestyle (eating right, exercising, maintaining high hygiene standards, etc.)  A huge part of getting rid of acne depends on the effort of the person and how well you balance your life.  The last and most important factor is the type of skin you have as well as the severity of your acne.  If you suffer from moderate acne, which is what a lot of teenagers and adults have, this product will work wonders for you.      I won&#x27;t completely dismiss the fact that through advertisement Proactiv has gained a reputation on being one of America&#x27;s greatest antidotes for acne.  Most people by now know about it and the brand itself is becoming iconic concerning today&#x27;s society about being among the most popular treatments for acne.  I personally find it a bit overrated concerning it&#x27;s effectiveness. Acne is something that most people encounter in their lives at least once and that&#x27;s probably the reason why Proactiv has become so popular, especially among those individuals that are extremely conscious of their image.      Also, although the commercials make it seem that Proactiv is not harsh on your skin, it actually is. I have relatively resilient skin and I have used much more stronger medications to cope with my acne and I must confess that Proactiv does make my face itch and burn after the application of the repairing lotion.  Vulnerable areas like around the lips and eyes can react very sensitive to this medication.  For many, this product might be a painful experience using it as it does burn (especially during the first few applications before your skin gets used to it completely.)     The reason why I gave this product 3 stars for my evaluation was because it does seem to work better than most over-the-counter products that are out there.  Like I said, it does work for some people but it might not work for you.  If you are one of those people that suffers from hereditary acne, I think I will consider investing in other much stronger medications like Accutane or something in that form that can combat acne from the inside.  Acne is predominantly caused and controlled through internal factors such as the chemistry of your body which include your oil production and the fluctuation of your hormones (these are the two predominant factors that affect acne; aside from genetic inheritance.)    I personally can&#x27;t afford Accutane but I have consider trying it in the future despite the known side effects (liver damage, possible depression, etc.)  I have heard extremely positive commentaries from the people that have tried Accutane which is currently the only medication that can really cure acne.  Although it is a 6 month treatment and it must be under strict observation, it does seem to have extremely favorable results for those that undergo it.  I think for those people that do suffer from severe acne it is better to fight acne from the inside with oral antibiotics like Accutane, instead of just attacking acne from the outside.  As I mentioned earlier, acne is triggered because of your chemistry, so attacking acne from the inside seems more rational to me than just applying it directly on to the skin where it can only do so much.       If you suffer from moderate acne and acne does not run in your family, I will definitely consider this product.  It certainly has a lengthy research history and it is definitely an \\&quot;above average\\&quot; acne product when you compare it to other much inferior products thatyou find in today&#x27;s stores like Neutragena, or Clearasil.  By the way, I have also tried AcneFree, which can be considered the corollary to Proactiv and it is definitely a lot stronger (in my opinion).  You can get it through Amazon as well and it is slightly more affordable than Proactiv Solutions.  It has a similar net effect on your skin as Proactiv, however.  You must use it consistently and there&#x27;s a possibility your skin might grow immune to it pretty rapidly.      Acne is one of those things that takes part of most people&#x27;s lives and this product will always be among the most well known medications to control it.  If you can afford this product, use it consistently and as indicated, and keep in mind buying this product for the next decade or so of your life before acne starts to become less evident, then buy it.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t because it will only be a waste of money and acne will keep becoming a persistent force in your life.    Bottom line:  If you suffer from mild acne, I will totally recommend this product.  However, I will keep in mind the statements I have mentioned above before buying it.  If you suffer from almost incurable and persistent acne, I wouldn&#x27;t put too much trust in it.  It might work but there&#x27;s also a chance you might end up with a similar story as me.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product if used everyday as directed, I stoped using it for about 2 months and using store brand cleanser and I broke out bad then I switched back to Proactiv and I cleared up within a week. I would recommend anyone who has issues with acne try this product at least once and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you then move on to another product, always keep in mind not all skin types are alike so this may or may not work for you... Also i use this 3 step system with the refining mask 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online as a gift for my 12 year old daughter. I didn&#x27;t realize that I had joined a membership or agreed to future purchase commitments (not used to looking out for this when buying items!). Two weeks after giving her the Proactiv, my account was charged another $40. I called and canceled the membership and was told to send the item back when I received it. Three weeks later, the shipment I had already been charged for came, but by then my account had been charged AGAIN! I was told it would take 4-6 weeks to process each return and would still pay $20 for shipping and handling! RIP OFF! If you buy this, do it over the phone, and make sure you don&#x27;t agree to future purchases if you don&#x27;t want them!!    Bottom Line:  - The acne care process is complicated and time consuming  - The company will scam you into buying additional products you did not know you ordered  - The results are disappointing</li>
    <li> I started using Proactive several years ago (I am currently 30).  This summer, I began to break out again, so I left Proactive and tried tons of other products.  Either they dried my skin out like no other, or made it too greasy.  I ended up coming back to Proactive because nothing else compared.  I will say though, that I have added an extra step to the process.  Before I use the proactiv cleanser, I wash with neutrogena face bar for sensitive skin.  This combination (Neutrogena and Proactiv) seems to wash away ALL the dirt and oil, yet moisturize and keep breakouts at an absolute minimum.  I also think that proactiv helps your skin to look young!</li>
    <li> Be careful of Proactiv company and their predatory marketing practices.  They pretend to offer trials and then sneak in exhorbitantly priced subscriptions that you don&#x27;t intend to sign up for or realize that they have stealthily included in the \\&quot;offer\\&quot;.  What makes this practice clearly \\&quot;predatory\\&quot; is that they have no real customer service staff with authority or willingness to correct the problems when it&#x27;s brought to their attention.  I really feel duped.    [[ASIN:B001A3ML3K Proactiv Solution 3 Step System Kit, 2 Month Supply]][[ASIN:B001SA5DZS Proactiv 4 Pc Kit 30 Day Supply]]</li>
    <li> I suffer from cyctic acne and Proactiv is the only thing that can keep it at bay. I stared using the product several years ago, but had to discontinue buying it because it wasn&#x27;t in my budjet at the time. Almost immeadiately I started getting the huge, painful blemishes that are cystic acne. I put up with it for as long as I could. I work in the beauty industry, and I felt that I was losing credibility with my clients. Why would anyone want to take beauty advice from someone with giant bumps all over her face? Finally I had the bright idea to check Amazon to see if I could find Proactiv. I&#x27;m happy to say I found it at an affordable price. That was six months ago and I haven&#x27;t had one single cystic acne blemish since. I love Proactiv!</li>
    <li> If I could give this a negative trillion stars, I would.     I order this product, and I don&#x27;t even have acne. I get a few pimples on my forehead (because I have bangs) once or twice a month. The product MADE MY SKIN WORSE! Once I stopped using it my skin got better!     When I tried to return the product within their 60 day \\&quot;no hassle\\&quot; policy, they claimed it was too late. I have the receipt to prove that I sent it in time, and they still won&#x27;t send me a refund. In fact, they are CHARGING ME for the last 2 installments! Absolutely ridiculous.     Their product is terrible and ridiculously expensive.  DO NOT EVEN TRY IT! Honestly, I know what you&#x27;re thinking \\&quot;it might be different for me\\&quot; but you&#x27;re wrong.. it won&#x27;t be. I guarantee this is the worst company to deal with.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not a revolutionary acne product. It turns everything white (now they&#x27;ve started including this warning on the inserts) and it does only an average job as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I don&#x27;t really have bad skin, but around exam times and stressful periods I get the occasional breakout. I decided to order it when they had the $19.99 sale, but that was a complete scam. They send you the tiniest bottles they have and then automatically put you on their monthly shipping list. I called customer service and the lady I talked to basically read me a script and couldn&#x27;t care less about how frustrated I was. I cancelled my account but I received another shipment and was charged. Funny how they cancel the account but leave your credit card info on their site. I finally ended up filing a claim with my credit card company which stopped the madness.</li>
    <li> I TRIED THIS, AND IT WORKED EXCELLENT. I HAVE SKIN THAT OILS UP ASAP. SO THE BREAK OUTS ARE HORRIBLE.  PROACTIV REALLY HELPED. BUT I STOPPED AND USED OTHER PRODUCTS, WHICH MADE MY SKIN PEEL. IM GONNA GO BAK AND STICK WITH PROACTIV</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible. I tried the product and used it faithfully for 6 months hoping something would work.  Instead of making my acne better, it made it considerably worse. I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since i was 12, i&#x27;m 28 now and i believed the sales pitch seen in the infomercials. what a fool i was.  to make it worse, i ordered from proactiv themselves.      when i cancelled their service, it was june of 09.  in august i was sent a new shipment and promptly sent it back unopened.  since then (and it&#x27;s august 11) i have been harassed by foriegn collector agencies who will call me day and night just for a sum of $44.  i even had my bank block any transactions they tried to pull because they tried to bill me months after i spoke to customer care.    don&#x27;t buy this product, use acne free severe</li>
    <li> Proactive solution doesn&#x27;t work I try and it dry my skin. Now I need to put lotion to balance the dry skin that makes me more acne!!! You can just used peroxide - same effect. Just watch from the sun.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever using proactiv and so far i have bee pretty impressed with it. It really was working i only had one pimple left on my face!! Then I started my period and i broke out. Not as bad as usual but still. its starting to clear up again and its been one of the only prducts tat have worked. I have used so many!! But the cleanser you can really tell it is cleaning your face and the tner feels so soothing and after the the cleanser goes on very smoothly and its never stung my face and i usually have sensitive dry skin. My face is glowing more than evre and i owe it all to proactiv</li>
    <li> Proactiv system is a scam!  They charge you 60 dollars total for a 90 day supply of 20 dollars per kit that you receive in the mail.  But, when I looked on my bank statement, I had received charges once a month that were more than 20 dollars per kit!  I basically payed a total of 90 dollars for something that wasn&#x27;t even worth that much!  Be careful!  Proactiv is a scam!</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ve been using proactive on and off for about 10 years now. Its so hard going back and forth to different products. I find that it works but you have to use it EVERYDAY. And when you do, it really dries out your skin. I started to use it every morning, doesnt try out as much but doesnt get rid of your pimples. It makes my skin so dull. Its such a struggle day to day. I also spot treat with Clearasil. And that really dries out the spot. I eat right, exercise and I STILL get breakouts. You really cant win...</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactive from their website. It not worked for me and i had allergy on my face. I called them to cancel but they still charge to my debit card for next month. At last i must replace a new card. Terrible product!</li>
    <li> My son has had so-so success with the product. The biggest problem is the proactive website &amp; customer service. Shortly after ordering on their website I saw some of the feedback here. I immediately called to cancel the order. I was assured that all I had to do was to return them once they arrived. I did as I was instructed by customer service with one of the boxes(I had ordered 2 sets-orders) I now have 8 charges for a total of $217.58 on my credit card and NO CREDIT for the boxes I returned. Also I&#x27;ve got 2 shipments(4 boxes) and there are 4 additional charges(4 more boxes) that I have never even recieved!  I also noted that one of the months I was charged $39 rather than the $29 like all the other months for no apparent reason.  I&#x27;m in process of disputing the charges now with my credit card co, calling the better business bureau and posting here so others don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. I wish I could leave this feedback on their(proActive) website!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working well for my teenage son. I wanted to try it without having to commit to an automatic monthly charge from their website. This was perfect.</li>
    <li> The product itself: mediocre. It works but just the same as a simple, average priced acne cleanser you can get at Walgreens. Not worth the money.  They have, by far, the WORST customer service I&#x27;ve EVER experienced.  First and foremost, I canceled my account last April. Called, got a confirmation number. Suddenly in October, I was charged for a whole new, full blown set. Obviously irritated as it set my bank account into the negative and got me an over draft fee. I called, canceled my account AGAIN, and requested that I receive a prepaid postage to send it back. Three weeks later, I finally got it. Sent the product back. Check my bank account. I have been charged yet again, after canceling my account a SECOND time.    At this point beyond irritated and feeling scammed, I call and cancel my account for the THIRD time. I also provided my delivery confirmation number, and was told I would receive my refund within 5-7 business days. (I was also told that because of my trouble, they sped up the process and it normally takes 2 weeks to process refunds.) Ok. Swell.    A week goes by. No refund. I call again. Was told that perhaps because of the federal holiday, shipping might have been delayed but that my refund had been processed. Ok. I waited 3 more days. Nothing.    I called again today. The woman I spoke to was rude and told me that the information I had was incorrect and that, basically, the previous employees had lied to me. I was told by this employee that I would have to wait 4-6 weeks for them to process my refund, and then another 7-10 days for it to be applied to my account. I firmly told her that this was unacceptable, and had now twice caused an overdraft fee on my account, and that if I did not receive my refund by the end of the day, I was contacting the BBB. (Better Business Bureau) In theory, what they did was actually a form of theft, and contacting the BBB is the least of their issues.    After she argued with me for awhile, I asked to speak to a supervisor and that I would not accept anything else. After waiting for a few minutes, the representative came on the line and asked for my delivery confirmation number. I provided it, and was told they would immediately process the refund and I should get it within 7-10 days.    This has been the worst experience with a business I have ever had. (I&#x27;m also a very calm, rational, and patient person. This drove me to the edge.) If I do not receive my refund within the allotted time, I will be taking legal action and contacting the BBB.</li>
    <li> The item came to me, brand new and still in it&#x27;s plastic case. The product it self did not work for me but I was impressed with how fast it got here and the great shape it was in when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I rarely review a product, but I felt  I had to comment on this particular one.  I am in my 30&#x27;s and have always suffered from moderate to severe acne breakouts. As I got older it did improve somewhat but as a teacher I hated having worse skin than most of my students.  Despite readimg negative reviews, I figured this product is still going strong after 10 years so why not at least try it.  And I&#x27;m glad I did.  My skin cleared up within 10 days and improvement was noticable on day 1.  I get the occasional blemish still, but it clears up within days with the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I believe a lot of the negativity surrounding it comes from not reading the fine print.  It even states in the commercials you are being signed up for an automated shipping program when you order. As for sensitive skin-I have it and have no problems with this product.  However, there are a lot of skin allergies to the main ingrediant and this can effect people pretty severly...and that is why Proactiv tells the user in the directions to do a simple skin test before using!  Also - the cleanser is a scrub.  It is not ment to be used abrasively - as I believe many people do.  A very light hand with a small amount of product will do.  Your face should feel refreashed, not scrubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There also has been a lot of controversy surrounding their customer service.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  My product lasts longer than 3 months at a time (about 4 months) so I can change my shipping online.  Each time I have done this I&#x27;ve recieved an email confirmation and everything has worked out fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course everone has to make up their own mind concerning anything, but if you are considering the product, I say at least give it a try. If you are nervous about going through proactiv.com - then order on amazon.com.  Also - read the directions!</li>
    <li> My wife used this product and made her acne WORSE! She is so upset that could not even write a review, Amazon would block (cause the cursing) it hehehe.</li>
    <li> I ordered the first shipment and set recurring shipments to a 12 week interval. Within 2 weeks of receiving the first shipment, I received and was charged an exorbitant amount in addition to the first payment I made of $29.99. I called them to cancel all further orders and the automatic message told me I still had balance to pay, even though I had only received two shipments and had already paid for both, plus paid for a third shipment I hadn&#x27;t even received yet. I cancelled the call (Since the automatic messages keep going around in looks and make it impossible for you to connect to an operator). I called back and selected the option for an operator. After waiting for over 20 minutes, an operator picked up and the first thing she said was \\&quot;I see you are trying to cancel your order\\&quot; which means my number was probably flagged after the previous call. She told me that to cancel, I would have to be put in touch with another department and asked me to hold. Even though I stayed on line for another 45 minutes, no one picked up. So I cancelled the call and called again, but ever since then it puts me on hold and refuses to connect me to an operator. I am going to try and fix this with BOA. If not, I am filing a complaint with the better business bureau. I suggest you be very careful before giving your credit card details to them. Proactiv only uses benzoyl peroxide treatment and there and a number of products out that that do the same without cheating you out of hundreds of dollars.</li>
    <li> One star because I HATE IT.  I hate the customer service, i hate the product, and i hate how you give them notice in January that you want to cancel the product, and they still charge you and and send you the damn product, and no matter how you call them, contact them through thier web chat, they are STUPID.  I WANT MY DAMN SHIPMENTS CANCELED!!!! I had to pull my money out of my account, open a new one, and they will not let me close my account unless i pay off the proactive. Proactive will not refund me, there fore i refuse to pay them, therefore i accrued NSF charges fom stupid WELLS FARGO, who will not stop payments one STUPID PROACTIVE.  I AM ONE PISSED OFF CUSTOMER. BOTH FROM PROACTIVE AND WELLS FARGO. Someone tell me what to do.  Proactive keeps telling me this time i have it in writing that they canceled my products.  I dont want to have to wait another month to see if it will deduct from my stupid account.  YOU ARE BETTER OFF USING MURAD!!! Go to SEPHORA!!! I am currently using Philosophy products for my face, and i love it.  STAY AWAY FROM PROACTIVE.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it said it would do..My face stays clean. All I need is the spot remover! Great product</li>
    <li> The Proactiv 3 step products appear to work and work fairly well.  Do not expect the overnight results as implied on the TV commercials but within a few weeks time results are noticeable.  The only real issue with the product itself is that it does dry out and sensitize the skin.  I find that using a regular moisturizer on occasion in addition to the Proactiv products help.  I also noticed a stronger reaction to the sun - so when going outside a regular moisturizer with SPF is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I strongly recommend that anyone thinking of using this product find a manned kiosk, vending machine or Amazon to buy this product rather than going to Proactiv&#x27;s website or trying to make an order over the phone with one of their customer representatives.  Proactiv&#x27;s own customer service is severely sub par.  First, they are unable to guarantee next day shipping and do not seem inclined to refund (easily) payments for next day shipping when clearly they are unable to follow through with an order in that time frame.  Second, they make it near impossible to reach a live person to assist you with any questions with regard to your order or their product.  Lastly, canceling an order/account does not seem to be able to be done within one overly long follow through.  Multiple follow up calls appear to be a necessity.  Overall, while the Proactiv product is useful their overall incompetence when it comes to customer service and easy access no doubt causes numerous customer losses.</li>
    <li> I originally got this product for my teenage daughters but I have used it as well and it is Wonderful! One of my daughters has severe acne and nothing she did was working to get rid of it. I decided to try Proactiv and it got rid of her stubborn acne almost overnight. I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about it for a long time, but as a last resort I bought it and I am so happy I did. It works on everyone I tried it on! I occasionally get some acne on my cheeks and when I use Proactiv by the next day it is almost all gone, in 2 days it totally disappeared! I would recommend trying it if you haven&#x27;t. It works great and I give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old woman, and I have had acne since I was 16. When I was about 17 I started to use proactiv, and my skin looked great. Then, when I was about 20, I stopped using it. I don&#x27;t know why, maybe because it was inconvenient to order, and expensive after a while. But my skin became horrible. I tried everything at the drugstore, but nothing worked. So, when I was about 21 I returned to proactiv and again my skin was pretty good (but not perfect). Really, my skin looked fine, nice in photos, and with a little makeup I could cover anything up. Last summer one of my friends recommended Murad, and said it was better. So I decided to try it out, but it was really bad for me. Then I went back to proactiv (but I was just using the cleanser, not the other parts). This spring I went to a salon and was advised to use some other products, so I switched. Big mistake. Now I am out of the US, so I have started to use clinique (have been at it about 3.5 weeks, with some improvement but not much), so as soon as I can I am going to go back to proactiv. It is not perfect, and you really need to use all 3 parts (not just the cleanser), but for me it has been the most effective (and I really have tried almost everything).</li>
    <li> ProActive came up with some new formula..micro something....I don&#x27;t like it, DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  It dries the face, but does NOTHING for acne.  I am so disappointed.  I used ProActive before and it worked, but whatever they did to the product, they messed up.  They should reverse this formula to old one.</li>
    <li> I have had cystic-type acne along my jaw for several years.  This product did not help this problem, in fact, it made it much worse.  I switched to Clinique&#x27;s acne line and am much happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Recommended.  This was a Christmas gift. Great price.  No hassles with having to sign up for monthly shipments (autoship) like you have to when you order direct from Proactive website!! Will definitely order from seller again.</li>
    <li> As soon as I hit my teenage years, it became instantly clear to me that I was the unfortunate recipient of acne-causing genes passed down by my father. In order to rectify the problem, my mother ordered the three-piece Proactiv set to help me. The product itself worked, but the cost and effort to use it was not nearly worth the trouble. While it did allow my acne to subside, it was just too much work to use three bottles every night. What&#x27;s more, if one bottle ran out before the others, the remaining bottles would be rendered useless. How does one fix that problem? Why, by ordering another overly priced three-piece set, of course. To put it simply, the product works but it is horribly inefficient. I urge potential customers to consider alternative one step solutions, if possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for about 8 years, but on and off.  When the stuff first became popular, I was still in high school and my mother had to charge it to her card for me.  What a pain!  Back then they would ship it every month whether you needed it or not.  I ended up having so much backed up that I eventually had my mom cancel the whole membership.  It lasted me through college!  After everything fianlly ran out, or expired, I used regular drug store cleansers, but they&#x27;d bleach my clothes or towels and often dry out my face or just stop working all together.  I had never had that problem with Proactiv so I decided to start ordering it again about two years ago.  I got stuck with the same problem with the vitamins (Vitaclear).  They seemed like a good idea and thought that I&#x27;d just keep taking them, but they made me so nauseous and didn&#x27;t help my face, or anything, at all.  It took a month of searching the internet to finally get the number to call to cancel.  THEN after I cancelled, they told me they were STILL going to charge me for one more shipment and send it anyway.  I was so frustrated I just told them OK.  Oh, and now all of a sudden, Proactiv bleaches certain clothes and has bleached all my towels.  Even when used in the shower.  A good number of my fiance&#x27;s shirts are ruined from sleeping on his shoulder at night.  I had to tell him to sleep with a shirt off so I didn&#x27;t bleach any of his shirts because we never knew if it would mess it up or not.  I&#x27;ve always loved Proactiv and it really does work if used consistently and correctly, but I think at this point it is more of a hassle.  Even though I have it set up to ship every 12 weeks, it always ships and charges me so randomly.  I hate to cancel because it really did work for me in high school, but I think I might be switching to the Neutrogena kit.  I think that now there are so many other products out there that can do the same, if not better, than Proactiv and that are much cheaper and less of a hassle.</li>
    <li> I had breakouts on one side of my chin so I decided to buy Proactive since they are always advertising and promising to clear up breakouts.  I tried it for 3 weeks and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  After the first 3 weeks I called the customer service number and they told me to just keep using it- so I did. It&#x27;s been almost two months now and I have more pimples now then I ever had in my life. I even got them on my neck which has never ever happened to me before. Also, my skin is insanely dried out. I just called to cancel it and the customer service rep tried selling me a stronger version- NO THANK YOU. I would absolutely NOT recommend Proactive!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this from a third party vendor on Amazon because I hated dealing with the manufacturer.  Now it appears you can only buy it direct even on Amazon.  Way to corner the market Proactiv!  I&#x27;m finally fed up enough I&#x27;m going to try the target brand.</li>
    <li> I started using proactiv when I was around 22. I had never had acne problems as a teen, but all of a sudden around 21, I would get these large painful cystic blemishes maybe once or twice a month on my chin. They tore down my self esteem whenever I had one. I would be afraid to leave the house and try and schedule my life around the stupid things. These were not little baby white heads, They would take a week or more to come to a head and hurt like you would not believe during that process. Then, they&#x27;d take forever to heal. I&#x27;m fair with freckles, so a honkin&#x27; red mountain the size of a nickel or dime was not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered proactiv and have never gone back. Though there has been a time when I tried using only the face wash/scrubby stuff, it doesn&#x27;t work by itself and I started to break out again. The key really is using the three steps together. Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not so tedious to have to go through all three steps. I&#x27;m 28 now. I rarely breakout and they&#x27;re SO much smaller now and really can be attributed to &#x27;that time&#x27; of the month. Everyone gets a blemish now and then, but no one should have to live with them every day. We&#x27;re a household of proactiv users, as my boyfriend uses it daily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to go and try it for a couple months(thru the proactiv website). I know it&#x27;s NOT super cheap, but now knowing how it works, I would pay double in a heart beat. And honestly, it takes me probably about 6 months to go thru one kit, so it the end it&#x27;s not bad at all. Also, some simple tips: Make sure your pillowcase is clean, never go to sleep with makeup on, don&#x27;t touch your face unnecessarily and don&#x27;t lean your face on a phone/cell phone. Those few things actually helped a lot as well!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Allow a few days to a week or two before best results are seen.</li>
    <li> I used the Proactive kit only once in High School, when I had a moderate acne phase and all I can remember is that it cleared my skin so rapidly and it was the only thing that worked after trying a slew of acne products both prescription and over the counter.  So, whenever I hear a story of someone suffering from acne, I would always swear by Proactive!   Here I am 8 years later at 26, and all of a sudden, BAM!  I just broke out so bad. I don&#x27;t know if it was stress or what? But there it was, just like I was in high school. I am by no means vain, but it really is a blow to your self esteem to have acne at ANY AGE and have to face anybody.  I am super low maintenance and not a fan of a lot of makeup, so having to pile on makeup to cover my breakouts just felt worse.  It seemed that once an area would break out and start healing (which took about a week and a half) I would break out in another area and this cycle just keeps happening.   I was on Murad acne system( Absolute Crap....don&#x27;t buy this at sephora!)  , and just desperate for something to clear my skin up. I wanted to go back to my simple makeup routine of a little bronzer, blush and mascara, so I recalled my old experience and advice to other fellow peers that suffer this problem.       I read a lot of reviews of having problems with ordering online and having problems canceling, so I just went to the mall and bought it at a KIOSK.  Took this home, it&#x27;s been 4 days....my skin is already clearing up, with no new pimples forming (the problem that i had). This stuff is just as amazing for me as it was back in high school!!!   I must warn those with sensitive skin...this is not for you!  I have very oily skin naturally and its not that sensitive, so this has dried it out to the point where it&#x27;s what Normal skin would be like  (I&#x27;ve never experienced normal skin...only very oily skin)  So, this WILL DRY YOUR SKIN....but it dries the acne out, so it heals up and goes away faster!    There is something out there foreveryone, and this is definitely my solution.  Try it, what do you have to lose, there&#x27;s a money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> It works, but it DESTROYED my cutis, i started peeling, my face started to get all red...Its just a good product for people with tough skin, but DO NOT BUY IF YOUR SKIN IS SENSITIVE...It will destroy it after 1-3 day of using it</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this product, results are slower than they said on tv but it does work.</li>
    <li> This product worked great at first.  My skin looked really good at first.  I bought a 2nd batch of the product.  Then my skin started drying out.  I thought it would go away, since before my skin would break out then get dry, then break out then get dry.  I continued to use it and my skin kept getting dryer and dryer.  I had to quit using it.  I like the mask that came with it though.  It doesn&#x27;t work as a spot pimple treatment like on the commercials, but it does have a nice cooling effect.</li>
    <li> The product just didn&#x27;t work at all. I saw no difference in the condition of my acne. I have rather mild acne and thought this product would help. It did not. While this next remark has nothing to do with my review as this is a review of the product and not the company itself, I would like to reemphasize what others have said: Do not order from Proactive&#x27;s website. They automatically sign you up to receive a shipment every month. Canceling my membership was a customer service nightmare. I had to cancel multiple times as they continued to send the product and bill me after I canceled. Calling them on the phone meant wait times of 15-45 minutes to speak to someone.</li>
    <li> i just bought it.. i didn&#x27;t have too much acne.. when i started to use it i started to get more acne.. but this is not the point.. i bought online and now they are charging me more money.. i hate the customer services that the provide.. im really disappointed with everything..starting with the service.. not good i dont recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My son can&#x27;t do without this line of products.We are very glad to have it available and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Before I started using ProActive I was really embarrassed about my skin problems. I&#x27;m 26, and it wasn&#x27;t just acne. I have very sensitive skin, that tends to be on the dry side. So dry before, I would apply a face lotion several times in the morning before putting on any make-up. NOW I can even leave the house without make-up! I didn&#x27;t have problem skin until a few years ago, and now thanks to ProActive I don&#x27;t anymore either! Jeez, I know I sound like an infomercial, but I am so grateful my hubby talked me into trying it.   I have found that the face wash can be drying and harsh. So I only use it at night when I need to take my make-up off. In the morning I just splash some cold water on my face, followed by the toner and then the lotion. My face feels great now, and is perfectly clear!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month now and my blemishes have not cleared up too much at all. I still have a few small breakouts every now and then, but I&#x27;m seeing the same results that I saw when I was using Clearasil Acne Scrub. I might as well use the same stuff that I was using from Wall Mart than spending $50 on over priced acne products. Thanks for nothing Proactiv!</li>
    <li> they made my subscription continuous, made me go overdraft, my bank charged me $35, they made me pay $115, total of $150. tooooootal rip-off+thieves. i do not recommend, even if they work for some of you...i think honesty is more important than anything else..</li>
    <li> I had only mild acne, but products from the drugstore did not help.  I decided to give Proactive a try and after the first use of the three step system, I woke up with acne worse than I had since I was a teenager.  I used the Refining Mask and that took care of it over night (that is a good product, but can only be used twice a week).  I tried the three step program for a few more days to see if my face would adjust and it didn&#x27;t. I just made me break out really bad.      I cannot continue to use this product, so I plan to cancel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product through the official website. I was getting automatic shipping so it was getting pretty expensive. I payed over 100 dollars for 3 month solution. it doesn&#x27;t sound so bad but if the product does not work it definitely is bad. Proactiv does not work for everyone. it definitely did not work for me. The pimples seem to ALWAYS COME BACK AND I USE IT as described. I would definitely not recommend this product. it is not worth it. I used Benzaclyn for so many years and is still the only product that works for me aside of birth control pills. Birth control really helps my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried lots of over-the-counter products for my daughter&#x27;s acne and nothing worked.  After reading all the good and bad reviews, I finally decided to give Proactiv a try.  In three months, her complexion improved slightly, but the acne never completely went away.  However, the most frustrating aspect was the ordering process.  It was impossible to get only the products I wanted in the time I needed them.  The hassle was definitely not worth it for only a minimally effective product.  I closed my account with Proactiv and went back to the store. This time I bought the Acne Free Severe to Clear System.  In three months, she has not had a single breakout, not one pimple.  If you are searching for a solution for acne, please try the Acne Free Severe to Clear System.  It works much better than Proactiv.  It is cheaper than Proactiv.  And, you can purchase it from most any retailer.[[ASIN:B000KK53L6 AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment System]]</li>
    <li> This product is a rip off.  My daugthers skin got worse and the product was guaranteed to work.  After calling them I never did get my money back.  I bought an over the counter product for about $2.00 that worked great that her doctor suggested.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv on and off for past five or so years. I have been getting my orders straight from Proactiv.com and stopped using it for awhile due to Proactiv having the WORST customer service reps in the world (not an exaggeration)! When Proactiv came out with their \\&quot;new formula,\\&quot; I had to try it and surprisingly, grew a liking to it. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since because I feel like once you go off the Proactiv system, your skin starts to get progressively worse. However, right now, I only use the Proactiv system at night and use my Boscia oily skin care regimen in the morning (I have combination skin--oily T-zone). I only have mild acne so it&#x27;s been working like a charm. The thing I like about Proactiv is that it DOES leave your skin feeling baby soft. However, the lotion (step 3) leaves your skin somewhat oily looking, which is why I only use it when I go to bed.     Also, I am loving that you can now purchase the 3-step kit on Amazon! No need to deal with the brain-dead customer service reps, you can order your kit when you need it versus having it automatically shipped and charged to you, AND it&#x27;s actually cheaper.</li>
    <li> I had heard from my daughter who had started using this product years ago, how  much she liked it.  I finally tried it and agreed wth her.  I subsequently recommended it to my oldest daughter who also now praises it.  We are all adults.</li>
    <li> I never had what I thought was an acne \\&quot;problem\\&quot; certainly not more than 4 at a time yet, it was increasing to ALL THE TIME. At 39? WTH? I had more pimples then I ever did as a teenager. Final straw came in January when I deployed to Iraq. Maybe stress? (ya think) hormones, new water, I don&#x27;t know. Decided I needed Proactiv when I was suddenly breaking out on my cheeks (that&#x27;s new) and as large as mosquito bites. Proactiv is a MIRACLE in bottles. I don&#x27;t use it twice a day, Just once. I am not on auto delivery. I have ordered from QVC, Amazon and bought at the kiosk at the mall. When I get lazy and skip it for a few days, I breakout. So, no laziness with this product and you will see great results. I have just added the night cream since I also needed something moisturizing and anti-aging. SO glad I finally tried this!!</li>
    <li> Like the previous post- this is a great product, but don&#x27;t order from the proactiv.com website.  They automatically enroll you to receive shipments every month, AND CHARGE YOUR CARD OR BILL YOU.  Once you cancel, which takes 48-72 hours for your order to post (they claim they cannot view your order), instead of giving you the promotion price of $29.95, they charge you RETAIL PRICE OF OVER $60.00!  LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE- DON&#x27;T BOTHER WITH PROACTIV.COM!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now, and I am still unsure if it is going to work for me. I love the way my face feels after cleansing it, but its been about a month and I am still having break outs, which they say can happen, but I figured the break outs would be worse when you start and gradually get better over your first month, mine are getting worse. The breakouts do clear up pretty quick and they are painless, so I guess that is a good thing. I am going to use for about three months and then make my decision on whether its worth it. Buying from Amazon is much smarter than buying from Proactiv...Proactiv will clean your pocket every month even if you do not need the products yet, but buy your products from amazon!!!! Overall, I like it so far just waiting for the breakouts to go away :)</li>
    <li> After almost two years of various dermatologist visits, products that tore my skin up, and general disappointment in my acne, I broke down and gave Proactiv a try. I&#x27;ve been on it for exactly a month. The first week, nothing at all happened. Second and third weeks was when I started to see results. It cleared away all of the red bumps and zits, but did nothing for the flat red spots they left behind. Then, in the fourth week, it kind of plateaued off and once again showed no results. All of the zits are gone, but I&#x27;m left with these huge red spots where they used to be. It works, but not the way I wanted it to. Once I stop using it I&#x27;m going to have to find some kind of product to even out my skin tone. Also, it dried my skin out beyond belief. I used what is probably considered way too much of the moisturizer when I started noticing this problem, but it&#x27;s been exactly the same for all four weeks. All in all, it&#x27;s a decent product. It left my skin dry and red after removing the acne, but for the most part it did remove the acne. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, though. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle for so little results.    One other pro, though: The kit says it&#x27;s a two-month batch, but I&#x27;m only about a fourth of the way through after one month and I use exactly how much the directions say to. I&#x27;m expecting it to last much longer than two months, so at least I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works!  If you use this product like is says to use it....your skin will markedly improve. I have always had decent skin...but...after I had my children in my mid twenties.....my skin went waywire...I stayed broken out all the time.  Since I have been using Proactive, I can count on 1 hand the number of pimples I have had. My breakouts are totally under control.  Plus, it feels so good when I wash my face, it feels so clean and smooth and light...I LOVE PROACTIVE!  P.S. The Proactive sunscreen is a really great product too...I use it on my face because other sunscreens will clog my pores and cause a pimple....but....no problems with the Proactive brand. However, it does burn a little when u first put it on...and DO NOT get it in your eyes!!!  OOOUUUCH!</li>
    <li> This product was an expensive debacle for our family. It was not effective on our daughter&#x27;s skin and made her complexion red, even used as instructed. It bleaches any towel or fabric it comes in contact with and caused a disaster in the laundry...this is warned about in fine print. Getting help from their customer service department is very difficult; the whole experience of this product caused tears and headaches.</li>
    <li> It looks like the product is working, my problem area was my forehead and at one point it got worse but now it seems that it&#x27;s clearing out. I am on day 10 or 11 of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne and blackheads ever since I was 13. I am 24 now and I was hopeful that this product would finally be something that would work for me. I&#x27;ve tried every acne medication you can think of and none of them worked for me. However, it was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. I hated that . Trust me it isn&#x27;t worth it especially for the amount they give you. I just hope I can find the right product someday.</li>
    <li> This product actually causes me to break out in huge painful bumps. I&#x27;d rather have acne...</li>
    <li> The 3 step system kit is an overly marketed poor solution to acne problems.     The cleanser is too harsh. If you have acne and its the least bit discomforting, you should not be using a scrub on your face. Gentle is the key. The salicylic acid will work fine for exfoliating, but the added grit will exacerbate your pimples causing them to open up and get infected. Also it will get your oil glands active. This is an OK cleanser to keep your skin clear AFTER you&#x27;ve treated all breakouts. Take a look at Shea Terra&#x27;s black soap. The rose hips and red bush is fragrance free if you have very sensitive skin. The mint version smells and feels great. Cetaphil also makes a very gentle cleanser.    The toner is probably fine to return the PH back to your skin, but your face would do that anyway in about an hour. Toner is a very optional step, and you&#x27;re better off with an apple cider vinegar/honey concoction. This will alleviate red marks.    The Benzoyl Peroxide is just a drying agent that will leave red marks on your face. Look for a sulfur on-the-spot treatment. I like \\&quot;Mario Badescu: Drying Lotion\\&quot;.     Don&#x27;t fall for all the marketing nonsense. Proactiv has to pay a lot of money to get Jessica Simpson and Puff Daddy to endorse for them. That money obviously comes from selling you an overpriced product.</li>
    <li> I love Proactive.  At the young age of 63 I began to have acne.  My daughter suggested I try Proactive and it works!  During the first few weeks using this product my skin was a bit sensitive ( slight burning) but I keep using the product morning and night.  I now have NO acne, my pores a greatly reduced and my skin is glowing.  Thank you Proactive!</li>
    <li> After discovering this fact, I tried to return the kit.  However, apparently the way I used the product violated the warrantee.....</li>
    <li> I have tried about 100 different products (including this one..three separate times thinking it would magically work eventually) to treat my acne...as well as going to 3 different dermatologists and nothing worked. I FINALLY found a product that has worked for me and I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it. My sister has started using it as well and her acne cleared up in less than a week. It was crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t waste you money on anything else before you try what I&#x27;ve been using...plus it&#x27;s way cheaper!    Just copy the link below into your browser and check out their website.  (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put a link in here?!?)    [...]</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactiv for the first time a few months ago and it really cleaned my skin up. I would say I had mild acne, and this product did really well. I use it exactly how they say, morning and night and I also have dry skin so I have the oil free moisturizer. The refining mask is also great, I use it aobabout 2-3 times a week. The only complaint, is that in the beggining it used to really leave my skin super dry. Now, it still does it but not half as much. Nevertheless, I would recommend the product for sure!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what my daughter wanted and in the amount she wanted.  I will definitely reorder this product when necessary.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone, dry skin, and proactive will work for awhile but it dries my skin out even more.  Ok so for awhile I didn&#x27;t break out but it did nothing for red splotches and the moisturizer is a joke!  What good is skin that is not broke out if it looks dry and brittle from a harsh cleanser like this.  They do a great job with the advertising but the product is not that great if you ask me and it&#x27;s pretty expensive!  Try Albolene first.  All you need is 1 container nothing extra to buy, it cleans and moisturizes and it&#x27;s about $12 for a huge container.  You can get Albolene on Amazon or at your local drug store.  1 jar of Albolene will likely last 3 to 6 months(That&#x27;s $2-$4 a month). Try Albolene first, before spending a small fortune on Proactive every month!  Like I said Proactive works for awhile but it leaves me skin really dry and brittle and then I get an immunity to it, and it no longer works.  So why put your skin through that??? not to mention your pocket book.</li>
    <li> Worked for me, I don&#x27;t have bad acne though just a few blemishes here and there. They went away, and my skin looks better. I don&#x27;t like the smell much. I only used once a day too.</li>
    <li> Proactiv. Oh, boy. I used Proactiv for about a year. From what I saw, it only really damaged my skin because it&#x27;s so harsh for my skin type. The first step is what really bugged me. It&#x27;s abrasive and rough and doesn&#x27;t feel nice at all. Steps two and three are ok, but they aren&#x27;t the best products out there.   PROS:  -It does clean your skin, if a bit harshly  -It did keep my skin from having as many breakouts, but I still had acne  -The toner (step two) makes your skin sting, but in a mild good way so you know it&#x27;s cleaning  CONS:  -It will bleach your clothes if you aren&#x27;t careful  -It made my skin red and itchy sometimes  -My skin did dry out a bit while using it  -The first few weeks you will have a breakout and your skin will be a bit red (any acne product will do this, so you have to get over it)  In the end, I found Skin iD works better for me personally. It&#x27;s much gentler, personalized and really makes my face feel clean. I am not sponsored or paid by either Proactiv or Skin iD in any way, and while I admit not even Skin iD is perfect, I still find it works better for me. But my overall point is, Proactiv can be a tad to harsh and medicated for it to work on your skin, so I would advise you look somewhere else. Don&#x27;t just take my word for Skin iD, though, find the best treatment for YOUR skin. Good luck, and I hope you can find the perfect system to rid you of blemishes!</li>
    <li> I had a very bad experience with Proactive customer service so there is some bias.&lt;br /&gt;I got the free sample from the website. The product worked like magic when I used it. I thought this was THE medication that will fix my acne that I&#x27;ve tried over many years using many types of cleansers and scrubs to get rid of, which is probably the case with many others here.&lt;br /&gt;The major problem is that its effects does not last. In fact, once I stopped using it, or even skipped a day or two, it got considerably worse than before I even started using it.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that the product is so strong that it makes my skin dependent on the product (a good business technique because customers will purchase the actual product after the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to speak about the customer service. By ordering the free trial, you automatically are ordering another 3 months supply afterwards. Not ignorant to this, I called to cancel and closed the account I had set up, in order to make sure I am not being charged for any more shipments. I received a shipment anyways and charged full price for this product and three other &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; products that came with this &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; kit. I called and they said that because I had reopened my account to write a review on the website, they proceeded to ship the products that I had specifically called to cancel that month.&lt;br /&gt;Especially because I was a kid, they had no problem being rude and unapologetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it was a miracle while it lasted, until my acne grew tolerant.</li>
    <li> I have been using the proactiv solution for one week now ordered through amazon because of the previous reviews of the customer service using the proactive sight. The product came on time and i was very excited to use it.  being a mother of 3 at only 27 years old i figured i shouldn&#x27;t be getting breakouts like a teenager.  I heard this was an amazing. After the first day my skin was really itchy. I only used the 3 step program, with a normal Clearasil moisturizer. Maybe my fault for not ordering the green tea moisturizer but my skin just got worse, the itch turned into little clear bumps then they dried out. Today is my 7th day and i am officially quitting the product. my skin is dry and flaking every time i put water, moisturizer, anything my face burns. I know this product has wonderful effects for others its just not for me. I am writing this review to warn anyone looking for a way to treat acne without seeing a dermatologist first. BAD MOVE. First see what skin type you have and what kind of acne you should be treating, then decide on a product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the product I ordered directly from proactive. Weird. Seems like it&#x27;s not the real stuff</li>
    <li> I had mild acne all over my face, predominately on my cheeks. I had tried one prescription and it failed so I decided to try Proactiv. I had very high expectations, mostly because of all the exposure and one of my cousins had suggested it to me. I was disappointed to find that it had no positive effects whatsoever, all it really did was dry my skin. Now I understand that to make the acne disappear, drying of the skin will occur, however in my case there were no positive benefits. I went to a dermatologist and they prescribed me Benzaclin and my acne is finally gone. If you&#x27;re seriously considering Proactiv, order one and if you don&#x27;t see any results within a month, don&#x27;t try again and contact a dermatologist. I give it two stars instead of one because the benzoyl peroxide can be used to clean your face and is recommended by dermatologists. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I received my package of Proactiv solution in a timely manner, and in a well-packaged box. This is the second time that this same product, bought from Amazon, has been just how I expected. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m filing a complaint with the BBB for the proactiv company.  I&#x27;ve never had as bad a customer service experience with the proactiv company.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that their product actually works for me - because I hate to be giving money to a company as bad as they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy through amazon from here on out.  Same price, easier to work with, no monthly bill, and I get it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this seller - while they clearly say its the only the 3-piece system, they should limit their pictures to the 3-piece system.  My fault for not looking more closely, but c&#x27;mon - why use pictures of a 4-piece system and a gift set if that&#x27;s clearly not what you&#x27;re sending, and images of the 3-step system are readily available.  I&#x27;ll order from a different amazon seller (if the price is the same) next time, just on principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, though, is great.</li>
    <li> This system will improve your acne if you can tolerate it and you use it consistently and diligently. If you have very sensitive skin, forget it. This will make eczema/dermatitis/rosacea go insane. I know from experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I find that I really like the Renewing Cleanser, so while I don&#x27;t buy the whole system anymore, I do ebay or amazon up the cleanser (beware some buyers that will rip you off, even on amazon, believe it or not, sure, but most are fine.) I&#x27;ve been using Acne Free&#x27;s REDNESS RELIEF, which has worked better for me (due to my eczema/dermatitis) than ProActiv. Much gentler. But I do use the ProActiv cleanser more often than the AcneFree RR one, because the quality of the scrubbing grains is unbeatable. Much gentler --smoother, less rough--and smaller than in other systems. Less irritating if used with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have hardy skin and don&#x27;t mind paying more for somewhat (though not ragingly) better quality than you get with some other drugstore systems (which all have about the same active ingredients, ie, exfoliating acids, scrubs, benzoyle peroxide and/or salicylic acid) try this. It can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only you know what your skin can tolerate. Mine can&#x27;t tolerate most of this system, but thumbs up on the scrubby cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want to pay significantly less for a system that can be quite effective (I have quite improved acne and sometimes get comments that I&#x27;m glowing, hah!) try Acne Free (whichever system is for your skin type). You can find it here on amazon and in CVS and Walgreens type stores, etc.</li>
    <li> So... I bought this because I was having some breakouts related to working out/drinking too much protein powder. Proactiv worked for me as a teen, so I figured I would keep some around till the breakouts got under control. Worked fine. I still haven&#x27;t finished my 2 months supply, which I bought ~ a year ago. I assume it&#x27;s probably going stale/bad, but whatever.  You should probably read someone else&#x27;s review about the benefits/drawbacks of proactiv if you are a first time buyer. There are quite a few, I assume.  1)bleaches skin  2)will not be able to get rid of massive acne problems    corollary) will not change your lifestyle that may be creating your massive acne problems  3)is now more expensive because people have discovered that it usually works  Oh yeah, if you do want to buy this, get it from Amazon, or some other 3rd party vendor. Proactive always tries to sell you like a year&#x27;s supply for a \\&quot;discount\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Horrible customer service. They are pretty sneaky with their monthy fees and how they bill. I will never order from the site again just on amazon. I have been waiting for a refund for over 4 months now. Like others have said never give them your credit card info. Beware of all the small writting.</li>
    <li> The reason there are so many mixed reviews about whether Proactive works or not is because the original formula worked, but the new formula doesn&#x27;t. And, as if that is not frustrating enough, their customer service sucks. They&#x27;ve always had poor customer service, but I use to put up with it because the product worked really well. Since the product doesn&#x27;t work anymore they should shut down the operation, but they know people will believe the new formula works because the old one did so well. But not you, because you&#x27;ve been warned! I even heard from several people that the new formula causes huge puss filled zits to pop up on your face with continued use. When I brought this up to their customer service they told me \\&quot;that happens because it&#x27;s bringing all the impurities up and out.\\&quot; They&#x27;ll say anything to get all the money they can until all the reviews say the same thing and they have no leg to stand on.</li>
    <li> I always had clear skin and smooth skin, but I had a lot of stress from being a dancer and high school when I was in the 11th grade. So my parents got me proactiv when I started getting pimples on my forehead and it all went away. I had that smooth skin again. I stopped for a little while and my acne came back and after a few months of not using the product I got acne worse than ever. So I went back to the product and this time it didn&#x27;t go away and it got worse! I had to go to the dermatologist after the last time I used it because I had acne so bad all over my face and places I had never had acne like my cheeks, I didn&#x27;t want to go outside what-so-ever. So I recommend you go to a doctor instead of using proactiv, it will cost much less and save you a lot of time. PS. I don&#x27;t have health insurance and it cost me less than proactiv ever did.</li>
    <li> Scam, you place one order and they keep sending and chager to you credit card. Took 6 months to get stopped.</li>
    <li> When I turned 30 and saw acne on my forehead and chin it was the last straw for me.  I ordered Proactiv from the company and in combination with my birth control regiment (ie, hormone control), Proactiv is extremely effective for me.  When I was younger I used more harsh medications and would cry as my skin would peel off and turn so dry and flaky.  Proactiv has never had this type of effect on me and I consider myself to have very sensitive skin.  Because I have sensitive skin, my skin does have a bit of redness, but once I put on foundation (I use this mainly as sunprotection), it appears more &#x27;pink&#x27; and radiant.  Proactiv makes my skin very smooth and even toned and I NEVER have a breakout while using Proactiv along with my hormone control--but if I take a break from the product I can predictably expect a breakout in a week.  I do recommend using a moisurizer along with the product.  Also, I only use the cleanser once a day (in the morning).  At night I use Aveeno clear complexion foaming cleanser (which does not container any scrubbing particles and is quite gentle) along with the other two components of the Proactiv kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am 33 I still love the product, but I hated dealing with the company.  For some reason, when you order the product it takes &gt;2weeks for the product to arrive doing the standard $4.99 shipping option.  Also, sometimes they would charge me $39.99 for the product and other times $49.99.  On Amazon, not only can you always find a $39.99 option or less for the same product, but with Prime I get FREE shipping and it arrives on my doorstep a couple days after I order it.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I used Proactive and it helped my acne a little ,but not much. And what really upset me was it stains clothes! Proactive ruined many of my shirts, towels, and washcloths. It looked like my clothes were bleached.I was very upset</li>
    <li> Purchased Proactiv at two different occasions.  My skin for the most part is clear but I wanted it to be fully clean.    1st time, it dry my skin a lot but I tried to keep faithfull till I finish the bottles.  Well, besides drying my skin, it gave me more acnee.     2nd time and a year later, I tried it again.  Same exact results.  I completely gave up and would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Proactiv works so good, it has changed my life. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed of my skin when I go out. Within a week I saw major results. My only regret with Proactiv is that I didn&#x27;t buy it years ago. The one draw back I have is that my skin dries out if I use twice a day because I have fair skin. To fix that I just use it in the mornings. If anyone has acne problems Proactiv will change your life.</li>
    <li> I had the worst experience with Proactive overall.     Bought the product and it turned my few blemishes a month to specks all over my face. I still have scars 3 months later. Horrific.     On top of that, upon cancelling my account, I am still being billed. Their customer service is awful. I&#x27;ve called several times, and have been yelled at and spoken to very rudely by the representatives. American Express is now handling this issue for me. (Can I get an Amen for Amex?)     I would definitely NOT recommend Proactive to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item not for acne, but because I have large pores and thought a product that&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin would help. It didn&#x27;t. The people in customer service don&#x27;t know anymore than what they can read out of the little catalog they send you. I sent my unopened second shipment back 2 MONTHS AGO and they claim they still haven&#x27;t received it. THEY DID TAKE MY $60 though. Don&#x27;t let the $29.95 price full you, it&#x27;s a lie. It&#x27;s $29.95 plus 2 payments of $18.30 for a grand total of $66.55 on the second shipment. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS!</li>
    <li> My skin was terrible at the time and was looking for a product that would help my skin out. I saw the commercial of ProActiv and was like hey that might work it is try it now for free and only pay shipping and handling for 30 days...my arse! I recieved a 30 day supply in mail for the $10.00 for shipping and handling and then within two weeks after my first 30 day shipment ProActiv billed me again for $40.00 on my bank account. After the billing took place I recieved another supply worth up to 3 months which I didn&#x27;t even have time to use my 30 day supply yet. Two months went by and I used up my 30 day supply and just started the 3 month supply and go figure I was billed again this time for $40.00 and yet another 3 month supply came to my front door. I called ProActiv and told them to stop sending me so much product! I do not need this much I told them that I had 5 months worth sitting in my bathroom and to hold off until I contact them. After another month went by I decided to cancel ProActiv since I didn&#x27;t really see any improvments in my skin and called the company to send back all the product they have sent me. Had to send all unused/used product back to them which cost me $25+ in shipping costs which isn&#x27;t paid by ProActiv. After a week of sending back product and had conformation that they had the products they were still charging my bank account and wouldn&#x27;t stop charging but this time it was $80.00 everytime. I ended up going to my bank and disput charges and close my bank account down and debit card so they would stop charging. After all of this ProActiv yet again started sending me invoices in the mail and saying I owed full price on the products that I ordered which was $149.00 or they would send me to a collection agency. I called a rep which was very rude and told them to f-off or I would sue them for unauthorized charges and I cancelled my order months ago. This was the last and only bill I have ever recieved from this company and I would just go to your local drug store for a facial acne cure......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid fan of Proactiv for about 11 or 12 years now. I remember initially buying it because I&#x27;d seen the commercials so often (late night infomercials back then), and the testimonials were rather convincing. It wasn&#x27;t my first time buying something off TV, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since I really needed something to combat my depressing acne situation and I&#x27;d had nothing but great experiences with other TV products I&#x27;d invested in (i.e. the Total Gym). Up til then, I&#x27;d tried so many over the counter acne products with little to no results. Years of disappointment. Needless to say, I was prepared to be disappointed yet again, but was hopeful since TV products tended to be very good. Within just 2 weeks of using the normal Proactiv system, my skin cleared up in a way I&#x27;d never experienced in my life!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it was!! My days of acne were over!! It felt so good to finally be free! Eventually, though, I had to stop using Proactiv because I moved out of the country and it wasn&#x27;t really available outside the US. So, acne problems eventually re-surfaced. As Proactiv will tell you, acne does not just go away, especially for those that suffer from adult acne. It&#x27;s always there. It&#x27;s a malfunction, almost disease, of the skin. Your skin will always want to have acne. You just have to continually fight and win every battle. Proactiv is the army to do it, and makes it easy too. Well, I&#x27;ve just recently moved back to the US, and the first thing I did was order Proactiv. Again, just the simple 3 step system. It was like coming back to an old, tried and true, trusted friend. Within just a couple of weeks, my skin had almost totally cleared up, and has been clear since (going on 6 weeks now). It still astounds me how great this product is. I feel like a normal person again. Oh! I forgot! I actually did begin using the Dark Spot Corrector too. Amazing results!! Proactiv is hands down the BEST product I&#x27;ve ever invested in and will continue to invest in no matter what. Though it is expensive, it is a highly effective product with amazing lasting results. It is money VERY well spent. And now, you can pay in installments, which is really cool, not to mention they now have Proactiv kiosks going up in various malls all over the country, which means you can just run out and get some in a pinch if you need. So, if you suffer from acne in any way, get this product! I cannot stress that enough! Even if you have to work overtime or something to pay for it. You won&#x27;t be sorry!

    <li> I recently brought this kit for my 15 yr old son. He has mild acne. I thought maybe we could control his break outs and clear it up before it got any worse. Well, after using the products as directed, his break outs became worse. He started getting bumps where he had none before and they were really large and became irritated.  I also noticed that anything that came in contact with the products like sheets, pillowcases, towels and washcloths would get stripped of color as if bleach were spilled on it.  Proactiv contains benzoyl peroxide and it acts like bleach when it gets on fabric. My son apparently didn&#x27;t rinse off his hands after applying the products, but even so, when he used it at night and laid on the pillowcases, they would get ruined with big bleach marks where his face had been. I didn&#x27;t realize what was happening until half of my towels and washcloths had these marks on them, and I knew I had&#x27;nt spilled bleach on them. Even my son&#x27;s shirts and tops have gotten ruined around the neck with this product.  Be careful if you use Proactiv to prevent ruining your linens and clothes.  Proactiv did&#x27;nt work for my son but, it seems like has for alot of others. He used it for about 3 weeks. Use with caution. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I bought this online for the $19.95 and I do scan over anything I&#x27;m buying but no where in there or the first shipment was there anything about it being an auto replenish program for $30 a month! I called to cancel it when I saw the first charge of over $45 go through and the guy said fine without a problem and said if I kept that shipment then I wouldn&#x27;t be refunded back the $45 but if I shipped it back I would be refunded so I figured why bother shipping it back after reading dozens of reviews about how customers never see the money back. Now I&#x27;m being hounded for late payments! Yes, I should have read every last word of the agreement but most things you buy online don&#x27;t sign you up for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it works  barely better than clean and clear except once you stop using it for a couple of days your face breaks out twice as badly!! Worst company I have ever dealt with!!</li>
    <li> When I starting using this product back in the middle of 2006, I was REALLY happy.&lt;br /&gt;It cleared my forehead of it&#x27;s blemishes perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as time went on... it didn&#x27;t reduce the amount of blemishes on the rest of my face! It seems to worsten rather than reduce them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I started to feel that as I used it, my face become un-even and cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I had my father cancel my monthly supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing that came out of my ordering it was that my forehead was perfectly cleared though, wish the same was with the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> the product was good!!!!!!!!! I received it on time. I used it and it was very effective. I used so many products, none of them showed any changes. but you need to use proactive on regular basses</li>
    <li> The system has worked well and consistently for me for several years, I just thought I would add that it is possible to buy these at a lot of malls around the US for much cheaper than online or through the proactiv subscription. At my mall, and in others I&#x27;ve seen, you can get this 3-part system for around $25! Proactiv will charge you in two $20 installments ($40) for the same thing and it is obviously more expensive to buy it here too. So look for it at your local mall and good luck</li>
    <li> It was shipped promptly and would buy again from this seller! The product works great!</li>
    <li> I am 28 and had a few blemishes, so I decided to try proactiv.  Now my skin is a mess!  It seemed like it would work, so I stuck with it for a month, and then I got another box in the mail of more product.  Be wary, it is not obvious that once you buy the initial kit you will automatically be signed up to receive proactive and be charged continuously.  Perhaps proactiv works for some, but since it was having reverse effects for me I called to return the additional box of product that they sent me.  Though I still had 2 weeks left to return proactiv for a refund, the customer service representative said that they take 4-6 weeks to process returns, and so it would not be enough time to get my return order refund!  Not only do I now have to pay for shipping and handling which is estimated to be around $10 but additionally for a certificate of delivery so I can prove I sent the product in on time. How frustrating.  My last rant is that once the customer service woman heard I wanted to return the product, she tried to get off the phone very fast, and I had to keep asking her not to hang up, since she was VERY short and not forward about how to go about handling the return (ie. address, filling out the return slip etc).  I would normally not write any review even if the product didn&#x27;t work for me, but the customer service i received put me over the edge.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work and the company has the worst customer service ever.  My customer service rep stated he didn&#x27;t care what my concerns were and to only answer the questions he asked.</li>
    <li> I shouldve taken it as a sign the day i never recieved a refund....Jan. 2012....i decide to give a proactiv a try for my ok skin...my face isnt what id consider \\&quot;acne\\&quot; i just get maybe one to two small pimples on my chin or forehead...nothing that really makes me feel disgusting. Well like an idiot i order it by sending in a check. 2 weeks latet i haven&#x27;t received my package, so i call and they tell me they put the check toward an outstanding acct from my address...WHAT? It wasnt my acct but someone who previously lived in my home! So after arguing with them they tell me they will send me my check back...never do. Call back then i hear sorry blah blah \\&quot;we&#x27;ll send you check and free package\\&quot;...never do. Anyway, so i buy some from my moms address....now here it is May and my face is TERRIBLE!  IVE NEVER HAD ACNE like this in my life. Im 25 and my face looks like. 12 yr old boy in puberty. I have big red cyst ttpe zits covering every inch of my face. I am literally embarrassed to even talk to people. ABSOLUTELY do not try proactiv.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, you just have to keep with it. The first couple of days my skin was super dry and itchy, but after a week my skin got used to it. Just make sure you keep well moisturized.</li>
    <li> Wow! I tried posting this on Practiv&#x27;s Facebook page, but it has been immediately erased 4 straight times within seconds. I cancelled my son&#x27;s membership and returned his $100 unopened package of merchandise. However, Proactiv never refunded my money. When I called today, they said the package was returned a few days past the \\&quot;60-day Money-back guarantee.\\&quot; Now, I&#x27;ve been a member for a while, so it&#x27;s not like this was our first shipment. However, the lady said she was refunding me $98 (purchase + tax - shipping). I was fine with that, but didn&#x27;t understand why they had never refunded my money after 1 1/2 months since receiving my return. When I asked, I was told it was because the shipment was returned after the 60 days and \\&quot;They couldn&#x27;t refund my money.\\&quot; Well, obviously they could because they did, but if I hadn&#x27;t called they never would have given me the refund. They were just going to keep the money and the merchandise. This has nothing to do with the product, just whether or not you can trust the company. Sad that a company has to try and hide the truth about the customer service. If you order Proactiv, I would suggest keeping a close eye on your account and $$!!</li>
    <li> I used Proactive like a couple of years ago t did not work for me.Then on QVC my grandma got it for me because there was agood offer and Proactive send it \\&quot;improved\\&quot; .Well I tried it out and it did not work out .My nose got all red and irritated from proactive. In fact,I even broken more. My skin felt so rough and irritated.Proactive for me did not work out for me.It just made my acne wost.I went to CVS and was looking for new Acene Soulution and this lady came up to me and suggestion for me to use CETEAPHIL  and I used it and loved it .My skin was so soft smooth and clean and my acne was much better I don&#x27;t have any acne.Also its great way to take off your make up.</li>
    <li> My son has very difficult acne.  After going to the dermatologist for a year with no real change, I thought I would try Proactiv.  He has been using it for a few weeks now and still no change. I will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> POroActiv will NOT refund your money and puts you on auto-shipments once you order ANYTHING from them. My second auto shipment was 2 boxes of stuff for over $100! I sent it back in July and was promised a refund...NOTHING! Don&#x27;t give them your credit card # or else use a preloaded credit card # so they can&#x27;t keep charging you. Their customer service reps will just lie and say you are getting your money back but you never will!! Too bad they don&#x27;t let you just buy the product ONCE to TRY IT but you NOOoooo you can&#x27;t--no matter what, if you buy a kit you are enrolled AUTOMATICALLY in their \\&quot;skin care club\\&quot; which translated means: we will send you boxes of stuff you didn&#x27;t order and charge your credit card forever!!</li>
    <li> This product may work well for some, but the active ingredients being a high percentage of acidic material will cause dryness and irritation, and will take weeks to become adjusted to. On top of that there is no way to avoid their constant billing, and their lack of communication is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen with any company. If you have no problem with being billed for no apparent reason, lack of reply to questioning emails, and lack of respect of help on the customer service phone line, go ahead and by this product but be warned. They are owned by a large infomercial company, and your loyalty as a customer will mean nothing to them.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and after  10 years having acne i finally got rid all my pimples.  I am so glad this product exist</li>
    <li> I gave this a two star...because I like the toner and its ingredients.    Otherwise, I used this and initially it cleared my skin...so I kept using it...then my skin got bad again...so I got into the cycle of using it because of the initial skin clearing and was afraid to stop for fear of it getting even worse. I used it for a long time and then started researching ingredients..there are ingredients that are acne causing in this. So initially the BP and stuff cleared my skin, but then the pore clogging, acne causing ingredients starting causing the acne again. I thought my skin itself was just getting worse, but the proactive was the culprit. Its a vicious cycle.    Well, anyway...I stopped using it and my skin improved, not better just improved. I have the cystic kind of acne(mostly on my chin area), ive had it all my life...I am now 40. I have found something that works well for me now, I dont know if I can name it on here though...It is sold at B&amp;BW, and it is almost a miracle for me...I have dealt with this acne all my life and have found something that almost eliminates it. This stuff, to me, is just a crock.</li>
    <li> I was exited to use this crap at first because of the *steps*. First time I used it, It was good. When I used it everyday like it says, my skin was AWFUL. I&#x27;ve a sensitive oily skin and my skin literally got inflamed. My face was all red and burning!! Whenever I&#x27;d apply anything it&#x27;d STING. I kept using it hoping it&#x27;d phase out and get better. It got so dry and it was peeling pretty bad and my skin was just falling and my face was so red like a monkey&#x27;s butt and I couldn&#x27;t go to school because of the way I looked. Every time I use it, I regret it. It&#x27;s NOT worth your money. Please don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my grown granddaughter (21) who was experiencing severe breakouts on her face, especially her chin.  With in a matter of three days of use she began to see results.  She loves this product and I am sure she will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I started using Proactive last January and I started noticing a difference within days. I did have an occasional pimple at times but my skin was so much smoother and felt great. I recently stopped using the product and my skin is a nightmare. It is amazing to me how well it worked. I didn&#x27;t realize it until I stopped using it. You can bet i will be rejoining the club.</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty even and clear, not excessively oily and I&#x27;ve never had acne, but I&#x27;m prone to the occasional skin &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34;. Aside from the odd pimple here and there, out of nowhere I&#x27;ll get wicked break-outs all over over my face that last for days and I really have no idea what causes them. Even with different soaps or detergents or whatever I still have it happen a couple times a year and it seems like there&#x27;s nothing I can really do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while I got tired of it, so I figured I&#x27;d try some actual product to mitigate it when it comes around. This is the main one that I know about so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try, and it does a really good job of managing things. If I follow the 3-step plan morning and night like it recommends, I can usually clear it up by the end of the second or third day rather than looking like I fell face first into a wasp&#x27;s nest for an entire week. That&#x27;s huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t have as much luck as I do, but my skin seems good to begin with. It really responds to the peroxide. It&#x27;s quite strong - if I don&#x27;t wash my hands well enough after using it, it will actually bleach my towels pretty good. Luckily I was using this stuff early enough before bed that I didn&#x27;t bleach my sheets, too, because this peroxide really does not mess around.</li>
    <li> this system is still the best out there for clearing acne...the copy cats dont work nearly as well</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a friend.  She told me this system works wonderfully.  She indicated it cleaned her face and healed her acne sintoms.  She highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> Proactive worked miracles on my skin. I decided to try proactive as a last resort before going on accutane I almost gave up the first month of using it because I saw no real results but I stuck it out and by month two I started seeing drastic results by month three even more so.</li>
    <li> Truly Amazing. I have had issues since I was basically 13 and used dozens of products bought in stores. None seem to work, some made it worse and some just kept it steady with less major outbreaks. I am 21 years old now and just started using this about a week ago. I have had amazing changes in my skin. Acne is disappearing at a nice steady rate and my skin is so smooth. Yes I am a guy. It&#x27;s very simple to do and doesn&#x27;t take longer then 5 minutes each time. I use the simple 3 step process and I will stick with this for a very long time. To make use easier I use step one in the shower and step 2 and 3 after shower. Saves you 2 minutes in the morning while trying to rush to class. I really recommend this product for people suffering with bad acne for years.</li>
    <li> This product is great by reputation but this supplier is fantastic! I place my order Saturday afternoon and shockingly received my order Monday morning.</li>
    <li> I am 11 years old, and I asked my mom if I could try Proactiv. I had watched all the commercials and I thought I should try it. My mom ordered it for me, and it was AWESOME!!!! On the first day my skin already started to heal. I have oily skin, and it is my forehead that had a bunch of red bumps and occasionally zits. I know Proactiv isn&#x27;t really meant for kids, but I got the starter kit with the three step system, the green tea moisturiser and refining mask. I haven&#x27;t tried the moisteriser or mask yet though. The 3 step system works really well though. I was reading a bunch of reviews and they said that some peoples skin got dry and red. Well my skin was red and oily to begin with and my skin is actually calming down. So, if you are like my age or something then I would recomend Proactiv.    (And if you are wondering why my username is my dad&#x27;s name it&#x27;s because I am on my dads account)</li>
    <li> So I used to use proactiv in my early 20&#x27;s and never had any issues that I presently do with the new formula proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face 2 nights in a row with my clarisonic and proactiv.  I washed my face thoroughly... and 3 hours later I went to sleep 2 nights in a row... which is ample time for my face to dry, etc.  This CRAP bleached my brand new $200 pillow shams! I am FURIOUS!  I slept on brand new bedding I just bought and now it is ruined  because of this proactiv!  I have never been so mad in my life!&lt;br /&gt;HOW can this be safe at all for our skin if it is so strong to dye bedding HOURS later?!  Seriously?! Rodan and Fields will be hearing from me, as will Q V C reviewers and any one else who will give me 5 minutes of their time...  I am sickened from this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT use this!  I was breaking out a little, I just turned 30 and had my 2nd child... and decided to give this a little go... in hopes it would help... but forget it!  I am throwing it all out and just going back to the philosophy cleanser....&lt;br /&gt;How can this JUNK have so many infomercials with success stories... and the crappiest thing is that my breakouts are WORSE after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW and IMPROVED formula SUCKS!  Bring back the old stuff they had a decade ago!  I know for a FACT I never had these issues, as my sheets were eggplant purple when I used to use this, and NEVER EVER had any stains or bleaching!</li>
    <li> Horrible horrible customer service.  They don&#x27;t care about anything but taking your money.  I agreed to a one time purchase per shipment of $30 and somewhere in the fine fine print it apparently said $90 for one shipment that would be broken down into 3 payments of $30 a month.  I did not agree to that at all! When I called to complain all they would do is cancel my account but I would continue to be charged the $30/month until the $90 was fully paid. The woman on the phone argued with me for 30 min about it and wouldn&#x27;t do anything else for me.  The product doesn&#x27;t even work at all.  I still get break outs in the same spots I did before using Pro Active. Seriously avoid this company... they&#x27;ll just take your money.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FOR MY DAUGHTER.  AFTER THE FIRST USE SHE NOTICED HER FACE WAS ITCHY WHEN SHE WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING.  SHE IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUED IT AFTER 1 USE.  IT WENT DOWNHILL AFTER THAT.  HER FACE BECAME SWOLLEN, RED AND ITCHY WITH WELTS.  I IMMEDIATELY WENT ONLINE AND DISCOVERED OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUES.  I GAVE HER BENADRYL AND ADVISED HER TO KEEP APPLYING COLD WATER TO HER FACE.  AFTER ABOUT 3 DAYS THE SWELLING, REDNESS AND ITCHING HAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY HOWEVER HER FACE IS NOW COVERED IN HEATS.  SHE HAD A SIMILAR REACTION TO CLERASIL ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I BELIEVE THAT SHE MAY BE ALLERGIC TO BENZOYL PEROXIDE.</li>
    <li> I used Proactiv when I was sixteen for several years and it cleared my skin up beautifully. Then I stopped because it was so expensive, and now, at 21, have gone back to it and find that buying it on Amazon is a great alternative (plus you&#x27;re not locked into anything) ..would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I used proactive for about 6 months and it worked excellently.  The largest issue for me was the price, which is completely insane.  I stopped and switched to the generic brand (Acne Free).  I had a tough week but within about two weeks my skin was back to about as near as where it was with Proactiv.  Proactiv is a better solution and I think Acne Free is about 70-80% as effective.  However, Proactiv is just not worth the price.  Finally, when you cancel your Proactiv it is a **nightmare** they will send you supplies after you cancel, they will say it takes upto 3 months to process any returns, and then they claimed that I hadn&#x27;t returned it in time though I did.  I had to get snippity on the phone with them before they finally gave up on charging me $40 for something I never used.  So just FYI!  90% of their customer service issues come from returns, you have to pay return shipping, and they want you to use a specific service with postal tracking.  In short, they make it as impossible to cancel or return as possible, on purpose.  Buyer be warned!</li>
    <li> This product will either work really well for you or it won&#x27;t.  Not everyone is going to experience the same results so if you are interested in trying this product, keep an open mind.    I just turned 33 and after having no acne as a teen, started getting adult onset acne around age 29, mostly around the chin and jaw line.  I tried all the over the counter products and some worked ok, some not at all.  Tried Obagi for awhile which worked great but comes with a very hefty price tag.  I started using Proactiv about 3 months ago and have had very good results.  Nothing miraculous but definitely less new breakouts and overall better texture and tone.  Consistency is the key with this product.      After reading the horror stories about their customer service, I looked for a kiosk location.  Now all I have to do when I run out of something is head to my local mall and go to a kiosk and out it comes. I think the kiosk items are a little more expensive than ordering online but since you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping and have the instant gratification then and there, it balances out for me.    Best advice...  Avoid the proactiv site and go to a kiosk or order from amazon.</li>
    <li> Though Proactiv Solution works pretty well for me, I have never seen a product vary so drastically from one user to another. I started getting terrible acne in the 9th grade, and it had a major effect on my confidence. People would stare at my zits--and not into my eyes--whenever we were having a conversation, and my 10th grade history teacher even held me back at the end of class specifically to recommend a skin care product that she had ordered from Avon. If that were not embarrassing enough, my acne reached a peak during my senior year of high school--the primetime of every young woman&#x27;s life. Every inch of my cheeks was covered in bright red, pus-filled pimples. It was so terrible that some people looked disgusted to even stand near me, and I had to wear a TON of concealer for my senior photos--which only exacerbated the problem as soon as picture day was over. After my high school graduation, I started spending a lot of time out at the pool, and (despite what the experts say), the sun drastically improved my skin. My face turned really red one day when I forgot the sunblock, and the next day, all of the zits were gone. However, when the summer ended and I went to college in the fall, the zits came back. It was then that I decided that I need something stronger than an over-the-counter medicine to deal with my skin. After watching a commercial for Proactiv Solution, I ordered it over the phone on a whim. The first few weeks didn&#x27;t give me any results, but after a about a month, the product worked to its full potential. I have been using it for almost two years now, and I am very happy with my decision to purchase it. Though it has not provided the magical results that are showcased in every commercial (I still get a couple of pimples every couple of weeks, my face is not the horrible red mask that it once was. Unlike some reviewers reported, the product does not dry my face out at all, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any redness. The most redeeming product of the entire system is the toner. Though it does not smell very potent, it succeeded in removing from my hands and forearms a botched application of self-tanning lotion that almost a week of constant scrubbing did nothing to help. For me, this is very good stuff. Unfortunately, as I stated, this product varies so widely from customer to customer that it is hard to determine the effectiveness of its use. In my circle of friends, three girls (myself included) are using Proactiv. My skin reacted very nicely to the product, but the other two weren&#x27;t as lucky. One of the girls had mild acne and experienced no change in her condition. Another girl had moderate acne and experienced such severe burning and redness of the skin that she discontinued usage and even voluntary went through the seven levels of Hell (also known as Proactiv Customer Service) to get a refund.     Overall, here are my basic recommendations for those considering using Proactiv:    1.) Since results vary so widely between each user, buy the smallest amount of the product that is available. That way, if it does not match your particular needs, you are not out an arm and a leg on something totally useless    2.) Beware of the freebies/extras. The basic three step Proactiv system and the Daily Oil Control lotion work wonders (compared to the \\&quot;before\\&quot; situation), but the other items in the Proactiv line were actually pretty damaging. As a \\&quot;free gift\\&quot;, I received a tube of the Refining Mask. I applied it according to the directions, but approximately twenty minutes after I removed it, my face was covered in large red, itchy blotches. I immediately threw the tube in the garbage, and by the time I resumed using my regular system the next day, the spots were gone. So, if you get extras in the mail, proceed with caution.    3.) DO NOT, under any circumstances, tell the representative that you want a free month&#x27;s supply VitaClear Vitamins with your purchase. First of all, the vitamins are disgusting. VitaClear comes in abox with thirty individually wrapped packets of 5 vitamins. After taking that first packet of five vitamins one morning, I had to make a run to the restroom to vomit. The next day, I had didn&#x27;t throw up, but I did a second time after using the vitamins a few days later. Though I followed the direction to eat before usage, no matter how much or how little I ate, I would puke at least twice a week. If this is not enough, as soon as you agree to accept a free order, you (unknowingly) sign yourself up to receive auto-shipments of Vitaclear every two months--which means that your credit card will automatically be charged $29.99 every six or weeks.  I have no idea how to cancel an account with VitaClear (which is sold by a different company than Proactiv). The only reason I stopped receiving shipments was because I changed addresses and my credit card just happened to expire that same month. So, if you like swallowing five vitamins each day that will make you puke, feel free to sign up for auto shipments of a product that is impossible to cancel.    4.) As I mentioned previously, Customer Service is Hell (according to the people I know who have tried to cancel). If you want to cancel your account, you have to locate the customer service number from the website or from your previous bill. Proactiv does not allow easy online cancellations or (to my knowledge) mail-in requests to cancel. Then, when you call a representative and mention that you want to cancel your account, you are mysteriously put on hold for an indefinite amount of time--though they jump at the chance to talk to you if you are willing to order Proactiv. If you are not put on hold, the reps will talk in circles and try to convince you to order more products. One of my friends who successfully canceled her account recommended setting up a web count on the Proactiv site, going to the help feature, and then emailing a representative with the question \\&quot;How do I cancel my account?\\&quot; A rep contacted her by email afew days later, asked for her account number, and subsequently canceled the account. I recommend following this procedure or continue to receive the automatic shipments each month.  Overall, this product worked for me, but it will not work for everyone. It is kind of like spinning the Wheel of Fortune or flipping a coin...only this time, instead of head and tails, the sides are \\&quot;Clear Skin\\&quot; and \\&quot;Not\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Honestly, I do. I have never had extremely bad skin but I did have acne growing up around my nose, &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; area and chin. I woke up when I was about 10 with this mysterious rash on the side of my right cheek. I&#x27;m 27 now and NOTHING had helped that rash or any of my acne go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most people at different intervals of my life I cut out sweets and soda, thinking this all would help. Yea, not so much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally after summer 2013 I decided to just bit the bullet and try Proactiv. I remember my cousin having this when we were younger but she stated that it didn&#x27;t really work for her but still I said I&#x27;d give it a shot. Now since I was not born yesterday I figured the &amp;#34;trial kit&amp;#34; for $19.99 was too  good to be true and started to research everything I could about Proactiv. I read a thousand more negative reviews than positive ones about this but still pushed on in that direction. I was well aware that they would start automatic deductions out of my checking account once those 30 days were over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results though is incredible. I love the feeling the system gives my skin. I do not wear make up ever excpet chapstick so I am fanatical about taking care of my skin. As one person previous mentioned, the system isn&#x27;t that much of a hassle to do twice a day once you get use to it. It&#x27;s just another part your daily beauty reigme. My skin was not covered in pimples when I started but I really wanted to concentrate on that persistant rash that had set up shop on my face for the past 18 plus years. Viola!!!!! Proactiv did what every other product on the shelf and homemade rememdy failed to do. I notice a huge difference in the clarity of my face and overall complexion. The rash is fading daily to a very unnoticeable sight, to which I am thrilled!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 3 step system and the blackhead dissolving gel the most. If left on too long, the gel can and will start to burn but should stop once you watch it off. I know I have customized my kit to add and take out what I want so my bill is not so high, also I lengthened the shipping increments to 20 weeks instead of the usual 3 months as a whole box takes me nearly 2 to 2 and a half months to take down. The toner is the only thing that goes like wild fire with me. I have more oil free moisturizer then I know what to do with however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is people please do your homework before ordering a product. If you see a deal and it seems to good to be true, then as the saying goes, it usually is. Consider your pockets and if you can afford to be out of $100-$150 every 12 weeks ($33.33 a month) for a system that may or may not work for you. Also take into consideration how many negative reviews there are against it, I mean if so many people are saying the same negative points, they can&#x27;t all be bought out conspirators right? Lastly consider your situation and how bad your acne is, is it bad enough you are willing to deal with all the above headaches in hopes of a better outcome then your neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to the majority of those questions, then I would highly say push forward and enjoy the new you!!!!!!watch it off.

    <li> I did not get much chance to try it properly.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely looking forward to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it couple of times only so far.</li>
    <li> I remember ordering this product before and it made no different to my skin, it actually made it worse. The money was wasted and they kept charging me for their horrible product. This is a warning, look for something better, this is a As Seen On TV total scam.</li>
    <li> After using this product for almost two months, I have noticed significant improvement with the clarity and texture of my skin. Generally, I have consistent, but mild break-outs, but since I have been using this product, I have not had any breakouts. Also, Proactive really prevents breakouts on my face that occur after waxing. After 25 years of using various acne products, hands down, this is THE best product for mild acne.</li>
    <li> First, the product works modestly well, but is no miracle cure for acne, despite what their television ads claim.  But that&#x27;s not the biggest problem.    Be very wary of starting to do business with these people.  Stopping is almost impossible.  Here&#x27;s why:    We ordered this for my son, and he used it for almost two years.  The results were modest but positive.  Then his dermatologist chose a more active and different course of treatment, and told him to stop using Proactive.    Naturally, we called to cancel the automatic shipments.  They didn&#x27;t stop. We called again.  They didn&#x27;t stop.  We called again. They didn&#x27;t stop.  We tried to return the product and were told we were passed the \\&quot;30 day return policy\\&quot; and the product couldn&#x27;t be returned (even though it has an almost infinite shelf life).      We stopped being charged only because the credit card expiration date passed. But the shipments continued for another month. Then the threats started.    Proactive (Guthy Renker, the company that sells everything imaginable via infomercials) started sending us collection letters. Since we had called them three times to cancel, and since we had paid for all but the final shipment, I ignored them.  The letters stopped.    Then we started getting incredibly aggressive letters and automated, mystery telephone calls at all hours from their collection agency, SKO Brenner American (800 669-5208)insisting that we owed for the final shipment.  I explained the situation and they didn&#x27;t care to listen.  Finally, in complete frustration, I paid for the final shipment just to make the calls stop.    This is not a customer-oriented company. Guthy-Renker isn&#x27;t trustworthy in the least.  Interestingly, on their website, they have \\&quot;ten commandments for management.\\&quot;  Not one of those says anything about dealing with customers honestly or fairly. They do talk about dominating their marketplace and trade associations, and they talk about building their brand and their upside at all times. But no where do they mention providing real value for their customers in an honorable fashion. From my experience they are living by their own ten commandments.</li>
    <li> I used Proactiv off and on for a few years.  How well it worked really depended on what was going on with my body.  During pregnancy it was fantastic.  The hormonal changes really were affecting my skin. Also, I only used the cleanser.  The additional products were too drying.. The cleanser alone worked miracles.  But there were times it did not work and that was when my diet was poor.  I believe that we need to look for issues beyond the external.  It is hard to blame a product when you are feeding your body excess sugar (sugar feeds bacteria), fast foods, carbonated drinks, and trans fats.  Most people don&#x27;t drink enough water either.  So, you overload your body with junk and then you can&#x27;t even flush out the toxins because you are dehydrated.  So you are now trying to topically eliminate the stink from a cesspool. Before giving poor reviews on the quality of a product, review the quality of your diet.</li>
    <li> I think that this product works good and so many people have complemented my skin since I started using this 2 months ago. I think that it is a bit strong so I only use it once a day instead of 2 to 3 times as the package says to do. For the first wash in the morning I use an antibacterial soap and then a lotion with vitamin E in so that this product won&#x27;t dry out my skin. And then I use the 3 step system before I go to bed at night. I didn&#x27;t have super bad acne until I moved from a dry climate to a very humid one. This product not only seem to help with my breakouts but also made my skin tone more even. I think it helps but should not be used as many times a day as they say to.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for almost a month. Based on how my skin was looking before I started, I can see results and will continue to use it until I have completely used it. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Would have given this a 0 star rating if possible.  I had mild to moderate acne before using this product.  As soon as I started using it my skin became dry, red, and irritated with severe acne.  I was advised to continue using the product for at least one month.  I was told the product was working, and bringing forth \\&quot;buried acne\\&quot; that would soon clear up.  I gave it another three weeks and it just kept getting worse.  I would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me SO much! If you use it like you are suppose to, it should work. I LOVE my clear skin!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t be scared about the automatic shipments. I&#x27;ve canceled mine before because they didn&#x27;t come on time when I needed them or they came too much. I now just get mine at the mall so I don&#x27;t have to worry about automatic shipment.</li>
    <li> My acne went from mild to extremely hard to cure... This might work for some, but the dire consequence if it doesn&#x27;t is way too much for me to handle. Unless you&#x27;re in a dire situation, do not test this product. I regret the moment I ordered this product this my whole face is flaring up for about a month already.</li>
    <li> Proactiv worked for me but it has to be used regularly.  I use it about once a day, it&#x27;s actually recommended to be used twice a day!!!  I have to admit that I don&#x27;t always use it regularly and then my acne returns very quickly.  I like the fact that most of the products in the kit are not extremely drying, and seem very gentle for acne treatments.  If you have used prescription or even other over the counter acne meds in the past then you know how drying with yucky side effects they can have.  Everything in the kit except the toner is not too overly drying for me and I have naturally dry skin.  I skip the toner all together which seems really harsh.  When I have a nasty flare up or get lazy and don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole process I will use the spot treatment which works really well!  I double up on the spot treatment in really bad areas and they usually subside within a few days.  One great sample product that came with the kit I ordered from their website was their green tea moisturizer, this moisturizer does not make me break out and goes a long way in helping with the dryness, I just wish that they would include a full size in their system and maybe a smaller size of the toner instead.  It&#x27;s definitely worth trying before considering prescription acne medication.    UPDATE: I am not thrilled with buying directly from proactive, after the intial discount the price for a one month supply goes way up!  On top of that I believe they added me to their montly subscription automatically.  I was disappointed.  I do think they sell some very good products though.  Definitely recommend the face wash, spot treatment/cream, green tea moisturizer, and mask, skip the toner its very harsh.</li>
    <li> http://joyfulbeautyblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/09/how-i-got-rid-of-my-cystic-acne/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did clear out my whiteheads and blackheads when I was younger but made my cystic acne much, much worse. More details in the blog.</li>
    <li> wow, damn, i guess all their commercials really convinced people to buy this bull. It made my acne worse. WORST CHOICE OF MY LIFE.</li>
    <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different medicines, one of which actually made his acne worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got fed up with all of the over the counter stuff and decided to visit our pediatrician.  He told us that our son had 3-4 level acne on the Pillsbury scale which classifies the severity of acne from 1 to 4.  Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something teens are notorious for not being faithful with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  So now we&#x27;re moving from using Proactiv to using prescription antibiotics and some stronger prescription acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish us luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, great product</li>
    <li> ProActive really worked for my face the only issue I had was their customer service was TERRIBLE. They don&#x27;t work with you at all and cancelling their product takes FOREVER. Also the price is what made me cancel. It&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for most of my life, and I cannot tell you how many things I have tried! This product really seemed to be my savior at first, but then it just seemed to quit. I discontinued use after eight months of using this product, because it caused my skin to start get cystic pimples ( so not cute) , which had never happened before. After I had stopped the usage of proactiv, my cystic acne was no longer occurring and I was back to my regular skin acne. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 year old female, I have never had acne until I became an adult.  I have tried so many products for my skin type and my age and nothing worked.  I thought it was just hormonal and just accepted it, until I tried my neice&#x27;s proactiv.  I noticed a difference in my skin overnight. I have been using Proactiv now for about 6 months and I will never use anything else.  My skin looks beautiful and I have not had acne since.</li>
    <li> I bought Proactive after breaking out with adult acne in Nov 2010. I had tried salycic acid washes and a prescription medication. I did not see any results and the cleanser died my hairline. I also had a terrible time trying to cancel my subscription. I realized in April the cause of my acne was from stressfull events and once the stressers had subsided my acne cleared. Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with Proactiv. There are several reasons for this.&lt;br /&gt;1. I placed an order for ProActiv on 4/30/2013 for a one time purchase of the product. Proactiv did not fulfill this order and sent me a letter on 5/24/20 that they are still working to fulfill the order.&lt;br /&gt;2. On 6/4/2013 I received an  e-mail notifying me that my Order is cancelled. Even though I did not initiate this cancellation, I decided it is for the good as I was not happy with the amount of delay.&lt;br /&gt;3. On 6/7/2013 I notice a charge being made to my credit card and was very confused as why Proactiv is charging me after cancellation. Decided to call their billing and inquire. Billing people informed that they are not able to fulfill the order I placed and hence they cancelled it and created a new order that is very similar. I was presumably charged for the new order. Decided to let it go, even though I was not happy at their decision to cancel and place orders at their whim and fancy without my knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;4. Received my product after another 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;5. On 7/2/2013 I notice that they charged my credit card for $49.60 and called ProActiv to inquire about the charge. They informed that the new order was placed in a membership package and hence it will automatically send me replenishments at very high rates. Customer Service was very rude and adamantly tells me that I Cancelled the previous order and place the new order in the membership package. Really frustrated with them. They told me that they cannot refund me immediately. However I have 60 day period to return the product for a refund. Requested them to cancel my membership plan and decided to let it go.&lt;br /&gt;6. On 7/11/2013 I receive the replenishment with an invoice for $106.99 and they will bill me automatically. That was the end of my patience.&lt;br /&gt;7. Called the Proactiv billing and once again face rude customer service. They repeatedly tell me that will keep charging my credit card until I return the product.I informed them that I am making every effort to return the product but do not want automatic charging done to my credit card for future bills. Customer service is so rude that they then inform me that refunds will take from 6 to 8 weeks, and there is no way to stop automatic charges to the credit card. Only way is to remove the credit card on file and that would delay the refund by another 3 weeks. Looks like every option Proactiv provided is to see how to delay the refund as much as possible while making every effort to to quickly keep charging the customer.&lt;br /&gt;8.I have to also pay for Shipping and Handling for the return of the product. When inquired about why I have to pay for S &amp; H for the fault of ProActiv, I was told it would further delay the refund by another 10 to 14 days while they take time to send a return label. If I pay for S &amp; H there will be no refund of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, Chose another Product but not ProActiv. Very bad Customer Service and very poor delivery times.</li>
    <li> Thank God I didn&#x27;t buy this product, my husband got it for free from his sister-in-law for treating his minor acne (now I know why she gave away easily this pretty expensive product). I had few blemishes on my face because of my period, so I decided to help my skin get over it - big mistake!!! I applied the repair treatment lotion before going to bed, and the next morning I came to work with my face burning and as red as a stoplight. By lunch time, the skin on my face was burning and hurting so bad I wanted just to burry my face in a bowl of ice!!! My face is red and swollen all over, and I pray it goes away by tomorrow. I don&#x27;t know if this is an allergy, or a literal skin burn, or if this how this stuff works. It&#x27;s definitely not for me. It might work for other people with skin not so sensitive, but PLEASE - don&#x27;t put this directly on your skin, try it on your elbow first or other piece of skin where it&#x27;s not visible in case it has reaction.</li>
    <li> I love proactive it is light and has a nice little smell to it ,I am going to keep it real though ....the time you stop or miss a day or a step of proactiv the acne comes back , your face is dry ,and or whatever issues you may have with your skin. I love proactiv but It is not for everyone my advice is use it for 14 days at least so your skin can get use to it and maybe it will be ok to skip a day or a night</li>
    <li> When i bought this it was a great price and my wife has shown that this product works great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</li>
    <li> This product is ok the first couple of weeks but it actually makes your skin produce more oils. We tried to cancel ,  you must call,can&#x27;t do it online. Spent a half an hour on the phone making sure that the auto ship they make you sign up for wouldn&#x27;t ship. They refused to guarantee that the autoship that was scheduled 3 weeks from the date I called wouldn&#x27;t come.  I had this happen last time I had a subscription a coupleb of years ago and they ended up shipping the product and charging my card for another 3 months. I had to insist on speaking with a supervisor then all of a sudden his computer worked and he could access my account and he was finally able to give me a confirmation number that the subscription was cancelled and no more product would ship and no more charges to my card.  I varied this with Delaney and his supervisor, Curtis. Wow, what manipulative customer service!!  Confirmation of cancellation is 02052012-ALT</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter. We used it for several months and it did not work. We tried several other things Also, did not work. We discovered Lugol&#x27;s iodine. Put several drops (10) in a shallow pan of warm water. Dip face in a few times twice a day (morning and evening). Do not rinse. This works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Took about two weeks to start seeing improvement. Continues to improve on a daily basis. I would definately give this a try if you also have a teen struggling with acne issues.</li>
    <li> I like proactiv. Of course the product varies from person to person. Step 1 works well for me, but my skin tends to break out more whenever I proceed with step 2 and 3 because my face gets oily from it. I&#x27;m trying step 2 and 3 again to see if I get a different affect. Proactiv is very risky when it comes to ordering from them. After ordering proactiv, you get 30 days before they charge you for a 3 month plan. They deny you if you try to cancel the three month plan after your first 30 days SO BE CAREFUL and call as soon as possible to stop that 3 month shipment.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product did work for me, but could be different for others. It&#x27;s not magic. It doesn&#x27;t completely stop you from having break outs, I feel like it maintains them versus completing stopping them. Good luck to everyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my daughter assured me it was the only solution that would clear up her skin at the time.  This of course was not the case, and she has now found a much cheaper product that works just as well.  I was on the twice a year plan and received one kit of three trial size products before Christmas 2011 with a bill for $105.74.  Long story short, they promised me a $63 refund on my charge card 2 months ago.  It still hasn&#x27;t been processed after numerous calls, and now I am disputing the charge with the credit card company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of this story is just because good looking movie stars rep this product, it doesn&#x27;t mean the company is reputable.  Actions speak louder than words.  THEY ARE OUT TO SCREW THEIR CUSTOMERS SO BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I was never able to use products with benzyl peroxide as a teen because I would have allergic reactions (red, itchy skin and swollen eyes) so when I got adult acne at the age of 26, Proactiv wasn&#x27;t even a consideration. Over the past 3 years I&#x27;ve used mostly OTC acne washes/meds as well as Zen-Med, an all-natural acne system. The Zen Med helped a little with the large cysts, but didn&#x27;t do a thing for the flesh-colored whiteheads (you know those little bumps that you aren&#x27;t supposed to squeeze, but you do anyway and a little never-ending curly-q of something white comes out? I know, gross.)&lt;br /&gt;So one night at my sister&#x27;s house I didn&#x27;t have any face wash and I took a risk and used her Proactiv. I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions, so she gave me some to try at home.&lt;br /&gt;I know that all acne medications say to wait at least 6-8 weeks before they begin working, but this worked in less than 2 weeks. More like 1 week. It was quite a bit drying, so I started using the face wash twice a day, but the toner and cream only before bedtime. And because I am so sensitive to breakouts using almost any moisturizer, I use the Dual-Action Moisturizer from Target which is specifically for acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;My big pus-filled zits are totally gone, my whiteheads (the impossible, I&#x27;ve-tried-everything-the-internet-said-to-get-rid-of-them whiteheads!) are totally gone, my skin tone is actually pretty! For the past 3 years I&#x27;ve had to cake all this makeup on my ugly skin, and during the last month, I haven&#x27;t worn ANY. That is amazing and I am floored by how well Proactiv worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;My sister said it stopped working for her after a while, but I also know she stopped using it consistently because of the drying factor. Personally, I&#x27;d rather deal with dry skin than zit-covered skin, so I will continue using it and just hope it keeps working like it has been.&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv is at least worth trying, especially for someone like me that has tried everything else short of accutane (not worth the side effects, from what I&#x27;ve heard)!</li>
    <li> Proactive is expensive and bleaches everything in sight, bed sheets, pillow cases, and clothing. Wouldnt recommend to anyone. Plus I had cancelled the product last year and now have a 100.00 dollar bill, because I was overseas protecting OUR country and packaged arrvied and I was unable to call or return. Thanks Proactive for making hardtimes even harder!!!</li>
    <li> I always read customer reviews of products before buying and I have to say based on the totality of these user reviews,  I won&#x27; t even BOTHER with trying this product! Proactiv will not get a dime from me and I will be sure to tell everyone I know , my website and contacts about this unbelievable treatment of their customers. I am sorry that these people had to experience this and I thank them for taking the time to let others know. Proactiv left a HUGE BLEMISH ON QUALITY CUSTOMER CARE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product back in high school and it seemed to work pretty well except that it dried out my skin like no one&#x27;s business. I stopped using it because my mom said it was too much money to keep wasting. Fast forward five years. I saw a new commercial claiming a new formula that was supposedly less drying and I decided to try it again, on my own dime. However, the \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; did not work for me even a little and actually made my skin worse. So I called to cancel. They said they were sad to see me go but they would stop the shipments after one more payment. So imagine my surprise when I got another shipment. I thought that maybe it was the last one I paid for. But then I got another shipment! So I checked my bank account and they had been withdrawing more money. So I called again to complain. The guy told me that I had canceled only one of my two accounts. Two accounts? That was the first I heard of it. Apparently I had called in to set up one account and set up the second online. So I looked into it. But my phone records, house AND cell, didn&#x27;t have their number on them anywhere and certainly not on the date they said. I knew for a fact that I had set up ONE account online. It took a good month or two before I saw any of my money back, and even then it wasn&#x27;t a complete refund. After all the grief they put me through, I was just glad to get something back so I didn&#x27;t push for more. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, just don&#x27;t try it.</li>
    <li> I have had cystic acne for 15 years now and as anyone knows, this is so hard on your confidence. I sometimes counted eight ot ten deep acne lesions at times the size of a marble. I felt like a monster two out of four weeks of the month. I was at the point where my dermatologist had come to offering me an extremely aggressive oral medication that required getting my blood checked once a month to make sure my body was metabolizing it correctly. This was scary and obviously for me...a health nut...NOT an option. I was at the mall one day and I decided to try the system but was not willing to spend good money on a scam. I just bought the repairing treatment and Figured that if it helped, I would buy the whole system. I knew I was lazy a lot about washing my face at night, so I bought Facial cleansing wipes (Philosophy Purity) as well. I am ecstatic with the results. Since my skin dries out easily, all I did was wash or wipe off my makeup at night and apply the Proactive repairing treatment on my problem areas and call it a night.  When my skin felt too scaly, I would wait until the next evening to reapply the treatment and almost immediately I saw results. I cannot believe that I hardly remember now how I used to look and feel. I am soooooooo happy now, my skin looks awesome and I feel so blessed to have finally overcome this problem. I think mostly the complaint on Proactive is that it dries out your skin so just using the repairing treatment is perfect in these cases. Then, NOTHING will replace washing or at least cleansing with a fragrance free wipe. In the morning, I moisturize with Clinique dramatically different lotion and that is all. I urge anyone who has the tendency to dry up to just purchase this one product and together with a fragrance free facial wash or wipe at night...expect awesome results!!!!</li>
    <li> Service Pros - you actually get to speak with someone at any hour of the day.  Service Cons - too bad they aren&#x27;t helpful and no one who says they&#x27;re going to do something actually does it (i.e. put in an order, fix online account information, ship products).  I called customer service over 10 times in a matter of 3 months.  The problems I had: No record of my order being placed; online account problems (was told by 3 different people, at 3 different times that this would be resolved and it never was); backorder problems (later to discover there was no such problem), shipping problems, automatic billing/shipping problems, and incorrect data information.  Each time a new Proactive representative looked at my account, they all said the same thing, \\&quot;Hmmm, that&#x27;s weird.  I don&#x27;t know why it says ____.  That&#x27;s seems strange.\\&quot;  Yeah, no kidding, yet no one did anything to fix it.  I was finally so fed up that I canceled the product.  Only then did they ship and charge me TWO 90 day shipments (days apart from each other) for $73.78 each.  I shipped it back, asking for a full refund.  A month and a half later, the refund finally appeared on my credit card, but they didn&#x27;t give me the full amount back (only $65.79), deducting shipping charges that weren&#x27;t my fault b/c I never asked for the product anyway.  So frustrating.    Product: I liked the cleanser, but honestly, the 3 step kit didn&#x27;t do anything that over the counter acne kits (that are a lot cheaper) could do.    Overall: Save your money.  Save the headache.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> When I was in eighth grade my skin was pretty broken out in the t-zone, and like any other middle schooler it drove me crazy. I couldn&#x27;t figure out a skincare regimen to clear it up and had been wanting Proactive for the longest time, finally I asked my mom and she said yes, about a week after starting proactive my skin was almost completely clear (I didn&#x27;t have horrible acne but it was enough that I wanted it gone pronto!). Such an amazing product. I would be careful though, I have combination skin and the toner was too drying if I used it all over but as long as I applied it in the t-zone i was good. Same with the moisturizer, pretty oily for my t-zone but used it on cheeks. The only item out of it all that I consistently use is the facewash. The green tea moisturizer is nice but I am not willing to pay full price for it when I can get a drugstore moisturizer for half the price and works just as well! Also the blemish spot treatment is pretty good, not amazing but I can tell some difference the day after I apply it.   One product I really didn&#x27;t care for was the clarifying mask, it&#x27;s great for spot treatment but I think a lot of people get confused thinking it&#x27;s an all over mask (which perhaps for some that is great) I tried that and it made my skin feel extremely tight and itchy. I use it occasionally if I have a blemish that won&#x27;t go away but otherwise don&#x27;t recommend it.  I think like others say this product is hit and miss, I have friends who love it and others who want to love it but it just didn&#x27;t work for them!  I&#x27;d give it a try if you can get a 30 day trial (for like $10 or something).   (I switch facewash once and a while and so I usually go long enough between using it that they send me a letter for a thirty day trial for $10 which is perfect since I really don&#x27;t like paying $40 every time I need more)</li>
    <li> A great deal on an awesome product.  I will definitely shop Proactiv this way in the future.  Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I had never had a problem with acne until my late 20&#x27;s when I started getting a lot more breakouts.  It was enough to become frustrated with and my normal face wash was not fighting the breakouts.  I wanted to do something about it and decided to try Proactive.  Our local mall has a Proactive machine where you can purchase the 3-step or individual bottles (thus making life easier and not having to go through their website).  It has worked wonders and I have not had any of the problems that people have reported.  It makes my skin feel great and it keeps pimples from appearing.  AGAIN, I was not suffering from severe acne, but for those problem breakouts, it works great.</li>
    <li> beware when ordering this product.  They fail to tell you when you order 1 shipment that you are automatically subscribed to receive 3 orders of it.  The second order cost me $39.80!!! I had to call and DEMAND that not future orders be charged to my credit card.</li>
    <li> I first bought Proactive because my cousin had recommended it for me. I had had acne for years. Before I went on Proactive my breakouts were very frequent and usually under skin and very painful. I started trying Proactive and the first week it started to get a little better but then my skin started to dry out very badly. I could tell that Proactive stared to not work and I actually think it made my skin worse. I went to a dermatologist and she said the Proactive has the same amount of benzoyl peroxide,which is what helps clear acne, than any product you can buy in the store. It just cost twice as much. Since my skin has gotten so bad my dermatologist is putting me on Accutane which is one of the most powerful drugs for acne treatment. I have scars all over my face and craters and I do think Proactive helped it get so bad. I think that if you do decide to do it but it stops working like it did for me go see a dermatologist immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30-something female with the acne issues of a teenager and nothing over the counter seemed to work. After seeing the commercials and testimonials I decided to try it. The starter kit arrived pretty quickly and I was thrilled with the results! I had some very stubborn pimples that vanished in a little more than a week and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier! The regular kit arrived about 30 days later and the great results I had experienced faded pretty fast. I started waking up with a film of oil on my face every morning and my acne seemed to be getting worse! I thought that leaving out Step 3 may solve the problem but I still kept having the same issue. I changed my pillowcase everyday thinking that maybe the detergent I used was causing a reaction of some kind and that didn&#x27;t work either. I eventually cancelled my membership because I didn&#x27;t see the point in spending $70 every 3 months for a product that didn&#x27;t work for me. I will say though that the Refining Mask that came in the starter kit is absolutely awesome! That is the one product that has not left me disappointed.  After I cancelled my membership, I happened to be online and found a website for consumer complaints. There was an over-abundance of people that had multiple issues in regards to cancelling their accounts. I&#x27;ve made sure to thoroughly check my credit card statement each month and thus far I&#x27;ve had no unauthorized charges.</li>
    <li> I first ordered proactive back in September, I have used it twice a day for the past two months and I have not noticed a difference. My skin still breaks out and it is not worth the money I spent. With all that being said I called to cancel my membership, and they tried to get me to stay and once they realized they couldn&#x27;t they said that was fine they would refund me my money within 4-6 weeks. I told them there was no reason it should take that long since it didn&#x27;t take them that long to charge my card. After she said that was their process I said \\&quot;If you do not refund my money immediately I will call the better business bureau and let them handle it\\&quot; Cha-Ching!!! The next thing she said was, okay we can get that refund processed today and it will show up within 3-5 business days, a lot better than 4-6 weeks. I also demanded that they send me a confirmation that they are processing my refund today to my e-mail account and a hard copy in the mail. She had to transfer me to a supervisor, but it got done! So any of you that are having this problem here you go, it&#x27;s amazing what you get accomplished when you threaten to sick the better business bureau on people lol.</li>
    <li> PROACTIV IS A TOTAL SCAM!!! It does not work. Do not buy it from the company directly because the will continue to bill your credit card even after you cancel their useless product. They are not honest or straight forward about the cost and they will trick you into signing up for a membership with recurring fees. This</li>
    <li> My son has been using Stridex and it wasn&#x27;t working like we hoped.  My hairstylist suggested Proactiv.  We have already noticed a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Everyones skin is different and for my skin, this didnt do the trick. I gave it two stars because it doesnt dry out your skin like the others and the mask that comes with it takes away the redness of a pimple, nothing more nothing less.</li>
    <li> I was using Proactiv for almost 3 months...but the end of the 2nd month my skin was so dry it would just flake off...but since I seen such a good improvement I kept with it.  Well having dry skin clogged my pores more, so it eventually started breaking me out, so I stopped using it and switched to something less harsh, but now my acne is getting worse again. Im not sure if I will start Proactiv up again or not.  When I went to cancel the order, since I have 2 back up supplies since I only used it 1 time day--they gave me a huge hassle, so I eventually just went online to e-mail them and cancel it that way.  We will see what happens after I try this new system.  Im 21, and have had acne since 13, and its getting worse each year. Im white with fair semi-sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> So, after not listening to the words of wisdom from my fellow amazon shoppers... I bought into the Proactiv story and system.  I have never been so disappointed in a product.  Proactiv ruined my skin and the cleanser was way to harsh for daily use.  I have tried to cancel my account twice since August, but just received another bill on Friday.  I really don&#x27;t even know what to do at this point besides call the BBB on Monday.  What a hot mess!  Please don&#x27;t buy into this scam!  Use Aveeno!!!</li>
    <li> Worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I bought the product for my teenage son, it didn&#x27;t work, we returned the product. We have not ever received the \\&quot;gauranteed refund\\&quot; that they promise. And I&#x27;m still being billed after months (over 8 months) of trying to cut ties with this company. Worst customer service I have ever seen. Product is terrible and the company is too.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time like expected. Thank you for the great service. I could not be any happier with the service that was given.The product works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> This product works alright, but the worst thing is that you become attached to their automatically sign up system and they keep sending you more and more product. And after the first product you receive, the second box and so on are $100 worth of product! It is a rip off! AGAIN DO NOT BUY PROACTIV PRODUCTS. Also the customer service is very bad! I was able to cancel my ¨subscription¨that they did over the phone, but it took a long time! It´s much better to go buy one of those acne products they sell at walmart, and it is going to work as good as proactiv and if not better, plus without the annoying subscriptions and automatically sign ups..</li>
    <li> Pro: As a teenager I had moderate acne, nothing too severe but enough to make me self conscious about it. I tried many of the store bought products and they seemed to have absolutely no effect on my skin. I saw all of the advertisements for proactiv and was impressed something that looked so promising was so affordable. I followed the directions and after a solid month my skin was completely acne free! It was such a relief! Proactiv does work, and it&#x27;s worth it if you have the money to spend on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I wouldn&#x27;t consider my skin to be uber sensitive, but every time I applied the 3 step process it made my skin burn as if it was on fire for at least 5 -10 minutes after. It dried out my skin to the point their \\&quot;daily moisturizer\\&quot; couldn&#x27;t even keep up with it. After a month of use my skin basically became immune to the product and stopped working for me. My biggest issue with this product is their sketchy tactics, when you order their first shipment of product they fail to mention (although it is in the fine print that hardly anyone reads) they put you on a automatic refill list and your next shipment is over 100$! I was very upset with this and it is next to impossible to get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Proactiv is a good product, but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to be on the cautious side.</li>
    <li> - Works for 13 yr child; you should see positive change within a week.  If acne reacts badly, try only once a day at bedtime.  - Expensive since you really pay for the commercials and a known brand name and have to order by phone/online.  - Simple and easy to use, rinses clean.  Need cotton pads to apply.  - Other brands available that may be effective for you. Currently trying AcneFree kit since other customers report  similar results and it&#x27;s cheaper and available at drugstores or on Amazon.com.  - Go to acne dot org website and enter \\&quot;acne\\&quot; to read about other recommended acne treatment products with same or similar ingredients.  Visit acne dot org website to educate yourself about acne and the ingredients to combat it.  There&#x27;s also a product line made by [...] that people seem to like and maybe more cost-effective.</li>
    <li> This product is very expensive.  Own any colored shirts, towels, sheets?  If you do you better not buy this stuff.  It bleached out all the collars of my shirts, left bleach marks on my towels  and pillowcases.  Anything that touches your face may bleach out.  If it does that to fabric what will it do to your face.  This product didn&#x27;t work and ruined other stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is advertised on television as \\&quot;clearing skin.\\&quot; It does not do that and here&#x27;s why. I&#x27;ve got scars on my face, as I&#x27;m sure many others who have suffered with or continue to suffer from acne. These scars come in various depths and also in two different colors (pink and purple). So proactiv does not clear skin. There are also other reasons that pull the effectiveness of this product down, but I&#x27;ll talk about that after I explain why I gave it two stars instead of going for only one. What proactiv does fairly well is that it generally prevents pimples from forming and that is ONLY if you use this product every day. That being said, I bought the \\&quot;two month supply\\&quot; and there is no way the amount advertised as a two month supply is supposed to last that amount of time. I get about a months worth with thiose small bottles. Maybe I&#x27;m applying too much of each suppliment but then again maybe they exaggerate their claims (not a first for any corporation). Another downside is that it seems when somebody takes a few days off of this product, that the pimples come back even larger, which means more pain and also a possible scar.    One last note: it&#x27;s $50 for a \\&quot;two month supply,\\&quot; that&#x27;s $300 a year!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color and often feel like products like these aren&#x27;t able to work for me (oily/combination skin). I recently changed birth control pills, which brought back my horrible teenage acne, which can possibly be attributed to a change in hormones. My teen acne was treated with Retin-A, which didn&#x27;t produce good results even after months of use.  I also have extremely sensitive skin and can only use certain soaps or body washes... Using new things with fragrances has caused chemical burns, rashes, itchiness, breakouts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after trying several drugstore washes, creams and scrubs, I decided to try Proactive as a last resort. My sister&#x27;s friend kept recommending it to me, and I was afraid it would tear up my face. Thankfully, there&#x27;s a machine in my local mall that sells the product in different sizes/packages without signing you up for a subscription. I recently picked up the 30 day trial and didn&#x27;t think it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, and my aggressive (possibly cystic) acne has cleared up, except for a few spots. I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is starting to look really nice, and blemishes are starting to heal. I am surprisingly pleased with this, even though I didn&#x27;t think it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just using the 3 step kit, morning and night. It came with the mask, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet. A warning though, this stuff WILL make your acne worse before it gets better (which I assume is the product clearing all the existing gunk out of your skin). The first few days had me livid because I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but stick with it at least a few weeks. The scrub burns a bit at first, and it is drying, but you can use a moisturizer with sunscreen after applying the step 3 product - just make sure the step 3 lotion sets/dries first.. My nose used to peel excessively, and now it&#x27;s not as bad, so for me, that&#x27;s an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps some people, especially other apprehensive WoC contemplating a purchase of this product. If you have a  Proactiv vending machine in your mall that sells it, the price is slightly higher than the TV ads, but you have the added benefit of getting it immediately without shipping costs, and not being roped into the subscription.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase. The products were as listed and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 16 year old daughter who had persistent acne despite a very healthy diet, excellent hygiene, excercise etc.  The product had 0 effect. I do not recoomend this for anyone, There are much more effective alternatives such as Retin A.</li>
    <li> I used the same skin care routine for years, but I noticed I was starting to break out a little more. Proactiv was doing a free shipping promotion, so I decided to try it and see if it worked for me. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER! Within a month of using it, I was breaking out more and more with acne like I&#x27;ve never had, even when I was a teenager. As the bottle and some reviews suggested, I used it the full sixty days to see if it was just an initial reaction. It wasn&#x27;t.. by the time I reached 60 days it had gotten so bad that I had to go to a dermatologist and even she was alarmed by it. I got on a prescription routine and it&#x27;s reversing slowly now. Very slowly... I would not recommend Proactiv to anyone, ever. Just go see a doctor, don&#x27;t take the chance unless they recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re reading this review, it means that you do internet research, so you&#x27;re already partway there.  Proactiv is OK if you don&#x27;t want to do the research, but really there&#x27;s a lot of literature about skin care on the internet if you care to search for it, and you can do it for way cheaper.  Some good places to start:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] (he talks about benzoyl peroxide, which is the active ingredient in the Proactiv wash)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for 5 months now, so I&#x27;ve given it ample time to help my face, and it hasn&#x27;t. All it has done is dry my skin out, and more recently, cause my skin to itch as if I am having an allergic reaction, and bleach my towels.  It seemed like it may have helped a little here and there over the past 5 months, but never really enough to notice a major difference. I do not have severe acne, only casual breakouts in certain areas on my face. I am in my mid-twenties and have never had a problem with acne until the past couple of years. With all the celebrity endorsements I figured this had to work, but unfortunaley, no.   At the advice of a co-worker, the next thing I am going to try is the Oil of Olay Pro-X system. We will see if that works. According to her, Proactiv did not work for her either, but the Oil of Olay did.</li>
    <li> Proactiv has been the only acne set that has given me actual results. I have moderate acne and due to the abnormally more dry than usual weather currently, my skin never looked worse. I hated going outside without makeup on and the amount of makeup I had to put it on made me feel like I was wearing a mask; which only aggravated my skin more. I used to use proactiv back in high school and for some reason I strayed away from it; trying unsuccessfully to find something more \\&quot;high end\\&quot; but decided to try once again but this time I avoided the actual ordeal of the company by ordering from amazon. TRUST ME! Go to the kiosk or order online you DON&#x27;T want to deal with them!  Anyway, on to the ACTUAL product review! It&#x27;s been only a week and my skin has significantly cleared up and my friend even told me the other day my skin looked great! I kinda knew it would work since I&#x27;ve used proactiv before. The key with proactiv to really work is the amount of the lotion you use. The amount I use is A LOT! Although the instructions tell you to put a thin layer, this isn&#x27;t enough for me. Because the lotion is only 2.5% benzoyl peroxide it will not be irritating. I use enough to cover my entire index finger; with a generous amount at that! I allow my skin to absorb this afterwards for about 5-10 minutes. If your skin is properly clean, it should absorb pretty quickly! I then, using clean hands, apply another moisturizer. I use Cerave PM. ALSO, I used proactiv with conjunction with antibiotics prescribed from my doctor. This prevented me from getting any real large \\&quot;purge\\&quot; in the beginning. They were very cheap and only temporary until I can effectively control my acne.   I&#x27;m seeing a lot of reviews where people say \\&quot;it stops working\\&quot;. I think these people just need to increase the dosage of the lotion they are using; they are not using enough. And when they call the customer service and get the \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; proactiv, they are just aggravating their skin even more! Studies show 2.5% BP isjust as effective as stronger % of BP and less irritating. You can&#x27;t get \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to BP!   HOWEVER, it is expensive to use this set. Using the lotion properly, you will run out quickly! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this product only 4 stars, because they don&#x27;t give you enough lotion to really use this product effectively. I will probably go on to buy 2.5% gel BP and use that instead once I run out and hopefully it will be just as effective.   I find the toner to be an amazing and gentle exfoliant. It contains glycolic acid which is a light exfoliant that will better increase the absorption of the lotion. I believe you can do without the cleanser but I use it but very gently as you don&#x27;t want to irritate your skin even more! Girls remember that you need to wash your face before to remove all traces of face makeup as I find the cleanser highly ineffective in removing makeup :/</li>
    <li> DO NOT GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD TO PROACTIVE!!!  I have called numerous times to try to stop the automatic monthly purchases they set up EVEN THOUGH I ASKED THEM SPECIFICALLY TO NOT SEND ME ANY MORE PRODUCT AFTER MY INITIAL ORDER--TWICE!!!!  They continue to charge my account number, (which, incidentally, can&#x27;t be deleted off of my account page) and send me product as they see fit.  Today they charged my account $27, and when I called to get the charges reversed they told me a second charge of $67 would also be showing up on my account due to a \\&quot;computer error\\&quot;.  I have called to speak to representatives 6 or 7 times and still can not get them to close my account. All this after I called, months ago, to make sure this never happened.  I AM AT THIER MERCY NOW--PROACTIVE KEEPS CHARGING MY ACCOUNT AND THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO STOP THEM!!!!</li>
    <li> Proactiv people are total SCAM ARTISTS... somehow I ended up paying OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS for FACE WASH that doesn&#x27;t even work! Give me a break! THEY ARE HORRIBLE just trying to rip people off by sending more and more product you DON&#x27;T need.</li>
    <li> I love this and I use it every day. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The products, used exactly as directed did not improve my daughters mild acne.  This company preys on the emotions of vulnerable teens.  Do not fall for it</li>
    <li> This is such a waste of money.  My daughter who is 16 had mild acne and nothing over the counter would work.  I went ahead and purchased this product from the proactiv website.  She began using it and I started to notice her acne got worse.  I called in after 30 days to cancel and I was told they will instead send me a stronger one that would help her.  We received it and after about 3 weeks my daughter had a face full of acne where we initially started with acne just on her forehead and random ones on her nose.  Its horrible she now has so many scars where she never did.  What a waste of money, I hate this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 and dealing with constant breakouts.  I tried Proactiv because I needed to try something new.  It has cleared my face BUT now I have tons of blackheads.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Proactiv completely dried my face out. I followed the directions and within a week my whole face was peeling...it took weeks of moisturizing to get my skin back to normal. It was awful. It also bleached the towels that I&#x27;d dry my face with. It is way too harsh on your skin and the fact that it bleaches fabrics says a lot. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - I know I never will again.</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactive a couple of years ago, and it just wasn&#x27;t the most effective. It actually left my face feeling oily and did not help acne. It also hurt to use such an exfoliating product twice a day on my face, and burned my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I closed the credit card tied to the automatic shipments, and I also happened to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year had gone by without receiving proactiv, and then I received a shipment at my new address- not sure how they tracked me down!  They also started sending me bills. They got more threatening- \\&quot;We sent you our product and you have not paid!\\&quot; and it may have gone on to a collections company. I made the mistake of giving them a credit card number as payment when I sent it back in because, lo and behold- they put me back an automatic shipments/payment. I never authorized this! I was upset and contacted them to cancel. At that point, unfortunately, the NEXT shipment had gone out already, so I would have to mail that back if I wanted my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine MY irritation when the NEXT month, I receive more proactiv and the money is deducted from my account again. The man I spoke to when I called was very rude in explaining that I had to pay for the product I had ordered. He could not answer to why a year would go by after my effectively canceling my subscription by closing the credit card, only to magically and creepily appear again at a new address. He told me I was responsible for the payments, so asked to speak to someone else, who cancelled the payment, no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so shocked at everything they did! Horrible, horrible, horrible. Other people seem to have this same issue. Even if the product was effective, you don&#x27;t want to deal with such a sleazy company.</li>
    <li> It was my mom&#x27;s idea that I try out Proactiv, because we&#x27;ve been seeing many commercials about ow \\&quot;great\\&quot; it is, and how well it works, but the truth is, IT DOESNT! The first 3 weeks or so, it made my skin ridiculously red, dry, and flaky on my cheek and jaw area. Im still using it right now, and I still get zits (and since I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv, I&#x27;ve been getting painfull underground zits that take AGES to go away!!!) DO NOT BUY THIS! After I use up my Proactiv, Im thinking about using the acne kit from [...]. It has great reviews, and looks great!</li>
    <li> I used this product off and on just about every year for a few months each time until I finally came to my senses. The first few months it did in fact get rid of my pimples and did leave my face feeling cleaner, smoother and softer. However, consistently over the years after about 5 months of using this product every day, I would then get some very deep and painful cystic acne. These cystic boils I got after 5 months of proactive were usually some of the largest I&#x27;ve ever had. And the hyper-pigmentation redness left over took typically over a year or two to go away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read up about how these Benzoyl peroxide treatments ruin the ph balance of your skin and once your skin gets used to it, the bacteria just buries itself deeper into the surface where the BP can&#x27;t reach it, causing deep cystic pimples/boils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of different non-BP acne skin care systems. None of them get rid of the acne quite as fast as proactive but the benefits are more or less permanent as long as you maintain a healthy skin care regimen. The product that seems to have worked for me best is a new brand called Suki. I got it at my local health store. The stuff works and its natural, and its also available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the scarring and red marks that are leftover from previous acne cysts I have recently purchased a derma roller with over 200 tiny 0.5mm threaded pieces coming off of it that penetrate the skin forcing your body to create more collagen to heal those minut spots (in turn giving you smoother, younger looking skin). Google it and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about. I bought my derma roller off of ebay for about $20 bucks. I also plan on using bio oil (purchased from amazon for about 10 bucks)in tangent with the derma roller. Will post an update on results when I get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my advice, do not get your skin into that never ending cycle that typically comes when using products with BP. Once you start doing that it will be hard to get back to a normal PH and in the end your skin will suffer. I&#x27;ve been down this road many many times, trust me.al PH and in the end your skin will suffer. I&#x27;ve been down this road many many times, trust me.</li>
    <li> Thought this product would be good until it gave me massive nose bleeds. I will never again buy Proactive it is very harsh on the body, and drys out the skin!!! I threw mine away !!! Plus proactive kept billing me every month after I canceled and didn&#x27;t send me the product just billed me for it!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I was 15 years old, now 27,  when I had terrible acne.  I will admit, the first few years my skin was FLAWLESS.  It was the first time in my life that my skin looked so good I didn&#x27;t even need to wear makeup.  I guess my skin did get used to it after awhile and sometimes I will get a small pimple or two but NOTHING like the acne I used to have.  If you use this product every day and night you should rarely have any pimples.  After 12 years I have tried other acne systems (just trying to find something a little cheaper) but NOTHING compares!  This company better stay in business forever b/c i never plan on stopping.  My skin is always soft and clean feeling.  I don&#x27;t know where my skin would be if it weren&#x27;t for this product!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Heard a lot about this product from friends and on internet. However, my personal experience with this product was not good. couple of days into application of this product on face, brought on red rashes on my forehead and chin. I stopped application and within 2 days, everything was back to normal. I decided to return this and amazon \\&quot;as usual\\&quot; provided no problems in returning this product.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of this product. After I got it, I had it for about 3 weeks but never used it because I found a better product. After about 3 weeks, I sent it back asking for a refund. I called about a month later because my refund still hadn&#x27;t come and they told me that because it was over a certain amount of time I couldn&#x27;t return. I preceded to ask them if they could please send the product back then and they said no. In the end I paid $30 for my product which I never ended up using nor having and never got any money back. I am very disappointed in Proactiv and will never purchase anything of there&#x27;s again.</li>
    <li> I have used Proactiv off and on for MANY (12+) years. In the past I would use it for a few weeks, then my skin would become very dry and peel. Then a someone told me that I have to use a moistureizer on top of it. I thought, for a long time, that the repairing lotion was to work as a moisturizer also. This was not true. Since then I have had NO problems what so ever. I use it once a day, at night, and rinse my face with cold water in the morning. Using it once a day stretches the product from a 2 month supply to a 4 month. I swear by it amd recomend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is not a review of the product itself, because plenty of people have their own opinions about that, but rather of the transaction. !!DO NOT!! buy Proactiv from proactiv.com, as they will enroll you in a pyramid-scheme type affair that charges you every month and keeps sending you more bottles of Proactiv and other products regardless of whether you need them or not, and it is very hard to get out of. It was recommended to me that I buy mine on Amazon, and that is exactly what I did and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is worse, being left on hold for about half an hour last week by their customer support hotline and eventually giving up!  Or having the line answer by some incompetent yo-yo giving you the third degree (\\&quot;Why did you order it if you were going to decide to return it!\\&quot;)  You will feel you are caught in some nightmare where Alice in Wonderland meets Kafka.    Another great line: \\&quot;If you don&#x27;t like our product, we can send it to you every six months instead of every month.  That will be better, won&#x27;t it?\\&quot;    Stick with products from your local drugstore, that understand how to treat customers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she has expressed great happiness at it&#x27;s effectiveness. Although the bottles were much smaller than I had expected (based upon the ads on TV) they seem to be meeting their expectation.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this, you will continue to receive this product and they will keep billing you.  When I called to cancel, was told I would only get $20 back if I returned it, so I didn&#x27;t.  They didn&#x27;t tell me that if I kept it they would continue to bill me for it for a total of $101!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give zero stars if I could</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work needed Dr. care.</li>
    <li> Good product, recommend</li>
    <li> Bought it for my teenage grandchildren.</li>
    <li> I decided to give Proactive a try a few months ago, since I was starting to get some acne spots on my skin because I had stopped taking birth control pills (my husband and I were trying to conceive) and my hormones were still adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;I called to order the product for $29.95 and figured it was worth the try, and even payed extra for 2 day shipping since I was so excited to start using it. A week later I still hadn&#x27;t received my order, so I called back to figure out what had happened and was told they were \\&quot;out of stock and it would be another week to 2 weeks before the product could be shipped to me\\&quot; It was pretty updating to have to call back AFTER I had placed the order and payed extra for the 2 day shipping, when they could have just told me over the phone the first time I called that they were out of stock.&lt;br /&gt;Around 10 days later I finally received the product and proceeded to use it according to the instructions for about 2 weeks. Unfortunately it not only didn&#x27;t work for me, but it made my skin worse! It became overly dry and started to peel around my nose and forehead, and when I would try to sooth it w/ some moisturizer I would get even more breakouts in the area. TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop using it, since it was clear that it wasn&#x27;t helping me at all, and went to the dermatologist, who examed me and prescribed me a fantatic facewash and mask which not only got rid of my acne but didn&#x27;t overdry my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months later I received another box of proactive products, but didn&#x27;t think much of it, since I figure it was samples and fliers and just put it aside. Another few weeks went by and while checking my bank account I realized that I was being charged $29.95 EVERY month as a reoccurring card payment from them! I called them right away and they customer service person on the phone was extremely rude, telling me that I was told when I first ordered that I would be billed every month and receive a 90 day supply untilI decided to cancel. I told her that I absolutely wasnt told that, since it&#x27;s the kind of information one would remember and consider before making a purchase. She them proceeded to tell me I could cancel now, but still had to pay for next month&#x27;s bill! WHAT A JOKE!!! I had to bargain w/ her to return the second box I had received, since it was unopened, and they would re-emburse me for this month minus the cost of shipping which I would have to cover.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of this company!!! They are set up to take your money and will do so w/ or without your concent. They have poor customer service and on top of it their products don&#x27;t necessarily work, it&#x27;s a one size fits all and might work for a few but definitely not for most people.&lt;br /&gt;My advise would be, take your money and go to a dermatologist. They will prescribe you something specific for YOUR skin and you will get much better service and results. Believe me!</li>
    <li> I had always wanted to give Proactive a try. There seems to be a lot of hype surrounding this product so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I had a problem with acne on and off for years. I thought it would be a thing of the past when I became an adult but I guess not. I read reviews of several people who saw outstanding results when they combined the Proactiv system with an acne pill called Clearzine. So I decided to do the same. I did not expect this stuff to work so well in a month&#x27;s time, much less the 10 days it took to completely wipe out my acne. I am so impressed with this combo and my face hasn&#x27;t looked this clear in years. If you want your skin clear fast, these two seem to be a winning combination. I would highly recommend them. It&#x27;s been two months since and I haven&#x27;t had another breakout.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son and he used it with no noticeable benefit.&lt;br /&gt;Then they automatically ship another lot 60 days later.&lt;br /&gt;Their whole customer service system is set up for Americans so trying to contact them is a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;Once I eventually got through their automated defense system, I had to explain to them that their website promises refund of shipping and handling if returned in 15 days. It took much frustration and elevation to a service manager to get my money credited back and agreement not to bill for shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> Acne is complicated and varies from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;While this product may not work for some, it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 16 (I am now 22) and I tried Proactiv when I was 19 on and off. Sometimes, it would work, sometimes my acne is very stubborn and Proactiv wasn&#x27;t very effective. BUT it worked the majority of the time, so it is worth buying and trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it makes my skin a little sensitive and doesn&#x27;t keep acne off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I am into more natural products such as [[ASIN:B0056B0XI2 Pura d&#x27;or Organic Acne Treatment Solution (2 fl. oz.)]] and I found it to be just as effective without the added sensitivity...and because it is all organic and natural, I can use it everyday safely to keep the acne from coming back. Again it may not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> I am 14 years old and a freshman in high school. About three weeks ago, I purchased Proactiv at a mall kiosk because my acne got to the point where my face hurt to touch it. I had my doubts; the infomercials looked a bit fake, but I had friends who had used the products and it worked for them, so I was willing to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the Proactiv Three Piece System worked for me. They included the Refining Mask as well, and within two weeks my acne had mostly cleared up. Yes, I still have some pimples on my forehead, but I didn&#x27;t expect any miracles. It is progressively getting better. However, it did take time. If you order the product, you HAVE TO FOLLOW THE ROUTINE. I was reading reviews along the lines of \\&quot;I got it and was using the first and third step once a day.\\&quot; Do not do this. They give you very clear instructions for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that people should know is that the results do vary. If you have very sensitive skin, they have a solution for that over the phone. However, I don&#x27;t recommend getting it over the phone unless you need the sensitive or extra strength- they tend to charge you every month. That being said, I also recommend that you get the Proactiv at your local mall rather than online or over the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it will dry your skin, but most acne products do. If people stick to the review and moisturize their skin, it will look fine. If anything, buy the one month supply. It&#x27;s $20 and it&#x27;s worth a try. For all you know your skin could clear up as well as mine.</li>
    <li> Proactiv was ordered by myself last summer to treat some acne problems I was having.....little did i realize that it would completely ruin all of my sheets and pillow cases/blankets due to the bleach stains that I noticed within the first 2 days of using this treatment.  There are white bleach marks on all of my pillow cases and any other blankets or sheets that I had on my bed due to the treatment.  Not only did it completely dry out my skin as well, proactiv worked for a week and then stopped working altogether.  This is a terrible product and my friends who have used it experienced the same thing, bleaching sheets and beyond healthy dry skin after using this product.  DO not use! I suggest nutrogena instead. Having been using their face-wash from the pharmacy (on shelf) since this terrible situation with proactive and its not only cheaper, but it works amazing. Skin is never dry and there is ONE step! it is amazing!</li>
    <li> So far I used it for three weeks, and I can feel a lot of difference in my face, which is actualy a two month package, hope by the time of two months all dark mark will dis appear. Its very good product</li>
    <li> I had pretty bad acne in high school, so I was really excited to try the new Proactive skin solution with only 5% of people not getting results. Well, I guess I made it to that 5%. I found it did not help me AT ALL. My skin didn&#x27;t clear up, and I made sure to follow the directions exactly. In fact, my dermatologist doesn&#x27;t recommend it at all. I became much better off using prescripton-strength creams that my doctor recommended.     Oh, and when I called Proactive to request a refund, they gave me a good 15-minute speech (including putting me on the phone with her supervisor for further influencing) on why to keep with it. A complete pain and a bit awkward to turn them down after all that. That is probably why they&#x27;re disapproval rate is only 5% - they harass you in order to deter you from the refund!</li>
    <li> I used this product for three days and after a shave my face was burning like crazy. My face turned really red and unsightly. Three days later the burning is almost gone, but my skin is pealing off, is really dry, and looks awful. I don&#x27;t dare to use this product again and have gone back to my Costco bought body lotion which works ten times better. Proactive might work as a last resort for people with really greasy and pimple prone skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else. Think of it as pure medicine, chemicals meant to peal your skin off. Thumbs down from me. Their customer support really sucks too so I am sending my box back.</li>
    <li> This does NOT work for me,&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely mad because i started with not that much acne and i think my acne got WORSE using this. I am really really sad and mad because now i feel that i have SO MUCH that i have to go visit a dermatologist! WORST ACNE PRODUCT EVER!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product on TV and wanted to give it a try without having to commit to a automatic delivery. I have moderate acne. Within a few days it was cleared up. I would recommend this product to anyone who has ance.</li>
    <li> I have always had awful breakouts. I have seriously tried everything out there and nothing worked for me. I have been using Proactiv for over 5 years and I love it. It has been the only product that has given me clear skin after many, many years of break outs. Thinking I would never have nice  skin.  My only issue is with the proactiv company. I have had issues with their billing from day one. They have charged my card and then not sent product. And trying to straighten it out many, many times has been a nightmare. Then I was getting the kits at a proactiv kiosk in the mall and their products are much smaller than what they send you in the mail. And for about the same price or more. So Proactive is an excellent product. Just order it from Amazon and not the proactiv company.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was a better value from the online website. The product is great for combination and oily skin.  This is a two months supply for one person.</li>
    <li> i tried proactiv for the blackhead gel but the system amde my skin so dry i discontinue using the whole set.worse, i noticed another $29.30 debit in the same card i used to purchase the first one without making additional order so i called and cancelled but the agent said it has been shipped!i am returning the package and will have my credit card refunded.make sure u understand that this is a continuity product before you buy and they automatically debit your card when they did not even explain it during the first purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  ProActiv is what it is.  A business that will suck the money out of your pockets.  After trying their product for 6 months, there was o improvement besides drying and irritation.  After cancelling your account, ProActiv will harass you with bills and letters.  I have received countless Warning letters about account imbalance and have spent countless hours on the phone with their costumer care resolving the \\&quot;issue\\&quot; over and over for about 6 times.  Getting them to leave your bank account alone is a nightmare, plus the twice monthly reminder in the mail about \\&quot;a new formula\\&quot;.  I am one very displeased, bullied costumer who is trying to keep others from falling into this trap</li>
    <li> If I could put zero stars, I would.  They are cheats and liars--don&#x27;t trust them!  I hated the product on me but their scams made it impossible to return.  Two months later, I&#x27;m still paying for the worthless product!  The product was so harsh.  The only good thing was the rotating brush, but if I thought I would have to pay $90 for it...I would&#x27;ve just got a clairsonic!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TRUST THEM!</li>
    <li> I started using proactive in high school and it always worked well for my mild acne. Recently I decided to look for a new cleanser because 1) Proactiv is expensive 2) I wanted something more natural that doesn&#x27;t bleach my towels! and 3) I wanted to find an all-in-one acne treatment that didn&#x27;t use so many bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying various products and exposing myself to terrible breakouts this past year, I decided to go back to proactive. I guess I&#x27;m willing to deal with a few negatives to have clearer skin. As with any acne treatment-it doesn&#x27;t always work well for everyone (my mom and brother had bad reactions with this product), but at this price I would definitely give it a shot! It&#x27;s SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper on amazon than in the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sidenote: I recently saw on Proactiv&#x27;s website that they don&#x27;t test on animals, which is definitely a plus for me. : )</li>
    <li> Please no one order proactiv! This company is a huge scam. They auto ship boxes of product when you aren&#x27;t even aware that you signed up for auto shipment. They do not stand by their money back gaurantee. Even after you cancel they still continue to charge your credit card for their terrible, overly priced product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Proactiv 5-step acne solution kit this last Friday, 2/3/2012.  The customer service rep stated that I would receive an e-mail w/in 24 hours containing my account and order numbers.  I checked 3-4 times a day following the order placement.  I finally called on Monday afternoon to see what was going on b/c I had yet to receive an e-mail or phone call for that matter.  The customer service rep that I spoke w/ was not able to help me, so I asked for a supervisor.  She stated that order was placed, but hadn&#x27;t been shipped out yet.  I wanted to cancel the transaction and have them refund the charges they ALREADY placed on my card (side note: my account was charged w/in minutes of placing the order, I checked my account online).  The supervisor I spoke w/ Savannah ID:  5448135 was rude; she kept trying to overtalk me while I was explaining the situaion and refused to do anything about it.  I&#x27;ve worked in a call center before &amp; I know all the gimmicks that they teach the phone agents.  I should&#x27;ve known not to do it, but I had hopes of clearing up my adult acne.  I&#x27;m hoping that when I receive this load of crap in the mail that I will receive a refund in a timely manner.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My grandson likes the proactiv cleanser but is not really happy with the moisturizer. It works and if you are diligent in using the product.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. WORKS VERY FAST!</li>
    <li> I recieved the product timely and am satisfied. I was expecting a full size set instead of two trial size sets but the product is fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Proactiv&#x27;s site, and let me warn you-they will try to scam you!  I received my product, and was disappointed first of all by the tiny bottles. Second, the product didn&#x27;t work for me at all, and my skin is not too awful to begin with. And last-here&#x27;s the kicker, when I chose my \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; of vitamins, they neglected to tell me they were signing me up for auto shipments of vitamins from a totally separate company! I received a supply of vitamins that I didn&#x27;t order, and didn&#x27;t know I was being charged for! I had to send them back, and call several times asking for my refund. And they only gave me a partial refund at that!  I had to call back two more times because they said they canceled my order but they didn&#x27;t.  My warning to you-be cautious if you order this from their site!!</li>
    <li> Works if you use it right.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for us but we received the 2nd shipment before we can stop it. We finally have to return it but they still keep sending the bill for it and also they are adding money for the third shipment even we haven&#x27;t received it. Called customer service but no help. They said that they received my returned package past 30 day limit so they will not credit it to my account. Zero star !</li>
    <li> So I have oily skin and my mom had given me proactive to try to get rid of my acne. I didn&#x27;t have a lot of acne but being an athlete and having oily skin caused me to get breakout&#x27;s here and there. All proactive did was make my skin worse, red itchy and even more breakouts. My skin has also a little bit more on the sensitive side. The chemicals in proactive are extremely harsh on your skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it. The best thing to get rid of acne is change your diet, drink lots of water, and keep it simple with the cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a serious case, talk to your dermatologist, they know a lot more than a \\&quot;marketer\\&quot; from proactive does.</li>
    <li> I know this review should be about the product itself, but here is another side to your purchase of Proactive.&lt;br /&gt;Despite unchecking the option for any additional emails, since I&#x27;ve placed order with proactive I am receiving daily anywhere between 5-15 emails with all kinds of offers due to Guthy-Renker SELLING MY EMAIL ADDRESS TO ALL THEIR AFFILIATES. I have been shopping online for years and consider myself pretty good about avoiding spam and junk email.&lt;br /&gt;To experience something like this from well known company as Proactive, I feel disgusted about their low way of conducting business.&lt;br /&gt;I followed up with most emails, opt-out out of their mailing lists, even called 2x proactive themself and was promised to be removed from the mailing list.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointing experience. Please, be aware of this crooked business practice!</li>
    <li> This stuff cleared up my skin extremely well after a few weeks. I will still get a zit on rare occasion but I have totally clear skin now and have been using this product religiously twice daily now for almost a year. I noticed that the product become consistently effective after I&#x27;d been using it for awhile, maybe a month. My face broke out a little after it cleared up from the product at first, but then it cleared up again and stayed clear. Used properly and religiously it can be highly effective. Make sure to let your face dry a bit from the toner before applying the 3rd step benzoyl cream. I had mild to moderate break outs prior to using this product. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This Proactive doesn&#x27;t work at all in my case. The worst is that I found this Procative company tricked me. Proactive claims that with $29.99 you can get one month solution so I placed an order on their website. After that, I got the product but it charged me $39.99. Since there is no order confirmation email, nor order details in their website, I thought I might remembered the price wrong so I paid the bill. After 2 weeks they mailed me another package, and charged me $46.99 and I found I became their member automatically. I called them right away and cancelled my membership, but still paid the bill. Now I found they charged me 2 more times after that with each $29.99. The business style of this company is like a scam. They trick you become a memeber automatically, and they trick you to pay multiple bills with one product and never tell you the real price and how to pay for it. When you want to return, they say that the guarantee period is over which starts from the first day of the first order and when you find their bill it&#x27;s already passed the period. This company is a cheater!!!</li>
    <li> They charged my credit card more often than promised and returning the product was very difficult.  I think they hope you&#x27;ll give up trying and just keep it.  What a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;Even now that I&#x27;ve \\&quot;unsubscribed\\&quot; from their e-mails, I continue to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the hassle and buy products with same active ingredients at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have tried the product and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. This product left me with oily skin, and also was unable to even help clear my skin.  Going directly through the proactiv company is also a horrible mistake. I bought one shipment of the product, and find myself still being charged for it three months later even after I have contacted them THREE times to cancel my order. They did not give clear answers, and are completely unhelpful in any way.</li>
    <li> I have been with proactive for almost 1 year.  I liked the product enough to keep ordering and eventually switched to extra strength.  It seemed to work better than over the counter face washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue isn&#x27;t so much with the product as it is with the customer service.  My shipment were messed up literally every time.  I was constantly on the phone with them trying to resolve issue after issue.  What put me over the edge was a delivery with a wrong item - then the replacement item didnt show up and then the account rep said she would take ownership and call me back.  She never did that and I was still being charged for products that were over a month late.  When I tried to address my issues they kept transferring and passing my call off.  I finally said forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line if you are going to order the same 3 step product every couple of months you might be okay.  But if you want different things it will get old quickly.  Oh and their system &amp;#34;takes 72 hours to update&amp;#34;. This meaning if you try to avoid calling by using their online service but want a last minute change in your order you will not get the products you want.  It was TERRIBLE!</li>
    <li> This was honestly the ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! This was the first time I have ever bought any type of treatment. I don&#x27;t have horrible acne just a few pimples and some blackheads here and there. For my birthday I got the 3-step system from a friend because she knew I wanted to try it. I started 3 days ago and I was super excited to have clear skin. WRONG! My had a bad reaction to it and is now itchy red and dry. It&#x27;s been like this for 2 days now and isn&#x27;t going away. It literally feels like it ate all my skin off. It&#x27;s completely unbearable I had to leave work. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT! I am now not going to be able to enjoy halloween!!! Thanks proactiv for messing up my face !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have some acne on my forehead, I said let&#x27;s try Proactiv product, then I made an order online, after one month exactly acne were over my face, it got worse !!  and i stopped use it. Peace !!&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, I found them charging me automatically for another shipment, as I remembered I didn&#x27;t ask for it !!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to call them to cancel my account, and  I thought it&#x27;s gonna be easy peasy. However, I was almost fighting with the lady on the phone. In the beginning  I was asking her gently THAT I WANT TO CANCEL  she was replying \\&quot; how is your experience with Proactiv\\&quot;!! I explained that it didn&#x27;t work for me, and I didn&#x27;t ask for \\&quot; automatic shipment\\&quot; !! she gave me an address to send back the package I will do it this coming Monday, I will follow them to get my money back.Otherwise, I would create a blog and copy all these reviews about this product, at least to inform others to not be a VICTIM !!</li>
    <li> I tried this product with high hopes for it helping my skin. After using ProActive consistantly for about 6 months my skin kept getting worse and worse. I continued using the product knowing it&#x27;s common sense that helping a skin problem such as mine won&#x27;t happen over night, but the results are just horrific!  Be very careful. After purchasing the product at a booth in the mall for over $100 I definately feel ripped off seeing my acne increase.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and although the website shows the newer version with the orange stripe on the bottles what was shipped were 3 bottles of the old formula... that hasn&#x27;t been sold for over 3 years in no box (no expiration date available from the missing box). Find another more reputable seller.</li>
    <li> Really really pissed of right now.Nothing wrong with product proactive plus or the company itself but I went and ordered the new proactive plus and its been more then 10 days since I got an email that is been shipped just called then to see y I didn&#x27;t receive my product I was told that they will send me a form to fill out which I will get in 10-7 days then send them the form back then I will get my products in another 10-7 days and on top of it whoever put in my order instead of putting the 30 day trial order did the whole 90 days order and then the girl who was talking to me cant say that she was helping becoz she was not helping wouldn&#x27;t let me talk was talking over me couldn&#x27;t let me explain that I was told I would get a 30 day trial not 90 days would not listen and then just hung up on me a \\&quot;customer\\&quot;. That&#x27;s the kind people proactive plus hires who hangs up on their customer when it was their own freaking mistake what a customer service the have, im so pissed right now I of course had to call back and got a nicer gentleman and cancel everything I don&#x27;t ever want any proactive product ever. That&#x27;s stupid girl really needs to find another job or learn how to talk to customers.</li>
    <li> Long story short, after attempting to cancel their product 3 different times, I have now been sent to collections even after returning their product because by the time they processed the return it was after the 30 days. Since canceling, they&#x27;ve tried to charge my credit card 4 different times and each time I&#x27;ve disputed and won. Now I&#x27;ve been sent to collections even though the women on the phone actually said everything was cleared up. On top of all this, the product didn&#x27;t even work. Word of advice......STAY AWAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND SKIP BUYING THIS PRODUCT!!! It is literally THE worst acne solution I have used. I began using the proactive with very little acne and just wanted something to completely clear my face so I decided to use proactive.  It was one of the worst decisions I have ever made.  Not only did it worsen my acne but caused my skin to become dried out and overall look awful! It took me several months and a dermatologist to get back to where I was originally.  Not only that but they completely rip you and charge you an arm and a leg without you even knowing it.  I thought I was paying 33.95 for a product that I was actually paying 100 DOLLARS for! But of course they don&#x27;t tell you this..... Long story short, PLEASE don&#x27;t buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried it, decided it just wasn&#x27;t for me, and am now going through h3ll for it. I was charged for a second shipment without consent or even knowledge it was coming. I cancelled my account the next day and refused that package when it arrived. It has now been over a month with no \\&quot;money back guarantee.\\&quot; Sure, if the money comes ever, they can still say its a guarantee but don&#x27;t count on it. It has been over a month now with no reimbursement for an authorized charge and I have called to inquire why this is, only to be put in an endless loop of avoidance multiple times. When I do get to speak to a competent human among the rest, I am just told to wait longer. This is the worst example of customer service I have ever seen and will do my best effort to insure that that no person I ever have known goes through this darned process. Nothing but another scam.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! I ordered it came in an extremely small package size. (1 month)which did not last! Because I did not want to discontinue,  I purchased in the mall for twice the amount 60.00! So when the purchase finally came their normal size package should last three months so they charge you 3 months!!!!! Does not last 3 months. What a RIPE OFF!!!!!!! Maybe it’s because they are paying all those stars??????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and I&#x27;ve had acne problems since I was 13. I tried almost everything you can think of in drugstores and a couple of different dermatologists. I decided to try Proactiv since I had nothing more to lose than my acne. When I started to use Proactiv, it did help keep my acne calm, but it definitely did not clear it up as well as all the commercials and celebrities say. I cancelled the order after seeing no major improvements after 1 1/2 - 2 years of using it. Wow, are they persistent to keep their customers. It took me awhile to finally cancel the orders and a long speech from the representatives to try other Proactiv products. I mean come on, if the main line of Proactiv that is heavily advertised does not work for me, why would the other stuff work? I got tons of spam mail from them asking for me to come back for about the next 6 months. They aren&#x27;t really a company that cares about their customers&#x27; skin but just their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now finally have completely clear skin and all of my friends and family have noticed a huge improvement. I finally found a great dermatologist that truly cares about my skin and knows what products will work for me. GO TO A REAL DOCTOR, PEOPLE! Acne can be caused by many different reasons and even reasons you wouldn&#x27;t have thought of, especially if it&#x27;s severe acne. Don&#x27;t rely on commercials and doctors you haven&#x27;t met in person to tell you that some product will clear your skin! Yes, doctors are expensive. But ask yourself this...what&#x27;s more important? Finally having clear skin and the confidence to go out without covering your face or spending tons of money on random/useless acne products that may or may not work for you and end up being even more disappointed that your acne didn&#x27;t clear up?</li>
    <li> my  face is very red and i think that i lose my money with that product..... i&#x27;m like red skin indigenous :( its very itchy.... i never gonna use this again.... so sad,, 90 us lose, thats too bad....</li>
    <li> I decided to try ProActive in the beginning of the year, so I ordered a kit. After that first one I noticed that it didnt work, but they sent me a second one without me asking for it about a month later. Not only that, but they took my money from my account without my authorization. About 2 months after, I called to tell them I wanted to cancel &amp; I wanted them to stop sending me kits without my saying so. So the guy I spoke to told me not to worry about the 60 day thing because of my situation &amp; because I didnt know that they automatically did that. I told him I would send the two kits back that day in the post office, and he said I would get a full refund as soon as they received my shipment. I did everything the way he told me to do it when sending it back. I asked him how long before I would see the refund, and he said to check sometime in November. Its the end of November now and I haven&#x27;t received anything back, so I called them only to find out that they wont give me back my refund! If I had known this, I wouldn&#x27;t have gone out of my way to send it back!! I did everything that guy told me to do &amp; paid for shipping it back, and this lady at ProActive even acknowledged over the phone that they got my two kits back but wont give me back my refund !! Now that I know these people are so incompetent... liars, unprofessional, and dont care about what they tell their customers,... I wont refer anyone to them. I will make sure to make them look as bad as I can so that no one has to lose their money the way I did. I had told a couple of friends of mine about it and they were going to order from them. I made sure to send them a text about this problem before they fell into the same hole. Now I&#x27;ve lost almost $200 because of them.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this everynight before bed and it helps her so much and now when people look at her beautiful face they only see her not zits.</li>
    <li> lasts a bit longer than two months I believe, but that&#x27;s because I do not use it twice a day like I&#x27;m supposed to. Only once a day on some occasions.</li>
    <li> It depends on how bad the acne is. My experience was that Proactive reduced acne by 2/3 or more, anything that can do that is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because it did work at first.     My acne problems aren&#x27;t that serious.  This product worked very well for a good month...and then it stopped being effective. For some reason, even though the wash is a scrub it wasn&#x27;t exfoliating properly...and it dried me out. My esthetician said that Proactiv usually works in the beginning for most of her clients...      I remember her telling me once that I didn&#x27;t need a salicylic or Jessner peel.  I figure, well--maybe the Proactiv was too strong for me...because it stripped my face of moisture.    But...the mask is very good. It&#x27;s creamy and cooling. I still go back and forth between the Proactiv mask and the DDF sulfur mask (which is VERY effective).  These days I use the Mint Julep Queen Helene scrub, a face wash from the spa I frequent, witch hazel as an astringent (it&#x27;s non-drying on my face) and pure/unrefined shea butter as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Bought the 3-step system for my son, and we seen his face become really clearer.</li>
    <li> Initially, it cleared up my skin but after a few weeks there was my acne with a vengeance.  It really isn&#x27;t non-irritating because it ripped my skin apart (so much for the \\&quot;spa quality botanicals\\&quot;), so it was really fun having red, irritated skin with acne!  I think it might work for teens or people in their early 20&#x27;s, but not for me (I started breaking out at 23).</li>
    <li> I am 37 years old, and I do not recommend PROACTIV because it caused me wrinkles and dry skin.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that this product I used for many years. When I couldn&#x27;t afford it going to school, to my shock at thirty my face started breaking out again. I started using over-the-counter Cetaphil soap. Changed my life &amp; my skin is much better</li>
    <li> At first, I had no problem with the product itself.  However, after several months of using the product (only once a day, as I tend to have dry skin) my face suddenly broke out in a bright, feverish rash.  I have tried several times to see if this were an isolated event, but it keeps happening.  My problem, however, isn&#x27;t the fact that I paid over $100 for a product that I can&#x27;t even use anymore.  My problem is that I was signed up for the vitamins that promised to help with skin and acne.  They were free with my first purchase.  Apparently they&#x27;re only free for the first set, and unbeknownst to me, they kept sending me these stupid vitamins (that didn&#x27;t work) that cost $100!!! I went on their website to try to unenroll from these vitamins, but there was no place to do so.  I finally called to cancel my entire subscription, was put on hold, told my story to a customer rep, then put on hold AGAIN, and then was told by the automated voice messaging system that all their reps were busy but that I could leave a message and they would call me back. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m getting threatening letters telling me that I owe them for these vitamins that I don&#x27;t want nor need and have no way to unenroll for them.  Finally, I get someone on the phone (after several more tries).  The gentleman told me to send back the vitamins and I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for them.  Dutifully, I sent the vitamins back (I had to pay the shipping cost). Now, I&#x27;m still getting collection letters from them saying that I still owe $100 for vitamins that aren&#x27;t even in my possession!!! I contacted customer service AGAIN, and was told that they never received the vitamins and that I would have to fill out a legal waiver that they would send in the mail.  I feel like I have contracted a parasite: I think I&#x27;m done with the entire ordeal and then, BAM! I get another collection letter. I will NEVER EVER buy anything from Guthy-Renker again. I don&#x27;t care if they come up with a pill that melts fat off and makes me lose my craving for anything with carbohydrates. I&#x27;ll stay fat!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this product a few times, but I always end up itching miserably!  The first time I used it I thought I was having a reaction post-thyroid surgery.  I tried it again, some months later, and the itching reoccurred.  I thought I&#x27;d give it one more try before pitching a full bottle...this time I didn&#x27;t apply to my neck area which seems to itch the worse, and the results were the same.  I hate that I wasted money on this product, but it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> That would be no stars if I could.  The product may work for some but not my wife, her face was far worse after use than before.  So imagine our surprise when her debit card was hit after 3 weeks for another shipment.  NOT requested.  Try calling customer service and they claim that they only got an &#x27;authorization&#x27; for payment.  Tell that to my bank because the money is gone.  Oh and after looking at her account with ProActiv, the item just charged for will not ship for another 7 days.  After several phone calls, and a few hours of hold time, I give up.  Tomorrow I will contact the attorney general and look into the possibility of a class action lawsuit against Proactiv and the parent company Guthy Renker.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister for her birthday and for Christmas she says she loves this stuff its the only thing that really works for her and I can see the difference when she is using it compared to when she runs out !</li>
    <li> For more sensitive skin, proactiv is very drying and in fact resulted in a very uncomfortable rash that lasted for 3-4 days.  Make sure you read the fine print on returns and cancellations.  They advertise a 100% money back guarantee but that is not what they give.  When you call Proactiv to try and cancel your ongoing deliveries and get your money back, they are really horrible. They don&#x27;t listen to you and try, they talk over you, they try and sell you more and do everything possible to avoid following through on their guarantee.  If you can get through that and insist on cancellation, then they only cancel future shipments and only refund what you paid less shipping and handling (almost $9) and you have to pay additional to return it.  Bottom line, by the time you pay shipping and handling both ways, you only end up with a few dollars of refund.  Shame on them!</li>
    <li> For as much as I paid I would of hoped the green tea moisturizer would have been bigger but overall it was great!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, this stuff works great..it made a nice gift for my grandaughter..she has very sensitive skin...she loved this and still uses it.</li>
    <li> fast shipping great cost</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK!!! Don&#x27;t buy into the scam infomercial. I had my son on this for over a year with NO results—just more acne! I finally went to our Family Physician who prescribed Bactrim (antibiotic) and Differin (acne cream). The result—NO ACNE! My sons acne began to disappear within a few months time and he has no acne now. We got real results for a fraction of the cost of Proactiv because everything was covered on our health insurance policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written this review because I am so tired of seeing the lies of the paid actors on the Proactiv infomercial. Guthy-Renker is continuing to get rich scamming people with this product that DOES NOT work.</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactiv forever now. It&#x27;s the best thing I have tried, and it works perfect for my dry/oily skin. I have never had bad acne, but I like to prevent it from happening. This product is worth the money. If you have never tried it I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a teenager I did not have acne, probably due to my habit of washing my face every night with HOT water and IVORY soap, followed by COLD water to close pores and small amount of Ponds cold cream. Try it!</li>
    <li> First time in my life without continual infected sebaceous glands. I &#x27;m so very happy. I use it once a day and am ordering another set as I need more of the green solution.&lt;br /&gt;A very happy ProActive user.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
    <li> I believe using Proactive acne treatment gave me a permanent scar. I&#x27;ve used other products on my acne and this is the only one that seemed to make a scar on this pimple that gave me trouble for a long time. I just kept using the cleanser (the one that dyes your towels and washcloths). I guess I should have taken that as a bad sign. This is a really expensive and harsh chemical to use on your skin. I canceled my Proactive and they would not stop sending me the brochures. I even called to cancel the brochures. Finally, I wrote to them regarding the wash and how it left me scarred and they never got back to me. Fortunately, their mail finally stopped. Unfortunately for me, I have a permanent scar. Do yourself a favor and do not get Proactive,. Instead, see a dermatologist. Mine finally prescribed a lotion that worked for me. You can find cheaper alternatives that work, and once you find that, stick with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know if this stuff works, and at this point I don&#x27;t care.  I am VERY careful to make sure I am not signing up for recurring automatic payments and shipments when I order online, because I&#x27;ve been scammed by other companies like this.  When I called Proactive to cancel it, they said it was already sent, (I doubt it since PayPal just debited my account about 2 minutes ago) and I would have to pay for it, ($66.00) because it is an automatic 3 month order.  I told her I was returning it and cancelling my payment.  &amp;#34; You can do that, but it takes 4 to 6 weeks to get a refund&amp;#34;  REALLY?  In this day and age?  I would never trust a company that has to resort to sleezy tactics to get people to buy their products.  Holding customers hostage in recurring payment hell is no way to run an ethical business.  I will definitely go to Target and buy their product like another reviewer suggested.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered through their website. I&#x27;m posting a review here for people to avoid this product. There&#x27;s nothing spectacular about it. There are other similar or better products such as those you find in Target or Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason though why you should avoid this is that it&#x27;s a SCAM! It is highly overpriced! Plus, you will just be surprised that your account gets charged for Pro-Activ shipments that you weren&#x27;t aware you signed up for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 30-day supply on their website. I was thinking that it was a one-time transaction. But as it turns out, it actually means I get their package every 30-days. I was surprised when after a month I received another package that is much larger. I called them to cancel my future shipments. After a few days, they charged my account again. When I called to ask why, they said it&#x27;s a second payment for the second package that I received. I didn&#x27;t even order a bigger package! And there was no email or any other information that says I will be charged separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is a scam and should be exposed for being one! Avoid their products at all cost!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Don&#x27;t even think of getting it. I have moderate acne and after seeing thousands of infomercials about it I finally decided to get it. WORST DECISION EVER. It does NOT WORK. sure your skin will feel smooth after couple of uses but after a week or so it will be REALLY REALLY DRY.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do anything but gives you a more painful acne than you probably already have.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is a pain and hard to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for two months, and no it does not &amp;#34;get worse before it gets better&amp;#34; it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;GET WORSE AND WORSE AFTER GETTING ANOTHER SHIPMENT THAT YOU DON&#x27;T REALLY NEED BECAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AND IT COST $100.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I first ordered Proactiv about a month ago and chose to receive a free gift -- the Vitaclear supplements. I was satisfied with my first order that cost around 30 dollars, then they sent me another order without my approval. On top of that, they sent me a full order of the vitaclear supplements without my permission as well. These two orders put me at a total loss of approximately $170 -- money that I did not have at the time. Just recently, I was able to pay the last 30 dollars I owed and cancel, but it isn&#x27;t always that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is HELL, every representative has a heavy accent that is near impossible to understand over the phone and when they finally transfer you to the cancellation department, you&#x27;re put on hold for an infinite amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough (after my 5th call) to talk to a reasonable representative without an accent that assured me that my orders would stop being shipped and that my account would be closed, but I hear it&#x27;s not the case for a lot of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TRAP YOURSELF, THERE ARE OTHER MORE AFFORDABLE AND LESS DANGEROUS WAYS TO CLEAR YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND DO NOT VISIT THEIR WEBSITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve recently ordered a kit or are just starting, I suggest you cancel your account as soon as possible before they trap you with payments and shipments that you will not expect.</li>
    <li> Thought it would come in a box with instructions, but just came in a plasitic zip bag.  been using a full week and no difference at all yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving Proactiv a negative review because it is grossly overpriced. I recently found that Target makes a \\&quot;compare to Proactiv\\&quot; product in their \\&quot;Up and Up\\&quot; product line. I was delighted to see this and even more delighted to see that the ingredients are just about identical, except for one tiny (most likely insignificant) ingredient that the Target brand has that Proactiv does not. It works identically to Proactiv (same results for me anyway) and the best part? It was ONLY $11.99 for a 4-oz bottle of the cleanser, 4 oz of the toner and 2 oz of the repair treatment! Same amount that is listed here for 4 times the cost! DON&#x27;T waste your money. GO TO TARGET and get the Up &amp; Up product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost almost $200 in this product.  When I sighed up for a one month supply they automatically sigh you up for three month supply, so I was surprised when I got another package from them a month later.  I tried to return it, but the customer service was a nightmare. They just gave me BS and kept trying to sell more of there product; in the end I just gave up.  After I cancel my account I still got outrageous fees and changes, like some vitamins that they said where a &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34;, but really changed me $88.  So besides costing me hundreds of dollars, this product didn&#x27;t really work.  You could spend way less money on a product that you can buy in a grocery store and it will probably work just as well if not better.  So if you don&#x27;t want to lose a ton of money and you want a product that works, I would stay far away from this one.</li>
    <li> I saw results immediately. I&#x27;m 38 years old, and had terrible acne on the sides of my face. I tried everything. I previously used Pronexin and it did work, but I stopped using it. When I started using it again , it did nothing. With this Proactive, my face is  so smooth and clear.  The only downfall was the repairing treatment made my face really dry. So I ordered the green tea moisturizer and it&#x27;s fine now. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> First, the stuff everyone is saying about never being able to stop buying it is totally true.  I wish I&#x27;d seen this before I tried this crap.  As a product, it&#x27;s okay, but there&#x27;s less expensive stuff at walmart that doesn&#x27;t automatically sign you up for some secret club.  I had no idea I was getting signed up for this.  Customer service was terrible.  NEVER GET THIS CRAP.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> I have used proactiv for many many years.  I love the product.  But I will not be using it anymore.  Proactiv will not let you buy what you want and when you want it.  In order to get the membership price, you have to join the &amp;#34;club.&amp;#34;  Otherwise your prices will be much higher.  Once you join the club, they will send you automatic shipments whether you need it or not.  You are forced to pay shipping to return it or just buy what you don&#x27;t need.  You can put a hold on the shipments so they come less frequent but they won&#x27;t let you do that without an extra phone call.  And you can&#x27;t put it on hold for more than 6 months.  If you don&#x27;t need any, you will have to cancel your membershipAnd they charge your credit card every so often in installments whether you want them to or not.  I would think proactiv would feel confident enough it it&#x27;s product to let people buy it how and when they want to. I like proactiv, but not enough to put up with business policies.  I am switching to something else.</li>
    <li> Not very helpful.  Be sure to read the fine print. I thought I was ordering one 30 day supply for $30.  When a 2nd shipment showed up I was told something about a &amp;#34;continuity&amp;#34; shipment in the terms and conditions.  I cancelled.  No more shipments but yet a 2nd and 3rd charge on my credit card-  apparently the 2nd shipment I received was $60.  Apparently this was also in the &amp;#34;Terms and Conditions&amp;#34;-  total scam!</li>
    <li> This works ok.  It cleared up my skin, but didn&#x27;t end the breakouts entirely.  I am into my 20s and my skin is worse now than when I was a teenager, and I stopped using this and am still on the lookout for a skin-fixer.  One thing is the areas that didn&#x27;t breakout were very polished and exfoliated.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactive since 2005 and it is an excellent product. It literally leaves my face glowing. I use it only once a day, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever suffered from blemishes I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Do you want clear, glowing skin? If so, buy this!</li>
    <li> First of all, order from anyone but Proactiv itself to try the product out. You have to be careful these days because nearly all \\&quot;risk free trials\\&quot; are enrollment programs. So, to TRY the product for real I outright bought a one month supply from that other site.    *It&#x27;s not a bad system really, I like the textures and the toner scent. I even saw some improvement. But not enough to justify being enslaved to the Proactiv line (and prices) for the rest of my days.     *The sizes of the one month supply and the corresponding price seem grossly out of sync to me. I would be willing to spend $30 quarterly tops, but monthly? No.    *It all felt like an exploiting of common sense to me. Wash your face twice a day with nearly anything (for your skin type of course), follow it with any mild toner, and top it off with a thin layer of a salicylic acid or benzoyle peroxide treatment. You can find all that and more at your local Walgreens.    I have found that my best results come from:     1) wash face twice a day - let dry completely  2) use mild toner - let dry completely  3) (morning) pat oil free moisturizer on - let dry completely before applying makeup     (evening) apply acne treatment, let dry completely, pat moisturizer on, let dry completely    Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have had great success with this product! I have never really had a problem with acne until this year. After trying many systems from the store I decided to give this one a try. Proactive is amazing and works quickly. You will love the results jsut like they say you will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing the infomercials for Proactiv since I was 12 or so. I&#x27;m 33 now. One thing that always really bothered me about those ads is that they either don&#x27;t disclose, or bury the fact, that this medication contains benzoyl peroxide. This is a real problem for a lot of people who allergic to that chemical, including me.     I would&#x27;ve thought that Amazon, at least, would list the active ingredients. Guess not.    Apparently there is a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; version of this product that uses salicylic acid instead. But neither product is going to be any different than your Clearasils and Neutrogenas.</li>
    <li> The product works great, but i don&#x27;t like how it bleaches my towels and pillow case. It makes me worry about what i&#x27;m actually putting on my face. So, i just started using it a couple of times a week and it still works great!</li>
    <li> I tried Proactive a few years ago, and it broke me out worse than ever! It did NOT help with my acne at all. After trying it for a few weeks, I went back to using a gentle face wash twice daily and 10% benzyl peroxide gel once daily. These work much better for my acne, not to mention are MUCH cheaper. The clearest skin I ever had was while I was on birth control- loved it! Didn&#x27;t even need the benzyl peroxide during that time in my life!!!</li>
    <li> My son used this product for over 2 years and was not acne free the entire time.  The product bleached towels and pillowcases.  Months later, I am still receiving promotional material in the mail from the company despite the fact that I have made numerous calls to customer service asking to be removed from the mailing list.  The bottom line is, if you want to treat acne, see your doctor.  Chances are, s/he can prescribe something that actually works and is more cost effective.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago, and then tried again this past year. I didn&#x27;t help my skin issues then and still didn&#x27;t help them now. Proactiv was not potent enough to clear the severe acne I suffered from as a teenage, caused redness, hypersensitivity to all elements and other products, and pealing. Luckily I have very oily skin so the dryness most people experience was not as severe for me.    I tried using it again now that I am in my 20s, and no longer under the constant stress of college. I still have blackheads and thought this might be potent enough to help medicate my pores to clear them. I was wrong, whatever the medicated ingredients are in the stuff- it does not measure up to the time true benzoyl peroxide that actually is anti-bacterial. I experienced the same awful side effects I did as a teenager.    There are better products, with more proven ingredients on the market. And with no real anti-aging proven ingredients in the products, no one over the age of 25 should be using this stuff.</li>
    <li> At first glance, it may seem a little expensive, but you are paying for quality. I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to be as good but have had little to no success with them. This is not a miracle treatment that will cure your skin forever as the commercials claim but it certainly does help clear it up and keep your face looking nice. I also use witch hazel on my face with the toner and very seldomly use the third step. I have no idea why some people claim that it dries their face out. I have almost never had that happen. Proactiv is incredibly gentle on your skin. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. There might be something out there that is cheaper and or works better. But so far this is definitely the best product I&#x27;ve used on my face.    CORRECTION, UPDATE!!! (July (2011): I wrote the above a little less than a year ago. And I regret to inform you that even though isn&#x27;t a horrible product, there are some serious flaws. 1)First, my skin is addicted to it. In other words if you skip at all, you break out. I&#x27;ve heard other people say the same thing. This is extremely disconcerting. 2)It has dried out my cheeks which are less oily than the rest of my face particularly on one side and I now have a red spot that I am having trouble getting rid of. 3) It doesn&#x27;t really work anymore. Even before I had to stop using it, I could tell it was less effective. When I did stop, my skin went downhill. Some of the worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had. Some people swear by it, But I&#x27;m going to look for a more \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; route. God know the last thing I need to do is give myself rosacea or addict my skin to a product. Keep in mind that I am talking about step 1 (the cleanser.)</li>
    <li> this product is great. i noticed a difference the next day. and be sure to use the mask. it really works! (when used correctly)</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> Proactiv is horrendous. First of all I must commend their marketing efforts, the 30-day &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; is a great way to get you to sign up. Once you sign up and you realize the product is a poorly manufactured bottle full of skin irritating chemicals, you&#x27;ll forget to cancel your membership and be sent a triple size of their product that you wont ever use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have learned my lesson when I used this product back in 1999. It made my eye lids swell from the exhorbitant misuse of the benzoyl peroxide. They claim it&#x27;s 2.5%, my skin begged to differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time around, last year in 2013 after having a few breakouts I got suckered into trying them again. I was not pleased. It didn&#x27;t clear up my breakouts and my allegic reaction was even worse than before. My face itched so bad after using their facewash just once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it is just too many chemicals. There are many other natural products on the market thet have really cleared up my skin. It was my mistake to try Proactiv a second time. They also mislead you about the &#x27;membership&#x27;. Honestly, it was my fault not taking it seriously that they would send me all these products in 30 days and bill me 3 times the original amount I paid. This is my warning to other consumers, it&#x27;s just really not worth the headache over a product that is manufactured so poorly. I&#x27;m actually currently being billed debt notices over $10.97 with them threatening to send me to collections. I&#x27;d rather not pay them because I feel so grossly misled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv shame on you!</li>
    <li> Never tried anything that works as well as this. The results were simply fantastic.  Would recommend this to anyone with complexion issues.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit for my granddaughter thinking I would only pay $29.00. One week after xmas the billing nightmare started!! First for another supply, I called and cancelled that order only to be told when it is returned it will take 8-10 weeks for a refund. Now there is the nightmare of vitamins, which I did not know I had order seperately. I thought this was one of the free gifts!!! Another call to cancel and wait indefinitely for my money.  Sad part is she liked it but the really sad part is that I can&#x27;t afford it.  Ii think their web site is very deceptive and I wish I had gone to Target!!!!</li>
    <li> My Daugther has used this product and stopped it. Proactive called me  begged me to use it again for 30 days and I was stupid enough to believe them. At 14 days they took my money - I sent back the 2nd shipment and they took my money again. Luckily I disputed this and won the dispute. This was a Very, Very Negative experience and caused me to Have a very negative view of a Company which presents themselves as a Good Company. When I spoke to Customer Service to explain that I did not want to continue with the product do to the bad experience, they were terrible and said I could not get my money back etc.. - Do not believe about the Free 30 Trial. Proactive is a Scam from the very beggining.</li>
    <li> proactive is too much$$$ and it dries out the skin w/o a good moisturizer  so get [...] products or mix and match [...] products and follow the regimen and if your case doesnt go away see your demotoligist ;)</li>
    <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it&#x27;s HIGHLY likely that you will be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.</li>
    <li> The product arrived within 5 days and was exactly what I ordered. The only suggestion that I would make to the seller is to maybe think about wrapping the bottles in some bubble wrap, provide a little more cushion for the bottles, or ship the product in a box v.s. a large mailing envelope. The bottle tops were slightly dented, but not broken.</li>
    <li> Used it for a month, every day and every night. Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used Proactiv for about 4-5 years. In the beginning it worked great for me. I used to swear by it. I never left home without it. I think its still a great product and I use it only a couple of times a week now. The reason for that is because I recently have been under an extreme amount of stress lately. My face has gotten out of control with acne and I believe it is because of the stress. No product including the Proactiv solution has worked for me. I need get rid of my stress before my skin can begin to heal. So I would recommend the product. I think everyone&#x27;s situation is different and they should at least try it.</li>
    <li> The products seem to be helping and are easy to use.  I would recommend them.  My teenager hasn&#x27;t been using them very long, but I can see a difference in his skin.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product from a kiosk.  My skin isn&#x27;t too awful, but for some reason nothing I seemed to try would clear up what i did have.  So at my wit&#x27;s end i decided to try Proactiv based on all the positive things i heard.  I also wanted to have access to the 60 money back guarantee just in case it didn&#x27;t work.  So with high expectations i began my trial period.  As i kept using the product it seemed to me to actually make my skin worse in certian areas and completely strip my face of moisture.  It seemed to me that unfortunately this product failed to deliver said promise.  Due to reasons i couldn&#x27;t return the product at exactly the 60 day mark.  When i had an opportunity i went to return the product to the same kiosk i bought the product from only to be informed that because i didn&#x27;t return it on EXACTLY 60 days they could not refund my purchase.  Also, there was a corporate rep at the kiosk and he informed us that there was no exception to be made for anyone.  I asked for a customer care number, was informed they don&#x27;t have one and was given another number to call instead.  Frankly, in my opinion, this is a scam.  There is a 60 day trial period where at the end of said trial i myself no better than i had been before the trial, if a little more worse off.  I intend to call the supplied number but i have low hopes of that going very far.  I am completely disappointed in the product and also the customer service provided by kiosk and corporate members.  I should warn anyone trying this product for the first time, don&#x27;t do this unless you can have opportunity to return EXACTLY 60 days from purchase.  After all the hype from this company and its products i expected better treatment than i received.  VERY UNSATISFIED.</li>
    <li> I used Proactiv for several years as a teenager to treat breakouts.  As I got older, I quit using it thinking I had grown out of my teenage acne.  Boy was I wrong!  I am now a 20 year old newlywed in nursing school.  Even though I try maintain a healthy diet and drink tons of water, my skin has experienced horrible breakouts lately.  Out of despair, I ordered this Proactiv kit and my skin feels so much better already!  I have no pimples, oil is little to none, and my skin feels amazing!  Proactiv solution helps keep my self-confidence strong and keeps me feeling like I can handle anything!  Definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter and she has been very impressed by this product.Worth the money and great service</li>
    <li> I used product for 4 days only one time a day and got really bad reaction and rash out of it, i&#x27;ll never try it again. My face was feeling like it had half inch layer of plastic on top for days after stopping to use it and it took a week to my skin start peeling off and getting new, healthy skin back. I have never had any kind of allergic reactions on any products i have used for my face or my hair or bodyhair and believe me i have tryed few of them last 16 years.... Would want my money back!!!!</li>
    <li> I have combo skin and mild acne. The reason I stopped twice using this product is because at first when I was a customer through the regular site just paying to much. They do have options to order at different month intervals. So lets say I had signed up for every 3 months the other supply wasn&#x27;t used up yet too. Also, I wanted to use something with less &amp;#34;Harsh&amp;#34; chemicals or natural. I have tried MANY things other than this to help. Aveeno, which works but makes me break out in white bumps, clearasil, clean and clear, neutrogena. I have as of late been trying organic facial cleansers and moisturizers from etsy. So still not sure yet have a few breakouts here and there..may be using proactiv once a wk then the organic..anyway though when you use it don&#x27;t use everyday which I am sure is a lot of people&#x27;s problem. It can dry out skin and make it flaky.</li>
    <li> Daughter has been using this for a couple of months now and her face looks a whole lot better. She is not completely clear yet but the difference is pretty impressive. I expect it to continue to clear.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY!!! First off this product made my acne deeper and hurt worse then when I started! Secondly they sucker you in and you pay like $29 bucks only to have them automatically renew your order with a 90 day supply without your consent! READ TERMS AND CONDITIONS!!! Apparently there is something in there that automatically lets then keep charging your card! And this time it will be for 100 bucks! Not the 29 you started with!!! They are scandalous! BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> Although the skin care line worked OK for my skin, working with Proactiv is a complete nightmare. I cancelled an order and they still charged me for it. When I finally got my refund after two months and sending in a form, they charged me yet again ! They will automatically send a replacement even if you cancel it. They just want to take your money and it is not worth what Proactiv does for your skin.. You can find other skin care lines that will work better and will be way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I actually like this product, but like the other reviews, the only way to order it is to sign up for automatic shipments by logging your credit card. I usually get the face wash and toner and I&#x27;ve tried the mask a few times and was happy with the results. The toner helps even if I use a generic face wash.     However, I probably won&#x27;t order this product again because the customer service is so irritating. I haven&#x27;t received a shippment in over 2 months and when I called they said they were on backorder....surprising that the only product they have is on backorder...</li>
    <li> I had very big expectations for this product, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. I used all three steps, twice a day as directed. I could see some results pretty fast - my skin looked a little better (20-40% better). But I couldn&#x27;t get rid of acne completely.</li>
    <li> NO STARS! I would never buy anything from a company that SPAMS me with about 25 or more emails a day even after I opted out of their mailing list that I didn&#x27;t even know I was on. Please STOP SPAMMING ME!!!</li>
    <li> When I first tried this product it worked okay but soon after became very ineffective. I still felt the pimples under my skin then they became visible again. Unfortunately, I decided to stop using proactive products because it dried out my skin way too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is.... don&#x27;t try it...its not worth it......its not for long term use....the refining mask does not work either&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using Biore pore unclogging scrub and I am very impressed and honey as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the worst business ever!!!! If you ever run into customer service issues with this company you might as well just kiss your money goodbye. The people they have running the call section were rude, short and unpleasent. They did not want to offer any resolution to the issues i was having. HORRIBLE! I would a...dvise any and everyone to AVOID doing business with this company!!! You most likely will regret it!!!</li>
    <li> For many years, from my teens into my twenties, I struggled with acne. There wouldn&#x27;t be a day when I would be happy with what I saw in the mirror. I would have acne all over my face, neck, and back. Not only was it embarrassing, but painful.  However, after trying and using proactiv, even after just one week, I saw a difference.My acne reduced in size, and number.  After two months, I was completely free of acne.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son who says he is very happy with it. Simple enough steps that he keeps up with it to help his skin stay more clear. We are on our second, 2 month supply of the product.</li>
    <li> When i recieved the product i was surprised that the text on the step 1 bottle was written entirely in a foreign language looked like possibly Chinese..... This concerned me because I did not know if the ingredients would be the same for product exported to China. I called the company and they assured me that all product would be the same but i still remain cautious.  The actual product was ok I dont notice a tremendous difference, I still do get the occasional breakout.</li>
    <li> As i write this review on the second day i have it, you can really see some results. First, i really had my doubts about this product working and useful. I was wrong. This is a great product because before i started using ProActiv, I&#x27;ve tried other acne products such as clearisil and neutrogena. They didn&#x27;t really work for me. Im not saying they don&#x27;t work but not the right acne treatment for me. After seeing Katy Perry on their commercial. this product has shown extraordinary results compared to other products. I&#x27;m a junior in high school and had acne since end of freshmen year. Im very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I bough Proactiv on their website a week or so ago paying with PayPal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy your first set they WILL SIGN YOU UP FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND SUPPLIES without asking (or maybe they do in 8pt font in the disclaimer or something). If you don&#x27;t pay attention they&#x27;ll charge you 100 dollars without asking 1 month from when you buy your first set to send you the biggest set they have without consent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that I was personally billed twice on my PayPal, they refused to acknowledge it, the lady at customer care was utterly useless, didn&#x27;t know what PayPal was and basically laughed at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to resort to opening a case on PayPal, prove I only bought one to get my 45$ dollars back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPARE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE</li>
    <li> We ordered this product for our son!  Follow the directions and use regularly!  With in a week or so his skin was clear.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> I chose this product for my daughter because of it was so highly recommend,but first they over charged me then my daughter said it burns when she put it on her face.I  tired to return it in the time allowed but they with out my knowledge signed me up for the whole kit and took my money I had to sell it to someone to get my money back . No I would not recommend this company to anyone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or what ,but i recently bought Proactiv 30 days trial and after finishing applying bottle #3 and i started feeling irritared my face to the point i had to get up i see the damage done . It was red-ish and burned like fired .Couple hours later, my skin was dry . Now 3 days later my skin around my cheekbones are red and my forehead is dry and peeling off . Had to apply some vaseline to make it more comfortable and help with the dryness .&lt;br /&gt;I used this product 8-10 years ago and i don&#x27;t remember having any problem and i used it pretty much every other day. And here this time , i used just one day and my face reacted immediately.  So, no i will not use it EVER again.</li>
    <li> I would post this review directly on Proactive&#x27;s website, but there is no place for genuine, verbatim reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To purchase their product, you have to agree to recurring payments. When I realized this, I cancelled my account to stop the recurring payments. I wrote them and called them to figure out how to purhcase products without agreeing to an account with recurring payments. You can only purchase their product - without agreeing to the recurring payments - if you pay DOUBLE the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their product helps me. But, you have to either be cornered into a payment or agree to be overcharged. No thanks. I hope the product developers find a better company to manage their business.</li>
    <li> its service is horrible. I did not request automatic purchase when I bought this, but Proactive sent me additional product without any notice so I called them not to send it anymore and would like to return the product. I pay for returning the product and Proactive did not refund the full charge. they only refund 70% on my credit card. Proactive made profit. I suggest not to buy proactive product. I would love to join if there is a protest banning Proactive. there is no such a good thing for Proactive at all.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!  Proactiv makes you set up a monthly supply with payment.  I called and cancelled and they STILL sent me product AND charged my credit card.  I closed my credit card.... they STILL charged my credit card.  I called and asked to cancel AGAIN and returned my unopened shipments.  They credited my credit card... only for a partial amount... and then I GOT A BILL IN THE MAIL!  Truly, this company is HORRIBLE!  The SAME product is sold under the Walgreens label and at Target and Walmart.  PLEASE save your self the MANY HOURS of dispute and a LOT of MONEY.  DO NOT BUY PROACTIV.</li>
    <li> The ingredient in proactiv that kills the bacteria is called Benzoyl Peroxide. Proactiv has 2.5%. I purchased proactive in December of 2012 in a vending machine at the mall, I didn&#x27;t want to order online in fear of the horrid continuous monthly charge rumors.. By January my skin was broken out worse than it had in years. I went to the local grocery store, and I found Clean &amp; Clear Continuous control for $5+.. This cleanser has 10% benzoyl peroxide... 3 days later, my skin is almost completely clear! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get the clean and clear and a good moisturizer! Good luck! ACNE SUCKS!!!</li>
    <li> I was prescribed Retin-A of differing formulas and varying strengths for years and years by my dermatologist. My skin would peel and turn bright read and splotchy. Finally, I gave up and decided to give this a try and it&#x27;s worked better for me in terms of reducing my breakouts. I&#x27;ve now been using Proactiv for years, and now in my 30s, it continues to work better for me in controlling and preventing breakouts.</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactiv because I was curious about the dark spot corrector, and have been curious about the whole program for awhile, boy was that a mistake. I only use the product for about a week and it ruined my skin. I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but definitely have breakouts. It made my face super dry and bumpy all over, and gave me tiny little pimples. I am just trying now to help my skin recover. It was pretty miserable, seeing as how I was looking for a product to make me feel better but ended up feeling a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN....I cancelled my order via the automated phone system, my cancellation confirmation number was my account number, which made now sense. I noticed two weeks later they charged my account the 2nd installment, WHAT?! But I cancelled! So I called them and the guy I talked to was not helpful at all, but said he would cancel my account, I just needed to ship the items back to them for the refund (at my own cost of course). I didn&#x27;t feel good about our converstaion so I called back and talked with another woman who said my account wasn&#x27;t cancelled, nor do they have any record of it with the automated system or the guy I talked to, GREAT!! So I cancelled again with her and got my confirmation number, again my account nubmer, whatever. She said an email will be sent out to me confirming my cancellation, never got it. So I called again this morning to make sure it was cancelled and the woman verified it was and said to ship the items back imeediately and the refund will show up in 4-6 weeks. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience all around has been everything but pleasant. I do not suggest this product or the system they have in place. It is a scam to get your money, and I truly believe that. I hope this has given you some insight into the workings of the Proactiv and Guthy Renker system.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, product doesn&#x27;t work and when I tried to return the second shipment (that automatically shipped without my authorization)they would not allow the return.</li>
    <li> I received my first Proactiv shipment in May 2010.  I am in my late twenties and while I did not have problems with acne at a younger age, now I get continuous breakouts of little red bumps all all over my chin, forehead, and temples.  I thought I would try proactiv because I had already tried at least 5 different cheaper cleansers with no positive results.  I received my initial kit and it kinda worked, nothing too good but at least my acne wasn&#x27;t getting any worse like it typically does in the summer.  So when the 90 day kit came, I kept it and continued to use it and my face didn&#x27;t get any better.  When I got my second kit, I called customer service and asked them to cancel my subscription, but they convinced me to send my new kit back in for a refund and I would not be charged for the rest of my payments.  They sent me a self addressed, paid label to put on the box for shipment back. They said they would send me a trial of the stronger formula.  The lady said that someone would contact me about the stronger formula to see it was working better before a full kit was sent out.  I tried the stuff and it did work better, but my shirts and sheets suffered from it.  The collars on my shirts were my face would rub and my pillow cases all became discolored.  It was like they were getting bleached out, probably from the higher strength of peroxide.  But no one ever called me about how I liked the product, I just received a 90 day kit in the mail.  I was kind of mad that they just sent it, but I thought fine, I have it now, I&#x27;ll just use it, but I want to make sure that I get my money back for what I sent back because I don&#x27;t want to be paying for two kits, one regular and one extra strenth.  Well, they charged me for the kit I sent back, and it has now been close to three months and I have yet to see a refund.  First I was told that it would take 4-6 weeks to get a refund and they I was told that I didn&#x27;t receive a refund because they \\&quot;supposeably\\&quot; never received the product back.  And how am I supposed to prove them wrong, I used the label that they sent me to send it back.  When I called to complain about not getting my money back, the guy told me that it was my responsibility to pay for the product because they sent it to me and he couldn&#x27;t help that I didn&#x27;t send it back like I was supposed to.  But I DID SEND IT BACK!!!!!  So I think that got my account cancelled, still have to make yet one more payment because I have to continue to pay for what I got, and the guy told me that it was highly unlikely that I would ever get my money back for my return and that I should \\&quot;have a good life\\&quot;.  Seriously, the guy had the nerve to say that to me!  So in conclusion, the product may work for some, the regular didn&#x27;t work for me, the strong did but at other costs, but it is definitely not worth the headache to deal with their customer service reps and not get WAY over charged for the stuff.  While it costs a lot to begin with, they will screw you over on the costs if you choose to stop buying it and their money back guarantee isn&#x27;t there because they can just say they didn&#x27;t get the product back.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, and I always thought that they weren&#x27;t real anyway. I was told about Proactiv, and I didn&#x27;t think that it was right for me because I only have those cystic pimples due to hormones around a certain time of the month. I barely break out when it isn&#x27;t that time. I waited forever to order this product, and I finally became sick of the way I looked and felt mentally during breakouts. I LOVE Proactiv. It&#x27;s the best product I have ever used. At first, there was a little drying, but my skin is sensitive. I called their hotline and was told that I should start out slowly, and use it as directed over time. It worked! It&#x27;s smells really good, feels really good, and I have barely had any breakouts since I started using it two months ago.     That&#x27;s not the best part. Any time I have a breakout, whether it is a cystic pimple or just your average nuisance, Proactiv actually gets rid of the blemish for me. I don&#x27;t have to pop it or worry about it. Within a day, the texture is already smooth, and I can cover it up until it goes away in a couple of days. It&#x27;s amazing! I have never seen my face so clear. I really can not believe it. I know that sounds cheesy, but I&#x27;m serious.     If any ladies or men out there aren&#x27;t sure if this product will work for mild break outs, you&#x27;re wrong. I will never regret buying this product. I wish I would have tried it a long time ago. I can now feel good about myself when I look in the mirror, and I can leave my house during that time of the month without worrying someone is going to notice that mountain zit in between my eyes, or on my chin. Personally, that&#x27;s what is important. Me feeling better about myself is worth it. Thanks Proactiv!</li>
    <li> This skin-care product isn&#x27;t any more effective than any of the ones you can buy in the drugstore - like Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, or any other benzoyl peroxide-based solution, and they will hound you with junk mail for the rest of your life.  Seriously, i&#x27;ve asked at least 6 times now to be removed from their mailing lists and they still constantly send me solicitations.  NOT WORTH IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product back in my teenage years and I thought it was going to really help my skin. My skin went from bad to WORSE!! I was covered in more acne, painful red bumps all over that I had to pop every one of them. I am highly disappointed. it isnt so great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactiv for over 5 years now. Since the day I started it is the only skin care that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was seeing the commercials on TV I was very doubtful and didn&#x27;t want to waste my money, and therefore, could never bring myself to try it. (I had been so disappointed before by everything else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I was having dinner at a friend&#x27;s house and I had a couple of very embarrassing pimples as I basically always did. She took a look at me and said: \\&quot;You have acne?\\&quot;. It was very embarrassing! Then she said, I have something you should try. She gave me the left over of a repairing cream bottle for me to try it.  I asked, is this really working? and she said, yes, try it and you&#x27;ll see what it does for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went home with that left over repairing cream of Proactiv and put it on the few pimples that I had. This is to say that I didn&#x27;t even have the cleanser or the toner yet. And, yes, after a couple days I could see that my pimples were drying up and disappearing. This time I was sold, and I order Proactiv the following week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week I used it my skin became very dry and a bit weird, but I read that this was a normal reaction the first time, and that the skin would adjust over time. Soon enough it did and the pimple and other ugly spots of acne disappeared.  I have never stopped using Proactiv since then. Nothing else works for me.</li>
    <li> We have been using proactive for years and I decided to give it a try by ordering through amazon. Came quickly and is just like buying it from a store.</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactiv for my daughter through the website, and started receiving \\&quot;drop shipments\\&quot; every 3 weeks and they would automatically charge my credit card.  I called to inform them that I did not want them sending me their product every month, I would prefer to order when I choose to order.  After months of dealing with having to send back packages that I did not order, and spending hours on the phone with customer service I was finally free from this mail order nightmare.  Then about a year later I received a postcard in the mail stating that \\&quot;we have listened to our customers and that I could order as needed\\&quot;. I was skeptical, but my daughter really likes the product, so I mailed in the postcard, paid for the first order, and 3 weeks later there was a drop shipment in my mailbox.  I was P***ed!!!! I wrote on the package, return to sender: did not order, and stuck it in the mailbox. Then I started getting bills for the shipment, after calling customer service, was told to wait 4-6 weeks. Then I start getting threats of my account being past due, the bill mysteriously changed from $40 to $60.  I was threatened with being sent to a collection agency, I refused to pay for something that I did not order and that I did return. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN, BUYER BEWARE!  The one star was given because there was no option for a minus 5 star.</li>
    <li> cant prove it but i think this product was actually better than the hundred other things we tried. amazon did have the best price too</li>
    <li> My son has had acne for the past five years and we have tried everything to rid him of it. I bought him Proactiv because I figured it was worth a try, and they market the product to be miraculous. Sadly, his results were far from miraculous. Proactiv made his skin incredibly dry after washing and putting the various products on it.  It did not improve his acne.</li>
    <li> Has anyone reported problems with Proactiv bleaching their towels/clothes? My daughters have been using Proactiv for about a year. we have noticed that all of our towels are getting white bleach spots all over them....even our new towels. It occured to me that it may be from the Proactiv.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised, thanks!</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!!  I ordered proactive about a month ago.  When I ordered, the rep. told me they would bill me every 30 days until I choose to cancel the oreder.  The problem was this:  Less than 14 days into the month they had already billed me for another month&#x27;s supply ($32.00) as well as billed me again for vitimans a week later for $30 something!!  They are TOO anxious to get into your bank account!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv off and on for many years, and my breakouts became more manageable. Last year I experienced a horrible allergic reaction to something unknown, and tried many different products from department stores, which made the reaction worse, and worse.I was left with severe acne, like I have never seen before. I finally broke down and ordered Proactiv and within 1-2 weeks, the severe acne/reaction was gone. I&#x27;m happy to have ordered from this vendor, because it was my first order on Amazon. It&#x27;s the real Proactiv!</li>
    <li> Proactiv worked fantastically for me.  During my teens, I tried every single acne product you could find in a store.  Every single brand.  Most were terrible.  The one that definitely clears up acne the best is Clean &amp; Clear, but there&#x27;s one big problem with Clean &amp; Clear: it left my skin seriously dried out and peeling.  So, not only was I plagued with acne, but I also had to deal with dried out, itchy, peeling skin (my nose was always bright red covered in flaky peeling skin).  And, unlike acne, you can&#x27;t cover peeling skin with makeup.  It was very embarrassing.  Then I tried ordering Proactiv, and was amazed immediately.  Proactiv has managed to come up with a formula that is able to clear up acne, and still leave your skin feeling moisturized and healthy.  No more peeling skin.  I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for about 8 years now, and I&#x27;ve never had dry, peeling skin again.  Proactiv did not magically clear up my acne--but it did make it better.  A few months after I has started it, this guy I worked with came up to me and said \\&quot;Your skin has been looking so much better lately.  Whatever you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s working.\\&quot; which really was pretty humiliating, but at least I knew it was working.  Before Proactiv, I would usually have 5-6 big ugly red zits on my face at a time.  With Proactiv, it was brought down to 1-2 at a time.  I do still have minor acne, but most of what&#x27;s on my face is scarring from all the zits I had before I started Proactiv.  I wish I had started it sooner.  I do have to say that if you have extremely bad acne, then a stronger product like Clean &amp; Clear is probably better for you, but if you have mild to moderate acne and also have problems with other products drying out or irritating your skin, then Proactiv would be a great choice for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through the &#x27;official&#x27; website for my teenage son. There was NO OBVIOUS way to order without giving them permission to ding my credit card and send another &#x27;convenient, automatic&#x27; shipment to me every 30 days thereafter. When I called the 800# that appeared on my checking account statement I was told that when I placed the initial order it told me I was signing up for &#x27;automatic delivery.&#x27; Most likely this is so, but it was NOT prominently displayed, nor was there a way to &#x27;opt out&#x27; online, instead one must CALL and speak with an operator to cancel their &#x27;convenient&#x27; automatic shipping arrangement.    Instead of forcing customer&#x27;s to go through an inconvenient &#x27;opt out&#x27; procedure which would entail remembering to call their 800 number at a later time to request removal from the program (you cannot do this yourself online at the time you place your order,) they should provide an &#x27;opt in&#x27; offer at the time customers place their initial order. This would TRULY give customers more options and freedom in making their purchasing decisions.    This is NOT about customer convenience, it is about pushing sales through and having continual access to your bank account. The product worked just fine, but so does the Clearasil kit I can buy AT MY OWN DISCRETION from Target. I may even write my Attorney General and ask them to prohibit this kind of INconvenient, automatic re-ordering set-up when I am trying to buy something.    STAY AWAY unless you want to give Proactive perpetual access to your bank account.</li>
    <li> The proactive 3 step program is a piece of garbage. it burned my face and made it turn red. It dried my skin up and now my face is like a tomato. Overall, this product sucks.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, terrible product that may cause strong allergies!!! On top of that if you have any issues, you do not have any customer service that is normally provided by proactiv.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv for years, starting on the advice of a friend and his wife, who both had adult acne, and claimed that it worked.  In fact, their skin was beautiful.  Because they&#x27;d gotten on the auto-renew program, they wound up with too much product, and were able to give me an extra kit they had lying around.  I tried it, and lo and behold:  my skin cleared up.  I had no problems with drying, despite my sensitive skin.  And not only did the acne go away, but it now had a glow to it, especially when I used a prescription retinoid cream with it (I used Tazorac).  My son, who is just entering his teen years and has acne with a vengeance, has seen great success with it (that is, when he remembers to use it regularly!).  However, once I turned 45, my skin began reacting differently to the product.  My skin started to get itchy and blotchy and dried out terribly, and it would take days and weeks to recover, looking worse than if I had just left the acne alone. As prescribed in the directions, I reduced usage to once per day.  Then to every other day.  Then to sporadic.  But every time I used the product, my skin reacted terribly...so I have just cancelled my Proactiv membership.    I have read reviews about mixed results for different people.  I know Murad explains on his commercials that this is because there are different kinds of acne, and that the benzoyl peroxide in Proactiv only treats a certain kind of acne.  His stuff claims to treat a great variety of acne types.  I eventually might order his product.  A footnote on the customer service when ordering direct from Guthy-Renker/Proactiv:  I have to say, I&#x27;ve never experienced the same problems that so many others have.  I just cancelled my service about 10 minutes ago, and this is the second time I have done this.  Each time, they do try to offer alternatives instead of cancelling, but in the end, they cancel without too much resistance.  I had no billing issues.  I&#x27;ve returned product by marking packages I&#x27;vegotten as \\&quot;return to sender\\&quot;, and they accept that and credit your account (but am told they only do that once...it&#x27;s not something you can regularly do).    And once before, I called to cancel because my dermatologist had put me on a regimen of other products in the evening that eliminated the 2nd Proactiv application per day--I was only using it once per day, and so therefore, not using it nearly fast enough to keep up with the auto-renew schedule.  I called to cancel, and they offered to suspend my service for something like 6 mos, and then resume auto-delivery on a every-six month schedule, which actually was perfect. So they seemed very accommodating to me.    Putting yourself on ANY kind of auto payment requires--pun intended--that you be PROACTIVE in assessing that the frequency of recurrence is accurate, communicating with customer service, and sending back product when it&#x27;s not appropriate for you.  So in that sense it can be inconvenient.  But my personal experience has been that the Proactiv customer service dept was very accommodating.  Not denying that everyone else experienced as they did--simply giving some perspective that&#x27;s a little different from the norm that&#x27;s been posted so far.  I really liked Proactiv a lot while it lasted.  Now it&#x27;s time to move on...maybe to Murad??</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews before buying.  You will see a consistency - ProActiv is a poor product and the company will rip you off when you try to cancel.</li>
    <li> I used the Proactiv system for only 4 days, and I have to say that this is by far the WORST reaction I have ever had to a facial product.  The itchy dry skin that accompanied the red patches all over my face and neck is one of the more disturbing side effects I have had from a product that was supposedly formulated by dermatologists.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the only one having these side effects and I&#x27;m not sure if they will go away with continued use.  But I am too scared to keep going, as my face is always itchy, incredibly dry and in constant pain.  I used the product for 4 days, and have been off for a week, and I still have itchy, red patchy, dry and painful skin on my face and neck.  I am so worried that I am finally going to see a REAL dermatologist to fix the havoc that Proactiv has created.</li>
    <li> Was very good product for my teenage son.  Haven&#x27;t ordered it in years.</li>
    <li> I have mild-moderate acne, and decided to buy a 30-day shipment to try it out; it made my skin really dry, and didn&#x27;t help with the acne at all. I understand that acne treatment is complicated because everyone&#x27;s skin is different and will therefore react differently to the same product, so I wasn&#x27;t terribly upset, and wasn&#x27;t even gonna bother with a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got a second charge on my credit card, and another shipment I hadn&#x27;t ordered. I specifically remember choosing no membership when I ordered, but apparently that means nothing because there&#x27;s something in the terms and conditions about continuing shipments. I found out I did have a profile and a membership after all, and attempted to call to cancel it. I was put on hold for a long, LONG time, then transferred multiple times to people who would not answer or numbers that didn&#x27;t exist. I decided to try the live chat on their website instead. When I told them I wanted to cancel, they proceeded to ask me why multiple times, and for all the reasons I gave them (it made my skin dry, didn&#x27;t really work, my acne was not that severe so I would be okay without any products for the week it would take me to find an alternative to proactiv) they kept trying to rebute and invalidate them. Finally, I got the representative to cancel my membership. Great. Everything&#x27;s squared away now. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five months later, I get another charge on my credit card from Proactiv. I go to their website again, tell the rep that I had my membership cancelled, but was still getting charged. Have to explain it multiple times before she says she&#x27;ll check for me. Fifteen minutes later she comes back saying that I did not cancel my membership. Luckily, I had taken a screen cap of my conversation with the first respresentative saying that she had successfully canceled my membership, and sent that to her. She checked again, and &amp;#34;oh! It seems you did cancel, but there was a processing error&amp;#34;. I asked her for a refund of the third charge, she told me I had to return the third shipment first. But I had moved out of the country since I first cancelled my membership, and they&#x27;d sent it to my old address. She said that was my problem because I should have updated my address. I said I didn&#x27;t think to update my address because THEY TOLD ME I&#x27;D SUCCESFULLY CANCELLED MY MEMBERSHIP SIX MONTHS AGO. We argued again for a while, and she finally said she would refund me. Great. everything&#x27;s squared away now. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, I get a $15 refund. But the charge was $60. So I called again to complain, and nothing. It took a call from my lawyer friend to get me the $45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story? Try the webchat instead of a phone call. And print screen everything so you have proof in case there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;processing error&amp;#34;. If you&#x27;d really rather do it over the phone, ask them to send you an email confirming everything that they said. If no email comes, call again. And of you have any friends who are lawyers, use them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews because I&#x27;m only one person with one opinion.  However, I am one of three people I know who have tried it, and this product hasn&#x27;t worked for one of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Proactiv because I had heard the commercials for so long and have moderate acne that has only gotten worse with my age.  After trying many products, I figured \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;  After the first two weeks I was pretty excited.  I noticed decreased pore size and acne.  After day 14, however, my skin reverted to the way it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Proactive decided that I had used up my first shipment and sent me another shipment, charging my card.  I didn&#x27;t have a hard time cancelling my account, but the woman on the phone was very rude and suggested that I buy even MORE of the product that doesn&#x27;t work for me. It was like a personal affront that I was cancelling my \\&quot;subscription.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I had all this excess product, so I gave it to my sister to try out.  She had been thinking about purchasing it for herself and was excited about the possible results, just like I and plenty of Americans were.  Her results were the same as mine.  After two weeks, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so my sister and I are obviously related and have similar skin/enzymes/whatever, so it makes sense that we would have similar results.  A good friend of ours tried it years ago and it did nothing but mess up her skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about trying Proactiv, proceed with extreme caution.</li>
    <li> my grandson believe in proactiv and this price was great</li>
    <li> Proactiv is the most disingenuous company I have ever had the displeasure of being duped into business with. A year or so ago, I decided to try it, and purchased their trial kit. I didn&#x27;t have great results with their product, it was too harsh for me and I didn&#x27;t like that it bleached towels/clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little did I realize, without consent, they enter you into an auto-billing contract. Luckily (I thought) I had paid through PayPal. So after the first auto-bill (that I did not authorize) I deactivated them as an approved recipient from my account, as you CANNOT CANCEL YOUR AUTO DEBITS ONLINE IN ANY WAY. Once I deauthorized them, I again was debited against my will. I filed a complaint through PayPal and PayPal refunded my money promptly (I did not receive a product for this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I get slapped with a COLLECTIONS notice in the mail from Proactiv. WHAT?! I did not want to be auto billed, I paid for the products I received that I DID NOT order, and PayPal refunded me after they didn&#x27;t stop a second unauthorized auto debit. Terrible, terrible, disingenuous company. Shame on you.</li>
    <li> The price was right on. However the product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Works great I recommend this I gave it to my teenage son</li>
    <li> I got this kit from the Proactiv company for my 15 year old son, and made him stick it out for three months before we cancelled, just to give the product a good chance to prove itself.  His acne is severe, and nothing we bought at the store even touched it.  While the Proactiv DID work in that it greatly reduced the acne, it never cleared entirely, his skin was incredibly dry and flaky, and he often complained of sensitivity.  When we cancelled, the reason being \\&quot;it didn&#x27;t work as well as we expected,\\&quot; the customer service offered to send a trial bottle of their Extra-strength formula, but I declined.  If the regular strength dried his skin so much, I can&#x27;t imagine what extra strength would do.</li>
    <li> Proactiv is not a solution to your acne if you only have a few blemishes here and there, even if its a constant annoyance.  I bought it to try it, even though my acne was frequent(a blemish a week or so) but not all over my face.  Within a few days of using it, my skin was clear and blemish free. However, after using twice a day as directed for more than a week, my acne became worse, and my skin was completely dry, itchy and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the website and it said that I should continue to use it, but cut back to once a day - then after a few weeks of once a day without irritation, go back to twice a day.  I did as directed, but once I went to twice a day again, my skin worsened, was extremely irritated and constantly itchy.  My mother-in-law suggested a moisturizing product she uses that is actually formulated for skin care patients after major microdermabrasion or plastic surgery.  That helped the irritation, but I now know Proactiv is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now need to cancel it and will report again how that went. Somewhere else noted that to cancel successfully call for the physical address, then tell them you want to cancel all auto-shipping on the account and cancel the account, then mail any unused product back return receipt certified mail so there is a record of them receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as people saying, \\&quot;it&#x27;s a scam, I didn&#x27;t know about auto-ship\\&quot;, that tells me they didn&#x27;t read what they signed up for or listen to customer service representative when they first ordered.  I signed up online and it clearly stated that it was going to become a membership product with shipments every \\&quot;___\\&quot; weeks. I opted to have my auto-shipments ship every 16 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to update you all. I called and requested that Proactive cancel my product, account and all auto-shipments and future shipments via my phone call. I asked for a physical street address to ship the return to (my returned product was unopened with 60 days of receipt of product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then sent a letter with the returned product to consider this my legal request to return my product, cancel my account and all future shipments and auto-shipments and please issue a full refund. I sent the package with delivery confirmation from the post office on 4-3-12. On 4-26-12, I received the full refund (less $10 shipping) in my bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope anyone who needs to cancel and get their refund gets help from the steps I used and I wish anyone seeking a refund gets their refund that they are due!</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactiv for the same reason anyone does, because you&#x27;ve got acne. Well, just as a heads up, when you first order the solution from the actual company, they charge 2 times for it. Apparently it&#x27;s their system \\&quot;checking\\&quot; your card to see if you have the money. Uhh. Also, at least in my case, they don&#x27;t give you back that money. I even filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and nothing happened. They still were able to keep their so called \\&quot;drop off fee\\&quot;. OH! And you are also \\&quot;enrolled\\&quot; to be automatically charged for your next shipment.&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product, the bottles are extremely small and you are only supposed to use a \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; sized of each of the solutions. Which most of the time isn&#x27;t enough to cover your face. The biggest problem I see is that it takes up to 5 WEEKS according to the bottle for the system to show improvement. Which, when you are paying for it by the month, basically the first month you will pay for no results. I used it for 6 weeks and only saw a minimal result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that it works super well for other people, because obviously it has a good reputation. But I just didn&#x27;t like my experience with the company or the product.</li>
    <li> ~from Katy&#x27;s fifteen year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started Proactiv about three weeks ago and am relatively satisfied. I have normal/combination skin. My skin had a hard time adjusting at first. There was often a burning sensation and redness after applying Steps 2 and 3. And a lot of dryness. The dryness still hasn&#x27;t gone away completely, which is one of the reasons this doesn&#x27;t deserve five stars. The other reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars, is it&#x27;s nothing special. Proactiv has exactly the same active ingredients that are present in drugstore products, and they are similar in quality. The only reason Proactiv has worked for me where other treatments have failed, is because I feel inclined to stick to the easy three step routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the three steps, and the Oil-Free Moisturizer with SPF 15 during the day. At night I use Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Night Cream (which I don&#x27;t recommend, I just needed some sort of moisturize at night). I am also taking Vitaclear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer with Proactiv is absolutely essential, for all skin types. Even those with very oily skin will most likely need some sort of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Proactiv to those who have a hard time sticking to an skincare routine (like me). If you don&#x27;t have that issue, you can create a much cheaper routine for yourself using Clean &amp; Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser or Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash and some 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel or cream.</li>
    <li> Incredibly fast service!  Product as described. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I fell for this old routine. What a horrible way to do business, by capitalizing on people&#x27;s trusting that cancelling your future orders really means that it will happen. Not to mention the percentage that just get frustrated with zero customer service NOT related to sales and suck up the loss.</li>
    <li> This never quite worked for my acne as expected. It may work for some but it dried my skin out too much.</li>
    <li> All skin is different, unfortunately my daughters skin reacted terribly to this product (and now I cannot return it). Although the price was better than the mall kiosks, I can&#x27;t return for a refund online.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin without many breakouts but my friend gave it to me because she said she didn&#x27;t want it so I decided to use it.. The first day I used it, I really liked it, but then by the second day my skin was completely red and itchy and irritated.. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin. It was definitaly the benzol peroxide. I decided to keep the toner because it didn&#x27;t have that in it, and I liked the toner. I tried this about 2 years ago, and now I&#x27;m into more natural products.</li>
    <li> This system is ok at best.. Acne Clear- found in drugstores... works exactly the same but is cheaper. Proactive&#x27;s \\&quot;low introductory price\\&quot; is a good deal, if that were all it was. What they don&#x27;t tell you is that they charge you $14.95 a month, even after you cancel, because that initial $19.95 for the 3 step system is merely a down payment, so to speak. You actually get charged the full amount of around $80. On top of all that, their customer service is atrocious- rude and incompetent!&lt;br /&gt;So save your money and buy the Acne Clear system at CVS for $23.</li>
    <li> I have had occasional break outs here and there, nothing too serious. I figured I would give proactive a try just to have consistently clear skin. After just one week of using it, I had huge break outs everywhere. Proactive made me break out worse than I ever have. I have read other reviews that say it is supposed to make your skin worse before it gets better, but of course the makers of Proactive don&#x27;t tell you that.</li>
    <li> I bought Proactiv for my son about 2 years ago, and it seemed to work fine with him only having a few blemishes here and there; however, after using it for about the second year, his eyebrows started to change color. After about three weeks from when I noticed his eyebrows chaning color, they had gone from dark brown to a light brown with blonde and orange mixed in! It looked like a clown as he said! Also, some of his brown towels dyed into an orange color. Now, I&#x27;m switching him to a prescribed acne medication that he hopes will work a lot better and that it will not dye his eyebrows. Just another note, Proactiv takes a long time to put on, and it can be a pain to put on everyday, twice a day. My son does not reccomend Proactiv at all! It&#x27;s a terrible product, and it is quite expensive too!</li>
    <li> The product made my skin glow, but if I wasn&#x27;t diligent at using it every day, I would break out even worse than before. On areas where there were no previous breakous pre-Proactiv (I was applying all over my face) I started to break out. Then, when I wanted to cancel my account- there was absolutely NO WAY to do it online. You have to call, talk to a machine for 10 minutes, and then try to avoid getting pursuaded/guilt-tripped into keeping your account. It is SO frustrating, the lack of freedom to cancel your account at any time without the help of a representative just shows their insecurity with their product. AH!!!</li>
    <li> Surprising results.  I have used proActive off and on for months I didn&#x27;t have any problems canceling my very first two month trial.  They introduced a New line and face wash with auto fill and it worked well for my problems.  I used it as a body wash and sit in the sun when I want with baby oil and a little iodine in it.  However, my acne and DIRTY skin was determined in one area of my body ( embarrassing) and I would not discuss it with my dermatologist.  So when the big bottles of face wash started to stock themselves in my closet I wanted to cancel however i decided to try the three part cleansing system and while waiting for my first shipment I found out that if I smeared just a little salicylic acid found in wart remover products my skin dried up enough to clear drastically&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I discovered this result that I can&#x27;t wait for my new Three Product  ProActive to arrive.  The wart remover also cleared up my nails.  Hope this helps</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the amazing prices in which you will find on Amazon. The infomercials are real on this one! I used this product for 1 week and noticed results almost instantly. The ingredients used work fast at actively removing acne and giving you clear, soft skin. I will continue to purchase this product. (It&#x27;s so much better than that crap we buy on the shelf in our local health and beauty departments)!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I want to start by telling you all that I came here about a month or two ago to read the reviews on Proactiv. I did subscribe to it directly through the company. I am 57 years old with post menopausal acne problems. I am also African American. Not that this matters but it does effect how my skin behaves. I suffered with acne as a teenager -- moderate to severe -- and as I got older, my acne subsided. I had many acne scars which did fade over time on their own. Early this year I started to break out again like a 16-year old. I tried some natural products, some supermarket products and did not get any relief -- in fact they made the problem worse. I was determined not to have to deal with this problem at this age. I had seen Proactiv commercials and was hesitant to start it. I did not realize that it was a subscription-based plan at the outset. Either I just did not read the information on the site carefully enough or it wasn&#x27;t that obvious. Either way, I decided that I needed something so I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will tell you that it has been about 2 months and my skin has never been this clear. Granted, the effectiveness of a product may depend on the person and the kind of acne they have but I can honestly tell you the my skin is more smooth and more clear than it has EVER been. I do get an occasional pimple now and then so it is not a cure. They tell you that acne cannot be cured -- only controlled. Even so, I don&#x27;t get pimples very often now and if I do get a pimple, it is dealt with right away and effectively. I added the refining mask which seems to be very effective in dealing with the occasional bump. I am very happy I bought it. I do have a few dark scars from acne but the product does not claim to remove scars. It does claim to even out skin tone from the discoloration that can accompany break outs. Right now, my face is tan from summer so it is not so obvious and my acne scars seem to fade anyway on their own in time so I am not terribly worried aboutthem. But,aside from those three or four scars, my skin is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the horror stories I am reading here about cancelling it are concerned, I can&#x27;t say except my niece was using it for a while and she liked it very much. It worked well for her also and she suffers from acne worse than I did. But she could not afford it any more so she cancelled it and I never heard that getting out of it was an issue for her. I don&#x27;t plan on stopping it since it is working for me so well but I guess I will find out at some point how difficult it will be to cancel the subscription. I suspect that if you tell your bank to deny any further payments to them, they will stop it quickly enough because I cannot imagine they will continue to send you product if they are not getting paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that is my story. So far, I love the product. It works very well. If you wear make up, they tell you to get a foundation that has the acne medicine in it. I did this even though I don&#x27;t wear make up very often, when I do, it has the medicine in it which helps because the medicine sits on my face all day that day. Anyway, it was worth it for me.</li>
    <li> This product is great for oily skin. Really dries it up and clears up acne. That being said your face will feel tight and dry. The additional moisturizers do help but again they are oil free and can only do so much. To get a really moisturized feel you need some kind of oil in the product but that is not beneficial for oily skin and takes you right back to square one with the acne. But to me its totally worth it to have clear dry skin as opposed to greasy skin covered in white heads and large pores and blackheads on my nose. Weigh your pros and cons first but it does work. As far as how hard it is to get out of the \\&quot;club\\&quot; idk because Im not looking to get out and have yet to try. I will definitly follow up and let it be known if I ever do.</li>
    <li> Hi I wanted to try proactiv for a month and did help in clearing and toning a lil.Though while usage my skin became dry and was not very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;After I stopped using it now I get more pimples than ever. Now am slave to this product...</li>
    <li> I Honestly had the worst experience dealing with acne, i tried everything and spent so much money and time on useless treatments, which only made me  breakout more.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Proactiv to everyone who is suffering from embarrassing, depressing acne . It can be the difference to emotion and confidence we all&lt;br /&gt;need in our every day life routines!!!!! So do not hesitate and get clear skin now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So here is my story with proactiv, I am 24 years old and almost a little over a year ago I started using proactiv to clear my acne. I get the type of acne thats all over my cheeks and some were mostly deep and painful and some were whiteheads. So when I first starte proactiv it made my face dry and this is something I knew would happen and I just needed to push through it and let it do its thing and this time I did and im glad I did! After a month of using proactiv my skin was CLEAR!!!!!!! Then two months after I had my baby I got like two pimples and I freaked out because I thought, oh no! proactiv isnt working anymore :( and I learned the hard way because I switched to Murad thinking my face needed something different. Man was I wrong! My face started breaking out horribly and I understand you purge but my purging time was up and I was still breaking out awful and this was like a month ago! So I went back to proactiv and guess what? My face is on its way to being the way it used to be a few months back and for the past year which is clear! After I had my baby my hormones went into over drive so its no wonder I got two pimples! Like I said though I just freaked out because I have dealt with acne for over 3 years so when I had that year of clear skin I thought oh no not again when I saw those two pimples! Switching to murad made it sooooo much worse though because instead of two pimples that I had that are gone now of course my face has about 5-6 pimples on one side of my cheek and two awful ones on the other side and some smaller ones! I can already tell proactiv is taking care of me though! I have tried proactiv in the past and I hated it only because I never gave it the full chance, when my skin started flaking and peeling I just gave up because with acne and skin peeling it just made me more upset but like I said I stuck it out this time and let my skin get used to it and used proactiv the correct way to a t and didnt over do it and couldnt be happier. I will always be a proactiv girl :)</li>
    <li> I tried the products for a few months and I did notice a small improvement, however nothing worth the price they charge for the system. Well when I went to cancel I called there customer support and supposedly got everything canceled, well the shipments stopped coming however about 3 months later I got a bill for the past supposed 3 shipments I received. I called yet again, talked to their fail customer support, who tried to tell me I never canceled, and that I would have to pay for the product I never received. Well I was not about to pay for any of this, and got it \\&quot;canceled\\&quot; once again. It&#x27;s one month later and I have been charged again for their products. My advice to anyone who was thinking of trying this system is to never even try the samples, do not get involved in anyway, it is not worth the product and it is not worth the trouble of canceling with there horrible support.</li>
    <li> I will try to be as professional as possible when describing my experience with Proactiv and their customer service, as well the product itself. Over the course of me taking this product I can indicate I was brainwashed by all the Proactiv ad&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s a healthy way to promote your skin care and etc. Proactiv doesn&#x27;t supply much of the product for such prices in the first place. I never experienced any form of healing or noticed any which effects on my skin from flawless usage of the solution. But I&#x27;m sure everyone is different and may or may not help you. One of the good factors about Proactiv is that it promotes good hygiene to the person trying to get the full usage of it and clear their skin up, meaning that maybe not the Proactiv itself that causes the cleansing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend subscribing to Proactiv as their customer service is awful. They put you on hold or are not open half the week, don&#x27;t allow any method of cancelling your subscription other then blacklisting them with your credit / debt card and your banking, or the extreme: just changing your card in whole (as I had to end up doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my prolonged use of Proactiv I never noticed any features of healthy skin which is promoted by the product, but rather dry and flaky skin on my acne where it mattered the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I would not recommend Proactiv as there have been many cases of people taking their vitamin and mineral supplements and just feeling god awful sick. Don&#x27;t take my word for it though in this review, do your own research and decide if this is the right product for you.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time,great product,thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had really serious acne since I was eleven or twelve. Proactiv irritated my face (by step 3 my face always burned so badly I&#x27;d have to fan my face to stop it), left my skin dry and didn&#x27;t give me consistent results (the acne always came back in a few weeks.) If you have severe acne I&#x27;d recommend a dermatologist. I&#x27;ve been going for almost a year now and my face is clear. Don&#x27;t use Proactiv.</li>
    <li> Proactiv worked great for me.  I never have had terrible acne but for some reason mine did get worse this spring.  When I ordered it, I was doubtful that it would work, but my girlfriend really wanted me to use it (it worked very well for her brother).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within just a couple days my face was noticeable more clear.  Now after about a month of using it, my face is almost completely clear of all acne and looks better than ever.  I am very impressed and will definitely be ordering more when my current supply runs out.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but I will never order anything from Guthy-Renker/Proactiv again because of the lousy customer service. I would call to delay my order (once a month was way too much), they would assure me it was delayed, and then I would receive the product anyway. Returning the product would usually result in me paying shipping and handling, even though I would provide them with the date I called and the telephone operator&#x27;s name. This happened five or six times before I finally got fed up and cancelled my membership. I will NEVER use this product again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for almost a year and it made my skin worst! I was told by my dermatologist that it actually spread the acne! They also put you on autobilling then don&#x27;t refund you when you send your product back. DO NOT ORDER PROACTIVE!!</li>
    <li> Works great for me. My skin is little sensitive so, I don&#x27;t use it daily. I use it when I feel my skin is dull or damaged.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactive for a month and have seen no change. This stuff had dried my skin so much to the point of peeling and I have an appearance of sunburn on my face which has been there since week one. It has literally burnt my face! I&#x27;d say my face looks worse now than before. I have called the customer service line and they are very quick to rush me off the phone. Very rude people working the lines. They also failed to tell me that the first order was almost $100!!! The rep told me my first payment would be $19.95 plus s+h which brought my total to $29.95. Such a scam!</li>
    <li> This is a SCAM!!! They did not tell me that they automatically send you a new box of the product every month and charge your credit card! What a NIGHTMARE! I may have to cancel my credit card if they don&#x27;t stop billing me. I did not know this was a GUTHY RENKER SCAM!  The product only works okay.  Also - it will discolor your towels and clothing - it bleaches them out to white! They should pay ME for two ruined towels and T-shirts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv for about 2 months now and it&#x27;s gotten rid of pretty much all my acne. However, I still get a few problem areas once in a while. Not as great as it seems in the commercials but still my favorite acne ridding system I have tried by far.</li>
    <li> Seeing how acne is a weird phenomenon, I never expect much from any product. Recently I stopped taking anti-biotics prescribed to me by a dermatologist and I decided to finally give proactiv a try. (I&#x27;ve used many other products in the past) All I can say is if I keep using two times a day EVERY day then my severe acne is significantly reduced. It&#x27;s not completely gone, but I can live with that.     All I can say is be gentle when applying. Good luck, but if you&#x27;ve ever tried other products then you already know that good results are NOT guaranteed with any acne product.</li>
    <li> I tried Proactive after nothing else seemed to be working on my stubborn face and I thought that maybe the hype was right and that it could possible be the answer. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. My face actually got so much worse with the use of this product I was shocked. I used it for about two to three months and saw little to no improvement over time. It over dried my face, I remember thinking how much my face hurt after using it, and like I said I never saw improvement, it actually worsened over the period I used it. I know many people who claim Proactive is a successful product for them and is there go to acne product. However, I think it is expensive and painful, I would never recommend it to one of my friends. Especially if you have sensitive skin, semi-sensitive skin, or face over dries easily. Plus the kit does not last 2 months, it lasted me about one month. The wash doesn&#x27;t lather up so you have to use a lot of the product to feel like its working or actually getting your face clean. I feel like I wasted my money and I just figured maybe if I could help one person with this review it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the \\&quot;trial size kit\\&quot;, not knowing that it automatically enrolled me in their ongoing delivery club.  That alone is reason to suspect the way they do business.  As for the products themselves, all I experienced was that my skin was so ridiculously dry I looked 20 years older.  Definitely not the look I was going for.  As for clearing anything up, it was no help at all.  I simply thought I just wouldn&#x27;t order any more.  Wrong.  Today a new charge showed up on my card for Proactive, as well as a separate one for the VitaClear vitamins.  I did receive a \\&quot;free\\&quot; bottle of the vitamins which I did not understand because I did not request them.  After being transferred to some foreign country and allegedly having the Proavtiv account cancelled (trust me, I will be on top of that!), I was transferred to a different department to cancel the vitamins.  The rep told me that when you order online, windows pop up with free offers (not free at all!) and if you simply X out of the window, it adds it to your cart anyway and puts you on the monthly scam club.  You must actually click on NO THANKS to keep from being scammed.    Now I am the one who has to deal with and pay for shipping back these products that I did NOT order and I am the one who must keep checking for my refunds and confirmation of the cancelled accounts.  \\&quot;Refunds will take 4 to 6 weeks to show up on your statement.\\&quot;  What a pantload!  It takes 2 minutes to issue a credit and most times it&#x27;s completed in 2 days.  To be safe, I&#x27;m contacting my credit card to block any additional charges from either of these companies (that belong to the same parent company, I might add).    The unopened \\&quot;free\\&quot; vitamins will go in the trash as will the remaining product in the Proactiv tubes.  It absolutely does bleach anything it comes in contact with.  What a nightmare and a lesson learned!  I will never order products like this from anyone again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv for about a month and a half now, not only did it not make my acne go away, it actually made it worst. I&#x27;m starting to get cystic acne and it&#x27;s just out of control. STAY AWAY FROM PROACTIV.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001A3ML3K Proactiv Solution 3 Step System Kit, 2 Month Supply]]el primer dia me gusto y dedes  hay he visto que funciona bien hay que usar protector solar se que es bueno,y gracias por todo estuve muy incomodo porque no llego a tiempo pero ya esta bien</li>
    <li> Product worked okay, however really its more about the habits the system tries to help you make.  Found less expensive options.  Tried to cancel product in November and took three attempts and a dispute with the bank to finally cancel now in January.  Hoping this is really the end of it...</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactiv as a one time order. A month later, I get another shipment. I did not opt for that plan, so I called and cancelled. I now have a bill coming from a collection agency to pay for the last shipment I never recieved....This is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Love love proactive, however the price has become ridiculous. I have been a proactive user for about 10 yrs, this is the most expensive I have ever seen it. Either I will find it at a reasonable price or find an alternative. I&#x27;ve heard good things about equate at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product and the first shipment came with 5 different very small bottles and 2 small sample bottles of some otehr garbage. This product barely worked and two weeks later I was billed again $39.95 without knowing it we had apparently signed up for a recurring order. When I called about this the lady was not helpful and told me I had to return the package for a refund. I DID NOT ORDER THIS why should I take time to go and return it. My account was charged without authorization and I am stuck with this garbage that DOES NOT WORK!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t order it from Amazon, ordered it from the company via the celebrity studded tv ad &amp; it made my moderate acne severe &amp; my slightly oily skin very oily! I used for 3 months &amp; it didn&#x27;t do anything except exacerbate the problems! I am going to stick with Clean &amp; Clear or Neutrogena products. (Note to self, just because a pretty celebrity endorses a product [as they are paid to do so], doesn&#x27;t mean the product is worth a ****!)</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This is review from my heart. I think product is good but they keep charging my a/c and I have to call them and try to convice them to I dont need next prduct and So I have to take affort to send back and then return money even its not gurrenty to get money back and I called customer service (name-Robert) is too bad .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say Dont buy this product, STAY AWAY FROM THIS HEADACHE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> The commercials are all true.  This is a great product that is gentle but super effective.  I will be a user for life.</li>
    <li> Proactive is a waste of money; the product did not work for me and I did it for 90 days. All proactive did was dry out my skin. I found a better product a Sephora that works wonders. The Red Clay deep cleanser is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have had the worse customer experience with Pro Activ. If 0 stars were available, that&#x27;s what I would give them solely due to my customer service experience. Below is a message that I have submitted, which includes the many other attempts I&#x27;ve made to have my issues resolved. I will also continue to come back and update this review based on additional attempts made to contact their Customer Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I am sorry to be sending such a negative message, but my experiance with ProActiv Customer Service the last 5 or 6 months has hands down been the worse customer service experiance I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This message will be, at a minimum, the 5th time I&#x27;ve contacted ProActiv to try and have my issues resolved, each time being told that it would be taken care of, and yet it has been months and nothing has happened.&lt;br /&gt;It began late fall 2012, I had submitted multiple online requests to help me cancel my account. I never received any response, yet alone a response with instructions. I had purposely delayed my next product shipment so that I could cancel my account without having to deal with returning any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to no online response, the product was delivered (I believe in early/mid December). At this point I called the customer service # on the package. Due to the issues in cancelling my account, they agreed to do 2 things: 1 - mail me a return label so that I could return my package at no cost to me and receive a full refund. and also 2 - cancel my account. I am not sure if my account was cancelled or not at this point, but I definitely did not receive the return label so that I could return my package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it plenty of time, and then called AGAIN to see what was going on. The girl I talked to said that from what she could see on the system notes, a return label had already been sent to me. I assured her I never received this label. She agreed to resend. Weeks have gone by and I still have not received this return labelso that I can return my product and receive a refund. Again, I am not sure if my account was actually cancelled by customer services at this point - but it should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of not receiving the return label, I have also now received 2 additional charges in January and February for $19.95, even though my account should have been cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called in again just the other day, but this time they couldn&#x27;t even find my information in the system. I had to explain, for the 3rd time over the phone, what the situation was. The girl confirmed that my account is no longer active, agreed to send a return label, and also said that she would send some sort of form that I have to fill out to receive a refund for the $19.95 charged to me in both January and February. I requested that she send me an email confirmation detailing out what she was going to do and she agreed. I gave her my email information, and then was disconnected before I could even ask her for her name for my records. This was 3 days ago and I have not received an email comfirmation nor have I received a return label or refund request form in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been extremely patient with Pro Activ and their customer service, but this has become absolutely ridiculous. In total, Pro Activ owes me $67.84. I have never had such a poor experiance with customer service anywhere. I have an expectation to receive a full refund - even if this takes a year to complete, as well as an apology for the hassle and time I have had to put into dealing with this issue from ProActiv management.  [Contact information removed for privacy reasons]\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As additional note - 2 days later and I have not received a response for the above submitted message.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past couple of years and it has really helped me with my acne. It is not the product that I would criticize, but the company. Proactive has some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. Several times my package has not made it to my house. When I would email I would NEVER get a response. When I would call and tell them what would happen, they would tell me they would send another package...they never did. On top of that, the package is ALWAYS late by at least one or two weeks. I feel like they have very low integrity as a company. I do not trust them at all.</li>
    <li> Step 1 and 2 are okay, but step 3 is so drying that my face can&#x27;t handle it.  This system dried out my skin too much.  I would recommend this for men and women who are not prone to dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have always used proactiv and I like it a lot.  I ordered two of the 2-month supplies because I was going out of the country for six months.  Unfortunately, I did not notice before leaving that the products were due to expire the month after they arrived! Now I have 4 months worth of expired proactiv.  Do yourself a favor and just order from the proactiv company directly.</li>
    <li> this worked wonders for my cousin who&#x27;s acne was worse! it just didnt for me! I used it for almost 4 months as i was determined to be patient as sometimes products take time to work...just wasnt for me. It all depends on who it is in my opinion; as i said, worked great for my cousin who had really bad acne problems since her teenage years...&lt;br /&gt;The products expired even before i was half way through the bottle...and before it expired, the smell of the product i noticed started getting weird or maybe its just me...</li>
    <li> No instructions came with this.  Poorly packaged. Grandson loved product though. You can order when you need it which is a plus, rather than  having to join the Proactive  Club and have them sent to you every month and charging your credit card.</li>
    <li> I first bought Proactiv in a kiosk and really enjoyed the product. But then when I purchased another set of products online, I started to receive all kinds of products (and be charged for them) that I never ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called them to ask how this could be done without my authorization, they told me that when I purchased the initial product online, the web site informed me that I had to become a member (which costs over $70 and includes periodic deliveries). I am positive that I would not have signed up if I was informed of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me forever to even reach someone on the phone because there were always technical difficulties when I tried to inquire by email. And often their web page wouldn&#x27;t even work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in this company&#x27;s deceptive ways, especially since I really liked the product itself. I&#x27;ll never buy it again and will dissuade anyone who asks me from ever supporting them in the future. It&#x27;s too bad because they probably would do just fine by selling the product in an honest way, because it actually works.</li>
    <li> This crap completely ruined my skin!!!! I ordered it cuz I would get 1 or 2 zits maybe 3 at the most every once in awhile. After using this product for a week, I wake up every single morning with new zits everywhere on my face! My face is always red and dry now. I wish I could go back to before I used this crap. I wish I could be pretty and zit free again but nothing works anymore. Its been 6 months of embarrassment and agony trying to undo the mistake I made of buying and using this crap. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone EVER! It ruins your skin!!!!!!! It is junk!!!! Crap!!!! A waste of money!!!! And trying to cancel your proactive orders is a nightmare!!! Stay away from proactive!!!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the negative reviews, I&#x27;m horrified and embarrassed to think how long I&#x27;ve been using this product - without ever having bothered to dig deeper and research it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced many of the problems that others call out here: cyctic acne (exacerbated and sometimes out of control while using this product), persistent acne (isn&#x27;t it supposed to improve while using this?), chronically dry, flaky, irritated skin, and bleached bedsheets, towels, and clothing. I&#x27;m embarrassed that I continued using it for so long despite all of these red flags. Lately I&#x27;ve been consulting a nutritionist and have just now switched to a much more gentle, natural, and CHEAPER alternative. In just three days my skin is already considerably less dry, flaky, and irritated. Fingers crossed for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please please pleeeeease consider alternatives (I&#x27;m horrified to think what kind of permanent damage these acrid chemicals may have done to my skin and my health). If you still want to try it, please stop using it if you have these symptoms too. There are a million other options out there!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any pimples at all so I can&#x27;t say how good it is for clearing up acne.  What I can tell you is that it evened out my skin, made it brighter, and softer.  I wish I would have tried this years ago.  I use to wear coverup makeup just to get an even tone but since using step 1 and 2.  I don&#x27;t wear anything on my face except moisturizer.  I have never used step 3, it&#x27;s for pimples.  I like ordering through Amazon because there isn&#x27;t all that crazy auto ship and auto billing.</li>
    <li> the worst part about this product is that they keep charging your credit card over and over and over again! they were a real pain to deal with.</li>
    <li> Proactiv was the worse thing that I have ever done to my skin. I was on this stuff for about 7-8 years. Yes, it worked for me, however when I DID get pimples while on Proactiv they were large, cystic, painful pimples that were under my skin that would not go away for about a week or two. My skin was constantly dry and I had flakiness always, but USUALLY no pimples. However, my skin later looked haggard and unhealthy. A couple months ago I find out that Proactiv is horrible for your skin in the long run. My dermatologist and esthetician say that it prematurely ages your skin and since it has been taking all the oil out of your skin for so long that it is impossible to go off of it without getting major breakouts than you had even before starting Proactiv. Boy is that the truth!  I have stopped Proactiv for 2 months and my face is HORRIBLE. It flares up everyday and it is all over my face now, just not on my chin which is where my breakouts usually occur. I am trying to use only Organic products by Eminence for my face now, however it is going to be a LONG process to switch over. If you are thinking about trying Proactiv, DON&#x27;T! JUST DON&#x27;T!  It is not worth the sacrifice that you are going to have to make later on in the future for your skin. This is a HORRIBLE product backed by celebrities who get paid lots of money to endorse it. It&#x27;s horrible- don&#x27;t use it!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t clear up my acne. Used Proactiv before and it worked.  Not this time.</li>
    <li> It helps a lot with acne. I have found that you need to use all the bottles though. If you try to mix and match or skip any step you start to break out again. And never, under any circumstances, neglect to use it. Just skipping one time and I started to break out bad again. This is not a cure all and will not completely make your acne vanish but it definitely keeps it in check and will quickly heal any new zits that pop up. Warning though, when you first start it will make you break out worse than ever. Give it about a week and you&#x27;ll notice they all healed up and you have a significant decrease in overall acne. I have used many different products and this is definitely the best I have found.</li>
    <li> I received my order earlier than estimated and I love the size of this 2 month supply!  it&#x27;s a great value and I haven&#x27;t seen it this cheap anywhere!!!</li>
    <li> My tweleve year old daughter had a moderate case of acne on her forehead.  After trying multiple products with minimal or no results, we decided to give Proactive a try before taking the next step of consulting a dematologist.  We weren&#x27;t sure what to expect since it appears that there are mixed results.  However, we were both really suprised and impressed with how well and how quickly it worked!  We saw an improvement within 24 hours and ten days later, it was completely cleared up!  Her skin tone looks great too.  I have to say that we&#x27;re a \\&quot;believer\\&quot;.  It may not work for everyone, but for those in which it does, it works quick and it works very well. We were also concerned that it might be too strong for her sensitive skin, but so far, there have been no problems - no drying or redness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for anyone who wants to give it a try is to buy it through Amazon and skip the offical website of Proactive.  It appears that the customer service is questionable when it comes to canceling and who needs the headache?  Amazon&#x27;s price is the same as Proactive&#x27;s with free shipping (over $25, which it is).  You get two month&#x27;s worth (the same as Proactive) but rather than having it shipped to you automatically, you simply have to mark it on your calender to re-order every six weeks.  No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I believe I had read either on the Proactive website or someplace else that while using the product, your skin is extra sensitive to the sun and to make sure you use suntan lotion.  This appears to be quite true.  My daughter, who doesn&#x27;t usually burn, spent half the day outside a couple days after starting the product and got sunburned.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product doesn&#x27;t work.  It dried out my daughters skin so much she couldn&#x27;t use it.  She had dried, red skin - with pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the set you up on an AUTOMATIC shipping and billing system.  Supposedly this was on the order but I didn&#x27;t see it on there and got suckered into it.  It only came to my attention when they started billing me - long before I actually received the second shipment.  I \\&quot;refused delivery\\&quot; of it and had it sent back over 2 weeks ago and they still haven&#x27;t received it.  After a second billing I called and was told it would take 4-6 weeks for them to receive the shipment back!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the product bad, but the customer service is worse and I don&#x27;t appreciate their deceptive practice of automatic billing.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product directly before. So I know it comes in a box with instructions, etc. These 3 bottles came wrapped together in cellophane &amp; that&#x27;s all! It feels like we could be using someone&#x27;s leftovers or the bottles could be tampered with. Because the lids are not safety secured.</li>
    <li> My son uses this product daily. We appreciate the order being filled so quickly! It&#x27;s a lot easier than a trek to the mall!</li>
    <li> Just an FYI, they advertise this product to cost $19.95 but automatically sign you up to take the money out of your account and ship you the product every month. I called to cancel after 3 weeks and they told me I owed $71.00 for a product that they had already shipped! The product worked somewhat so it may be worth it to you but just be careful for the hidden fees.</li>
    <li> I ordered proactive a few months ago. It worked for me, but I did not know that I would keep receiving it every 6 weeks. I cancelled it and kept receiving.  I cancelled it because I do not have the money for it and I cannot use their products because I am pregnant. They are refunding those packages but they wont pay for the shipment. I also found another version of Proactive at Walmart that might not be the same quality, but worked as well. I will NOT recommend Proactive to anyone. The costumer service lady was very rude.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm on problem skin. I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne for over a year now and It&#x27;s really helping clear it up. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 days since I&#x27;ve been using the 3 step system. I ordered it because I got tired of getting those deep ulcer like pimples, the kind that get bigger once you mess with them. I also had red marks from where I had really bad ones that took forever to go away. My problem areas are forehead and chin. I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena face wash, clearasil, you name it, especially the ones that would say \\&quot; works in 4 hours\\&quot;..but nothing ever worked. Here it us the 3rd day, and that huge ulcer pimple is melted away. I&#x27;m impressed, considering that it normally took over a week for one to even begin to go away. I believe its the 3rd step that is doing the trick. I put a little extra renewing cream on it and its almost gone. The pimples on my forehead..gone. my skin is getting a little red but I think I will use a good night cream to take care of that.</li>
    <li> It works ok but is not a miracle for the price you paid!!!! They said I was enrolled in a 3 months treatment plan but I never remember signing up for that and then they charged my checking account like crazies... To the point that I have to cancelled my bank card.... They claimed that each package sent was $100 value... For that amount I rather go to the dermatologist and paid for a better medical treatment... Never again!!! Not even FREE!!!!</li>
    <li> Proactive is a terrible product!  I tried it and it basically ate the skin off my face.  Then, when you &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; it you are automatically on the replenish program.  I&#x27;ve spent time on hold to cancel and complain only to have to leave a message.  I would never, ever use this.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using this stuff, my skin got much worse and really really dry and even flaky in parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;m told, if you keep using it, your skin does get better but then you have to keep using it forever or your skin will get even worse than it was before you started using it. They put something in it that makes you skin need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this stuff is a scam.</li>
    <li> My son used this product for his acne, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really work that well for him. We continued to use the product until it ran out.</li>
    <li> I bought Proactive for my daughter who had noticeable blackheads on her nose and acne in the T-zone.  She plays a lot of sports and we thought she needed a better cleanser for her face.  I ordered Proactive- it was 3 bottles and bonus- blackhead diminisher.  The bottles were so tiny!! 28.00 for a 2 oz bottle.  I was shocked and appalled.  Imagine my surprise when I was billed another 28.00 for automatic shipment- I had no idea when I signed up that they would automatically sign me up for monthly deliveries.  The print must have been so tiny- it was invisible!!  I called to cancel and the customer service rep informed me that it was a 3 month supply billed in three increments- Over $80 worth of a product that does not work for my daughter!  WHAT?!!!!!!!!!  but, I can take it to the post office and pay $10.00 in shipping to send it back and wait 3 months for my account to be credited.  Sneaky-be careful!!!!  I will never recommend this product to anyone- it doesn&#x27;t work and they trick you into a 3 month supply.  There are more 1 star reviews than there are 5 or any other star reviews- negative reviews are almost double the positive reviews- BE CAREFULLLL!!!</li>
    <li> This product is way overpriced. Here is what you get with this kit:&lt;br /&gt;Bottle 1 is a face cleanser with no active ingredient (nothing special);&lt;br /&gt;Bottle 2 is a cream with one active ingredient: Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle 3 is another cream with one active ingredient: Salicylic Acid 0.5%.&lt;br /&gt;These active ingredients are common, very easily available. You can find creams with these active ingredients on Amazon at much higher concentrations at much lower prices.  These low concentrations may be enough to just contain the acne bacteria, not kill it, so you will continue to need the product.  Hence the monthly kits...</li>
    <li> As my daughter put it, Proactive helps her be in control.  It doesn&#x27;t magically erase pimples but it puts her in the drivers seat and helps her feel like she can wake up with clearer skin instead of more nasty surprises that formed in the night.  There is a direct correlation between how regularly she uses it (twice a day produces best results) and how well she eats, exercises and drinks water.  When she is doing all those things she enjoys a beautiful healthy glow with minimal pimples and few blackheads.  Before proactive, all the healthy food, exercise and water still couldn&#x27;t stop the acne from flaring and it was really frustrating.  With Proactive, she is able to use healthy hygiene habits and actually see results.  I am grateful to those who posted about the snares of buying directly from the company.  We bought from a private party (Morning Beauty) and had a simple, fast delivery with no strings attached and no reoccurring payments.  This is strong stuff so it will most likely dry out skin to the point of peeling if you don&#x27;t add a high quality moisturizer.  My daughter uses Bare Minerals Five Oil Blend and she radiates with a healthy glow and no peeling.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of healthy oil moisturizers and don&#x27;t buy cheap.  They last forever because so little does the trick so it&#x27;s worth it.  Plus, if you are going to invest in Proactive, don&#x27;t waste your money by not getting all the elements you need to be successful.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that I used this product and it&#x27;s horrible. It makes my skin raw. My best friend is a dermatologist and highly advises against it. It has been proven to prematurely age your skin. Also, their customer service is ridiculous. I spent half a year convincing them to stop sending me the product and they repeatedly argued with me about my attempts to cancel...yet kept charging me. Don&#x27;t fall for their tricks. Read the fine lines or spend the same amount of money for some dermalogica which has transformed my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff did nothing for my skin! Actually, seems like it made it worse and my skin was so dry.</li>
    <li> This is my second time in the last few years trying this product as a young adult with acne. I was asked to try it for just two weeks and after one I refuse to use it again. I plan on calling them and getting the money back. In the first use of this product me skin burnt and felt raw with every step (I&#x27;ve had facials, I&#x27;ve experienced skincare that was supposed to be a little painful, but NONE of it hurt as badly as this does- every single time you use it) and although I did see clearer pores my skin is dry, rough and appears to be thin. Without makeup I honestly look about 30 years older than I am because of only one week with this product. The \\&quot;life\\&quot; and glow have been taken out of my skin and my skin is so dry that I feel like a girl with very very intense botox all over her face. I would rather have severe cystic acne than have my skin feel the way it does when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on their website they have NO place for honest reviews for their product, it is an absolute gimmick.</li>
    <li> I gave these products as a gift to a teen aged male. He is thrilled with the results and I am so glad I decided to give him Pro Active.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  I was automatically enrolled in an automatic shipment/payment schedule.  It was not working for her so I returned the product expecting a refund and cancelled the membership only after having them repeatedly trying to talk me out of it... The next month rolls around and yet another payment comes out of my account.  I call them up again and was told that they had received the product and that I would have a refund to my account by the end of the following week minus the shipping.  The amount to be deposited will be $59.85.  A week and a half rolls around, I check my bank account, still no refund.  I call them back only to have them tell me they have not received the product back and I will not get a refund until they do.... Very upset!!!!  Not only will I not receive my money back, I have no products to show for it and I got rid of the tracking info, thinking it was a done deal because I was told it was received ...</li>
    <li> Wow!  Horrible customer service. Everything said below is true about them making it hard to cancel and they try and get more and more money from you!  The try to make it sound like you&#x27;re getting it for $29.95 and its soooooo not that. They charge you a $100. I cancelled my service in April and today I received a past due notice for $29.95. They wouldn&#x27;t really talk to me on the phone. Just saying that they basically give you one shipment of these TINY little bottles for $100 broken down into three payments. What a joke as that&#x27;s not what was advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want proactiv just get it through the mall and don&#x27;t give them any info to subscribe you because I actually had selected not to be on a subscription and low and behold I was put on one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post this all over to warn people about them!</li>
    <li> I gave them 2 stars and that is only because I have not tried the product yet. I ordered it, not realizing that I would keep getting shipments. If I had known that, I would not have ordered it at all. I called to tell them that I just wanted to try it and that I wanted to cancel my membership. I said that if I liked it, I would just order it again later. The customer service rep told me several times that she would push back the next shipment date. I repeatedly told her no. She badgered me until I wanted to scream, then finally told me that she would cancel my account. Now I am very weary. I am not sure if they cancelled it or not. They are supposed to send a cancellation email in 24 hours (anyone know why EVERYTHING takes so long with this company?). If they don&#x27;t, I will be the one badgering them. I refuse to let my account go to collections because they do not do what they say. We will see if I get the email. If I do, I will be holding on to it so that they can&#x27;t try to charge me later and I will not be reordering this product, whether it works or not. Terrible customer service.</li>
    <li> I have battled acne most of my life but it cleared up considerably the last couple of years. I suddenly started getting break outs on my neck and decided to try Proactiv. It worked great and did not dry out my skin like other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old son loves this product!  He won&#x60;t use anything else to keep his skin clear!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My son has been using the product for 2 years and loves it but doesn&#x27;t use it regularly only when needed.  It was simple to cancel.  We had to cancel because we had too much product</li>
    <li> Received fast &amp; works great!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Proactiv. The worst costumer service. Aren&#x27;t very clear on how the shipping and pricing would be done. &amp; very rude when trying to help explain everything. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ever going to them. It&#x27;s a hoax. Just for money. Go to a derm so much less money involve &amp; they use different ingredients THAT ACTUALLY WORK!!!!!!!  I wouldn&#x27;t even give 1 star</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how Proactive works because I never recieved my order! Won&#x27;t even go into the trouble I had there. I can say however that if you are in the market for Proactive stick to ordering from anyone BUT Proactive.com! Trust me it&#x27;s a mistake!</li>
    <li> You have got to realized that you are paying 30$ every 2 months that being said ima go to the review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its been a year since i last used proactive (using it for a month)&lt;br /&gt;The stuff spells neutral not great not bad kinda pleasant, it worked for me for a couple weeks but with the downside of putting my oil glands into overdrive midway threw the day my face would be shining due to proactive i would have to wipe off all the oil/grease every hour or 2 while in school because my face was that covered. I figured my skin just wasn&#x27;t used to it so i kept on using it for month but my skin never calmed down it still made my face shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i stopped and went to my normal face washer, my oil glands were still messed up from the proactive that it took 3 months for my face to stop producing excessive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line this product works (was very minimal results cleared up a bit of my acne and kept it under control) but is not worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also 60$ for 4 months can buy you top brand face wash scrub and toner (pretty much what proactive is) for a year</li>
    <li> I ordered it ONCE only one kit for like $34. Then i saw how they had Auto-Shipments which i was NOT interested in participating in and they had NO WAY OF CANCELING AUTO-SHIPMENTS just postponing them for a max of 20 weeks, so i called them to cancel my account, they had already taken the money for that month and sent the shipment which was no biggy at the time, but thats how it starts.. all innocent.. i canceled my account and was informed that i would no longer be receiving Auto-Shipments and they would no longer charge my card. YAY just little issue that was solved.. or so i thought. So thinking nothing of it the next month i go on a shopping spree and leave very little in my account maybe like $20 bucks then a few days later i get an e-mail for my bank &amp;#34;OVER DRAFT PROTECTION ENABLED&amp;#34; Proactiv had for some reason charged my card again EVEN THOUGH I HAD CANCELED MY MEMBERSHIP/ACCOUNT WITH THEM and over drafted my account. But apparently since they already had my info stored who cares? we&#x27;ll just keep charging her card. So i called them find out what was going on and they said i would receive another kit soon, and i was like but my membership with proactiv is cancelled and the customer service lady said that i was already scheduled for another shipment well i was furious but the lady reassured me that there would be no more shipments or charges to my card so i was like fine ok whatever and went one with my life and then i got the shipment that i was charged for and the bottles were a lot bigger then the other ones i had, i didnt think anything of it because the customer service lady said i would not be charged anymore. SO the next month GUESS WHAT... THEY CHARGE MY CARD i called them again this time i was raging md wondering what they think they are doing to someone who isnt even their customer anymore and they said the the shipment i had received that was bigger then the rest was more expensive (like over $100) and that i would be billed in three payments the charge for this month was the second one and i would still have another payment to make and then i repeated what the other two women i have called said and she said that all she could do was give me half off for the next shipment so i asked for her supervisor and i told the supervisor i would just return it for a full refund and she quickly told me no that they would just keep the two payments i &amp;#34;owed&amp;#34; and not charge me for the next/last payment (basically she didnt want to return the money). The supervisor told me that i will no longer be receiving anything and not be charged anything. This time i learned from my past experiences did not believe these liars and canceled my credit card and got a new one. ALL OF THIS FOR A FACE CLEANSER. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. The product itself wasnt even that great it wasnt even the best i had tried, i ended up with an acne cream my doctor proscribed that cleared me up in no time. Guys if after all this you still want to try this product just call them and theyll tell you nearest STORE where you can buy it.he charge for this month was the second one and i would still have another payment to make and then i repeated what the other two women i have called said and she said that all she could do was give me half off for the next shipment so i asked for her supervisor and i told the supervisor i would just return it for a full refund and she quickly told me no that they would just keep the two payments i &amp;#34;owed&amp;#34; and not charge me for the next/last payment (basically she didnt want to return the money). The supervisor told me that i will no longer be receiving anything and not be charged anything. This time i learned from my past experiences did not believe these liars and canceled my credit card and got a new one. ALL OF THIS FOR A FACE CLEANSER. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. The product itself wasnt even that great it wasnt even the best i had tried, i ended up with an acne cream my doctor proscribed that cleared me up in no time. Guys if after all this you still want to try this product just call them and theyll tell you nearest STORE where you can buy it.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, although over priced...BUT the customer service is horrible!!! Every single time I call with questions I end up frustrated. I moved and updated my address before moving, but for some reason proactive sent my next three shipments to my old address. When I would call to inquire on where my shipment was or what was going on they would tell me that it was sent (to my old address, even though I updated it EVERY SINGLE TIME). To top it off each time they told me there was nothing they could do to help me. I have had to contact the postal service, and new residents because of proactive&#x27;s errors that they refuse to fix. I also called today to cancel, since I have yet again not received my shipment, and was told &amp;#34;Sorry I can only answer your questions not update any account information because our systems are having maintenance.&amp;#34; How can a company be so horrible to customers, especially ones who are paying such big bucks. So basically NEVER buy proactive. Get the knock off brands for a third of a price, they literally do the same thing.</li>
    <li> I used Proactive for years.  I have very mild acne, and Proactive kept my skin balanced and really seemed to control the few breakouts I had.  I was very satisfied with their product.  Well, times are tough everywhere, so I am always looking for ways to cut back.  I started researching other acne control products that might not be as pricey.  Let&#x27;s face it, people on a limited income cannot afford these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, I now use the Walmart Equate brand \\&quot;Acne Treatment System\\&quot;.  The ingredients are IDENTICAL (except that they are listed in a different order on the package, which indicates the amount of that each chemical in their formula).  I&#x27;ve been using the Equate brand product for about 5 months now and see absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in how well it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Equate system is $11.97 for the same 3 items you get from Proactive at $45.00.  And, as a plus, you can usually find the invidual products on the shelf.  One of the inconveniences of purchasing Proactive is that you had to buy all 3 products at once, regardless of whether or not you actually needed them.  The individual products run about $4.12 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I left Proactive, they constantly send me letters and specials, begging me to go back to using their product.  I just can&#x27;t justify it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big believer in using store brand products whenever possible.  I&#x27;m really excited about the nearly 30% savings resulting from the little bit of research I did.</li>
    <li> First of all, spend your money to go see a dermatologist if you have acne you will come out cheaper. This product is no better than your standard drug store benzoyl peroxide wash. Furthermore, you have to jump through proverbial hoops to opt out of their delivery program. It falls on your shoulders to ship back their inept product. As a small business owner and with the customer service industry- the customer is always right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old female who has struggled with acne ever since jr high. It&#x27;s never been really bad taking over my entire face, but it can&#x27;t remember a time when I didn&#x27;t have at least 1 zit either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1:&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so, I decided to try proactiv for the first time about 3 weeks ago. I was super excited to get started, but after a week of use... I HATED it.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it dry out my skin leaving it red and sensitive, but it made my acne WORSE. It was like everything had surfaced leaving me with a pimple covered chin, forehead, nose... my whole t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;I was about to send it all back for the refund (which I&#x27;ve read they actually don&#x27;t give you), but I decided to modify the way I was using it and see if that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2:&lt;br /&gt;I went down to once a day use at night (I use LUSH face products in the morning) and added in a GOOD oil-free moisturizer. (Don&#x27;t use the ones they give you for free, there&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re free let me tell ya) My dryness went away, and amazingly, once all the zits I had healed, I noticed that there weren&#x27;t any more appearing. It felt like that first week was like a detox, bringing all the toxins and bacteria to the surface (aka causing zits) but once they healed, my skin wasn&#x27;t producing any more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3:&lt;br /&gt;Once my skin adjusted to the product I went back to 2 times a day use (unless my skin feels dry) and continued to use my deep moisturizer. So far it&#x27;s been wonderful. No painful, ugly zits, and for the first time ever, I don&#x27;t have to use any CONCEALER. Hallelujah!!! My skin is acne free! I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but so far it really is working and I hope it stays that way. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product. The people however.... I still think its punk that once you order they make you go through hell to cancel them charging your card and sending you more every month. I just changed my frequency of ordering to the longest option online, which is 20 weeksso that way I&#x27;m free to click the \\&quot;ship now\\&quot; button when I want to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> My acne started when I was 16. When I turned 19 the breakouts worsened. For 3 years I used every drugstore acne face wash imaginable and no matter what I tried I would still have horrible breakouts that took weeks to clear up. I would avoid leaving the house. I never let anyone see me without make up. I was so self conscious about it and nothing I did helped.  A friend recommended I try proactiv, but I was nervous because I had heard how difficult it was to cancel. I gave it a try, and I can tell you right now it doesn&#x27;t matter how hard it is to cancel because I never plan to. My skin started clearing up the very next day after using the 3 step system and within 3 days it was completely clear. 7 months later I have not had a single zit, pimple, blackhead, anything. I&#x27;m amazed at how well this product works. The refining mask works miracles if you feel you might have a breakout coming. Plus, you can change how often you receive the shipments to fit your needs. If you find you are receiving bottles faster than you can use them, you can stretch out the dates between shipments. I get a shipment once every 2.5 months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will never use another face wash again.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE!!!!!! Seriously. The product made my acne worse, customer service sucked when I called to see what I should do, and when I canceled they continued to charge me and just terrible seriously. NO PROACTIV!!!!!!! I have  aserious hate for them after what their product did to my face (I USED CORRECTLY), AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRRRRRRIBLE!!! OMG. Worse than any cable company you can imagine. Their &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; always makes billing mistakes. lol. Pathetic. Go to a dermatologist. It will save you time, money, and extra stress, and it will ACTUALLY WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for a few years now, with great results.  She keeps asking me for more.  Her skin always looks fresh, and clean.  She is religious with her skin regimens, and this product is definitely a key to her skins flawless look.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I only read some of the reviews after I return my product. I bought the product for my son, but when we went to the dermatologist she recommended other products and said that this was not the right product for my son&#x27;s acne. I then proceeded to return(remember money back guaranteed!). However they sent me another shipment and now my nightmare begins. First of all I did not know they would automatically send me the product, then they charge your credit card in 3 installments. After I return the product and cancel the product over the phone they keep charging me. I return the product in April, they still charge for the product in June !!!! They claimed they have not received the return!!! I simply DISLIKE this company and all their sales tactics!!!Someone at customer service said they will send me a piece of paper to fill out so I can get the return. I am guessing I will have this solved by Christmas!!!! So I hope. Bottom line: Beware of their sale tactics.</li>
    <li> Eleven calls to their support line and finally demanding they remove my credit card from my account. These are the most clueless people I have ever dealt with. As a manager of a call center I would fire every incompetent idiot there.  They never know what has shipped why multiple charges are on your account and always ask for you to call back in a couple of days. I asked for a supervisor and that was nixed right off the bat. You suck Proactiv. Good-bye</li>
    <li> I was expecting what was advertised on TV and after 2 months still no results.I guess I should have known better.</li>
    <li> My son has used this for 2 months seems to work for him.  His face looks clear.  He likes the way it feels on his face.</li>
    <li> The 3 step kit was fine, and I&#x27;ve heard others swear by it, but even if I truly loved this product (which, honestly, I didn&#x27;t) it would not be worth the hassle of dealing with the super sketchy people at Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it once, decided it was too strong, and called to cancel any future shipments. The woman on the phone offered to send me a free sample of the sensitive formula, which I could try and decide I liked. I agreed, but asked her to cancel my standing order in the meantime. The sensitive stuff seemed to work better, and I was actually considering ordering it when a giant box came to my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv had shipped me a whole new order (of the regular strength stuff, which I had made clear I did not want anymore, ever.). I want nothing to do with a company that will charge my credit card as it pleases and sends me stuff without asking my permission first. I was informed that a refund would take several weeks and that I would not be refunded shipping costs. They told me that my account had not been canceled but merely \\&quot;put on pause\\&quot;. Clearly my fault for not understanding that \\&quot;cancel my order\\&quot; is proactive speak for \\&quot;wait a few months and then resume billing me when I&#x27;m not looking anymore.\\&quot; Scamsville.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, while Proactiv is taking their sweet time processing my return (of the product I never requested, for which I am still being charged shipping) I continue to receive bills for \\&quot;installments\\&quot; asking me to pay for the product I never ordered and have already returned to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy being billed for stuff you didn&#x27;t want and then harassed about making prompt payments on it from a company that inexplicably needs 8 weeks to process a return, by all means call proactive and place an order with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had terrible acne for most of my life and tried Proactive once before about 15 years ago with no success.  After a round of Accutane in high school things cleared up really well for about 10 years.  The last few years it&#x27;s slowly started to creep back but not nearly severe enough to necessitate another round of Accutane.  I tried grocery store brands (Oil of Olay, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, etc) as well as expensive department store brands (Philosophy, BeFine, Korres, etc) with no success so I thought this would be a good last ditch effort before I went back to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four days after starting the system I woke up with blistered, burned, flaking skin.  So much for a last ditch effort.  Not even Retin-A or Acctuane did this to my skin.  And don&#x27;t get me started on the return process - SUCH A HASSLE.  If you can live without the $20 don&#x27;t even bother trying.  It&#x27;ll take months and they&#x27;ll harass and guilt you every step of the way.  The nice thing is you can cancel overtheir live chat now so it&#x27;s a little less awkward, but no less of a pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> Be VERY careful of the \\&quot;club\\&quot; membership aspect of this product.  VERY subtle, yet you will keep receiving the product on an ongoing basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product did not really work for my son.  Ads are very compelling, but the product didn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING WARNING WARNING ... you will be sent (and charged for) refills every month - very tough to cancel.  Expensive product AND expensive return shipping!!</li>
    <li> cleared up my light acne once i started using it , i suggest you get it if you have a little to high acne problem</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the full 30 days, have not noticed any results, thats when I decided to try out something better a clay mask, first time I have used the clay mask I started noticing some results right away... the ads proactiv use are with people who had never had any acne... and news flash justin bieber never had any acne either he always had clear face,  girls are only using proactiv because proactiv is saying bieber uses it but that stuff does not work... unless they make the dosage a little bit stronger it might just work, but the way they have it now dont waste your money on proactiv...</li>
    <li> Proactiv Solution worked well for me. I&#x27;ve receive compliments on my smooth skin after using it. I&#x27;ve noticed that after using it, my face, especially my forehead, would glean, so I now only use it before going to bed and I wake up with a nice clear face. The reduction of red spots and moderate acne are a big plus. The downside to using Proactiv may be the slight bleaching of clothes/bed sheets. I&#x27;ve switch to white bed sheets so now it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed many complaints about the inability to cancel the automatic payment. The number to call is 1800-235-6050. When I called to place an order, this is the number the lady, Elizabeth, gave me for cancelling the constant payment cycle. Although I haven&#x27;t personally called it, for those with trouble cancelling, try it out and hopefully it can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for Proactiv working to clear my skin (I&#x27;m an Asian male)&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for customer service (even Chinese restaurants have better service)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5 stars overall (rounds up to 4 stars)</li>
    <li> This junk simply does not work, it&#x27;s not worth the money spent. There is a hidden clause that allows them to automatically bill your checking account, &amp; when you try to cancel they give you a hassle. Definitely NOT worth it!!</li>
    <li> Not only is the product highly ineffective, but the customer service through Proactiv is atrocious.  The product will show almost zero improvement after 3 weeks of use,and this is with minimal acne.  Expect to be billed and hit with random fees.  I ordered a one month supply at $19.95 and they hit you with an automatic signup for a $100 three month supply.  Saw the fees on my credit card, it turns out they put it as a hidden clause when you order.  They refused to refund any of it even though the second supply hadn&#x27;t even shipped.  Definitely DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> You can get a prescription from your doctor that works better and is stronger for $10.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. After using for awhile my son decided he didn&#x27;t want to keep using it. I contacted the company and cancelled the products which seemed easy enough to do. Two weeks later we received another shipment and they charged me again. After dealing with customer service I was able to return it for a refund. So I sent it back. Then it was returned to me! So I contacted them again and again set it up for refund and got a return label from them. I sent it back and here it is months later and I still have not received a refund from them. So they took over $60 of the 3 payments and still have not refunded. If you decide to buy it buy it from a kiosk, you can&#x27;t trust them to cancel your account when you decide to do it, and good luck getting your money back, even if you cancelled it prior to them shipping. Bad company, bad customer service. Easy to sign up for, hard to get out of. Run from them if you care for your money.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! You will end up with a monthly charge on your credit card and unwanted overpriced product on your doorstep. I will never buy this product again. The product itself is mediocre at best and their sales tactics are that of your typical late night, TV infomercial. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Hi, I have used Proactive for a week now, and my acne has faded very much. I am very excited to see what my results are after I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, some people say this made there acne worse, due to there skin drying, but this never happened to me. Even if it does happen to you, they include a moisturizer, so, no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Proactive is touted as being the #1 acne solution out there. It&#x27;s pricey by itself and then add S&amp;H--ouch! Worse, you get stuck in a revolving door of automatic re-order and their customer service sucks. Don&#x27;t be conned by the magazine endorsements or the glossy commercials with famous personalities and &#x27;every day&#x27; customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience and friends who&#x27;ve tried it as well, this product only works on light acne, but then, it doesn&#x27;t even completely clear your skin, and while it is gentle and keeps your skin soft, if you stop using it and then start using it later on, your skin may react badly to it. Or it does nothing at all or it works for a couple of weeks then your acne comes back with a vengeance. It makes me think they altered the formula or concentrations, and you just don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re buying the real thing or a diluted form and just buying the name and reputation of the product. I used this as a teen and in my early twenties and while it cleared some of my acne, it never cleared it fully but I got it because it was gentle on my skin--something that, at that time, most products weren&#x27;t because they contained alcohol or some other strong astringent. These days, a lot of OTC and AFFORDABLE products exist, like the NEUTROGENA ACNE STRESS CONTROL line of acne products, which I&#x27;ve been using since quitting Proactive, and it works sooooo much better on my skin than Proactive ever did. Maybe age has something to do with it or I&#x27;ve outgrown a stage of acne or the product itself has changed throughout the years, but Proactiv has never been a cure all, folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole pain the neck and infuriating ordeal happened when I was stupid enough to get lured by the travel sized version being advertised on TV for $19.99 a couple of months ago, and mostly to get the dark spot remover, which was free with the order. Free--yeah, right. I gave the travel size, which is tiny, to someone else and it only lasts for a month or less. Keep in mind that if you order directly (and not like here where it&#x27;s third party), you&#x27;ll get enrolled in automatic re-delivery with no way to opt out and they charge your CC without notifying you they&#x27;re about to charge your card. You can&#x27;t delete your card info on your account and more often than not, when you try to change the frequency, the system doesn&#x27;t save it (how convenient) when it tells you that it did, and when you try to send an email through you account, that doesn&#x27;t usually work either because the security element to verify you are you never lets you through; and if, by some luck you are able to send an email via your account, more often than not it &#x27;appears&#x27; to go through but then when you call them up to ask why you haven&#x27;t received a response--they tell you no email was sent. And then you tell the CS person that you don&#x27;t want the product, that you want your refund, to cancel your account, they give you the BS run around and try to get you to buy other products! They sent me a box of the stuff when I&#x27;d asked them to delete my account, then told me it was too late to rescind the order and that when it came, I&#x27;d have to send it back and get refunded--but I&#x27;d still have to pay for the S&amp;H even though IT WAS THEIR FAULT! They tell you it&#x27;ll take 6 or more weeks to get the refund even if you return it the day it arrives, which I did. WTF? After over a month and constant calling, I finally got my refund but not the full amount and they&#x27;ve been email bombing my address and email account with new products I should try even though I asked them 3 times to take me off their mailing lists. UGH. The fact that they even gave me a refund is a miracle, which is soooo not right! I just wish I&#x27;d never heard of this horrible product and company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Proactive if you truly believe nothing exists out there for your acne woes, have the bucks to pay for it and don&#x27;t buy directly from the company, but BUYER BEWARE! My advice, go to your local store and shop around--you may savesome money and you might just find a set of products that work just as, or even more effectively, than Proactiv.some money and you might just find a set of products that work just as, or even more effectively, than Proactiv.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever.  I had mild acne on my cheeks and thought I would try this to clear it.  Ordered what I thought was a one time kit and tried it.  My whole face broke out in horrid acne plus itching and peeling.  Decided it was not good and I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.  Unfortunately the company had other plans and had unknown to me signed me up for repeat shipments.  When I got another kit in the mail I immediately called and cancelled and shipped it back.  Now I am still battling them for a refund and they are threatening me with going to collections on the remainder of what they say I owe them for something I shipped back.  I have repeatedly contacted them and they reassure me that its taken care of and then I get another bill and threat.  I would never use this again and I would avoid this company.  I switched to skinceuticals and my skin is perfect now.  It cost more but actually works and no hassle.  I order what I want and reorder what I want without worry.</li>
    <li> My daughter worked a minimum wage job in college and bought this stuff awhile back. It does not work. Period. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this junk!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv for about six years and cannot imagine using any other facial cleansing product. I was absolutely thrilled to see Proactv offered by Amazon. Delivery time was GREAT. Will definitely recommend to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Never use proactiv. I have mild acne before but after using this product my acne have never been worst.. Never</li>
    <li> The proactive treatment in itself did not work as quickly as the little face wash(it came in a little white bottle and it was a baby blue color ) that I recieved as a free gift did. I started using just the face wash after I was done with my trial proactive and then I then I gradually stopped using the system and just the face wash. About two weeks after using the little face wash my acne was GONE!!!! That was about nine months ago and I&#x27;ve stopped using proactive since, my face isnt as clear as it was then when I get mother nature&#x27;s gift I get little petty breakouts and some maybe throughout the month but nothing like before I started using proactive. Just as long as I keep my face clean in the morning and before bed my skin does well. I use ST.IVES apricrot scrub in the morning and then wipe my face off with a nocxema pad afterwards AND I wipe my face before bed too. When I get more $$$ in my hands I will get some more face definitely....</li>
    <li> I started using Procative in 2010 when I had a terrible acne outbreak. It worked like a miracle after almost two months, but I have to mention that I had to endure months of burning pain because it burns your skin. Nonetheless, I continued using it because I rather had my skin burned for a few minutes a day than the terrible acne I was having. The acne left after three months, and I continued using Proactive ever since. However, it made my skin so dry, their moisturizer is terrible, does not work at all. But I put up with it because the acne was gone. This year however, the acne came back again. I did not stop using Proactive, but the acne is back for three months now and it is as if I am not using anything. I don&#x27;t know why this products stopped working suddenly. And I still have almost full containers that I paid for. I so hate it like crazy. I am going to toss this crap today as soon as I get home. After the sacrifices I made, burned skin and dry skin :(</li>
    <li> The product never worked for me, but just my acne have gotten more. Other people also mentioned that the company is dishonest and their product is worthless scam. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. In addition, there is no real solution to acne problem yet, even if various companies claim they can help. However, one product worked for me which my dermatologist prescribed. i think it was duo something, i don&#x27;t remember full name. you can Google it. In bief, avoid this product. you can try, but it does not work.</li>
    <li> I started breaking out just 4 months ago, and after 2 months of no improvement, i finally decided to resort to proactiv plus system. Immediately after using their product, i started to notice my skin was getting worse. i called them after a month of using and they gave me the &amp;#34;it makes it worse before it really gets better&amp;#34;  talk. The lady told me to wait another two weeks and it will get better. I listened to her and my skin is now worse than it ever was.  I called again but every time i mentioned that their products weren&#x27;t working for me and that i wanted to cancel my subscription, they quickly gave excuses like their system just got &amp;#34;shut down&amp;#34; or their computer was &amp;#34;acting up&amp;#34; and that i should try calling back in 10 minutes. After the first few calls of that, i finally got someone who actually had a working computer and managed to cancel my subscription. But i couldn&#x27;t return their products because i missed their 60 day return policy by a day. I just wasted over $200 worth of products that did nothing for me. I recommend seeing a professional first before wasting your money on this. And if the professional suggest to try proactiv, then see another professional.</li>
    <li> I buy here because the dont require a debit card to charge you monthly orderts and payments.  I can control my purchases as I need them..</li>
    <li> We placed a 1 time order. My wife specifically said no membership. A month later they charged us for another order. We called and were told we had a subscription which we immediately cancelled. 3 months later we got a bill from a COLLECTION AGENCY!! Now I can&#x27;t even get them on the phone. Thanks for damaging my credit score Proactive.</li>
    <li> Not only do I like this product, I LOVE the fact that I don&#x27;t have to belong to a &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; to purchase it.  I can buy it when I need it and  not be hassled by the company or have extra product in my medicine cabinet working it&#x27;s way to expiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff</li>
    <li> Another great proactive product. Very small kit, suitable if you&#x27;re frequently on-the-go. Go for a larger supply if you might use it longer than 2 months.</li>
    <li> I got this horrible product for my gf. Never buy this product, they make you buy a kit and then they charge your card 3 more time because they send you an extra kit, and if you try to return the kit you have to pay 20 dollars and you still have to pay!. I ended up spending more than 100 dollars when they said it was going to be 20 dollars! disgusting company and product...</li>
    <li> Proactive works well as long as your kids follow the directions.  When they get lazy and don&#x27;t use it the acne comes back.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for my daughter. Although I am not sure if she used the product regularly. My biggest complaint is ordering it on-line. I ordered the trial on-line and did not realize I was on an automatic membership. So I was surprised when I received a shipment. When I called Proactive, I was transferred several times to cancel the membership. I have to pay for the shipping to send it back. This shipment that I received was a 3 month supply and they bill you in monthly installments. Of course they have my credit card on file since I ordered on-line. So they will keep billing me until they receive what I am returning. Very frustrating!!!!</li>
    <li> Great great, great, GREAT product by Proactiv, Will be using these products again, again. They were shipped on time also.</li>
    <li> While I did not purchase the Proactiv kit from Amazon, I felt the need to write a review. I&#x27;ve always had good skin up until a couple weeks ago. I woke up scratching this.....THING on my jawline. Couldn&#x27;t pop it, could barely cover it.....I was devastated. Within a day I sprouted two more. Call me vain, but I actually wanted to call into work. I googled, came up with nothing. I purchased a typical acne cleanser and used it a few days, while covering with foundation. No results. I remembered my mother using Proactiv when I was younger, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. There&#x27;s this wonderful VENDING MACHINE in the mall.....No salespeople, and no monthly subscription! Bought the kit, started using it the sane night. My total blemish count that night was 8. Today is my  3rd full day of using it......and it&#x27;s glorious. The monstrosities on my face are retreating back into the hell from which they came. Maybe I won&#x27;t even wear foundation tomorrow, who knows....&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the price. Worth it, but really it could be more affordable.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to believe reviews on anything unless you&#x27;ve experienced it for yourself but I&#x27;ve tried proactiv three different times now throughout the past ten years and it has never once worked for me! My skin seemed like it was getting better in the first two weeks and then it was almost like it just stopped working, and my skin actually got worse as time went on and I still continued to use it. I have had moderate acne for almost 15 years now along with my skin being sensitive and very oily. The other thing that really bothered me about proactiv was the products actually made my skin more oily and it was almost embarrassing how oily my skin was only ten minutes after putting the products on. Congrats to anyone who had great results with proactiv!!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the product, but my skin got use to Proactiv so I decided to change. Nobody explained that they were going to charge me $60 in three installments until AFTER they took the money. I hate how you have to sign up for continuous shipments, and find it greedy and shady the way they handle business. I have never been so infuriated. I will definitely not be doing business with Proactiv again and make sure my friends use better and less expensive products!</li>
    <li> be careful when ordering this product with the automatic shipping option. When I was scheduled to move I notified proactive and even sent them a letter. Not only did they continue to send their product to an address I no longer lived at but then insisted on charging me. I had moved to another state and even after explaining in great detail they hurt my credit rating. They were rude and discourteous on the phone and harassment is an understatement. Take your child to a dermatologist its covered by insurance in most cases and far more effective</li>
    <li> I always had an oily face. When I was in high school, I had a few pimples every so often like a typical teenager. As I got older, the pimples became few and far in between, but I would still get pimples if I didn&#x27;t use a good face wash.  When I turned 30, I began to get more and more pimples regardless of the face wash I used. I would sometimes get massive pimples larger than the ones I got when I was a teenager. I washed my face more often and still had problems. A google search on how to treat acne showed me this product and I remembered the TV commercials. I decided to try it out despite the cost. I began to see immediate results. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I&#x27;ll get a random tiny pimple here and there because of my oily face. I don&#x27;t always wash twice a day as it recommends because of my hectic schedule. But I don&#x27;t get any large pimples or breakouts anymore. I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product works. I used it as instructed. It didn&#x27;t dry up my skin and didn&#x27;t see any of my acne go away.</li>
    <li> Works moderately well, but their shipping is horrible.  Product goes out as late as one week after the estimated shipping date on their website.</li>
    <li> The Proactiv Company is a scam. You will be charged multiple times without your awareness after you buy even one product. I bought one starter kit just to test the product for $60.00. Then, 6 months later, I was charged $192.00 for a \\&quot;90 day supply\\&quot; of product that I did not even receive. I have not been and never will be reimbursed for the nearly $200.00 that was falsely charged to my credit card account. Save your money and frustration--go see a real dermatologist for less money.</li>
    <li> According to an in-depth Consumer Reports study, this product is no better than much cheaper drugstore products.  Many of these products share the same active ingredients as Proactiv after all.  Be forewarned this company will start you on a subscription that will be difficult to get out of.  There are numerous complaints all over the web.  EDIT:  We eventually were able to cancel our subscription but they robbed us one last time by shipping us (and charging for) a 90-day kit instead of the 30-day one.</li>
    <li> Proactive has charged me 3 times in 3 weeks with another charge pending.  They signed me up for 2 accounts and take out funds automatically...BEWARE..they are scammers.  I only signed up once and called with no avail!!!</li>
    <li> I had moderately severe acne and tried this. I waited a few months to see how the treatment would pan out. This system barely even worked on reducing the redness of my pimples. It never reduced the amount of acne I had. I eventually found a routine of products that completely cleared my acne. I was very disappointed to lean that this system doesn&#x27;t work, especially after hearing and reading so many testimonials. The spot treatment heavily irritated my skin and smells terrible. They rope you in to spend money for something they claim is amazing. Hardly the case.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I had seen the infomercials about Proactiv, but I had read review online about how people said it made their acne worse and that the company is a hassle to deal with. So I didn&#x27;t bother. However, my mother had seen the same infomercials and decided to get my Proactiv anyways (for the record, she bought it at a kiosk but when she started getting charged for the auto shipments, she promptly returned it...I can&#x27;t say how easy or difficult it was for her to do it, but we never got anymore shipments after that and I haven&#x27;t heard her complain about how hard it was to get a refund...so there&#x27;s that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I put off using Proavtic for a long time, even though my mother was insistent about making me at least try it. So recently, I started using it. I would describe my acne as more than moderate, but definitely less than severe. I use the entire system once day in the morning before I went to school. Instead of experiencing a relief from my acne (or at least no change) it actually made my acne worse. I know it wasn&#x27;t just \\&quot;my skin getting used to the product\\&quot;, it was legitimately causing pretty bad acne that had never been there before. I only experienced relief when I STOPPED using it. I was then left with more acne than when I started. I have since stopped all usage of Proactiv and now only use baby wash/shampoo until I can fine something else...it&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper, has actually helped to clear my acne and definitely not as harsh as the Proactiv system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I do not recommend Proactiv at all. It&#x27;s extremely expensive, and does not provide any acne-clearing benefits that couldn&#x27;t be found in a simple drugstore acne kit.</li>
    <li> I used proactive for several years, they now have many products and you can customize your kit, what you want, how often you want it. I had to cancel a few times due to moving to other countries and I never had a problem with them. Cancellation is easy, just call and answer a few question to a computer voice. I don&#x27;t know why some people have problems with them. I&#x27;m older now and my skin needs different cleansers and lotions, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it years ago, it always worked great for me. If you&#x27;re debating whether or not to try it, I say give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I hate this stuff!  It messed my skin up terribly and made it so sore.  I figured out that I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide after using this product for less than 2 weeks.  It didn&#x27;t clear up my acne and gave me a bad rash.  My skin was peeling.  Also, I had to use moisturizer like crazy because this stuff was zapping my skin of any moisture.  I would not recommend this product -- especially to anyone with sensitive or dry skin.</li>
    <li> So this product felt like it was melting my face off... it clears acne by like burning it off your face. I was in really bad pain where i had to immediately wash this product off. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ordering from Amazon is a great idea, the product works and enables you to order the product as you need without signing up for an unnecessary description. NEVER EVER, EVER!!!! sign up through proactive directly to receive your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cancelled my subscription and the company attempted to charge my credit card numerous times. In order to get the charges to stop I HAD TO CHANGE ACCOUNT NUMBERS. Literally, I have confirmations of my cancellation yet the company refuses to stop charging me. It is illegal, immoral and just plain wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, in order to cancel your account the call center company you are in contact with has absolutely no connection to Proactive other than that they are the company responsible for taking your calls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY ORDER THIS PRODUCT from a vendor in which you are not required to subscribe to a prescription. Everything else, no matter what the commercial or phone rep says is a RIP OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just google \\&quot;Proactive Scam\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I am 25 and I just recently developed acne. Rather than looking like I&#x27;m 15 I decided to try proactive to counter that. It hurts your face. My face hurts so badly most days that my whole body temperature rises. My skin is so dry all of the time and there is nothing I have been able todo about it!! I have also developed wrinkles around my eyes. I&#x27;m 25!!  My acne hasn&#x27;t so much gone away as just changed positions on my face. Rather than my forehead, it&#x27;s on my chin. Don&#x27;t try it unless you don&#x27;t mind your face hurting ALL of the time. After reading all of these reviews, I think I&#x27;ll change my card number and just send them their money when they threaten. They were extremely accommodating when I called to cancel but now I wonder if they cancelled anything at all.</li>
    <li> Iam 30 years old with cystic acne. I have gone to a dermatologist who told me none of these over the counter products would work. Like many ppl I figured I&#x27;d give it a try whats the worst that could happen, right? I first tried the skin id with no improvement. I than tried 3 different prescriptions again with no results. Recently I met someone who said she had the same problems as me and used the Proactiv and her skin looked great so I ordered it. My package came along with the 3 step program I received 3 \\&quot;free\\&quot; gifts. A 39.95 program came to 106 and some change. I called askin about this price the gentleman told me it came to that ammount due to my \\&quot;gifts\\&quot;. He asked if I was happy with the product and I replied not a 106 dollars worth of happy. I was able to get this shipment for free and it was suggested i customized my package which I did. Overall I wasn&#x27;t completely unhappy with how my skin looked while it wasn&#x27;t 100% clear it was clearer. I began to notice if I happened to skip a wash my face went back to the way it looked before I started the Proactiv. This made me decide to try there extra strength line. So I customized my package to include the deep cleaning wash, the extra strenght toner and topical treatment. My price was quoted at $45 I asked the rep how much with tax and delivery he said that was the price. Okay..... So I figured no more than 50... Right? Wrong!!!!!! When I recived my new package I recived what I customized my package to be but I was also sent the extra strenght cleaner and yet another \\&quot; free\\&quot; gift for a grand total of $65. This company shamelessly lies to you no gift is free there&#x27;s no returning anything and the only way to stop them from sending you anything is don&#x27;t pay!!!! I feel douped. There are equally good products out there like acne free which is what I switch to with completely honest pricing!</li>
    <li> Whether it works or not. if you order it they don&#x27;t tell you that they automatically sign you up for what they call the \\&quot;3month replenishment program\\&quot;. In three months they will automatically recharge the card you gave them, reship the product to you, and play with your money for a month+ until you ship back the product and wait for a refund. I call this a sticky sale with dishonest people.</li>
    <li> Proactiv is the best brand of acne care products ever! I&#x27;ve used a lot of acne products, but none of them take care of my acne quite like Proactiv does! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Personally, I have been using proactive off and on for a long time and I am incredibly amazed on how well it actually work. I like this version of ProActive way more then the new PLUS system and that is why I have bought it from here.</li>
    <li> All results are different, however, I have been using Proactiv Solution since it was first introduced by Guthey-Renker and for me,  it has kept to its promise. I slacked off from using it and began to have small breakouts. I saw the kit on Amazon and the price was something I could not pass up. My breakouts have diminised and my face is glowing again!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter.  I saw improvement in her face in a week.  She likes using it too.</li>
    <li> When I hit my 30s, I was in shock that my always clear skin was getting pimples. Other systems were designed for people with oily skin and I have normal to dry skin. Proactive was the solution. I do alternate with an age-reducing product so my skin doesn&#x27;t get too dry, but it really works!</li>
    <li> Works great when nothing else did. Bought for my 11 year old who is already suffering with cystic acne.</li>
    <li> Honestly, pro activ ain&#x27;t any different from all the other topical acne treatments out there. It makes my skin FEEL cleaner but the acne still remains how it always has been for the last how many years!?! I have been using it for a year already and it don&#x27;t work. Pro activ is ripping people off and its really complicated trying to unsubscribe to it..customer service is really bad (or good, for THEM) i tried sending it back but idk they would like keep charging. and here i am still subscribed. I guess it&#x27;s because I won&#x27;t ever run out of the product I won&#x27;t have to keep going to the store to buy any kind treatment but still getting charged like nearly $100 every 2 months!!!</li>
    <li> My wife had used proactiv before so when my daughter was having acne problems then my wife asked me to order it. The price was good for a product that works well.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product because my husband wanted it as a gift.  At first my husband saw a difference but as he continued it wasn&#x27;t working as much. Nevertheless my husband wanted to continue the product.  The company began using automatic payments that was very confusing and caused problems with my budget.  I will call every month to get a definite date as to when they will deduct their payment so I can budget properly.  Each time I was given a time frame the company will deduct the money at another time frame.  This will infuriate me because they will take the money that belonged to another bill.  At first I was patient and attempted to understand their protocol but each time I will get screwed.  After 6 months or so I closed my account.  I had to call again to make sure it was closed and it was not.  I had to request again to close my account.  I don&#x27;t know if the product is good.  However customer service fails to explain clearly their protocol because each person that answers he/she has a different answer.  I&#x27;m very responsible with my bills so I hate it when a company can&#x27;t be honest about their rules of payment.  Proactive lacks professionalism and honesty.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this kit seeing how it is advertised everywhere. It really worked for me.... After using it for about 3 months everyone was telling me to try PanOxyl just to keep my face maintained. BIG MISTAKE. I&#x27;ve been using PanOxyl for about 2 1/2 months now, and I regret that i stopped using Proactiv. I actually just re-ordered another kit, and I will not be giving this up again. The only annoying thing about this is the fact that you HAVE to stay on top of this. You must be committed to having clear skin. Because I&#x27;d say if you skip a day or 2: it SHOWS!! However if you follow instructions, and use it every day &amp; night.. i dont see how anyone could go wrong with this. I have become an advocate of this stuff :)</li>
    <li> Quick delievery and improved facial skin. This product came through as hoped. Quick delievery. Easy apply and no negative side effects.</li>
    <li> YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED AND SENT ANOTHER BUNDLE OF THE PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They DO NOT give you an opt out option when you first order&lt;br /&gt;They DO NOT give you any warning what-so-ever that you will be &#x27;subscribed&#x27; to ordering the product every month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product okay but this kind of a scam makes me not want to use it ever again.  There&#x27;s other good benzoyl peroxide face washes out there for just as cheap&lt;br /&gt;oh and the moisturizing cream is like putting Vaseline on your face. It clogs your pores and causes blemishes.</li>
    <li> Product works but customer service is the worst ever. Buy somewhere besides proactive tv.They rip you off on added charges</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ptoactive before some years back and completely forgot how fast it works!! Not only did it quickly clear my face but everyone around me noticed how great my skin looks. My skin.is clear and it&#x27;s glowing! I will continue to use this product and continue to order it from Amazon.........best price and quickly delivered.</li>
    <li> My wife should really be doing this review since I bought this stuff for her. She absolutely loves it, and says her face feels brand new after going through the treatments. Amazon is a great way to keep your supply stocked too if you live in a small community like me where proactive is hard to come by.</li>
    <li> We purchased a three month supply all at once to give it a fair chance to work. It did not improve my teen&#x27;s skin at all.it may work for some, but not for us.  In addition, after we cancelled, we still received the next three-month supply and were charged for that month. Just spent $15.50 to insure &amp; mail back.</li>
    <li> Good God. This stuff is bad. I have been struggling for acne for as long as I can remember. I gave it a try years ago and it didn&#x27;t work. I have been to a dermatologist who put me on every antibiotic for acne on the market, none of which worked. When I was suggested to go on Accutane I didn&#x27;t want to assume the risks associated with that so I decided to give proactiv another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked for about the first month. Not worked as in cleared my skin completely. Worked as in it helped to reduce what was already existing.  After that, I started breaking out again. I tried the \\&quot;magical\\&quot; refining mask that&#x27;s supposed to make your pimples DISAPPEAR overnight. No such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The annoying thing about Proactiv is that this money-hungry company ropes you in for automatic payments, so you don&#x27;t even know when you&#x27;re going to get billed for something. They give you \\&quot;free gifts\\&quot; but if you don&#x27;t cancel them off your plan they will give you normal size bottles at a not-so-cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just went to a cosmetic dermatologist to have a DiamondTome treatment and purchased facial cleaning products from her. She talked to me about outside sources of acne that proactiv doesn&#x27;t address. She discussed that Proactiv, a SULFUR-BASED PRODUCT typically is effective for only 30 days. I highly recommend anyone to STAY AWAY FROM PROACTIV and seek out a dermatologist that will design a treatment plan specifically for you. Find one that talks to you about your life to find causes of acne. (My derm could tell me on which side I sleep, for god&#x27;s sake, just by looking at the location of my acne)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t discount the fact that Proactiv \\&quot;works\\&quot; on some people, but I think that they would still be fine with a good drugstore brand if something OTC (which Proactiv is) works for them. By the way, according to FDA standards, no OTC products are legally allowed to contain more than 3% salicylic acid. even if it says more on the bottle, it&#x27;s being diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for this and other scams. If you are serious about getting rid of acne, it will not be more expensive to get to a dermatologist to really fix the problem from a direct medical authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I tried to cancel my business online, since you can basically do everything else with your plan online. Nope, had to call customer service. I went through the automated menu for five minutes before realizing you can&#x27;t cancel with it. I then spoke to a real person who put me on hold for 2 minutes for someone else. Once I explained I just wanted to cancel everything, she tried selling me their products that don&#x27;t treat acne (moisturizers, makeup, etc) for a small price of around $20/month. Jesus christ, NO I just wanted to cancel and she was making it so damn difficult. When I turned her oh-so-generous offer down, she started me offering a deal on what you may ask? SHOES. SHOES!!! I was ready to lose my temper with this woman but I kept calm and told her to cancel everything. It was the most infuriating customer service experiences I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> hi i bought this product base on the ads , i was really hoping it work , but didn&#x27;t , after a month of continuous use day and night , i dint notice any changes on my face , what i did notice was stains on my dress shirts for work around the neck area , and some t shirts pants any thing this liquid got to from the cream , it sucks i called proactive once i got the second package to get a refund for the first package and to get a form or refund for the second package i didn&#x27;t order but i guess they put us in some plan that we get those every month any ways they did refund me for the second one that i never open just drop that on the post office , but the first one that i call them they ask me to give it some time and call back , well i&#x27;m finally call back today July 19 2012 to my surprise they told me that im out of my 60 day money back , and about the stains on my clothes , the lady said that it clearly says on the label of each bottle about not exposing it to fabric any ways i guess i screw , face its not looking the way i wanted , and clothes are ruin , i will just keep wearing them , i guess its my fault not calling sooner and not reading the fine print , but i would like to make people aware that this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me , and don&#x27;t be using it with clothes that are expose to your face , even the sweat drops will do the damage , i wish they do a better job explaining that to the faithful that actually buy this stuff from them like me , well not im a non believer , i lost $30.00 just to try this and it ruined around 7 dress shirts for work and 3 t shirts , not good $$$$ for now i will just ordered some other Elicina Cream i hope it works other wise they will be getting my reviews too! please if you buy this product the proactiv, if you are not satisfy ask them for a refund right away if you wait base on their advise it might be to late and you will be scew like me also dont wear it with clothes that could get expose to it the sightless touch to your face or the area where you have it on will be a stain for sure , overall this product sucks sorry i just had to say it ,</li>
    <li> Proactive Is the worst thing you can use on your skin to get ride of acne. First of all it is made up of mostly alcohol and witch hazel which is too drying for your skin. If your skin is oily putting alchohol on your skin is the worst thing you can do because it freaks out your skin and makes it produce even MORE oil which will lead to even more break outs. and if your already have dry skin well it&#x27;s gonna dry out even more thats just how skin works. Not only that but it has embalming chemicals in it which is just disgusting,  this product also ages your skin. If you want something good for your skin get something like GM Collens or Skinn. Go to univeralcomapnies.com and look what skin care they have for sale. Also don&#x27;t use bar soap on your skin it&#x27;s not good for your face at all.</li>
    <li> Please be aware of all of the hidden fees with this product.  They will continue to send you more and more until you cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rec&#x27;d my 3 Step package 2 months ago for $19.95.  To my surprise, another package was automatically sent to me a month later.  Except this time they sent me a 3 month supply automatically for about $70!!  I called customer service who read me the rehearsed response to my question.  I had to take it to the post office and mail it back.  The would not refund the shipping fee of $7 and I had to pay additional shipping to return it, another $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them back this morning and they still have not rec&#x27;d my 3 month supply.  The CSR said it would take between 4-6 weeks to process the order and issue me a refund.  Unreal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the product is not great either!  I&#x27;ve been using a Rx from my doctor this month and its working much better than ProActive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactive needs to be way more customer focused.  I will NEVER order from this company again!</li>
    <li> I really am in love with Proactiv!! I think it works soo well! My skin type is combination and i noticed results in a couple weeks!! I defintly recommend proactiv! But people that have dry skin should probaly not use this product because it does tend to dry the skin! But if you have oily skin and acne i think that this is your solution!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a devoted user of Proactiv Solutions for 3 years and going strong.  Always a satisfying product, for sure.</li>
    <li> First off, the stuff didn&#x27;t even work. You can find something ALOT better for about a third of the cost of proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, they make it VERY difficult to cancel. Actually, I couldn&#x27;t even cancel it at all even after calling them at least 3 times. Ofcourse they say that you&#x27;re account has been cancelled but they still charge you every month regardless. I&#x27;ve had to go through my credit card company to dispute all of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this product. Don&#x27;t buy into their advertising. It&#x27;s all a big marketing scam.</li>
    <li> 1) Renewing Cleanser: has micro-beads which I hate. It goes fast and isn&#x27;t particularly effective. 1 star&lt;br /&gt;2) Toner: Great! I wish I could just buy the toner. It is really effective at reducing the size and redness of fresh acne. 4 stars for toner.&lt;br /&gt;3) Repairing Lotion: Ineffective 1 star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this for acne prone skin: theoilcleansingmethod.com  This page simply states some information and is not selling any product. It describes a way to cleanse the skin with castor oil. I haven&#x27;t tried it just yet but I will soon. Currently, I do not use soap or cleansers of any kind on any skin. I take a warm shower and gently dry off with a clean towel. At night I splash a bit of warm water on my face and gently dry with a high-quality towel. My acne is much better since I stopped using cleansers. Especially on my chest and back. I have had zero acne on my chest and back since I quit using body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for Guthy Renker. I am only going to add to the current rant. I have had the same experience with Guthy Renker sending me packages and not cancelling my account. I reported my card lost in hope they would sending packages. I called, emaailed, and chatted. Still get packages. For a few YEARS I just conceded to refusing delivery of the package when I checked my PO Box. Usually I would get a bill but the charges would be cleared after they received my return. THIS WENT ON FOR YEARS! I couldn&#x27;t get them stop. Thankfully I had the heads-up to report my debit card lost so they couldn&#x27;t take my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I moved, a package was forwarded by the Post Office to my new address. They held the package at the Post office and left me a delivery note in my mailbox. The Post Office returned the package after I failed to pick it up after 14 days. Guthy Renker sent me bills/delinquent notices for a time (no more packages yay!). Now they are using a scam collection agency called North Shore Agency (the NSA is after me! lol). I have thrown out all of the letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am waiting to see if they will actually take legitimate action to recover their fraudulent debt. They claim I owe $57.25. I am not going to pay it. I failed to notify them of anything. We will see if they will sell their scam debt account to an actual collection agency. I am betting they will do no such thing and that they just want to bully me into paying a false debt. I will check my credit report soon to see if it comes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 10/3/2012&lt;br /&gt;So, I filed a complaint with BBB. I was very thorough in describing all of my dealings with Guthy Renker to the BBB. GR responded:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company&#x27;s Initial Response - Posted 10/02/2012&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for contacting Guthy|Renker through the Better Business Bureau. We received your inquiry and sincerely apologize for any miscommunication. We take these complaints very seriously and appreciate the time you have taken to let us know about your experience. Our records indicate that on December 21, 2011, your third Proactiv® shipment, a 60-Day 4 piece supply, was sent for a total of $57.75, which remained unpaid. Our records further indicate that on March 28, 2012, we received this shipment back to our facility, but as it was received outside our 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee, no return credit was issued at that time. You were sent monthly invoices requesting payment and, on September 11, 2012, your $57.75 balance was transferred to collections. In an effort to fully resolve this matter, I have cleared the $57.75 balance and contacted SKO Brenner American collections agency to have your account removed from their records. Please consider any invoices received after the date of this correspondence as having crossed in the mail. Your Proactiv® account is now closed with no further balance due. Nothing further will be shipped or billed.&lt;br /&gt;Initial Response Summary&lt;br /&gt;I have cleared the $57.75 balance owed. Your account is closed with no further balance due. Nothing further will be shipped or billed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay! no more BS from Guthy Renker! No more collections or worrying about my credit! I can finally breath a sigh of relief! ahhhhh... If you have been harassed by this company as I have, know that you have some recourse and can get justice. I hope this helps others.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written. I would never purchase this product again. I believe their marketing is very deceptive and it&#x27;s not worth the hassle. If I could give it a lower review than 1 star I would.They do not tell you that you will be billed whether you order an additional supply or not. A $19.95 cost sounds good but it isn&#x27;t in my opinion honest.&lt;br /&gt;There are better products out there I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> When I first used proactiv I had issues with skin irritation. I started experimenting with the kit and found out that I can only use the 1st and 3rd step every other day with no issues. And Ive been using this for the past three years</li>
    <li> bought for some one so i did not use this product my self but i was told it works</li>
    <li> Great product for my girls.  They swear by this product and use it for several reasons.  Clears up skin and keeps it clear.</li>
    <li> It was just what I expected, It seems to be taking care of my skin problem, I would recommend it</li>
    <li> SUCH FAST AWESOME SHIPPING! Thank you so much.  I love this product and the packaging is like no other.  I received a book too! Thank you so very much.  Sincerely, Your Loyal Happy Customer P.s. Definitely buying again if available.</li>
    <li> It took me weeks to figure out that all my colored towels were ruined using this on my face. If you want to try it, get only white towels! Best not to try it!</li>
    <li> I ordered X-out a couple of months ago. Today I received another package, and Proactive charged my credit card without my authorization! I called the customer service, and was told I could get refund if I send the product back with certificated mail at my own cost. What a shameless scam! Never, ever order anything from them!!!</li>
    <li> The product works slightly better than others I have tried, but my face still has blemishes.  I&#x27;m not the type that expects this to work miracles and am glad that some has blemishes have cleared up.  However, their customer service is horrible.  They set up recurring orders through their system based on the number of kits you order, not on the order itself.  So if you ordered more than one, such as for gifts, they send you the same amount of kits in recurring.  In my case, I ordered three kits, one for myself and two as gifts.  In my package and in the online order notification, they say that they are going to send out ONE recurring kit.  There is no mention anywhere about how each kit would have its own recurring order, which would be a total of three sent out each time.  When I received the second order, I was shocked to see three boxes and my card charged a total of $95 and two more payments set to charge in 3 weeks of almost $60 each.  I called that day to stop the payments and to return the items I didn&#x27;t want.  I was planning to keep one set and return two.  When I spoke to the representative, she said that this happens all the time and that the information is deceiving.  They sent out labels so I could ship the items back, which took two weeks to receive.  I put the kits in the mail.  Then, they charged my card one payment of $60 since they said that they had not received the kits back.  So I&#x27;ve had a total of $155 charged to my card for this recurring order and another $60 due to charge in another 3 weeks.  I called them about this.  They refused to refund the $60.  They also said that once they received the kits (which had to be shipped by USPS, the slowest way possible), it would take up to 6 weeks to process the refund, which gives them enough time to charge my card the last payment.  The product does not work well enough for this much hassle.  If you really want to try it, buy it from a store.  Then you won&#x27;t have to deal with these crooks.</li>
    <li> It helps with my oily skin to maintain a clear face. The product works well if used as it is directed.</li>
    <li> Iv been using it since 6th grade...... I&#x27;m a sophmore now, and I don&#x27;t know why I still use it but it definatly hasn&#x27;t gotten better. If anything it has gotten worse.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter and it didn&#x27;t work, to say the least.  Actually she broke out with the red blotches each time she tried to use it.  If that was the only problem I would not have said anything, as I realize that each person reacts different.  But I was very upset that they started sending me the product automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful when I requested the product that shipments would not be sent to me automatically; however, they did it anyway.  Then to make matters worse, I got a run around from customer service when I called in to try to get the shipments stopped and my money refunded.  When I called in, I was having problems with allergies myself and I could hardly speak.  Trying to be nice, but tired of repeating myself, I told the young man that answered the phone that I did not appreciate them setting me up with automatic shipments and the man got all upset saying I was being rude.  Not sure how I was being so rude when I could barely speak, but the guy got an attitude and put me on hold.  Then someone else got on the phone after a couple of minutes of me waiting, ask me the same questions and then put me on hold again saying they had to transfer me to someone else.  Finally a third guy got on the phone and asked me all the same questions again and then a whole bunch of other questions, before they finally agreed to quit sending me the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the product, because they will start sending you the product automatically and to stop getting the product they will request your medical history.  It was ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This product while mildly beneficial is a total ripoff.  They will keep sending you products even if you don&#x27;t want them and send them back.  THEY DON&#x27;T CARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BILL YOU 100 BUCKS JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN! The customer service is not helpful whatsoever and the experience in general is terrible to say the least.  Don&#x27;t get involved with these people, trust me you will regret it.  They are nothing but a company of scam artists. So just be warned the little results that there are are not worth the trouble!</li>
