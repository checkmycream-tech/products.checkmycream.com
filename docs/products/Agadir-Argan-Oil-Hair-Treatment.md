<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It a wonderful and excellent</li>
    <li> Thick, rich oil. Fragrance is not over powering. Did not leave a heavy oily residue. Which is great. Leaves hair looking rich and lustrous</li>
    <li> Been using this product for around 5 years now.  Love it, and am always looking for good deals on Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this oil! When newer products would come on the seen, I would try them and I would always go back to this one. It has a very nice fragrance but not to overpowering. You only have to use a very little bit because this bottle should last you forever! Worth every penny, you won&#x27;t be disapointed!</li>
    <li> Just like a kid, I play with my hair, silk in my fingers. Seven more words are unnecessary. Now two.</li>
    <li> Priced right. Keep my hair from being  frizzy</li>
    <li> First of all, TO ALL THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS NOT BEING 100% ARGAN OIL...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says &amp;#34;Contains 100% pure Argan Oil&amp;#34; . . . It does NOT mislead to say it IS 100% Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn to read, pay attention to details!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, NOW for the quality of this product, I love the smell which is why I keep buying this brand. I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan Oil from Regis, Sally, etc. and it works and feels great but the smell of this stuff is amazing. It makes my hair so soft and shiny, anyone who sits behind me comments on how shiny my hair looks. It&#x27;s soft and light, just remember to use it sparingly or it could create an &#x27;oily&#x27; look. It helps with itchy scalp, too. If you have that issue. It repairs damaged hair from frequent hot irons, sun, blow drying, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you&#x27;re on the fence, just try it...You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. 3rd bottle my wife has bought. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN SOME OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS.  IT IS JUST TOO HEAVY FOR MY FINE HAIR.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Moroccan oil.  Pleased with results.  Makes my curly hair smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair dresser, but much less expensive here than at the salon!  It does have a strong scent (which does not last), which I find pleasant.  My daughter loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I use Arran oil for my hair and skin, this is excellent. This brand is very good, just as fine as the very expensive types.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to have more Argan oil in it like the Moroccan Oil brand which made my naturally curly hair curl up nicely.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pricey nd there are better products out there that don&#x27;t smell as strong. Morrocan oil or the Chi Kertain complex in the sivler and gold bottle.</li>
    <li> for true moisture on your skin, face and shine on your hair - best quality of the 2 products i tried. a little goes a long way. natural. helps the economy of morocco?</li>
    <li> Wow, I use a quarter size drop as conditioner for my waist length hair.  Another dime size drop prior to drying.  It leaves my hair shiny and silky and smells great for days.  This is my new favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> I wanted 100% argan oil, and this product contains many other ingredients just like other reviewers have written. I unfortunately did not bother to read the reviews in the first place because I thought I was getting pure argan oil. Also, I kind of try to avoid perfume-y products, and this oil has a patchouli type smell that I don&#x27;t care for at all. I am totally annoyed at having spent money on this product that I will never use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and my hair is improved by this product immediately. Remember to use it when your hair is half dry.</li>
    <li> My hair hates humidity and looks horrible. I can apply a quarter size of this oil on my long hair and it lays the frizz out. The spray works better but this is good to apply after blowdrying. My hair absorbs the oil and looks great not oily.</li>
    <li> No only a great deal but works great for dry or color treated hair, especially for hair that is styled w/ heat.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it on my face and in my hair daily.  Better than any moisturizer i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> smells great , works great</li>
    <li> This oil is GREAT.  It makes my hair so soft and shiny.  It&#x27;s the only styling product I use on my hair.  I put a little on when it is damp and a little more on after I finish drying and flat ironing my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Smells very good and make my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my hair. It makes it softer and easier to manage. Too much of it at one time will make your hair look oily . It&#x27;s not a heavy oil so I use it in conjunction with olive oil cream to weigh down my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Not pure argan oil. Smell is overpowering. wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This oil is fragrant and not 100% argan oil. I wanted something purely argan oil not one with additives. The fragrance is very strong and not appealing. I was disappointed because this product was not inexpensive so I am out $ 25+. I would not order anything from this vendor again[[ASIN:B001U9M2EW Agadir  Argan Oil Treatment, 4-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This product works like a dream &amp; smells heavenly as you apply it fading away as it drys. I have a whole gallon ziplock of frizz taming products from drug stores to high end salons I&#x27;m going to give away to my 10 yr old niece. This is all you need. I also like Morrocan Oil but this smells nicer!</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy and unmanageable hair (like I do), you will love this product.    I have very thick and wavy hair, so combing and detangling my freshly washed hair can be challenging.  That&#x27;s where this oil comes in.  I use it straight out of the shower and work it throughout my towel dried hair.  It gives me just enough conditioning to comb my hair out, without making my hair oily or weighing it down.    I swear that this argan oil also shortens my hair drying time.  If I try to dry my hair without using this oil first, it takes me about 20 minutes to get my hair dry.  When I use the oil, it only takes me about 10 minutes.  That is a big plus for me!    The only complaint I have about this product is that the bottle is definitely on the small side, and it can be a little difficult to control the amount of oil that you get out of the bottle.  You definitely don&#x27;t want to use more than 3 or 4 drops, or it can make your hair oily.    All in all, a great product.  It is definitely a part of my regular beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> This product help protect hair from breaking and splitting. It also provide an extra sheen to hair. Very good product.</li>
    <li> This product works great. Most conditioners and oils weigh my hair down, but this treatment moisturizes without making my hair oily. It also gives hair a healthy shine.</li>
    <li> Apply to very damp hair. Apply liberally. This product restored my hair when it was dry and brittle. Now it is soft and shinny.</li>
    <li> i love this hair oil! smells so amazing and provides enough control and shine without leaving my hair feeling weighted down.</li>
    <li> Love both products. My hair is always so soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> So luckily I had samples from my distributor. she tells me it&#x27;s cheaper and work as well as Moroccanoil. Not true!!! The smell reminds me of bathroom spray and I tried it on my sister her hair has no shine, greasy, stiff, no life to it. She&#x27;s not a hairdresser but clearly see she doesn&#x27;t like it. Normally when I use MO on her it lasts 4 days. The very next day with Adagir her hair looked like she haven&#x27;t showered in a week! I&#x27;ll stick with MO! It&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> the product did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> 3 orders so far since last year  .. the size suits me ! and it keep my hair hydrated</li>
    <li> Great for hair shine and health, and for skin too.</li>
    <li> An excellent price for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I had previously used Moroccanoil.  I ran out of it and because it was a little pricier, I thought I would try this.  I do like Agadir&#x27;s fragrance better, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to smooth my hair as well as Moroccanoil does.  I used Agadir several times, but decided to go back to Moroccanoil, so I just ordered more of it a couple days ago.  I will continue to use the Agadir as just a touch up.</li>
    <li> I have really wavy, course, thick and hard to manage hair.  My stylist used this product when he was blow-drying my hair.  He said it makes hair dry faster, more manageable and it does.  No more frizzies!  I don&#x27;t lose my waves; but my hair is smooth, soft, very shiny and not weighed down.  I&#x27;m a happy camper.    I was hugely disappointed after receiving my shipment to discover that the product IS NOT ORGANIC as the description states.  I really hate being deceived.  The little round label on the bottle that looks like it might say \\&quot;Certified Organic\\&quot; actually reads \\&quot;Made With Certified Agadir Oil\\&quot;.  And as another reviewer noted the product does contain silicone-type ingredients...  I am sure this is what makes my hair feel quite silky...something it doesn&#x27;t do without some kind of hair product.    To end on a positive note...this product smells heavenly.  The scent is slightly reminiscent of a perfume I used to use back in the 80&#x27;s called Cinnabar...kind of clove, incense and spice.    I will be buying it again. Oh...and a little bit goes a long way!  Hope this reveiw helps. v.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It makes my hair feel like silk.  Great on wet or dry hair.  Just a drop or two is all you need.  I use it on my body as well. it has a very earthy sensual fragrance. It originally was called Moroccan Gold, but I think they had to change the name.  It is just as good as the pricey Moroccan Oil.  It lasts for a very long time. I just bought my second bottle after having the first one for over a year.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this under the impression that this was exactly the same as Moroccanoil, but it is not.  It is still very  nice, but I will tell you there are slight differences.  The texture is just a bit different, not bad, just not the same.  AND the scent isn&#x27;t quite as nice as the Moroccanoil.  I LOVE the scent of the Moroccanoil, so I was a bit disappointed.  All in all, IF I can&#x27;t find the original Moroccanoil in the future, I will use this again, but just beware if you are looking for the \\&quot;identical product in a new bottle\\&quot;, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Just before I go out I use a bit of this and voila... I have a nice sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product has helped my hair improve. I started using it over five years ago and I think my hair looks the best it ever has.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product a bit, but to make a long story short, I have asked a friend to bring some  Argan oil back from Morrocow. The real thing is nothing like this commercial very expensive product!</li>
    <li> Having curly hair that tends to frizz easy, especially when I step outside or get too hot.  Sometimes I straighten my hair and sometimes just leave it curly but either way I always use this oil.  I put some on my most frizzy places then blow dry my hair if going straight or allow it to dry naturally if going curly.  After my hair is dry I sometimes add a little more in the needed places.  Makes my hair silky and soft.  My husband loves to touch my hair and says it shines all the time.  That&#x27;s important with curly hair but no matter your hair type this oil is excellent and never makes my hair greasy.  My husband has started using a little on his hair and he has straight (beautiful) hair.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that this oil smells absolutely phenomenal! I mean, I want to wear it on my neck it smells so good. AND, it is not heavy at all. It does not weigh my hair down. I have put it on my wet hair and dry hair and it is lovely. I am so happy to have found it and it is far less expensive than the Moroccan Oil. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Though I prefer the regular packaging and not the pump.</li>
    <li> Love it! It makes me hair so soft.</li>
    <li> The oil leaves an oily residue and it turns the shine, dull on your hair.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thin hair, i have a lot of it, but it is thin. I like this product, i dont love it. It DOES make my hair very soft. It is NOT oily. Not one bit. and it detangles my hair like a dream-which is the reason i like this product. However, it does make it a little limp. There is not a lot of shine and it makes my hair have static. I do love the detangle part of it, tho. I have a co-worker who has damaged and thicker hair, and it is a miracle for her. But, if you have thin hair, dont expect that same miracle.</li>
    <li> Curly Girls, this product contains many \\&quot;cones\\&quot; in the ingredient list. I&#x27;m going to send mine back. If you don&#x27;t care about silicones in the ingredient list, you would probably like this product. The smell of this product is divine, very feminine.</li>
    <li> This product is not Argan oil. It is just silicon and chemical product.  Yes silicone makes hair silky and shiny; however, It harms hair and cause a lot of hair loss to me.</li>
    <li> Fabulous, does make my hair fabulous!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! My stylists suggested I try this instead of my usual frizz-reducing products. I have been using it for a month now, and I don&#x27;t even need any extra products to keep my hair at bay!!! This oil is truly a hair miracle product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different oils, including Kendi bamboo oil and Agadir argan oil is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I have used high quality virgin coconut and other nut oils and they left my hair starchy.&lt;br /&gt;Not the case with this!  Leaves my hair SOFT, and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple of years now. My hair is very thick, dry, damaged, splitting ends.  I like to highlight with blonde and prior to using Agadir, my hair felt like hay!  Very glad to have this.</li>
    <li> This really helps tame my hair which gets quite frizzy in this Houston humidity. All other products tend to make my hair look greasy or clump up together. This actually succeeds at making my hair look glossy and tamed, but not oily-looking. It gives a nice sheen. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. It also has a pleasant, warm coconut-like fragrance that fades with time. I also feel like it&#x27;s actually conditioning and helping my hair. I feel safe and comfortable knowing it contains plant-derived natural ingredients rather than loads of over-processed chemicals.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the Moroccan Oil brand but times are tough and you have to conserve money somewhere.  So I decided to try this product.  I love it just as much and saved some money as well.  It smells nice also.</li>
    <li> i was on the hunt for argan oil for my hair, decided to chose this product, because everyone told me to get the one with the gold label.  amazon was the only place i found it, makes your hair so bright and soft, but not to soft. i will re-purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product gave me an itchy scalp.  No matter how well I rinsed, I ended up with a flaky scalp.  This has never happened to me before.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders! I have over processed hair, which is coarse as I&#x27;m Indian, and this stuff makes my hair shiny and soft. Just a drop will do you. would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Although a bit pricey a little goes a long way and I love the way it helps your hair dry faster.  Not sure how it works, but it does.  Although the product says it is \\&quot;oil\\&quot; my hair is never greasy feeling and feels great! I would certainly recommend it for longer hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil to use for frizzy hair and your hair absorbs it rather than looking oily...I love it and have been using it over 2 yrs.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this stuff.  I have wavy, coarse, and sometimes frizzy hair.  This product does a great job at moisturizing it and reducing the flyaways.  I apply it most to the ends to product my hair during blow drying and using other heat products.  I highly recommend it.  It also has a good smell and a little goes a long way.  This bottle will probably last me 6 months or more.</li>
    <li> For $26 I expected a REALLY GOOD product.  The first thing I noticed was that it smelled terrible.  I tried a similar product by Fekkai, which smells great and works better.  I bought this at Target for about the same price.  My hairdresser just used a product by Avon that she swears by.  I liked that too.  It comes in a small orange bottle.  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on the Agadir.  I saw an ad for it in Glamour magazine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have hair that wants to be wavy, but instead is just a big frizzy mess.  I used to work in a hair salon, and when we brought this product in I fell in LOVE!  It smelled great and a small amount of it really worked the frizz out of my hair.    I bought Morroccan Oil the next time because for some reason I couldn&#x27;t find this particular product, and I really didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled nor did I think it had the same effect on my hair, so I&#x27;m back to this stuff!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the hope of finding a less-expensive alternative to MoroccanOil, but there is really no substitute so far. The oil is packaged well, arrived very promptly and is a great price, but the aroma is of a slightly rancid sandalwood and the oil is not absorbed easily. It left my hair limp and greasy and was not pleasant smelling. I&#x27;ll save it for using in a pinch, but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for thick, coarse, curly Mediterranean hair.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using it. After shampoo/conditioner and towel dried my hair, I put a tiny bit on, and just forgot about it. Two hours later, when I saw myself in the mirrow, WOW, \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; is the first word that jumped out of my mind! I haven&#x27;t had healthy hair for a long time, the perm i had last time completely damaged my hair. But this argan oil brings my hair back to life again. I don&#x27;t quite like the smell though, it&#x27;s too strong. And the price is high. But I definitely love the result.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My 10 month old daughter is mixed, so I have to be very selective about what I put in her hair.  It smells great and works wonders on her tangled mess.</li>
    <li> this is not a pure argan oil, there are 8 or 9 ingredients including perfume; so don&#x27;t believe them and do not purchase it</li>
    <li> I first received this as a sample from my hairdresser,  loved it!  helps your hair dry faster w/no frizz!!</li>
    <li> My daughter suggested I try her Argon while we were on vacation at the beach.  I used it a few times and quickly ordered my own.  I can&#x27;t imagine styling my hair without it.  I have thick, wavy hair and the oil helps keep it straight and soft.  I never thought I could have hair like that!  It&#x27;s all about the product...and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft, protecting it from the heat of my blow dryer/straightener. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and my hair stays healthy!</li>
    <li> Lightweight.... been using this for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil really aides my hair, keeping it soft, and with great sheen. It also has quite a pleasant scent that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This product is great for hair. I have colored hair and I use it daily to keep it from drying out.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or oily, makes it soft and easy to manage while repairing damaged hair.  this is my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> This product is so worth it. I put this on my hair after i shower and when my hair dries my hair looks so much healthier and is so much more manageable. It smells amazing and leaves my hair soft and bouncy. I have gotten so many compliments from using this. I will definitely be buying more when i run out.</li>
    <li> Well I am a research Queen ! I don&#x27;t like to buy something without knowing about it first so I saw the great reviews and also went on the website to make sure it was 100 % argan oil and nothing else and they didn&#x27;t list all the ingredients on website. So I ordered it and well its is not 100% argan oil... it has all these other things inside of it.... these are the ingredients in order on the bottle....cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, cyclomethicone, argania spinosa kernal oil (argan oil, capryly Methicone, phenyl trimethicone, fragrance. Now the only reason that I am upset about that is because I could of got the exact same product at sally&#x27;s beauty supply for [...]. The products works good and it smells really good im just upset I paid 30 for the same thing.    ***** Update****  Okay so I can be more descriptive the product that is at sallys is called one and only argan oil.... I did not buy the agadir at sallys. So paying 30 for the exact same thing with the exact same ingredients is what is upsetting when the product at sallys cost ALOT LESS(I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THESE PRODUCTS)!     I am now using a product called SHEA TERRA ORGANICS moroccan argan oil and its 100 % pure and natural certified organic. And on the ingredients it doesn&#x27;t have anything other than 100 % pure ecocert certified organic argan oil. I got it here on amazon and its price is less then the agadir.  [[ASIN:B000VSZDVW Shea Terra Organics Argan Face And Body Oil 2 oz]]    Research Queen !</li>
    <li> Makes my coarse hair very silky and shiny without undesired greasy effect. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair.  First attempt, I put the oil in wet hair before shampooing. I had to wash my hair multiple times to get it out, then my hair was heavy and dull. Second attempt after shampooing, smaller amount on the ends only and same results. So I found that the only way this product works for me is applying right before I flat iron my hair. I bought this instead of Morrocanoil but I think I will spend the extra money. Lastly, I am not a fan of the smell...</li>
    <li> I have a mortal fear of going bald, so I&#x27;m willing to try out stuff that supposedly increases the longevity of my hair.     Before trying out this product, I used eboline coconut oil for a while.  I used to think the coconut oil was good, but quite honestly it&#x27;s pretty lousy compared to this.  The coconut oil was pretty thick, and after I applied it, my hair always felt a bit... oily.    This oil by contrast is very fine, I only need a few drops when I apply it.  It brings out the color in my hair very nicely, and leaves it shining for hours.  Even a while later, my hair feels softer, and more easily straightened.  It does not however feel oily.  The oil must get absorbed into my scalp, hair, or just vaporize naturally... Anyway, it may just be a placebo effect, but I&#x27;m convinced that it actually does make my hair stronger and healthier.  My hair tends towards being dry and pointy.    I&#x27;ve also read that this argan oil has *extremely* high concentrations of vitamin E, so it makes for a nice after-shave as well.    The bottle is pretty expensive, but given how little I use, I&#x27;d expect it to last me for close to a year.  Proceeds go to some strange eco-cooperative for women in Morocco who reforest the desert with argan trees, so I suppose that&#x27;s a plus too : )</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, dry, wavy hair that is most often described as \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; or \\&quot;unruly.\\&quot; Argan oil leaves my hair feeling softer, and looking less frizzy. Hair products don&#x27;t usually make much difference to my hair, but this one does tone down the volume and frizz and add a bit of shine. Although I apply quite a bit, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking or feeling greasy. Also, it smells great. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the smell being overpowering - once it is absorbed into my hair, the smell goes away (although my hair doesn&#x27;t tend to absorb or hold scents). I will definitely buy another bottle of this when this one is gone, and I would consider trying other products from this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Agadir Argan Oil for a couple of years. Oddly enough, Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t feel oily, at all - it softens and atrengthens hair, and creates a shine that&#x27;s superior to the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products I used to use - and it smells amazing.  I used to buy it at the salon for twice the price I pay now, on Amazon. The oil arrived in a padded mailer, in perfect condition, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier - one of my favorite splurges, without leaving home, for half the money. Perfect.</li>
    <li> If you are a woman over 40, you will need this wonderful oil to keep your hair from drying out and being unmanageable and damaged.</li>
    <li> this is not pure argan oil, as quoted . this is perfumed oils, but not sure what oils..go to the pure argan oil..</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  Love the feel and fragrance and the compliments on shiny, healthy-looking hair.  Who wouldn&#x27;t?  Not for people with fine or thin hair--unless you want it to look flattened out!  Travel size (2 oz bottle) is much better than the packets that leak since you don&#x27;t use a lot of it at a time.  Haven&#x27;t tried the spray bottle yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this treatment because Moroccan Oil was hurting my bank account, and I heard this was the next best thing. I used the same amount for my hair (size of a dime) as M.O., and it made my hair incredibly greasy; I had to shampoo my hair twice to get it out. As for the smell, its not as strong as others were saying. It smells fine in my opinion. Spending the extra money for Moroccan Oil is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> First off, I want to say that I am a review queen! I never try a new (and pricey at that!) product without reading a bazillion reviews on it first. And this is one of the those items. I read such amazing things about it - how silky it made one&#x27;s hair, etc. And I can tell you after I experienced myself, it is true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is incredibly frizz and poof-prone, I have always hated it. The only way I can calm it down is with products, and this is my favorite I&#x27;ve tried BY FAR. I typically use about a quarter-size of the oil and smooth it through my hair while it is still wet/damp (But not soaking wet by any means, that would dilute the product too much). Then I take the little remnants of whatever is left on my hands and I smooth it over my fly-aways. Works wonders! At the top of my head I always have fine little hairs sticking up randomly, but after I use this stuff my head looks so sleek and smooth. Not to mention my hair itself feels super soft and silky. And the scent is amaaazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big bonus! It does not make my hair get oilier faster, even though I have relatively fine hair. And my hair gets oily VERY quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I always let my hair dry naturally, so I can&#x27;t say much about the cut-down on time blow drying it, but my hair seems to dry faster naturally. Usually it takes half a day for my hair to be completely dry, but I think it probably takes about half of that now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and don&#x27;t love it or hate it. The smell isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s strong, reminds my boyfriend &amp; me of someone&#x27;s family party with lots of older latina or middle-eastern women (we are both of middle-eastern descent). But those ladies have nice long shiny hair, right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly long and quite thick, and slightly wavy/frizzy. I like to twist this type of stuff into it while it&#x27;s still damp and then let it dry in a clip - when I let it down, it&#x27;s nice and curly/wavy and shiny. The biggest drawback is its scent -- while it&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just really strong, which i&#x27;m not that into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of washes with a mild, moisturizing shampoo, it did feel like there was some residue left. But with dry hair, that&#x27;s not the worst that could happen, and it hasn&#x27;t seemed greasy when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how it would work for someone with thinner hair or for straightening/blowdrying.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine but I have a lot of hair.  It&#x27;s past my shoulders and long-layed (mostly one length).  Naturally, my hair is wavy.  I use about a quarter size drop in the palm of my hand, and massage the treatment on damp hair, dry it with hair dryer, then use a straightening iron.  The result is my hair is straight and shiny.  Other products I&#x27;ve tried will result the same except the other products also make my hair appear as though I have not washed it in five days! (greasy).  This product is \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist has started using this stuff in my hair and recently she gave me a sample to try on my own. I thought it was something she was doing with her hair dryer or something that made my hair so silky, turns out it&#x27;s this stuff. I tried a tiny amount before I dried my hair and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair. It&#x27;s ridiculously soft and smooth. It also cut drying time at least in half, which for me is very important. This stuff is amazing. It makes me not want to touch the silicone serums anymore. You only need a tiny tiny tiny amount so it will last a very long time. I can&#x27;t rave about this enough.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and dry on the ends due to the sun and highlights.  My hair dresser recommended this oil over a year ago and I am hooked and use it ever time I wash my hair.  It smells nice and make my hair soft, shiny and manageable. I would never think of using anything else.</li>
    <li> Love this oil and it is WAY cheaper on Amazon then from my salon.  I use just a small amount when my hair is damp to protect from heat.  It also smells super good.</li>
    <li> I never got it!! I ordered it and I have been waiting for a while and I didn&#x27;t get it... If you are not going to send it to me... I want my money back!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair that gets frizzy in humidity. After shampooing and conditioning, I put a small amount of Argan oil in my palms and work it into my hair before blow drying. It has worked very well for me, reducing the frizz in the summer, and making my hair look super healthy all year long. I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and numerous people have complimented me on my healthy, young looking hair. I hope it works as well for you.</li>
    <li> This product smells heavenly and works great.  I have fine hair, and it did not weigh my hair down.  I was also worried it might make it look oily...but it only gave it shine and smoothness.      I would recommend this product if you have damaged or frizzy hair or just want extra shine, and smoothness.    The Con:  Since I have to purchase 1x month ...I wish it was a little less expensive.  I also buy the spray oil too. ($27.00) to put on dry hair during and after drying.  So buying both products can eventually get expensive.  But in the long run my hair looks 100x better.    DO NOT BUY OTHER NAME BRANDS!!  They dont work near as well as this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works great and smells delicious!! I&#x27;ll keep using this product as long as I&#x27;m able!</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff after my hairdresser used it the last time I went in.  She used the spray so that&#x27;s what I came looking for, and found this treatment as well.  I&#x27;ve been using the argan oil for a couple of weeks now, and I&#x27;ve been able to get rid of ALL the other hair products cluttering my vanity.  I use it in place of my detangler, my frizz serum, my heat protectant, and my finishing spray.  It works great with blow drying, flat ironing, curling, and even holding the curl from my old school hot rollers.  I am so pleased and will definitely be buying these products from now on.</li>
    <li> My hair use to be very dry and damage until I started using Argan Oil, my hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy in years even my hair dresser is impressed with the results. Love, love love this product!</li>
    <li> I first heard out about this product through my hair dresser, Anamaria and the second she opened the bottle this amazing scent just grabs you and everyone near it. !! WOW!!!  It&#x27;s not sticky or oily at all and it won&#x27;t weigh down your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so you can put it on your skin- smells AMAZING!!  There are probably 101 Argan oils on the market but for the size, price and quality of what you are actually getting, I would say that this is by far the best out there.</li>
    <li> While there is Argan oil somewhere in this concoction, it&#x27;s listed after dimethicone, which you can find in pretty much any hair care product, and several other ingredients. The listing leads you to believe this is 100% Argan oil, which it certainly is not. On top of that, the scent is heavy, overly sweet, and flowery. If you&#x27;re looking for 100% Argan oil, look elsewhere. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really shouldn&#x27;t have changed brands but this is considerably cheaper and the reviews were so good that I wanted to try it.  I have thick, fairly coarse hair and I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil (blue label, amber bottle) for a couple of years and love it -- absorbs easily, and creates shiny, smooth hair without being weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this Agadir for the first time today and my hair is kinda puffy, not sleek like it is with the other brand, and has a slight perfum-y smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant.  I wouldn&#x27;t care about the smell though if my hair looked great.  I have big hair right now and will have to use a flat iron today, this product just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair is soft to the touch though and it does look better than if I didn&#x27;t use any product at all after keratin conditioning.  If you love the other brand, my advice  would be to stick with it or just get a sample of this one before buying a whole bottle.</li>
    <li> wow! I&#x27;m a AAF and in all my days and years of having relaxed hair I have never expirenced my hair being so soft, and manageable. I bought this yesterday at lunch and decided to put it&lt;br /&gt;in while my hair was already dry. I wrapped my hair with a silk scarf and went to bed. Usually when I unwrap my hair there is several pieces of hair that will break off but today there was hardly any. I can run my hands through my hair without it tangling and breaking... I&#x27;m just so impressed. My hair is long at the middle of my back and usually a pain to wear down because it would tangle so easily and with so much fog today I just knew it would frizz but NO frizz or tangles throughout the day and my hair smells so clean and fresh. Please try this if you have problems with breakage and dry brittle ends it will restore life to your hair again.&lt;br /&gt;Mom416</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit surprised to get a tiny bottle of oil for the price I paid. However,I have been using for the past three months and can give 5 stars for this product. This summer I have been going to the beach and in the ocean water every day which as you know damages hair big time. Also, every day showers make them dry. I use just a tiny bit of this oil on my towel dried hair and in 10 min they look absolutely nice and smell nice. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s prone to frizziness.  I battle the frizziness every day with thorough blow-drying and various anti-frizz products.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with the products I currently use: [[ASIN:B0017M7VI4 Garnier Fructis Leave-In Conditioning Cream Color Shield 10.2 oz.]], [[ASIN:B0012NWQLU Garnier Fructis Haircare Weightless Leave-In Anti-Frizz Serum, Sleek &amp; Shine 5.1 fl oz (150 ml)]], and [[ASIN:B003JTEAJQ Garnier Frcts Styl-Brllnt Shn Crm Wx - 2oz]].  Yes, I do believe that all of these products actually work, because if I omit even one, I can tell a difference.  But I&#x27;m always up for trying something new (and hopefully better.)  I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Moroccan Oil, but hesitated because of the price.  So when I found this Agadir Oil on Amazon, I wanted to give it a shot.  Instead, I found that my cheaper drugstore priducts do a better job for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it does smell nice, so I will continue to use it along with my other products, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! A little goes a long way. Leave hair silky smooth and tangle free. Totally worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Favorite product! Im a curly girl and a product junky. The fact that i keep coming back to this product means a lot! It is not too light and not too heavy. Perfect for the LOC method. Also, great moisturizing properties! When i straighten my hair, this peoduct adds shine but doesnt weigh my hair down. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The oil leaves my hair shining which I love!! A little bit goes a long way. Even have my sister using it now and she loves it too! Great smell too!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I&#x27;ve use other Argan oils but thought that I would try this one because the price was reasonable.  It smells like baby oil and did not absorb into my hair.  I&#x27;ll go back to One &amp; Only Argan or MorrocanOil.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the description \\&quot;Contains 100% Argan oil\\&quot;.  The first impression one gets is that it is 100% Argan oil.  But actually it is a mixture of many silicones and some Argan oil.  I am not sure of the percentage of the argan oil to other ingredients.  Since argan oil is listed as the fourth or fifth ingredients I assume it must be pretty small.    Silicones do make your hair smooth and frizz free but I dont think it does anything for the health of your hair.  Buy pure argan oil from other suppliers of you want to reap the benefits of actual argan oil.</li>
    <li> I have very dry naturally curly/wavy hair that is nearly impossible to tame down.  It doesn&#x27;t look particularly good worn curly as the curls are all different sizes and looks like a bad perm.  I think I have tried literally every shampoo, conditioner, serum, spray, wax out there over the last ten years and this is by far the BEST product I have ever used.  I first heard about MoroccanOil through a friend.  I tried it with good results but it was rather expensive and difficult to find.  This is the second argan oil I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s definitely as good if not better than MoroccanOil.  I also bought the shampoo which is also wonderful.  I just shampoo, towel dry, add a dime size amount of Agadir Argan Oil and voila, my hair dries quickly and looks smooth, shiny and perfect.  The humidity still gets to my hair when it&#x27;s rainy but overall this is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever found and I plan on using it forever!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!!!</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time and not greasy</li>
    <li> I think this product is Ok.. it has a very unnatural feel about it.  It does not feel like Oil.  If you have used the product Biosilk, the texture feels similar.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is a little strong... it is good if you are into perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smell lingers on..</li>
    <li> This smells lovely and makes your hair very soft but be careful not to use to much or it can make your hair look dirty</li>
    <li> Love this hair oil, isn&#x27;t greasy leaves hair light and shiny</li>
    <li> This is awesome and a great price too.</li>
    <li> I tell everyone I know about this product.  I see people in restaurants, and think they could use a little (or maybe a lot) of argan oil.  It&#x27;s all I can do to keep my mouth shut.  I only wish I had this stuff when I was younger.  Thinking back I remember my parched frosted blond hair-- ugh!  Since using this product, my hair looks lustrous and healthy.  It makes the color of my (now red) hair look rich, bringing out the red and the highlights.  After all is said and done, the best thing you can do for your hair is to improve its condition-- and this product does it, hands down.  Once I went on vacation to a humid beach and forgot my gel but I remembered the oil.  Turns out that I didn&#x27;t need the gel-- the oil did it all.  I used it in the evening after I shampooed my hair, and it got rid of the frizz.   I also used it on the beach when I came out of the water.  It worked great with the sun!  I came back from a sun and surf vacation and my hair never looked so good! I am truly in love with this product!</li>
    <li> I received this from a friend when I mentioned I needed some more argan oil.  She got me this one/brand. It does not compare to the oil I pick up in Morocco, however it is still pretty good. Even in Morocco you may not get a pure saturated bottle of the stuff so get over it. Those who are looking for organic - doubley get over it. These kinds of products are never fully organic unless you go to the tree itself.  Argan oil in its true pure form does not have a pleasant scent. When in Morocco, the brand I buy is by Cosmetique. I&#x27;ll pick up a few and list them on ebay in the near future. --------- AND even that brand is not 100%.   Go figure.</li>
    <li> My fiance has been using this for years.  Hair looks real healthy &amp; a good natural shine.  Not heavy, sticky look.  Very natural looking.  My hair stylist commented that his hair looks good.  My hair stylist uses it too.</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry I feared it would break off. It immediately responded to this product. It became softer and more more manageable after just 3 uses. I&#x27;ve been using a very small amount of oil and getting great results. I highly recommend this product for its effect. If you don&#x27;t care for fragrance, I&#x27;d avoid it. The smell seems to dissipate fairly quickly, however. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Nice thick liguid, was recommended by my hair salon.  I hope it stops my hair from breaking as it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  I spend a lot of time in Mexico in the sun and water and my hair really dries out.  The oil treatment is great for putting back some life into my hair.  Just put a dab in your hand and run through your hair.  Just do it in the morning.  Works great!</li>
    <li> works and smells great!!</li>
    <li> After watching several videos on youtube on how to moisturized and seal my hair with oil, a demonstrator used this oil.  I have dry, relaxed, color treated hair (I am an African American woman).  This product is excellent and it makes my hair smell delicious, my boyfriend loves the scent. Every night I moisturized with Garnier Fructise leave in conditioner and then I use this oil to seal it, I use a protective style (twist or bantu knots) then I tie my hair. I really like the results and I&#x27;m happy with the way my hair feels.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for a couple of years now.  I love it and Amazon always has a good price.  I usually buy two bottles at a time.  I bought two bottles this time and one of the bottles had a small slit in it and some leaked out into the box, so it wasn&#x27;t really a full bottle.  I&#x27;m sure if I had written to Amazon with this problem, they would have taken care of it.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t have the time to mess with it and accepted the fact that I only got 1 1/2 bottle instead of two.  On the whole, this oil is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Yup, the other reviewer is right.  I just called the company, and they confirmed it is NOT 100% argan oil.  It \\&quot;contains\\&quot; argan oil.  Very misleading indeed!</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair, and I flat iron it every other day...sometimes daily during the weekend. I also have coarse hair, and I&#x27;m telling you....this product is serious stuff. It hydrates my hair so well that even with all the washing and blow drying and flat ironing, my hair is shiny and super healthy. I immediately notice the difference when I run out and don&#x27;t apply it for a few days...it&#x27;s just ridiculous! Going on the fourth year of using it;  I even tried Moroccan Oil which is much more expensive but did not do the trick for me. Had to come back to my Agadir, and gave the other bottle away. I even got my mother and sister hooked on it...! Like I said: serious stuff.</li>
    <li> this product is also good for the skin. my only disappointment is that i thought it was 100% argan oil. it&#x27;s not. good stuff...great scent.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that it is the best! My hair feels healthier after using it and it doesn&#x27;t have any buildup which is great. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy either. I love this stuff!    July 2011 -- Still in love with this product! I find it works even better than the Moroccan Hair Oil brand and I like the smell too!</li>
    <li> It keeps my hairs in order without leaving any traces of oily marks. I would recommend to others as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave-in treatments on the market and as a stylist I&#x27;ve been using tons of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not 100% Argan oil BUT it is meant to be a leave-in treatment. I find Argan Oil (100% oil) very difficult to use as a leave-in treatment as the hair cannot absorb it as fast as a product specifically created for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have damaged and/or naturally frizzy or curly hair this is the right product to put on your hair as a leave-in treatment.</li>
    <li> I bought this product before when it was Morroccan Miricle Oil...friends had told me that they just changed the lable and the name but the product was the same...well its not...I have very dry color treated hair and it does help...it does improve softness and helps with frizz.. but I swear it worked way better before...it&#x27;s still a good product and worth the money and I still use it ...but I think Biosilk works just as good or better and Biosilk is cheeper so I probably would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The best product for hair !!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on the reviews of others, I have relaxed hair and i use it on my daughters hair as well that is relaxed and it leaves the hair moisturized, shiny and there is no oily build up on the hair. I use it everyday and i would definatley recommend it to others. If you relax your hair It works good also good when you apply heat to the hair, no hair breakage or extreme shedding. Best to put on night before bed and cover hair hair would be soft and moisturized by morning.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser in Santa Fe used Moroccan oil on my hair last week. I was beyond impressed with what it did for my hair, but not with the price, so I came here, did some research and bought this oil instead. Hands down, it&#x27;s just as good. It&#x27;s perfect if you live in arid climates... completely non-greasy and leaves my hair feeling wonderful!    For those whimpering about this product not being 100% argan oil, you can buy culinary varieties that are 100% here on Amazon but they will cost you more. Also, I read on Wikipedia that this particular oil&#x27;s chemistry can make it more susceptible to going rancid, so perhaps the other ingredients in the cosmetic varieties are to help prevent this from happening... just a thought.     More good news.. most argan oil is grown by a women&#x27;s cooperative in Morocco and studies have shown it lowers cholesterol.. it&#x27;s a very GOOD thing!!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, because there are much better oils out there. This left my hair pretty dry, and a little does NOT go a long way, but to be fair I do have thick and course hair.  I like macademia products better (even over moroccan), but the best I think is to make your own hair oils. Use a mix of natural argan, jojoba and/or coconut oils.  Look at the ingredients of commercial products and they all have a lot of useless filler but they are still expensive.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Moroccan Oil, but seems to have about the same effect on my hair.  And it&#x27;s significantly less expensive--might as well try it!</li>
    <li> This Argan hair oil is nothing short of amazing.  I&#x27;m a product junkie with thick/frizzy hair, and have NEVER experienced a hair product like this before.  I have tried this formula both ways: on wet and on dry hair.  Using it on dry hair gives it a bit of a shine...and even a little body.  In fact, up until yesterday the results I achieved by putting it on my dry hair weren&#x27;t even worth me leaving a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I tried something different.  I put a little bit (a dime size) in the palm of my hand both when I shampooed and conditioned my hair.  I let the conditioner/argan oil set in my hair for about 10 minutes (also combed it through the ends).  It instantly changed the texture...felt like silk as I rinsed it out.  Combed it straight, sat under the dryer for 30 min.  After that I put a dime size in before blow drying it (no other products) for about 8-10 minutues tops (the technique of blow drying isn&#x27;t to dry it....but the blow dryer infuses the oil even more into the hair strands while straightening it a bit).  Use a high speed hand-held blow dryer that&#x27;ll protect the hair (I use a Pibbs...see my review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I flat ironed it (with my FHI flat iron)...and oh my God, I achieved the same bouncy, shiny, soft, no frizzes, smell good hair effect I would have had if I&#x27;d visited my salon.  I now know my hairdresser&#x27;s secret...they put this stuff in their shampoo (not a lot) and it makes an incredible difference.  I could tell my husband loved it as well.  At work today, I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments from co-workers.  Now, I can do my own hair and look fabulous until my next salon visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages: None.  It smells great (for days), a lot goes a long way, makes your hair healthy, protects it from heat, a fantastic leave-in, a great conditioner, doesn&#x27;t leave a build-up (I use it everyday), isn&#x27;t oily/greasy (it&#x27;s fully absorbed by the hair strands)...so if you&#x27;re looking for a wet-look shine..this isn&#x27;t it.  The hair absorbs it, and shines from within..sort of like a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the very few products that is well worth the price tag.  My little bottle has lasted me three months...and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it (I&#x27;ve used it everyday too - dime size daily usage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps someone...Enjoy!from within..sort of like a healthy glow.       This is one of the very few products that is well worth the price tag.  My little bottle has lasted me three months...and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it (I&#x27;ve used it everyday too - dime size daily usage).     I hope this review helps someone...Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is extremely expensive for something that isn&#x27;t even 100% pure Moroccan Oil.  I only bought this because it was on sale.  I do like how it has added fragrance though.  Pure Argan Oil tends to have a slightly nutty smell, so I actually don&#x27;t mind added fragrance.  However, I do not like the way this smells.  The smell is very heavy and cheap. It would be nice if it came in other scents to choose from, or even had a neutral one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it worked in my hair....it&#x27;s very light weight, and absorbs into the hair very well.  I use it more like a frizz serum more than an actual treatment.  However, I find I don&#x27;t use it as much simply because I hate the smell.  Overall, I&#x27;m not pleased with this product.  It&#x27;s pretty mediocre, and considering the price, it&#x27;s not worth it to purchase again.  I&#x27;ll stick to only pure Moroccan oil and get something I can use as a treatment and isn&#x27;t full of additional ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff for dry or fine hair. Use it sparingly, starting with the ends of your hair and working in through the rest. I use about a nickel size in my palm. My hair has never been healthier or thicker. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received the oil really fast!  It smells so good and seems to make my hair less frizzy.  Doesn&#x27;t look oily either.  I love it!  Wished it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though.</li>
    <li> The Agadir Oil is absolutely incredible.  It takes a very small amount worked into your wet hair (after the shampoo and conditioner) to make it feel healthy and alive.  If you have never tried it ..... you must!  The price is kinda scary but when you see how little it takes to get the job done you will gladly pay it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to save some money by purchasing this Argan Oil treatment over the more popular Moroccan Oil. I used, and loved, Moroccan Oil. This Agadir Argan Oil has similar ingredients but it does not work as well. I will finish the bottle (because it&#x27;s not horrible, just not as great) and then go back to Moroccan Oil. FWIW, I have long wavy hair that I usually blow-dry straight. I use argan oil as a leave-in conditioner and to tame the frizz.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Moroccan Oil, but my stylist was out of it, and saw this online for a lot less than the MO, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  When I first put it on my hand, was surprised at the color--kind of an orangy gold yellow--and at how thick it was.  I have medium length, naturally curly (and often dry &amp; frizzy) hair.  It was pretty hard to get through to all the hair; didn&#x27;t distribute very evenly or very well.  I had to use a LOT that first time to get the coverage I get with half the quantity of MO.  I thought the thick, rich oil would be really good for my hair, as it&#x27;s been pretty dry lately.  But it never absorbed in!!!!  It sat on it for days--worse than the silicone gel/shine stuff-- until I washed it out, and made it look like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks.  Tried it a second time, using much less and using it mainly on the middle &amp; ends of my hair.  Still had the coverage problem.  Some hair was so oily it looked wet and stringy, some hair was dry and frizzy, with some in between.  Still never really absorbed in.&lt;br /&gt;As someone else said, I will use the bottle till it&#x27;s gone because I hate my money to have gone to waste, but I&#x27;m going back to MO ASAP!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Leaves your hair super soft and smelling wonderful.  I have fine hair and it works great. Does NOT leave your hair oily.</li>
    <li> Wonderful as expected</li>
    <li> Very good for your head.</li>
    <li> Agadir offers the best argan oil treatment. I was excited to find this product online for half the normal cost. This oil hair treatment also has a very pleasant smell. I love it!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used the Agadir brand of Argan Oil for several years.  After combing out my just-washed hair, I put a dime-sized amount in the palm of one hand, rub both hands together, and then rub my hands through my wet hair.  My hair is long (down to the middle of my back) and that small amount is all I need.  It smells so good.  I&#x27;ve smelled other brands of argan oil and never found one that smelled as nice as this one.   When my hair has dried, I put a little more on just the very ends of my hair.  The argan oil smooths down frizzy hair and makes my hair feel really silky.  My hair stylist uses this product in her salon.  Can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price, either!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. The bottle recommends putting on damp hair. For me that what works best. I put it on my hair when it&#x27;s damp (at night) and then style/flat iron my hair the following morning. I have had little to no breakage and my hair is infinitely smoother when I use this (as compared to without it). I have tried several other \\&quot;argan oils\\&quot; and none of the ones I tried quite felt as oily as this one. I&#x27;ve also tried putting this on post-styling, when my hair is completely dry, and that works well too. Although I usually only go that route when it&#x27;s extra humid out or there&#x27;s some other reason my hair is extra fuzzy and wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried this product on my skin, so I can&#x27;t attest to its performance as a skin moisturizer. I should probably also note that this product does have a fairly strong fragrance to it. Personally, I really like it (my hubby really likes it as well) but if the smell isn&#x27;t for you it might be a game killer b/c it&#x27;s quite strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: the Organix Argan Oil was probably the worst of the others I&#x27;ve tried-- super sticky, ineffective and there isn&#x27;t a single organic ingredient so the name brand is so purposefully misleading!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years. It is so great, it makes your hair soft and silky. It also takes away all of your frizz.</li>
    <li> Leaves my thick, corse hair soft, silky - AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;Was using Sojourn detangler but this is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will buy it again. Buying it for my sis.</li>
    <li> So far I like it . Smells really great. Not to oily . First week trying it . I put it on damp hair also after I blow dry i add a drop makes my hair smell good</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a GREAT price. I have purchased this item at several stores for 3.5x the amount of money.  [[ASIN:B001U9M2EW Agadir  Argan Oil Treatment, 4-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I have ordered this stuff before and I loved it, however this time it was not as thick and did not seem like the original stuff? It does not hydrate my hair either like it did the time I ordered it before. Is this stuff being counterfeited? I&#x27;m disappointed and won&#x27;t order it again!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for coarse hair, curly hair and thick hair that tends to frizz easily. It&#x27;s also good for really dry damaged hair and works as a great conditioner or detangler.   I use this every time I wash my hair. I notice a huge difference when I blow dry my hair. If I don&#x27;t use it, my hair gets all frizzy and looks like a hay stack. If I use it, I can get a comb through my wet hair and it dries beautifully. It also smells good. Kind of a light version of sandalwood. I use the excess in my hands to soften my elbows LOL.  A little goes a long way so the price is worth it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I straighten it everyday.  The process is much easier when I use Argan Oil.  I have been using this for the past couple of years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I mentioned to my hairdresser that my hair was having more bad days than good.  It is natural curly and would not do what I wanted it to do. It felt dry, unmanageable, frizzy at times.  She mentioned Agadir Argan Oil Treatment.  She used it on me once and I was pleased with the results.  I started using it and use it every time I wash my hair.  I used to have to wash my hair every day just to have a decent hair style.  Now I can go two, sometimes three days without washing because the Argan Oil keeps my hair soft and manageable.  I have trouble with humidity and frizzies.  Not any more.  This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I had first tried this at my salon and was very pleased with the results.  They gave me a sample to try and then determine if I would be interested in using it on a regular basis. I was very happy with it, even with my own non-professional salon treatments!  I use a very small amount and it never leaves a buildup and my hair smells so nice and feels so soft. I also have had no problem with static during this crazy winter weather, even when wearing my wool hat. I was going to purchase it my salon but when they were out, I went searching on Amazon (doesn&#x27;t everyone?) and found it at this terrific price. I was extremely pleased with my purchase and it also provides good protection to my hair when using my flat iron.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find out that my hair seems to dry faster, so another benefit, I&#x27;m not under the blow dryer as long!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days now, and so far I love it.  I usual get dry near my hairline. It gets really bad sometimes, dry flakes. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was psoriasis. I have tried almost everything for dry scalp, and some things work for awhile, then they stop working.  Since I have been using this; I noticed my hair line isn&#x27;t disgustingly dry and flakey.  I can&#x27;t say it will help psoriasis, but it may cure very, very dry scalp.  I always use natural hair products. There are several hair products that contain too many chemicals.  I believe if you are using a good shampoo and conditioner that contains only natural products along with this oil your hair will be FAB-U-LOUS!</li>
    <li> Smells good and seems to brighten my scalp and hair........</li>
    <li> I have been told by three hairdressers to buy this.  I did and my hair loves me for it.  My whole family uses it.  I love the smell.  It is so earthy and not over powering.</li>
    <li> My stylist started using this product in my hair.  Fell in love and have been ordering it online ever since. It makes my hair manageable, soft (I have somewhat coarse hair), shiny, plus it smells so good!  Agadir Argan Oil has become part of my hair routine.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and calms the frizz.  You would think an oil would make your hair oily, but it&#x27;s not true at all with this product!  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This product is great. My son got his first haircut 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s already growing back thanks to Agadir. We love it!</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. I&#x27;ve used morroccan oil in the past, but I prefer this. My hair seems to absorb it better, and the results are fantastic. It seems as though the longer I use these products (shampoo, conditioner, and treatment oil) the better my hair is looking. Absolutely no greasy residue, as long as I only use it on damp hair. If I try using it between shampoos, my hair will not absorb it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product so much. it makes my hair feel softer right away and i like to use it when i want to straighten out my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is the BEST if you have dry hair,colored hair or just want a little boost in condition. It helps in leaving hair soft and shiney without being limp or greasy. It IS THE BEST product out there for these needs, I won&#x27;t let myself run out of this one anytime soon!!!</li>
    <li> This product is really great for all types of hair, my hair is curly and dry so that additional oil helps alot I use it every time I wash my hair I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I love this hair treatment. My hairstylist was the one who started me on it. If you have dry hair you&#x27;ll love it, too. I swim everyday which gets my hair even drier. The scent is nice and clean. I would not recommend it for oily hair. I can get it cheaper through Amazon than I can at the salon.</li>
    <li> I got this to repair breakage and to strengthen my hair.  My hair has not been the same since I had children, it is so delicate and limp.  I have been using it for just a few days and my hair feels great and is so shiny.  My hair is super fine and straight to wavy.  I have had breakage on the top of my hair and the broken hairs were showing, which is embarassing.  After one application, they are not noticeable at all.   After I shampoo, I put a couple of drops in my hand and distribute it throughout my wet hair and leave it in.  I blow it dry and it is breaking less, and dries faster.  We had a wet, humid day recently and my hair was unaffected by the weather.  I will continue to use this instead of conditioner as this leaves no residue.   It&#x27;s great for my kids&#x27; hair as well.  I could see this being great for the summer and trips to the beach.  Highly recommend, wish I knew about it months ago!</li>
    <li> First heard of product fror hair salon. She placed a little dab in her hands applied to my hair and blow dried it. The price at the salon was $40.00, however amazon had it for $20.00. Leaves my hair silky, love the smell.I Place a small amount on hands rub with your hands and apply to hair. My hair was dry and brittle, the oil has alleviated dryness. Would recommend product to others.</li>
    <li> This is not 100% Argan oil as advertised. Argan oil is the fourth ingredient, the first three ingredients are silicones which will build up on your hair and make the problem worse over time. Also, this is NOT a 4 ounce bottle, it is 3.4 ounces.</li>
    <li> The Agadir Oil left my hair looking healthy and silk smooth without a greasy and heavy feel.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I got turned onto this product from my hair dresser.  He was out and i couldn&#x27;t wait for the stock to be replenished....was happy to see it on Amazon......</li>
    <li> I use Biolage and Kenra on my hair. I have tried so many different products. After having children my hair took on a different texture so I now have hair that has some natural curl to it but not enough to wear it curly. I like to wear my hair straight so I blow dry my hair and it tends to feel like straw. I&#x27;ve tried all types of products, conditioners, shampoos and hair and nail vitamins. I heard some girls taking at Sally&#x27;s one day about how wonderful this product was. I saw their hair and it was gorgeous. Against my better judgement I bought this product. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. This stuff works great! I use it on dry hair after blowing it dry. It takes away that straw like feeling, makes my hair feel smooth and silky but not greasy. The smell at first was a bit overwelming, I almost washed it out. BUT, I didn&#x27;t, I am glad because the smell reduces and isn&#x27;t so overpowering. I now like the smell of my hair. Great product!! A must HAVE!!!!</li>
    <li> Simple Amazing. Light and smell awesome</li>
    <li> I live in the south with HIGH humidity and this product is great for that.  I have curly and frizzy hair, with this product that all goes away!  My friends all love my hair, they especially comment on how silky it looks.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, I have chemical treated hair, after use this oil, my hair is much soft, and smell great!</li>
    <li> Great value for price.  This is the same stuff my hairdresser uses.  It makes your hair silky not greasy or oily.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> As a man I tried this product not paying much attention to the fragrance in the list. The oil is ok although I don&#x27;t think you need the added chemicals for this type of oil but wow, I smelled like a prostitute from the very strong cheap perfume. Ladies, again judging as a man this is NOT a classy fragrance!</li>
    <li> Good quility&lt;br /&gt;Good Price&lt;br /&gt;Thank you~~</li>
    <li> Nowhere does it state on the bottle nor Agadir&#x27;s website that this product is organic.  It is 100% certified argan oil but that&#x27;s very different from being organic. Nonetheless, it works well and absorbs instantly.  My forehead tends to break out when using any other hair product or natural oils (like coconut or olive).  I recently started using WEN hair cleanser and I found that my hair no longer needs any styling product (including this argan oil) so I stopped using it but for those using traditional shampoo/conditioner, this works wonders.  I&#x27;ll use the rest of the bottle on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this hair oil by rubbing a small drop through my hair after shampooing and conditioning.  It really helps to make my hair shine.</li>
    <li> Great product , fast delivery</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair looking healthy and smelling really nice! Argan oil is really expensive and after all the research I did this one is one of the cheapest I found. Overall it works!</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t fall for beauty gimmicks, but so many raves for this stuff wore me down. I bought this kind because argan oil was at least near the top of the ingredient list, a pure oil does not seem to exist. It works about as well as a $6 leave-in, but more troubling is the smell. O the smell! This crap has got to be seems to be HALF cheap fragrance. It smells like a fire in a head shop next door to a curry house. It hangs tangibly in the air around my head all day and wakes me up at night when I roll over. I&#x27;m not sure I can get enough used to it to finish the horribly expensive bottle.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long wavy hair and It&#x27;s difficult to manage it after wash.I have been using this product for a few years now and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, the smell is very subtle and the bottle lasts long. It&#x27;s also 3 times cheaper here than in stores.</li>
    <li> This oil is very light and smells great. I am an African American and I have natural hair. I use this oil after I wash and deep condition. This can also be used as a hot oil treatment she heated up.</li>
    <li> My favorite non greasy moisturizing oil. Love it</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your hair so soft and nice. I also love the smell. It is not too heavy - but I have coarse, dry hair. I can imagine if you have fine hair it could weigh it down if you use too much - but I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> If you have dry curly hair this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I love it. I put it on my towel dried hair before I blow dry it and it really does leave your hair soft and silky. I have long thick hair, so I use like almost, but not quite a nickel size of it in my hair. It never feels greasy. You don&#x27;t even need a smoothing serum after drying really. If I feel I do need some, I just use a little bit of the argan oil on my ends and fly aways. I have chi silk infusion, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, so I can&#x27;t compare the two. I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the argan oil, I haven&#x27;t wanted to try anything else!</li>
    <li> excellent ........as expected</li>
    <li> hi- i am 1 of those product junkies. seriously ive purchased everything. my hair is thin  and long and has been dyed + highlighted many times ive been dying my hair sence i was 12. ive tried pantene pro v and it was ok but over time it makes your hair brittle and color fade ive also tried wen recently good at first but later has build up. ive tried everything between $5-$120 this \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; is amazing i use it every day. i use it with moracin oil shampoo and condition i get a clean brush and pour a lil argon oil on the brush and swipe it through my hair its makes your hair feel like silk. it has the look as if you have spent hourse straightening your hair it also makes your hair soooo shiny i use to straighten my hair every day and know i dont need to my thin fragile brittle hair is now shiny, thicker, smoother and straighter, no frizz. my hair poofs in the winter it good from straight to frizz. i carry some of this with me just in case of an emergency. it also increases hair growth. my hair went from a little longer than my shoulders to a lil higher than my hips! buy this product its amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have hair that looks like I get a perm. I use a flat iron everyday and I live where the humidity remains high all the time. This product is wonderful. I use it daily and my hair looks healthy and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for over a month, and as far as I am concerned, it is the best thing on the market.  My hair was never a problem until I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and this product has really made a big difference in texture and manageability.  As a metter of fact, a nurse recommended it to me.  I don&#x27;t ever intent to be without it.</li>
    <li> A very nice product that I am enjoying using.  It smells wonderful and really does a good job as stated.</li>
    <li> you can yell at me later, because I have not used this product, but I have used products with dimethicone and the other ingredients in them for years - Frizz Ease, etc all have this product in it. It&#x27;s what&#x27;s making your hair shiny and soft and manageable. Try the 100% oil and see what you think, otherwise, go buy yourself some Frizz Ease and see what I mean for a lot less money. My coarse curly hair becomes soft and manageable and significantly less frizzy with dimethicone coating it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transported into bliss every time I smell this oil and it is the only product that makes my hair come alive again.</li>
    <li> I thought i was getting actual Argan Oil but I didn&#x27;t read correctly. I was going to use the Argan Oil in a mix for my beard/mustache oil but this works great too. I don&#x27;t use it everyday as I like more all-natural products but this is great when i&#x27;m travelling.</li>
    <li> I had been using a sample a beauty store gave me (different brand) and looked for it when I ran out.  I couldn&#x27;t find the brand I wanted online in the U.S. so I searched on Amazon and read reviews.  I ended up getting this brand after reading a lot of reviews and comparing pricing.  I have fine light hair, and always like to use some kind of leave-in oil or conditioner and most are too heavy and make my hair look greasy or clumpy. This does not unless I use way too much.  The price is great, the oil quality seems high, and it&#x27;s not greasy and heavy.  I will buy this product again, have been using it for over a month already, it will last another several months.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser gave me a sample of this oil to use and I loved it so much I searched for a full size bottle on line. It makes my hair very soft but doesn&#x27;t make it oily. Luv it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and makes your hair very soft</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and hate the buildup most products leave on my hair.  This product controls frizz and defines my curls enough that I don&#x27;t need to use any other product. No buildup and softer hair make me a VERY HAPPY customer.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan oil for about 2 months and I have noticed the difference in my hair. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I use it after every wash and I even use a little after my hair is dried. I highly recommend this product and a great price too.</li>
    <li> I had read other reviews before buying, and felt encouraged to try this product. I have used the oil for almost a month now, off and on. I am not sure yet if I like the scent, but it is gentle, so that is fine. My husband reports that he likes the scent in my hair. My hair feels slightly softer, but again, this is a subtle change.  I will continue to use it for now, and check back in if I have a stronger opinion one way or the other, in the future. As things stand now, I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product works great and delivers on it&#x27;s word, but... I found out just buying pure argan oil is not only just as effective but cheaper and also u can use it on your skin. Just a little tip.</li>
    <li> Works well! I used it on my hair and my son&#x27;s lovely curly hair. Definitely would buy again sometime soon!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s new favorite hair product. She says that it works just as well as Moroccanoil (at least for her it does) at a fraction of the cost. One of her favorite benefits aside from it moisturizing so well is that it reduces the drying time of her hair by almost half. This would make a great gift for anyone women that likes to take care of her hair and uses moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a must for curly headed hair dyers!!!!  Smells great and it keeps my hair frizz free and feeling like silk.  I put it in my hair every morning for some shine and protection.  LOVE EEET!</li>
    <li> I received a ? generic form of oil when my order came.  Looks nothing like the add. However, I will say the product works well.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it that much (not a strong scent though) but it styles great.</li>
    <li> This hair oil is the best on the market.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy-and I use it liberally! I highlight my hair, so when I get out of the shower it&#x27;s like straw.  By the time I put the oil in it and style it, it&#x27;s as soft as can be, and I get compliments all the time how soft my hair is.  When I&#x27;ve run out and bought a substitute oil at the store, my hair is always weighed down and greasy.  This oil is simply the best.</li>
    <li> Ever since I tried this product, I can&#x27;t live without it. It makes my hair feel amazing! Love it and recommend to everyone, especially those with color on your hair!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s Very cool&lt;br /&gt;,,&lt;br /&gt;My hair has become a wonderful and shiny&lt;br /&gt;and Easy demobilization&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three of this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s Very cool</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I want to blow dry my hair. It is a great product and I love using it. It keeps your hair healthy and gives it a nice shine. I have oily hair, but this product don&#x27;t make your hair look oily.</li>
    <li> One little drop of this applied my medium length damp hair; then blow drying made it soft and shiny.  I am a senior citizen and have not had my hair look so great for decades.</li>
    <li> My hair is ever so silky and helped the frizz. I recommend this to anyone with damaged.. Frizzy , and unruly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, smells amazing!! I use it in my hair every day. As long as they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep using it! :)</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my hair feel at first, but by the end of the day it just feels rough and dry. I also thought this was pure Argan, but it&#x27;s just made with it.</li>
    <li> I have course, dry, curly hair.  I&#x27;ve been using the moroccan oil and love it, but it is soo expensive. After several months I gave this a try and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Keeps my dry curly hair, smooth, soft, and looking great.  Not a huge fan of the smell.  I&#x27;m not all that sensitive, but it is very perfumy and gives me a bit of a headache.</li>
    <li> Great product to for my very fine but abundant hair. My hair requires much drying and this helps to keep it from drying out.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and just a few drops to make your hair healthy and beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I like that you can use it for curly hair when you want it curly or when you want to straighten it! Cheaper than Marrocan Oil, but just as good!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from my hair stylist.  First let me say, I have fine hair and at this time of year, it is so full of static and tends to tangle easily.  I have to treat it with care especially when using my blow dryer or curling iron.  With that said, one little drop (a dime sized drop) in my towel dried hair has been all it takes to turn my unmanageable lifeless tresses into hair that feels better than it has in years.  It is silky, shiny, manageable, smells very nice, does not tangle, nor get electrified and best of all it styles anyway I want.  I&#x27;ve tried everything but I am sold on this oil treatment.  It&#x27;s really given new life back to my old hair.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just love the way it obsorbs into my hair leaving it feel soft.  No greasy feel! Great leave in product!</li>
    <li> I cannot use this product.  It makes my hair very oily and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with any type of oily hair.  Made my hair look wet and very flat.  Not happy with this product.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered this at least twice.  My wife love&#x27;s this stuff.  If we could setup to get it auto-shipped, we would definitely do that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! i dye my hair a often which leaves my hair frizzy, my hair has always been frizzy and when there is mosture in the air it fluffs up no matter what i apply on it. My hair dresser recommended me to buy Agadir, she calls it Magic. After every time i wash my hair, i out some on wet hair, and then do my hair. It is never greasy, but turns out soft and beautiful and much HEALTHIER hair. This bottle lasted me a bit more than 5 months and i wash my hair every other day. Thats like forever. :) Im thankful for this product. I recommend it with anyone with frizzy, unmanageable hair.</li>
    <li> Whenever i need to have a great hair day. I use this product and it never fails me.&lt;br /&gt;It was given to me by a friend years ago for my troublesome hair and wow its a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil after every wash on my hair for about 3 years.  Living in a dry climate, and being a bit older (47) my hair needs all the help it can get.  This hair treatment smells great, adds strength to my brittle hair and cuts the drying time of my long hair by about a third - maybe because the oil bonds with the hair and forces the water out?  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Indeed it is a great product as others said. My hair is very happy since I started using this product. Use just a little bit, it doesn&#x27;t really have any smell that stays with the hair once it dries out. My hair is shinny and flexible now.Price is very good and it does last for a very long time. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a beautiful, shinny, bouncy hair. Do not listen to those reviwers that have sour and sarcastic reviewes. I bet they have no idea how to use it (a dime size)or they generally unhappy about everything :).</li>
    <li> I noticed an immediate smoothing effect when using this product. As far as an improvement in the overall health, I didn&#x27;t really see any benfits. I have extremely thick hair, though, so it could be attributed to that. I used it as instructed for a couple of months but saw no real improvement so now I just use it to slick back wet hair.</li>
    <li> It works! Leaves your hair very silky and manageable. Don&#x27;t use too much, may leave you greasy. I have also tried the spray - the oil is much better. Smells a bit like incense, but I personally like it and once my hair is dry I don&#x27;t smell it. I haven&#x27;t used any of the other types of oils so I can&#x27;t compare it but I will keep using this product for sure. It was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this line of products recently through my salon. After shopping around, I found them on Amazon.com for half the price of the salon. Let me say - I love this product line! I use the shampoo, conditioner, and finishing oil treatment each time I wash. I have wavy/curly, thick textured hair, and this product line is great for controlling my frizz and smoothing my curls without causing too much heaviness. My curls are defined, light, and bouncy. I also really love the scent. I live in an area with high humidity almost all year round. Spring and Summer are especially difficult times of year to keep my hair tame. I find this product line has been the best I have ever tried for battling humid conditions, and I have tried many, many other products. On particularly humid days, adding a little extra finishing oil treatment to my dry hair tames the frizzies every time.</li>
    <li> My hair feels incredibly soft and is not frizzy when I use Argan Oil. I highly recommend it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It&#x27;s easy to style and make my hair smooth. I got straight hair and only use in the end.</li>
    <li> The oil is very light and does not make my hair feel oily.  Has a very refreshing scent.  Wish I had known about this all of my life.  I can&#x27;t imagine using a different oil ever again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to relace same item I bought years ago.  It leaves my hair and skin soft, but it is not at all greasy, and for me, it is absorbed quickly.  It has a very subtle, pleasant fragrance that I, personally, really like.</li>
    <li> My stepmom turned me on to this product. She has thick coarse hair but lately I&#x27;ve noticed how shiny it is. She told me about this Agadir oil she&#x27;d been using and let me try some. I couldn&#x27;t imagine it would do much for me because I have super-fine, straight hair but, Wow! I use it instead of mousse or silicon gels that I used to try. It smells amazing - my boyfriend remarks how yummy I smell everytime I put it on - but mostly I love it because it leaves my hair shiny, healthy looking and full of volume. I never expected that an oil would give my hair body but it does. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. (Oh, and if I pour too much out, I just rub it into my hands like a body lotion and it feels great!)</li>
    <li> this is not 100% argan oil... far from it</li>
    <li> Great accompliment to the Aagadir Shampoo and Conditioner. I have Red Hair that is naturally curly and this is a must have. My curls stay lush and healthy looking no dry or split end look for me!  The fragance is lovely as well. Little goes a long way as does the Shampoo and Conditioner. Great bang for the bucks!!</li>
    <li> the product works great and istantly..i wish it last all day or ill add more for my dry hair. i also use it on my extensions to keep it from tangling and frizz. it makes my hair soft and smell great. calms mi itchy scalp too</li>
    <li> I am a VERY discerning shopper.  I do my homework and find the best products at the best price.  This oil is incredible!  I am caucasian, and my hair is thick and naturally wavy but not all-out curly - it&#x27;s dry, brittle and prone to breakage.  Now that I started coloring my hair, it gets even drier, so I wanted something to condition my hair and make it just-left-the-salon silky.  My stylist started using argan oil on my hair, and the results were incredible!  Naturally, I went online to buy some for home use!  Here&#x27;s my routine: I wash and condition my hair in the shower, towel dry it and apply about a quarter-sized amount of oil starting at my ends and working up.  I allow my hair to dry naturally for about 15 to 20 minutes while I&#x27;m doing my makeup (so the oil has time to soak in), and then I blow it dry with a roundbrush.  My hair has never been softer!  It&#x27;s not at all greasy, and it does not weigh down my hair.  I highly recommend this product, especially if you have dry/wavy hair that is prone to frizz.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!!  It makes a huge difference for my hair.  I have never been able to have healthy looking, long hair until about 3 years ago when I discovered this product.</li>
    <li> Same oil you can by at Walmart. Not 100% argan oil! save your money. It makes your hair soft just like any oil substance would. Do not buy</li>
    <li> I helps me keep my dry-frizzy hair moist, soft and healthy. My hair sucks the oil quickly I have not greasy appearance on my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s useful, I think, but it doesn&#x27;t tame my hair like Moroccan Oil does. I will keep using it but I am mixing it with the M.O. Not worth buying. Not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Only wish there was a larger amount for the price but it does exactly what it says it does. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product over 3 months&lt;br /&gt;One bottles goes for 2-3 months easily even if you have very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Natural product, makes hair very smooth, and ohh I love the smell, helps in controlling frizz,  can be used before and after styling, non-greasy, makes hair shinny&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive, doesn&#x27;t feels like roots absorbs this as much like other hair oils bcoz its a little thick.</li>
    <li> It is simply amazing ! :)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using argan oil since over 4 weeks. For some reasons, I did not feel like I was doing justice by using a harsh shampoo and then applying argan oil for the health of my hair. After doing some research, I decided to go for this product. It has been nothing but awesome. Right from the first day of use, my hair feels softer and polished. This has been so far the best shampoo that I have ever used. totally worth the money. Give it a try, you won’t regret it. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product very much. My hair has been permed so that they are very dry and tangled after washing. With this Argan oil, I&#x27;d never be bothered by this problem. I don&#x27;t suggest to use every day, since it will make your hair oily, but I suggest to use right after you washing hair, especially when they are wet.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say how good or bad it is because I&#x27;ll never use it a second time. The closest I can come to describing the smell of the stuff would be a powerful sickly-sweet baby powder-ish smell?</li>
    <li> Great product! makes my hair soft, smells great and less frizzy, however doesn&#x27;t control the frizziness completely.. I also got it faster than expected.</li>
    <li> i have used this product before and it is absolutely amazing.  my hair is so soft and healthy, i dont know what i would do without this treatment!!</li>
    <li> The product works very well, but I find the smell off-putting.  I am looking for a replacement for Oil de Casbah argan treatment which I can no longer find.  This works just as well for conditioning, not weighing down hair, manageability, etc, however, would like to find something with a better scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  Use it daily. My hair used to natually shine and had a lot of body. When my hair went gray, it lost the shine and the texture became wirey. A family member recommended  Agadir and I tried some if theirs. I was a convert!  My hair has never felt softer.  Only word of caution, if your hair is thin, might want to use sparingly. But it&#x27;ll be hard to do because it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! My Agadir Argan Oil was packaged well and there were no leaks. The product smells great and left my hair feeling so soft and also gave it a brilliant shine. The fragrance of the oil does linger for awhile but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is false advertisement because this product is not 100% argan oil.  There are chemicals added to this product.  Do not purchase if you are trying to go chemical free.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have tried many others and always come back to this oil. Nothing else compares. believe me I have tried them all!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It feels like it dramastically improves the quality of my hair until the next time I wash it and use it again.</li>
    <li> I picked a bottle up at Walmart and it changed my life. I run two or three drops through my pixie cut every day and now I never have frizz, even when it is extremely humid. It smells great and makes my hair soft and shiny. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have heard argan oil is good for a lot of things but I use it on my hair after I shampoo. It leaves my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying this different ways. On wet hair, on dry hair, wet hair then blowdrying, etc. It doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it nor will I be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Love this Argan oil.  My hair actually absorbs the product, so it doesn&#x27;t just stay on the surface and end up weighing it down or making it look gunky.  Cuts my blow-drying time in half too.  A little does go a long way.  If you end up with too much on your hands, just rub it into your cuticles, elbows, or any where you have dry skin.  Its a great product that leaves hair shiny, smooth, and soft.  My new fave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase my 3rd bottle of this. I apply a quarter size in my medium length hair and blow dry and style as usual. It makes my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I recently went to have a full sew in done. I&#x27;m not new to sew-ins but I am always looking for better ways to take care of the hair I am wearing and my natural hair underneath. My hairdresser said this was a must have product and I am exceedingly glad I took her advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This oils is light enough to use regularly without your hair becoming too heavy or oily and it works very well. I like to brush a few drops through my hair after I wash but before it is completely finished drying. My hair is noticeably softer, shinier, and more manageable for the effort, so much, so that my hairdresser was actually surprised at the condition of my hair when I went back in. How silly! Considering I owed it all to a product, she had recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This oil smells great as well. I have a tendency to get carried away when adding oil to my hair but with this product it has never been an issue. Even when I over apply my hair doesn&#x27;t get weighed down or feel gross later. When I use this oil on my natural hair there are many notable benefits as well however, they are not as dramatic. This hair does make my natural hair easier to comb through and style. When using it on my natural hair I prefer to treat my hair before I wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve had the 4 ounce bottle for about a month now. I use it at least once a day, have even spilled it a couple times, and still have about 2/3 of a bottle. I will be buying another bottle of this for myself and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great daily oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years! Very happy with the results. Does not make your hair greasy. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Unlike some oils, this product does not weigh my hair down. It smells incredible and makes my hair shiny and hides the fact that my hair is damaged. I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually helps the health of my hair, but it certainly makes it look healthier! Note: I&#x27;ve purchased the smaller bottle before and came in a glass bottle. This one is plastic so I was a bit scared it wasn&#x27;t the real thing. However, other than the plastic bottle, I don&#x27;t see anything that would cause me to think this isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
    <li> great product for your hair, i&#x27;m very happy and use it all the time it truly adds shine to your hair...</li>
    <li> If your hair is anything like mine: thin, flat, straight, dry, damaged, split ends - then this Marvelous Oil Deep Nourish Conditioner from Garnier is for you. It leaves your hair feeling soft, light and clean.</li>
    <li> The Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment, 4-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Agadir isn&#x27;t that great because it makes my hair too oily not like in the beauty where it seemed to work out better</li>
    <li> This oil is great to eliminate frizz and to style your hair. I tried another brand but disliked the scent and I would reek all day. The brand essentially doesn&#x27;t smell or make my hair smell of coconuts all day as other brands do.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair shinny and smooth without weighing it down. Great price too, much cheaper than Moroccan Oil and does the same job!</li>
    <li> After 1 use my waves and curls looked shinier and felt healthier(i have heat damaged hair). It has a nice smell, in my opinion. Its not your typical fruit or citrus burst type smell but its calming. The bottle seems kind of small for the price you pay(4 oz) but it goes a long way on my medium length hair. I actually mix this in with my deep conditioner and my hair is so moisturized afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have been using Agadir hair products since I got a perm almost a year ago. I tried other argan oil products but none work as well or smell as good as Agadir.</li>
    <li> My hair was dry and damaged until I found this oil. No it looks shiny and healthy. I recommend this oil. The first time I bought 4 and then I ordered two more as I live abroad and want it always at hand.</li>
    <li> It actually made my hair dryer...not sure if I got a bad bottle, but I was so disappointed in how it left my hair, I ended up throwing it away :l</li>
    <li> The plastic bottle had a small crack that caused the product to leak over the other package and the box. I was able to save some of the product but I was not happy receiving a damage item.</li>
    <li> It feels nice on  your head, but it isn&#x27;t any help for hair loss issues. It made my hair soft and silky. It didn&#x27;t help my friend who is suffering hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry and unruly hair. I don&#x27;t mind the strong scent. Will buy it again. Wish it was more affordable.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, it is so wonderful for my hair and I am amazed of how cheap it is to buy here...over 50 dollars in store!!! great price and great product</li>
    <li> Well I just got it in the mail just literally right now. I haven&#x27;t tried it so I&#x27;m going to leave it at 4 stars for now but, literally I&#x27;m in awe about how fast it came in. I will try this bottle out and see if I see an improvement to my hair and the. Hopefully it works great</li>
    <li> It does not add the shine that this oil is supposed to give to your hair it is only very temporary.</li>
    <li> perfect fo my hair I love it</li>
    <li> The description is misleading. Says contains 100% pure Argan oil, while it is mostly contains other components. I looked for 100% pure oil, and found myself buying it. You should modify the description as many people were confused, as me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many many argan oil products and this product doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily at all.  Its a wonderful hair treatment and a little goes a long way.  I use it every other day</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair soft and easy to manage. Also smells good.  Have tried countless other products and this by far exceeds the rest!</li>
    <li> It is really good! I color my hair pretty often and it was quite damaged! Argan Oil had a good effect! It really softens my hair and gives healthy look.</li>
    <li> The smill is so nice . And the texture also ..</li>
    <li> NOT 100% Argan Oil! NOT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The gimmick was that this product CONTAINS 100% Argan Oil, which is almost the same as saying that MDF contains 100% wood.  This is really a silicone based product to prep hair for heat relating processes.&lt;br /&gt;This does not offer the rejuvenating miracles associated with 100% Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It makes my hair feel soft but doesn&#x27;t make it feel weighed down or greasy.  I color my hair every 6-8 weeks and using this product on my hair after I wash it really makes it feel great.</li>
    <li> The product smells good, goes a long way and is a great moisturizer. Before I went natural I would use it when I washed n conditioned my hair. It was silkier and did wonders for styling. Now I include in my morning routine. I use the conditioner for deep cond.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff in my hair.  I use it when my hair is wet and I put it on after I flat iron to take the frizzies away.  It doesnt leave my hair looking greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this and have been telling all my friends about it. It leaves a great and fresh smell on my hair and it makes it extremely shiny and soft. I used to pay a lot more for another brand but I will definitely stick with Agadir now.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for keeping your hair healthy and shiny!!! I color my hair and it makes it so much nicer</li>
    <li> makes the hair really light and frizz-free with a gentle scent.</li>
    <li> The Agadir Argan Oil brought back shine and luster to my waist-length highlighted hair. Moisturizes, stops frizzies and feels so smooth. Just need a tiny bit in the palm of your hand, rub it over just washed wet hair, then comb out the knots and blow dry. Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I used it and it&#x27;s very good it made my hair very shiny and seems healthier thanx a lot :)</li>
    <li> I have not tried other Argan oil brands, but I loved how light it feels on the hair.</li>
    <li> I am loving this oil hair treatment.  I have also purchased more pure version of argan oil and i usually prefer the healthiest, purest, least processed form of things, but I love the smell and it works very well with my hair-ie wavy/curly that I blow-dry straight sometimes.  Keeps from frizzing, stays straighter if I want that, more manageable.  I use on wet hair, but also the next day when dry.  No oily residue.  I am considering purchasing a large supply in case they ever stop producing!</li>
    <li> I used this product and and had to shampoo it right out. The smell is overpowering, and to repeat it is not 100% argon oil.</li>
    <li> leaves your hair feeling soft and conditioned and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to their shampoo and conditioner. Especially in humid weather...</li>
    <li> too gooey and oily for me, weighed my hair down.  I prefer the spray version.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works well and smells great!</li>
    <li> help my hair looks very good. the price is reasonable. This product at counter are more expensive</li>
    <li> Awesome argan oil for hair. Makes hair soft and shiny and is always a repurchase.</li>
    <li> For anyone that has dry or frizzy hair or really thick hair like my daughter, who is half Hawaiian, products like this can be a life saver.  Brushing her hair used to take her forever and be full of winces and groans, now it&#x27;s so much better and she loves having softer hair.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Makes frizzy hair lay down, very soft, everyone says it smells so good and fresh.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel healthy smooth and strong</li>
    <li> This is a dream for curly hair or straight hair. Just add a little in the palm of your hands to the end daily not too much as it can weigh the hair down.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product for the price.  This bottle will last me a long time.  I have long, fine and color treated hair.  I live in the Midwest and the winter is so dry here and this is helping keep my hair healthy.  It smells nice and isn&#x27;t over powering and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it greasy.  This will definitely be a repurchase when I need more.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff under their other name.  They had to change the name (other company already had something similar First).  This is the exact same stuff! Just as GREAT AS EVER!  Still a Moroccan Miracle!&lt;br /&gt;Hair is like SILK when used. Cannot keep my hands off of it!</li>
    <li> This dried out my hair to the point of breakage - was hoping it would be like the keratin oil therapy treatment - there is absolutely no comparison.</li>
    <li> I recommend to buy from this product as it is light weight and apply shine to the hair. And the most important thing good product for colored damaged hair. Would buy it again</li>
    <li> I love this oil, always use before hot iron.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it. My hair is so dry and damaged. But this is a life saver. I would apply a small amount after shower to damp hair and work it all the way through. Love the way my hair feels afterward. 5 out of 5.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse hair and when I use this product, it feels like pure silk!  I love the smell too.  It is not flowery or overpowering.  It also cuts the drying time.  I have had friends try the product and they have all bought it too.  Excellent stuff!!</li>
    <li> This is great oil and worth the price</li>
    <li> feels sticky and it change leather color</li>
    <li> the best treatment for your hair</li>
    <li> the best stuff i have ever used , u can feel the diffrence from the first time . i swear to that</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed race and she has that uncontrollable hair. one dime sized drop of this in her hair makes it so manageable. my wife can brush right through it and the brush doesn&#x27;t hurt her. I use many products from this brand. It might be high priced but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> Love it! works well and not too greasy.</li>
    <li> I was told about this by a lady in the Beauty shop that was waiting to get her hair cut.  it is wonderful.  I feel like the color that I put in my hair stays so much longer.  Just love it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy, long, thick hair and I am in my 50&#x27;s. I have tried many, many products to manage my &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;. Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment is by far the best I have tried. This product doesn&#x27;t only releave my frizz, it also helps in styling my hair. I will buy this again. IT IS GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I have hip length hair and it&#x27;s hard to maintain long length hair AND have it be healthy. I felt a difference after first use, this item has saved me a lot of time in my hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, for anyone who tries to use it on their scalp or near the roots, your hair will feel oily. This product works really well if you use it right and by right I mean the bottom half of your hair.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is probably the best friend a dyed head of hair can have. You only need a tiny bit after shampooing to give your hair a little shine and conditioning. I use it with my other products. I also treat my hair before I shampoo, and it&#x27;s great. Before using this oil, my hair was breaking like crazy, and since using it I feel my hair has become thicker from being better conditioned,</li>
    <li> You will love this product also the price.&lt;br /&gt;This makes your hair shinny with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Have referred to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but I was expecting a higher quality from the product. Plus, the product was taped so I do not know if it is ever been use, but product was open.</li>
    <li> Terrific product! A little goes a long way. Really controls the frizz without weighing hair down. Looks soft and product free! Can&#x27;t beat the price with Amazon. I paid less than 1/2 of what I had paid at the hair salon!</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil. It makes my hair smooth and shiny without looking greasy or dirty. I can rub it into my hair everyday and it still looks great.</li>
    <li> I used it twice a day</li>
    <li> This is not 100% Argan oil, its pumped up with chemicals</li>
    <li> I really love using this oil on my dry hair.  I use it before I blow my hair dry and sometimes I use a little bit afterwards as well. The last time I ordered it they sent me a free sample of the shampoo and conditioner and now I&#x27;m hooked on those products as well. The best way I can describe it this story.  I&#x27;m white but I stayed with my black girlfriend once and used her shampoo for her hair. I was hopeful the moisturizers in her shampoo would make my hair look nice but instead I looked like I had fallen in the lake for days. Of course, she used it and her hair looked awesome. Since then I&#x27;ve longed to find something that was in between what she uses and all the products they sell for my hair. This is it! The shampoo, conditioner, and oil are all as rich as you can get without going overboard in my opinion. This line is the holy grail for dry hair.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of it or how my hair felt afterwards. It was not a good product  to buy.</li>
    <li> Leave my hair so soft and shine like. Everybody have to tell me something about how beatiful is my hair now...</li>
    <li> I love This stuff for my hair. It leaves of super soft and shiny. I am a little heavy handed with this product I can&#x27;t help it, it smells so good and leaves my hair feeling amazing</li>
    <li> This product has Argan oil as its FOURTH ingredient.  The first three, i.e., main ingredients are silicones which create a grease slick on anyone with fine, fair colored hair!  The product also has a very strong perfume smell/odor.  I feel the product is not represented accurately.  Ingredients should be listed. I sent it back and bought guaranteed 100% ALL Argan oil product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works for our purpose. We would recommend this product for those looking for a good price and for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was fine in my hair. However it had a rather strong fragrance which I did not enjoy.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair soft, even after having a baby (hair got very dry and fell out - this saved it!)</li>
    <li> very small bottle for something so expensive. oil is really thick so it is hard to work with and use on scalp/hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells awful too. there is also wastage of product because there is no pump etc.</li>
    <li> Love love i ve been buying this product for years! I tried other brands but this is the best!</li>
    <li> I once asked a friend how she got her hair to be so shiny &amp; she said this was her secret weapon! I like that it is a light-weight moisturizer and features naturally occurring ingredients. I use it after every wash as a leave-in conditioner for the ends of my long hair. Also helps to smooth away frizz and protect from heat.</li>
    <li> This Agadir Argan oil is excellent. My stylist introduced me to it and I just love it! I&#x27;m in my late fifties, have long hair and I color it. The Argan oil makes my hair so nice and soft, keeps the frizzies down and it smells great. I pay much less with this vendor than from the salon. Great on your skin used alone or mixed with your regular lotion.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at my salon for a lot more money.  It leaves my hair soft, not greasy and it looks and feels healthier.  I use this every day.  It smells nice too as an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was all the rave on a beauty blog I follow. The blog is about how to go &amp;#34;No &#x27;poo&amp;#34; (i.e. Using natural ingredients to wash your hair instead of the standard shampoo + conditioner). I have been no &#x27;poo for roughly 2 months now and here&#x27;s what I have noticed: my hair is greasy greasy greasy!! This product was intended to be used as a &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; for damaged, dry, brittle, unhappy hair. I read that if you have dry hair, apply it when wet. Greasy hair, apply when dry. It didn&#x27;t matter when I applied this stuff or how much. My hair felt sticky, looked greasy, and if you apply it &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; good luck getting a brush through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run: I&#x27;ll probably still use this stuff but only on the tips of my hair. I read that you should apply it everywhere except the roots. I have naturally oily hair so, I&#x27;m never doing that again. My hair looked awful. Greasy after I&#x27;d just washed it. Such a disappointment. Also, It smells like baby powder. I don&#x27;t really like that.</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations and I would recommend this item to all my family and friends! Great quality and awesome customer service.</li>
    <li> nice treatment oil for the price</li>
    <li> Love this product! One bottle goes a long way &amp; has a great scent. Great for our thick, brown hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my frizzy hair! So light weight!</li>
    <li> Keeps hair shiny soft and in control in humid environment.</li>
    <li> Makes my frizzy hair soft and smooth. Smells great but can be a bit overpowering. Hope they never change the fragrance, or worse, stop making it. Great prices on Amazon. Highly recommended for frizzy, curly hair.</li>
    <li> It acts pretty much the same but has other oils so it can feel a little greasy. The price is ok for what it does but I think in the future I will go back to Moroccanoil.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my order. The delivery was prompt and perfectly described by the Seller. Thank you!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, I LOVE,  THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE OIL ARGAN will LEAVE YOUR hair more manageable. VENEZUELA</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hair. It is great to put a little on my hair after I shower before I blow my hair dry and it does not weigh my hair down, it also smells so amazing</li>
    <li> As with many enhancement products, this Argan Oil Treatment must be tried to determine if it works for your needs.  I am in my late sixties, have thin, dry, and slightly wavy hair. In the last twenty years, as I have aged, I noticed that with the arid climate where I live, plus hard water, my hair has turned almost brittle. A friend put a few drops of this oil in my hand, and as I massaged it into my hair,I noticed an immediate softening and added sheen. And decided to order my own supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in two ways: as a leave-in conditioner after a shower and shampoo, and in-between on dry hair, every few days.  I had to experiment with how much to apply; more on wet hair than dry, and how frequently, until I had just the right amount for the result that I desired. As for the smell; it was a little bit strong for me at first, as I rarely use any perfumed products, but I have come to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the comments about some of the synthetic ingredients, since I never have even had a permanent, or used other beauty products on my hair regularly, I am not concerned at this stage, about using something artificial, to give my older hair a little boost and shine.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair that you usually only brush while there&#x27;s conditioner in it, this is the charm for you. I&#x27;d been using a sulfate free shampoo for a while but after going to the gym, I needed a harsher shampoo to really get my scalp clean, which of course stripped my hair. My scalp and hair don&#x27;t get along too well. They always need opposite care. Anyway, this agadir oil is awesome to get the softness and manageability back into your hair after an harsh rinse with something like suave shampoo. I just put a really small amount in my hands, and worked it through the midsection and ends of my hair, then let it dry naturally. My curls were more defined than usual and very shiny. It also doesn&#x27;t add weight to your hair so my hair had more volume than it normally does. Try it out! It&#x27;s great to find just the straight up Argan oil without any of the watered down junk like parabens and panthenol.</li>
    <li> At least the argan oil is the 4th ingredient instead of the last!  It&#x27;s helping with my winter dryness and works well for a grooming aid.</li>
    <li> My hair is mostly straight, but it has a little bit of a wave and tends to get very frizzy. It can be hard to find a product that keeps my hair looking straight and sleek without it weighing my hair down or making it look too greasy. This does the trick! I run a little through my hair before I blow dray to help protect it from the heat. After drying and flat ironing, I run some over the top of my hair to keep it smooth and hold the frizzies down. I love this stuff! Just remember, a little goes a long way. If you use too much, you can still end up with greasy-looking hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE FRAGRANCE AND MY HAIR IS SILKY WHEN I USE IT...JUST DONT USE TOO MUCH...MORE IS NOT BETTER....</li>
    <li> I plan to always keep this oil - it is awesome and smells nice - like a pleasant smelling man :)  A little goes a long way but is very effective in soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silicone protects my hair so I don&#x27;t mind it being a major ingredient.  Almost all of the other serums I use and have used (i.e. Paul Mitchell...Skinny Serum) contain silicone (first few ingredients).</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic Argan Oil with a very unusual fragrance that I just love.  This product leaves your hair feeling like silk and it is not oily in anyway.  I have so grown used to using it and depending on it to keep my hair in line.  I can highly recommend it, especially for dry or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat buyer.  Use it daily and highly recommend.  The product is not heavy or greasy and leaves my hair soft and  shinny.</li>
    <li> I have this and I have the Spray version, I love them both!  However, I love this serum slightly more, it&#x27;s feels like velvet and it melts right into my strands.  This serum is definitely in a league of its own!  I&#x27;m also happy that I received the one with a pump (this makes it  much easier to dispense).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair has no dye in it and is pretty healthy. Some leave in hair stuff is too heavy on my hair and makes it feel gross. This stuff goes on super light and smells great. After my hair dries, it feels really soft and stays light weight. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is looking for soft hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and buying it from the drugstore at 3 times the price. This is fabulous!!!  I was so happy to find the same product with the same quality!!</li>
    <li> This is very nice for my fine hair.  I can use my flat iron now.  Smell is very nice and the product is no greasy,  Makes my fine hair look like I stepped out of the beauty shop.</li>
    <li> I have never liked sticky hair products, but have always needed something to help me control my hair.  This argan oil works great and is very pleasant to use.  I put it on damp hair, right out of the shower and I&#x27;m off.  Good for a guy who doesn&#x27;t like to spend much time on his hair!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser gave me a sample to use of Agadir Oil.  After that, I was hooked!  I have to use it every day because it brings out the best in my hair!</li>
    <li> Love it! A sample of this came with Dermorganic Leave-in treatment, so that is how I discovered this product. I have coarse, thick, curly hair and this reduces frizz and makes hair look smooth. And the smell is loads better than the Dermorganic Leave-in treatment.</li>
    <li> this makes your hair come alive again ... not dry and brittle ......</li>
    <li> My problem was dry hair especially ends after doing massive highlights. I tried this product once and loved it. It leaves my hair shiny but not greasy. Also, my hair is more managable and looks alive. Another advantage of Agadir oil is that it lasts long time. You don&#x27;t need to apply much in one use. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy but I have a really thick hair and it becomes hard to manage. I&#x27;ve tired different shampoos and gel but nothing gave me anything close to what i was looking for. I started using this product few days ago and i have to say my hair is definitely softer and smoother. I got close to what i was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;The smell kinda of smells like Armani Code... smells good. I use it everyday and makes my hair easier to style and deal with. I would recommend this over your gel and since its \\&quot;natural\\&quot; oil its probably good for you too unlike hair gel. Definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to make it work for the best: Apply a small portion of this oil 1/2 hour (or 1 hour) before you take a shower and then wash it off with a good shampoo or conditioner. it will make you hair silky! I would recommend this method over the one mentioned on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and see the results.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, makes my hair feel soft, silky and shiny! I use it quite often and I woukd recommend it to people I know!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  It&#x27;s easy to use, very smooth and makes my hair look terrific.  Better than it&#x27;s looked in years..........</li>
    <li> Recommendation from my hair dresser. I will be using it forever. I have shoulder length very curly, thick hair that is prone to frizz if no products are on it to keep under control. I use about a nickel size amount worked through my wet towel dried hair. Just remember because it is an oil this is not a root to tip application. I focus on the out layer of hair and finger thru my curls.</li>
    <li> husband loves this product</li>
    <li> Best of the aran I have tried.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this for my curly hair. Works great on ends, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy unless you use way too much.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever found. Have frizzy hair and hot iron it every day to make it straight. It does not dry out my hair or leave it greasy. The product also has a great scent. Have used for 2 years and will continue.</li>
    <li> A great winter hair miracle.</li>
    <li> In the summer heat and humidity my hair get fuller and fuller &amp; starts looking like a haystack.  Putting a little of this on the middle part of my hair makes it look healthy and shiny.  I love it!  I also love the Moroccan Oil, but it is more expensive and the quality seems to be the same.</li>
    <li> i like trying new things and this agadir argan oil is so far my fav hair product. it smells amazing and love what it does to my hair. would deff suggest to anyone who wants shiny and smooth hair</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for several months and my hair is so much healthier now. Its thicker and more manageable. I love the smell! My Mother started using it because she noticed her hair was coming out after a lengthy illness and now she says her hair loss has been greatly reduced!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I prefer it to other types like coconut or avocado because it&#x27;s lighter &amp; the only thing that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount on damp hair after the shower &amp; massage it from mid-hair to the ends (away from the roots) &amp; it conditions and hydrates my hair. It eliminates frizz, relaxes &amp; straightens waves/curls a bit &amp; overall hair looks healthier and shinier with no greasy residue. This is not pure argan oil, but it contains a decent amount (at least you can finger-count the ingredients instead of a long gibberish list) &amp; I can notice the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not-so-much-Cons: The warm incense-like scent is not my favourite but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;  Small bottle but I don&#x27;t really need alot (just a dime size for medium-lenghth hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very good brand &amp; I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair product keeping the Floridian humidity at bay and keeping my hair in beautiful condition a must for hair lovers.</li>
    <li> Fine, straight hair, but this oil brings out the best!  Good stuff... Shipping was fast, kept me informed every step.  Good product from a good company.</li>
    <li> Moved from Az to Fl. Extremely dry heat to very humid. Needed a new product for my hair and this seems to work the best.</li>
    <li> Perfect. My hair fixed and back to normal. It was to dry and I tried everything but nothing work except that oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Agadir shampoo and conditioner for at least 2 years now, and I love them.  They are very moisturizing, smell great &amp; do not strip my hair...I guess that is because they&#x27;re sulfate free?  I decided to try the Argan Oil treatment recently and I absolutely love it.  My hair is natural, and colored, so I need all the protection and hydration I can get.  I mixed with raw Shea, Grapeseed Oil, and Coconut oil; and also use maybe once or twice a week alone.  My hair is so soft and manageable.  I recommend this product and the Agadir brand, especially if your hair is natural and/or you color your hair.</li>
    <li> Heavy for Blondes.... It is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used...Made hair look greasy like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in days.</li>
    <li> I started using this on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  Use it after shampooing and work it in and then dry your hair and it really does improve the feel and look.</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair feel wonderful (and smell great).  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with hair!</li>
    <li> Wish this secret was told to me years ago. This little 4-oz of Argan oil has become my new best friend. My hair type was &amp;#34;damaged and dry&amp;#34;. After applying just a small amount to my wet/damp hair for 2 weeks, I noticed a difference. I will ALWAYS use this product on my hair and nothing else.</li>
    <li> The best of the best, everyone is coming out with similar oils but, this is the original.</li>
    <li> love this product and it has been working on my hair sooo well and it&#x27;s priced so well. I will definitely be purchasing more when I run out :)</li>
    <li> I first saw my hair dresser use this (and she only uses the best). I believe the reviews. This is a high-quality product. I bought it for around twice the price at a drug store. Needless to say, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such an awesome price!</li>
    <li> This Hair oil is a must.  It leaves your hair so soft and shiny. Love Love Love it</li>
    <li> LOVE This stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a year and it is the best!  I have very thick naturally frizzy, wavy, and generally uncontrollable hair and this product allows me to make my hair glass smooth with a flat iron.  Also it really does cut down on the drying time with my blow dryer.  Give my hair a wonderful shine and protects my color.  My hair LOVES this stuff - never been healthier even with blow drying and flat ironing daily.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Agadir argan oil by my hairdresser about a year ago.  You use only a few drops.  The first thing I noticed is that it cut my drying time in half.  I thought it would make my hair oily and heavy-feeling, but it does exactly the opposite.  My hair feels almost weightless and unbelievably healthy with a natural shine that lasts until my next shamnpoo.  It helps protect hair from flat irons as well.  My daughter and I both never want to be without it again.  We tried a cheaper brand that we got from a beauty supply store for only $9.  It was not the same.  I am now very loyal to this product.  I would love to try the related hair care products when my budget allows.</li>
    <li> Great product, as expected</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it to all that suffer from frizzy hair due to humidity. Now I can have good hair days in the good ol Virginia summer humidity. You only need to use a small amount and so this size should last a good while.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time was as described.</li>
    <li> NOT LIGHT ENOUGH, TOO HEAVY</li>
    <li> My wife has curly hair and just loves this product to care for her hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to many products to repair and add shine to my hair after a few botched dye jobs.. This is the best product I&#x27;ve used hands down, and it honestly lasts very long because you don&#x27;t need much. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> so Nice  so Nice  so Nice</li>
    <li> Love how well Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment works! I am in my 50&#x27;s so obviously I dye my hair every 6 to 8 weeks. Hair dye tends to dry one&#x27;s hair, not to mention, the damage caused by blow drying and a hot curling iron. When I started using this product, my hair was shoulder length, It is now to the middle of my back. I&#x27;ve been told I have thick hair and hairdressers love working with it. I give credit to Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment for the visible health of my hair and softness. I know there are a few negative reviews on this product, but honestly, it takes time to learn how to use any product you purchase. All you need is a dime size drop in the palm of your hand, rub palms together as if you are warming the oil and apply working the bottom out to the ends. Thank you Agadir for keeping this affordable.</li>
    <li> great product, leaves a very good smell to hair</li>
    <li> Smoothes the hair and makes it sleek, but it is not a treatment for damaged hair, only a hairdresser and not nutritious.</li>
    <li> Yay! I&#x27;m all for cruelty free products! Makes my hair soft, I dye it a lot so it needed some love. Works good as a body oil, too.</li>
    <li> Ilove it!!! Smell s great hair feel s great!and great product and great price ! Great deal  I&#x27;m gonna order again!!</li>
    <li> Save your money on that popular name brand stuff, buy this you&#x27;ll be happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife loves it, very very happy</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It makes my hair look shiny and healthy without looking oily.  It smells great too!</li>
    <li> i like it. smell good. make the hair soft</li>
    <li> Oh my wow. My hair LOVED this stuff!! My stylist has been using it for quite come time on my hair. I just started with this bottle, myself. Also, I now have a flat iron that uses this oil as well. My hair is the BEST EVER now!!</li>
    <li> It has really helped my hair. My hair use to be so dry and lifeless. Now it is fuller and softer</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great! I love this stuff. It makes my hair shiny and healthy and works great after blowing it out.</li>
    <li> THE ODOR IN THIS PRODUCT IS SO STRONG, IT MADE ME SICK.</li>
    <li> Not pure Argan Oil.  Read ingredients carefully.</li>
    <li> I have bought few of the oil over the past few years and use it every day and I am happy with it</li>
    <li> I received the free sample and was skeptical. I never would have dreamed I would actually put oil in my hair...but I tried it and loved it so much I went and bought a full size bottle. Made my hair so soft and manageable and didn&#x27;t leave that oily film that I thought it would</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Smells wonderful.  Have used this product for little over a month and I like the way it makes my hair feel and look.</li>
    <li> I am totally sold on Argan Oil for hair. I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil, but wanted same quality, just less expense. Moroccan upped their prices in the last year, and they were just recommended on The View, so it&#x27;ll probably go up again. So I read all the good reviews, and bought this. Ingredients appear to be comparable, but the smell is overwhelmingly perfumy. Strong, and not pleasant to me. Moroccan has more of an almond smell, this is pure, in your face, flowery perfume.     It doesn&#x27;t mean the product isn&#x27;t good, and I know many will like this smell. It&#x27;s just not for me - i&#x27;m more an almond/vanilla/woodsy kind of gal.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft, shiny, and silky. Smells great also. I&#x27;ve tried all types of oil treatments for frizz and dryness but none compare to Agadir argan oil.  Absolutely the best!!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A great light oil that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Finally!  Nicely scented without overpowering. This product left my hair moisturized with body to my curls. Love it! This will be a staple in my hair regimen from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Agadir Argan Oil for over a year now.  A bottle lasts me a good 6 months.  It makes my hair incredibly soft and if I apply it prior to washing, it helps my winter dry scalp.  My hairdresser started me on it and recently she had a bottle of the Moroccan Oil.  I asked if it was better and she said no, it was just pricier.  So I am sticking with this oil - I love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product before.</li>
    <li> Great product, speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair, looked all over and tried many products no matter their price, but always found they had alcohol or so much stuff that they weighed my hair down.. I wanted to find a natural way to nurish my hair on a \\&quot;daily basis\\&quot; since I wash my hair everyday, I love Agadir because the hair can absorb it without and oily feeling and helps with frizz, I would recomend this product to anyone how wants to grow their hair in a healthy way!</li>
    <li> Wow JUST Wow!,, Smell is very very good</li>
    <li> Have used Moroccan Oil for years and while on a trip to visit my folks in Florida, ran out. Saw it was cheaper to buy via Amazon than CVS and since being a Prime member, it arrived quick! Authentic product and LOVE how it feels on my hair! Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> My hair tends to be very frizzy.  This oil tames the frizz and leaves my hair smelling nice and looking shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great conditioning oil.  I can&#x27;t live without it.  Great to use on natural hair.  I use it at least once a week for a great conditioning oil or it could be used as a deep conditioner depending on your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My hair was brittle and once my beautician recommended it, I bought it about 3 years ago.  My hair drastically improved.  It is now very soft and silky. I will never be without it.  The same goes for the shampoo and conditioner.  I do alternate occasionally with other products, but will never give up the Agadair Argan Oil Hair Treatment, Shampoo or Conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this product and I have now been using it for years.  I have long hair and it has never been healthier.  I use a little Agadir Argon oil each morning after washing my hair. My hair is now has elasticity with very few split ends and there is little breakage.  My hair also has shine without an oily appearance.  The argon oil is absorbed into the hair.  I have found that the Agadir is the best argon oil as it is of high quality.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well on over-processed blonde hair. I am rather fascinated how quickly it took effect and hoping it continues to work as well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My hairdresser introduced me to this item and I can not get enough of it.  Makes my hair smell great and silky soft!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it! I was using it way before Redken and other hair product makers discovered it! Now every line seems to have some kind of Argan oil in their offerings. I still like this one better than those other big name ones.</li>
    <li> this oil works wonders on my hair!! It is great for keeping my hair moisturized without feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> I did see some improvements in my hair</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my hair along with the spray a little goes a long way and is non greasy my hair was fried from trying to do a bleach ombre and this brought it back to silky shiny locks.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly, great product. It didn&#x27;t grease down my thin blond hair. it helped stop breakage and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before and liked it so I reordered.  Very light, is not greasey at all.  I can see the difference in the texture of my very dry, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I had a beard worthy of a viking king and used this to soften and treat my skin. It smells nice, it works really well, but it has a tendency to leave your beard greasy so don&#x27;t wear this to bed. I used it in the shower and rinsed it before I got out, that&#x27;s the key to success with this product.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product based on the rave reviews and while it&#x27;s an ok hair product, i personally haven&#x27;t experienced glorious results others claim to have experienced.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It smells great, helps my hair dry faster and makes it shiny and easier to manage.  Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t received it yet.  I have just a few drops left in the old bottle.  Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t take much each time I apply it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Agadir Shampoo and Conditioner Combo that came with several Agadir oil sample packs. I loved the oil soo much that I purchased the large bottle...it is NOT the same stuff...the scent is not the same and it has done nothing for my hair. So dissapointed. I guess I&#x27;m going to have to purchase sample packs to get what I want...I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I have very long thick curly hair. This product is awesome. Makes comb through easier and makes my hair so very soft. I will NEVER be without it again!</li>
    <li> First I was googling for marrocan oil. Then realized, that it is only argan oil under huge price. This one smell wonderful. I&#x27;m really satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair became strong and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Great thing</li>
    <li> My favorite Argan oil</li>
    <li> This is not pure Argan oil (it is a hair oil)</li>
    <li> Great for the hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Very Very nice. I would definately pick up this product. I have longer thick brown hair and I was nicely surprised how much I noticed the softness and controlability in my hair! Summertime humidity take a toll on my hair but, just this small amount that I used made a huge difference! Great price too!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair when naturally air dried tends to become very dried out and &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; - this oil helps control the dryness and give it a healthy sheen. The oil itself is extremely lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair or make it feel greasy (unless you use too much). I like the scent as well, although at some times it can be a bit strong like I am wearing too much perfume. If you have problems with dry hair I would definitely give this a shot.</li>
    <li> I tried Agadir Argan Oil looking for a cheaper alternative for Moroccanoil. I used Agadir Argail Oil after the shower as a leave in. It might work better for hair treatment, under hot air kind of hair care.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Agadir Argan Oil and it makes my hair feel nice, soft &amp; smooth.I use this product for frizz control and it really works. I am a little disappointed that this product is not 100% Argan Oil but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Smells great and makes my hair uber shiny!!!</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair feeling silky smooth, for best results put it on when hair is damp!! it helps a little with frizziness but i do live in Florida and the humidity is horrible.</li>
    <li> I like this as much as anything I&#x27;ve put in my hair. My hair is long, thick, frizzy/fly-away, and I live in S. Louisiana &#x3D; high humidity. I read a lot of the reviews that said only put a drop. After I wash my hair, I put several quarter-sized applications while my hair is drying and occasionally more after that. Hair is softer, not as \\&quot;big\\&quot; and not oily. One interesting and surprising thing is that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often when I use the oil. A few days after I wash it (and \\&quot;oil\\&quot; it), it does tame down to a degree - lasting a few more days before it needs to be washed again - about 5 days. It smells nice too. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to the Moroccan Oil. The only difference is the smell, which I can&#x27;t stand. It&#x27;s kind of an old lady floral smell. Luckily it doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair after I&#x27;ve blowdried it. The Moroccan Oil has a clean fresh smell, but for the cost savings on this brand I&#x27;d probably go with Agadir again.</li>
    <li> So I gave this product a try for the first time yesterday.  I dont have particularly damaged hair, or dry hair or overly oily hair.  Its just &#x27;normal&#x27; -- not too think, not too thin.  Its a little wavy but that goes away with a little bit of blow drying.      Last night I washed my hair, shampoo and conditioner,  I patted the hair dry and then put a nickel size amount of oil in my hair.  I started by fingered it through the ends of my hair and worked up until I put any amount left into my scalp.  I left it on for 5-10 mintues and then I blow dried my hair.  I didnt notice any reduction in time when I dried my hair, as other reviewers did.  I didnt notice much difference last night, my hair looked hydrated and not so dry as it used to after drying.  and I did notice that my hair was a little poofy last nite.  The next day, today, however, its AMAZING.  My hair looks so volumeness and shiny and ... &#x27;hydrated&#x27;!!  I dont know how else to explain it.  My hair no longer looks like it was just washed not does it have any fly aways.  It just looks like I&#x27;ve styled it!!  and I didnt!  I love LOVE this product!  I didnt really need it but my hair looks so much better with it in my hair, I might never stop using it!!  the results have to be seen with your own hair and with you own eyes.</li>
    <li> My young daughter is multi-racial (puerto rican, african-american, caucasian), and her hair can be crazy out-of-control.  It also gets tangled very easily as well as very very dry and course in the wintertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the only products I have found that helps me to \\&quot;tame the mane.\\&quot;  I absolutely love it.  I just apply about a dime size of the oil to her damp hair and brush thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it make her hair smooth and detangled, but it gives her hair moisture and has a very pleasant \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; smell that is not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - I&#x27;ve shopped all around and Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> After hearing from a friend of the wonders of Argan oil, I rushed to make a purchase. I was slightly disappointed to find that this product is NOT 100% Argan oil and contains the normative unnatural ingredients you would find in any other de-frizzer. What did I really expect? Save your pennies and opt for a generic bottle from Sally&#x27;s, results are the same level of shine and greasiness.</li>
    <li> Helps with frizz and leaves hair feeling silky. If you do not have very thick hair be very careful how much you use because it can make your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I had used something similar and was excited to try.  It works great leaves my hair silky and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Great scent, and got me through the harsh summer.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> best conditioner for your hair</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and loved it, the price is so much better through Amazon. This is a great product for condition and shine, but does not make your hair oily. also helps hair to dry quicker.</li>
    <li> Opened up the bottle and the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; was very powerful. Was looking forward to,something that would nourish my hair but it smells like a 2 dollar hooker. For me was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great to moisturize dry hair!</li>
    <li> Like all silicone products, this will make your hair feel silky, but will also majorly weigh it down. The smell is overpowering for me, and the bottle cracked when traveling. Not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a silicone based styling cream, I prefer Frederic Fekkai&#x27;s Brilliant Glossing Styling Cream. It smells good and feels a little lighter, although you will need a clarifying shampoo now and then if you use it daily.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser always uses this on my hair, and my hair always looks amazing... but the price int he salon was $48.... finding the exact brand and size for pennies compared to the Salon Price is worth it!  You dont need much, but this oil keeps the frizzy fly aways at bay even on the most HUMID days!!!!</li>
    <li> love this product - been using for over a year. It is only product that makes my prematurely white hair feel soft and silky versus coarse and dry</li>
    <li> Smells incredible!  Anti-frizz without weighing down or being greasy.  Very Happy with product, used to use Moroccan Oil products, but they are way overpriced.    Does not contain alcohol!  Looking forward to trying other products from this company!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have thick curly hair that gets rather unruly in humidity.... which we have in Missouri!  I can definitely tell a difference if I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use this in my hair mix but using this alone just leave my hair super smooth and silky. Will buy more without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Fast shipping!! Product does what it says. Leaves hair with no tangles. Great price! Will order product again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this oil makes my hair feel, soft. It doesn&#x27;t give a lasting shine as when I use other types of oils. I like that the Agadir Argan oil is not oil setting on the hair but is absorbed into the hair. So when I put my glasses on the top of my head I don&#x27;t have to clean the lens each time I use them.  I use it after washing and again after styling and inbetween.  Highly recommend it for the softness and non-stickingness.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product elsewhere. I bought 2 oz for $40 and on Amazon I got 4oz for $20 and it&#x27;s the best for any and all hair types but I have weak / fine hair due to a thyroid condition. So, I mix this with Redken&#x27;s blue bottle protein builder (can&#x27;t think of the name) and it&#x27;s miraculous stuff! :)</li>
    <li> Please remove the chemicals and provide pure Argan oil and I will buy it all the time. I like the smell but not the chemicals! I think most people will buy it this product without the chemicals.  I hope you listen to your customers! Shokran! Good luck!</li>
    <li> Love this entire line. Don&#x27;t think my hair would be the same.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous. I love it for my hair, smells fantastic not like a lot of hair products that have scents that become intolerable. I am very sensitive to smells and this is fantastic. will order again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is very useful.</li>
    <li> Smooths frizzi hair. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this hair treatment. I was looking for an affordable replacement for Moroccan Oil, and this is it. It has the same effect of being light, not greasy, and making my hair relax before blowdrying. After years of having long hair, I went pixie-short, and this is the only thing that mitigates the poofiness for my super thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;If it smelled better, it&#x27;d get a 5 star rating. The smell is fine, but a little masculine.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair.  This product helps to eliminate the frizz and also makes my hair very shiny without weighing it down.  It cuts down on your drying time.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> It makes your hair shine for about an hour and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price.  A light oil that does not weigh down the hair.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> amazing product and it smalls wonderful, get some</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My hair is silky.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this product.  It was exactly as described, a plus was that it came earlier than I planned.  Thank you</li>
    <li> My wife will not do her hair without it</li>
    <li> GREAT stuff!  Not heavy on your hair and helps control curls &amp; frizz.  Since you only use a &#x27;pea&#x27; size amount, it lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I love this oils. It&#x27;s very helpful</li>
    <li> good quality for this price, but when delivery, the package was soaked by oil from somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;it is being leaked from the bottle....or ...i dont know why.&lt;br /&gt;anyway the quality itself is great for hair. I have kept using this product for 3yesars.</li>
    <li> I have another review that goes with this one.  I use this with Crack Styling Treatment, and the combo is very nice on my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, and I think you can even use the oil on your skin if you want.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this on my wet hair and dry hair after styling.  The cost in the salon is triple this price, buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this agadir stuff. If you have frizzy/damaged hair like me ( from self bleaching etc ) this will repair your hair... and you do not need to use it daily, just once to twice a week, and it keeps your hair healthy!!!!! I seriously recommend this product! Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you will smell amazing guaranteed!</li>
    <li> I guess the argan oil ingredient is the key to making this product work so well.  I think it works better than other products I&#x27;ve used to make my hair stand down without looking slick.  The fragrance is ok - I don&#x27;t really like or dislike it, although it&#x27;s probably a little too feminine for a typical guy yet nobody said anything to me about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other products with argan oil that sell for a lot more per ounce, and they probably have a similar amount of argan oil in them.  However, I found an even cheaper alternative - hemp oil.  Hemp oil can be purchased pretty cheaply and so far it has also worked well on my hair just to keep it down without making it look slick.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for making your hair soft and controlled if you have frizzy hair. Wish I could find a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> Got this to tame the frizzys and it works pretty good...any leftover on my hands I put on my arms...feels very good and makes hair tame down...</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  The fragrance is dreamy.</li>
    <li> I love it. This product makes good my hair status. Thanks for argan oil.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products.  Makes my dry hair like silk.  Only takes a drop or two and lasts forever.  Best price around.</li>
    <li> 5 stars..prompt delivery! !  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product for my hair more than any other I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Living in MD, there&#x27;s never a summer day without humidity.  Using this, I barely have any frizzies, and my hair is smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> Been using it for close to 3 years, no complaints at all.  Not oily even on fine hair, just make sure if you don&#x27;t use too much.  Hair looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> Awesome, love this stuff. This makes my hair super soft.  I have really dry hair because I dye it so much.  A little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best oils for hair. We are sold on it.</li>
    <li> Love it. It leaves my hair nice and smooth and smelling awesome.</li>
    <li> competitve price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> This is what happens when you buy product online without knowing first hand what it smells like, i was disappointed bc it&#x27;s expensive, kind of smells like sun tanning oil when smelling from the bottle...which isn&#x27;t bad, but then when applied to the hair, it morphes into a different smell, ever been to a african american salon? Smells similar. Like a burnt nutty scent w/ a slight flair of flowers. Ehh, just wasn&#x27;t for me. ORGANIX morrocan argan oil smells GREAT! It&#x27;s a little thick, but a great hair refresher/moisturizer/shine booster and a whole lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> I have been a cosmetologist for years, I don&#x27;t use my license but I keep it up as I like the benefits of going anywhere to get my products.&lt;br /&gt;Someone told me about this product Agadir Argan Oil so I bought some 4 months ago.  I made a trip to the store today and bought 200.00 of the product as I love it but they are only open 8-5 Monday-Friday so I can&#x27;t get in every day.&lt;br /&gt;This product DOES NOT leave your hair oilly or greasy.  If you put half a bottle on it, it might but I have very fine hair that is recovering from a long vitamin B and Biotin defitiency and with normal spraying on the after shower spray treatment I have had no issues.  I have used many, many other products and there hasn&#x27;t been any big deal about them.  This one I will continue to use because as I said, I feel like I&#x27;m protecting my hair by spraying enough product to protect my hair but I&#x27;ve never had it come out greasy.  I love the smell.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell, don&#x27;t use it but don&#x27;t give it a bad review because YOU don&#x27;t like the smell.  That&#x27;s like perfumes, you wear whats appealing to you.  I have terrible allergies but this product smells good and it&#x27;s not so strong and sweet that it irritates my allergies...</li>
    <li> Excellent and the price fabulous. Recommend it to all those ladies who wish to have silky shinny hair. Use at least once per week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and I have colored hair with highlights so it&#x27;s a bit on the dry side, I apply agadir on my hair after every shower and my hair turns into a very healthy and soft texture!! Btw it&#x27;s not an oily oil so your hair doesn&#x27;t look like you have oil on it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and added it to the 100% argan oil which was an excellent mix. this is sold in Sally&#x27;s near my home but not in the ounces for the low price so for me it is better to get it from Amazon then my neighborhood beauty supply house.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year.  I blow dry and straighten my hair every day and my hair is super strong and healthy; it&#x27;s because of this product.  I have used other Argan oil treatments and they aren&#x27;t the real thing as this is 100% pure.  The price on Amazon is half the price you&#x27;ll pay in the stores.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nice! Felt a difference in my hair after like 1 week or putting this on. Great product, will purchase again. :)</li>
    <li> This helps with winter dryness and flyaways. The smell is a little different from most other products but I think it&#x27;s nice - the key is use only a very very small amount so it&#x27;s extremely subtle.</li>
    <li> I have very dry frizzy thick hair.  This product is great in helping to moisturize and tame it.  Would recommend to anyone with any type hair.</li>
    <li> Just a small amount goes a long way- makes my hair shiny and manageable</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best stuff for smoothing your hair especially during humid days.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but none compare to Agadir.  It&#x27;s worth the price! And only takes a little even it you have long hair.</li>
    <li> Works great, nice smell, not greasy in my hair</li>
    <li> It is silicones - but so is the original overpriced Moroccan oil.  It will weaken your hair over time.  Try to use as little as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you want to save 75% over the original stuff- buy this.  It works exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even think of buying 100% Moroccan oil.  It&#x27;s great on the body - but it will weigh your hair down.  Moroccan oil is another gimmick created from a  very smart person that wanted to make tons of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silicones calm your hair plain and simple.  They also damage it.  Choose your gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just prefer paying less for my gun.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Yes Argan oil is the 4th ingredient and it is misleading which is why I am giving it 4 stars, there are other things that are making my hair look nice. However I don&#x27;t mind it so much because I have tried 100% argan oil, and that stuff smells like poop, and I don&#x27;t want to smell like poop. This product makes my hair shiny and it makes my wavy hair curl nicely.</li>
    <li> This product is made by Moroccan Gold LLC - and I highly recommend it!  I have long curly hair that tends to dry-out and frizz. This conditioner (applied to either wet or dry hair) helps retain the natural curl while adding deep shine and hydration. I recently had several natrual hair extensions added to the back of my length. Working this product through the extension has helped retain their \\&quot;first day\\&quot; texture. I have used this product daily for 6 weeks...and the extensions are healthy! (That is how long the 4 oz. bottle lasted). I Paid $40. for this small bottle in a salon...the price here is great! There are other Moroccan Oil products on the market....this one is worthy of my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> in my opinion the Agadir Argan Oil Hair it works well, even with longer hair, it gives a nice smooth shine, i didn&#x27;t have any problems getting this online, will buy probably again, the four stars are regarding the price, its a little expensive for a small bottle like this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and not only does it smell good it makes your hair feel the same way and adds a bit of luster.</li>
    <li> I originally was buying the Moroccan Oil brand product from the salon and paying $40. I really liked the Moroccan Oil, but could not afford to continue buying it along with the other products that I use on my hair. I gave this product a try at less than half the price and am just as happy with the results! I have naturally curly hair and this keeps the frizz and dry ends tamed. There is no smell to this product. I use a dime sized amount and massage it in to my hair while it is wet. It also works well on dry hair, you just need to be careful not to use too much on dry hair as it will make the hair look greasy. I saw this same product at Target for $30, so Amazon truely has the best price for this great product! If you use the more expensive brand, I recommend giving this product a try. You can get yourself a manicure or dinner on the money that you will save!!!</li>
    <li> While this product smells good, beware its not 100% argan oil, it is partly a parrafin based product. THIS IS NOT 100% natural. but it smells nice and does make hair more manageable for a guy without making it oily.</li>
    <li> I love this one and will buy it again.  I use just a little and use it for my hair and my skin.  My hair is getting hay like at my 60 years and my feet and hands get really dry.  This helps everywhere! A+ purchase</li>
    <li> I was looking for Argan oil for my hair... And thought I would try this. I thought that all Argan oil is the same... Boy was I wrong. The bottle causes it to flow out very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair shine like the brand I used before. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this treatment. I am so happy to be able to purchase it at such a super low price. I have been using this oil for a few years and it works wonders on my dry hair.</li>
    <li> This product has the same ingredients as Moroccan oil and the price is less than half. Saw same product at CVS at double what I paid. Best deal!!!!</li>
    <li> The only agidar oil I will use shipping was fine</li>
    <li> Great for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product !</li>
    <li> This is hair crack, it makes my hair so soft and smooth I don&#x27;t have to straighten down the flyaways. Not to mention it adds tons of shine and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in treatment for my hair. It leaves my hair with an additional shine I wouldn&#x27;t get from my typical shampoo or conditioner. It even smells great too. My hair is really looking so I have to use a quarter sized amount instead of the dime sized in my hand. For best results, make sure you apply it to your hair while it is still damp from your shower. It even smells great too!</li>
    <li> I love it!  The 4 oz bottle is bigger than I thought so it&#x27;s a great value, I&#x27;ve seen it for twice as much at the store</li>
    <li> This product is great...the only downside and the reason for not rating it 5 stars is it kind of smells like a funeral hall? Ive been to a few funerals this past year and when I opened the bottle to take in the smell that some has described as \\&quot;wonderful and \\&quot; smells good\\&quot; I was instantly reminded of that musky floral smell of a funeral home/hall.. YUK! Ive added in some mint oil just to take some of the smell away...I use this product with my Moroccan Clay for a facial mask b4 bed.. so I had to do smthing to tk tht smell away! ...</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair feel healthy, shiny, and soft!..love it!It&#x27;s the best alternative to the morroccan oil especially if your allergic to it like I was.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is reason enough to buy it.  But it really does work on dry, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I put it in my hair after a shower on the tips. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. The bottle last for months! Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it smells great too!  A little goes a long way so use sparingly :) Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I like the smell but it stays there until you wash your hair. But my hair feels soft and nice.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great. Leaves my hair healthy and shiny, protected.  however, it&#x27;s very thick. Like olive oil and all the Argans I have had are much more lighter of an oil making it versatile to use everywhere on your skin. I still think it&#x27;s great though.</li>
    <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried a sample of this product I loved it. I ordered this smaller bottles to try for longer period. I loved the way my hair felt. So since then I have ordered the larger bottles of the product.</li>
    <li> I like using Agadir Oil and the amazon price was considerably less than what I had bene paying at another store.  I also like it came in a 4 oz, instead of a 2 oz. bottle which is what I had been buying.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil and it makes my hair so silky smooth.  It is perfect for the drier winter months.</li>
    <li> this is a great product  I never have had a problem with dry frizzy hair because of humid conditions and I live in Louisiana since I have been  using for 3 years..anyone having dry curly hair will be overjoyed at the results</li>
    <li> I like the way this oil makes my hair feel.  It is much healthier since I started using it and it is a lot less expensive than the Morracan oil brand.</li>
    <li> Does more than advertised great for skin and my hair is getting thicker. I recommend this product for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> My grandson has very soft, verycurly hair.  He is 2 1/2 and has never had a hair cut. The Argan Oil applied after a bath leaves his hair soft, tangle free and shiny.  No frezzies.  It is a great product and I would certainly recommend it for anyone with curly frizzy hair.  You only need a very small amount. One bottle lasts</li>
    <li> Best argan oil i&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> Arrived very promptly.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Argan oil does wonders for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used argan oil before, so I thought this was an expensive little bottle. Turns out this bottle will last quite a while. I bought this in January and I still have about 1/4 of the bottle left, even using it after every shower (about 3-4 times a week) on long hair. It has really improved the texture of my hair, and I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use this and let my hair air-dry, my curls are more defined. My hair is softer, shinier, and tangles less. When I run out, I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair really soft. I love it. Strong fragrance.  But I have to be careful about the quantity i use. If i use too much,it will weigh the hair down even if I had washed it. If it is too little, the next day my hair gets frizzy a little (not too much). But this has considerably reduced my hair frizz which otherwise is uncontrollable.</li>
    <li> Great hair product - use sparingly to avoid oily look.  Worth the expense.  Recommend large bottle to save getting another soon.</li>
    <li> Good product, been using this for a while. Recommend this product to girls that need care of your hair. Good!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft but not greasy, can re-apply for frizzy hair during humid summers. I think that I will continue to buy this prodcut</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and it really does cut the drying time down by probably half!  I have very thick coarse hair and this leaves it very soft and shiny.  Much more affordable than a lot of the oils out there.  I think it&#x27;s a great product and at a very fair price.  I plan on continuing to use it.  Oh, and I love the smell too!</li>
    <li> great product but NOT 100% PURE argan oil, so if that is what you are looking for, you will need to spend more money.</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous for your hair.  Makes it look and smell great!</li>
    <li> Adds shine and keeps my hair in place.  No greasy feeling, a perfect product.  Get it, you will see. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Always helps my hair when it feels fried,  I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
    <li> I love what this Argan oil does for my hair (and mood).  It adds a sheen to my dry and brittle hair and softens it.  The aroma is to die for!  I really look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> So love this oil! Tames the frizz, makes my hair shiny and soft, and smells fantastic. The spray version is my favorite way to apply it although I use both. Depends on if want to blow dry or air dry or just need a touch up cause my hair is having an extra frizzy day.</li>
    <li> Pleasant feel and smell. I am making this product a part of my daily regimen for hair care. decent price as well</li>
    <li> My hair had a lot of damage from perms and hair color and at the recommendation of my hair stylist, I started using this. I am amazed at how much healthier my hair is. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this in combination with the shampoo and conditioner. The oil does wonders for my over processed hair, it makes it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff to get for your hair. The other argan oil products that are 100% oil leave hair greasy. Those are good for skin and face. But this is the stuff to get for your hair, without a doubt.</li>
    <li> It leaves hair shinny and manageable, hair feels soft but bouncy. Has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried when I first purchased this, that it would not be like the moroccan oil brand, but it proved to be a great buy and smells great too.</li>
    <li> Came as said.. No complications</li>
    <li> Love it!! Smells so good!!</li>
    <li> Wow,this is great stuff I love it, I have thick naturally curly hair and it makes my hair soft and shiney, I made the mistake of buying a 2.25 fluid oz.bottle at my local store and paid 24.99$ for it!!!!!!next time I&#x27;ll most definitely order it from amazon and get almost double the amount for a way cheaper price, I&#x27;m so happy I decided to see if amazon sold it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  used I put it on  my hair  I have dry towel dry it this product for years found it on Amazon for the best price. It&#x27;s the best argon oil. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel oily like other products. I put it on my hair after I towel dry it you can also put it on when it&#x27;s dry.  This is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Have ordered this several times before and love it. Love the shine.</li>
    <li> I am reading a few reviews about how Agadir is priced slightly higher then other brands.  People wake up.  This product is made in the good old USA! Something we do not find often.  The products that are cheaper are probably coming from China and probably not 100% Argan Oil as stated.  Trust the Amercian brands.  At least we know what we are getting.  As for Agadir, I love this oil treatment.  I have very think and oily hair.  I must say this product does not weigh down my hair and it actually makes my hair feel and look thicker.  I love the smell of this product.  All around a great product!</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than the Moroccan Oil but I love it just as much. Makes my hair glossy &amp; feel great--not oily at all. Seems like it just soaks up the Argan oil &amp; says &amp;#34;Thank you!&amp;#34; Plus you don&#x27;t need to use much at all so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My wife has been use it for years and she still love it.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair really soft, great product, works well, will definalty purchase another one in the future for myself and family</li>
    <li> Have been using this argan oil for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks good, feels nice and silky, with a shine.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the Moroccan oil brand</li>
    <li> This stuff works really good for dry hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking oily after applying it. It also helps some with humidity. It&#x27;s not going to completely fix damaged hair but it sure helps. I can&#x27;t go a day without using it.</li>
    <li> I have damaged hair and this product really helps.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very nice too, I can use it in the morning before i get out.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling greasy</li>
    <li> Usually when I order this it is not packaged right.  Your company packed it great.  Since it is an oil sometimes before with other sellers they do not wrap it good enough and it comes greasy.  Thank you I will buy from you again.</li>
    <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Light weight!</li>
    <li> I love this for when I straighten my hair, otherwise it just kind of sits on my hair and causes it to become very greasy throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This oil is great but I found best of best oil bottle that has 50 plus healthy oils in a one place. it has all the oils people use all over the World for hair care &amp; loss, it called AL-Shaafi herbal hair oil comes with 60 days money back guarantee -- using this oil means you are using all oils at a time&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love! Keeps your frizzy down and makes your hair super manageable and salon perfect everyday. Not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> I have such mixed feelings about this argan oil! I love the way it makes my hair shine. My wavy/curly hair has never looked this good! The smell is amazing too. I just hate the ingredients...I try to do the organic thing with my cleaning and beauty supplies. I just didn&#x27;t realize that this wasn&#x27;t 100% argan oil when I bought it...my fault. The next bottle of argan oil I order won&#x27;t have additional ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy hair that gets very frizzy if exposed to moisture -- so far this stuff is amazing... it&#x27;s light weight, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  The true test will be taking it to Aruba... I&#x27;ll let you know how it stands up to island humidity.  It does have a smell that dissipates pretty quickly enough - I like it, but I can see it not being for everyone.  I like it MUCH better than Paul Mitchell Frizz Ease stuff.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, wavy, thick, frizzy, crazy hair. I bought this and did not expect such amazing results. I added a little to my conditioner and applied some more to my hair after my shower. I woke up the next morning confused because my hair was 98% straight and AMAZING. So happy.</li>
    <li> I apply it when my hair is still wet it leaves my hair very soft and with a really nice shine. Like the smell to. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy (not curly) hair that I prefer to blowdry straight.  This oil smells awesome, protects my hair and really helps bring some of the kink under control.  There are more expensive versions of it out there (and those are awesome too); but this one, is great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> After washing and conditioning my hair, I put just a small amount in my hand and rub hands together. I run my hands thru my hair, blow dry and away I go. My hair is soft and very shiny. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, coarse, straightened (think curly, frizzy), highlighted hair, and I live in the desert. I haven&#x27;t had to trim dead ends off my hair in 3 months, and I straighten it every day. Makes my hair soft, and fights off the frizz.</li>
    <li> This was the cheapest I found and it was a bigger bottle than I could buy in the salon. I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> I Advice everyone to purchase it&lt;br /&gt;All moroccan product are very good</li>
    <li> Excellent product and realistic price.</li>
    <li> Love this and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Absolute BEST hair oil out there!!! Makes hair just shiny enough without looking oily, smooth, and smells AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this treatment about 5 years ago.  A friend that had undergone chemo told me about it for her regrowth.  It only takes a tiny bit--less than dime size for my middle of the back hair which is color processed.  Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair treatment with a pleasant smell. I buy it here at half of what I used to pay at my hairdresser&#x27;s shop.</li>
    <li> Love this for stopping the frizzed out hair.  Works great and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely a less expensive alternative to the popular blue-labeled Morroccan Oil.  I initially loved this product, but I have soon discovered that you need to be very careful how much you use.  It is best used sparringly.  If you use too much, it can make your hair a bit heavy, and even greasy (and I typically have dry-to-medium hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you find the right amount that works for you, this can be a great product.</li>
    <li> Its quite good. I cannot claim that it has made my hair any better, but I doesnt make the hair sticky as the other oils and the smell is pleasant</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live with out this product. Great price.</li>
    <li> I tried this first about six months ago and I LOVE IT! Nothing, I mean nothing had left my hair soft and manageable. I have very coarse and a lot of hair. I tried using all kinds of moisturizers and other hair packing products and nothing. Once I started using this I got nothing but compliments from everyone! I bought a different, One&#x27;n Only brand, product because I can&#x27;t get this in the stores I live at, I was told it is the same as this one. Sooooo not true. If you want to spend more for 100% do it, but this does the work for me.</li>
    <li> All these Agadir Argan Oil products are awesome and really great for your hair.  They work just as well as Moroccan Oil but are much more affordable.  They do have a strong smell, which I don&#x27;t mind at all, but some people in the house seemed to be more sensitive to it.  If you have a husband or partner with a really sensitive nose, they might not be thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> Please be aware... This has a very strong perfume odor. The description is misleading. This is not 100% Argan oil, it CONTAINS 100% Argan oil. The ingredients are not listed in the Amazon product description. There are several nasty silicone products listed as the first ingredients and there for they are the most plentiful. It has a very strong, cheap perfume smell, like the sickly sweet incense sold in gas stations. It does not smell natural. It was so overwhelming that I had to immediately rewash my hair. I couldn&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word... yuck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used products with the same ingredients that work much better than this product. For one, the smell is extremely strong and unpleasant (this is obviously subjective, but in case you are sensitive to that sort of thing). Secondly, where as the other products I&#x27;ve used have made my hair have defined, silky curls, this one leaves my hair frizzy and looking strange. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I got 4 oz at a salon and they charged me 40.00&lt;br /&gt;loved what it did to me naturally curly hair but my goodness the expense was overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;thanks for offering us who can not afford to shell out for the same product&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much</li>
    <li> It really does what it says and your hair will absolutely thank you for it , meet my expectations and i will continue to use it as time goes by. a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> yes it&#x60;s oil same any hair oil .&lt;br /&gt;I bouhgt more than 6 .Nothing has changed.&lt;br /&gt;I think that the nature of your hair will remain in the last.Oils temporary effect</li>
    <li> It works but it is a knock off of the original. If you don&#x27;t mind a heavy smell then it is nice. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell just very strong. I have to use several products to maintain my curly hair even with this products.</li>
    <li> This argan oil didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. Plus it smells...terrible. It smells like old patchouli! I would recommend trying Argan Magic oil instead of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Been using this for quite some time. I love Argan Oil and great for my hair. Inexpensive in Amazon compared if you buy it at the store.</li>
    <li> Works very well , Just don&#x27;t over apply.&lt;br /&gt;takes out the frizz and my hair never looked better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the product !</li>
    <li> i just love this stuff i used this because my hair is so brittle...this seems to bring it back to life again.works for me</li>
    <li> I love using the Agadir Argan oil treatment right after I wash my hair when it is still wet. The comb glides smoothly and my hair dries shiny and not oily.</li>
    <li> I have had wonderful results from this Argan oil. I have sensitive skin and react to most conditioners. I have not had a problem with this.</li>
    <li> It is not 100% Argan oil, but is a great formula. I have relaxed hair; I put it own after I wash my hair. It worked better on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair soft, and full of body. Not to mention that it smells soooo good! Every time I put this in my hair I get compliments of how I smell soo good. Make sure to follow directions and put a small amount.</li>
    <li> The best product for getting rid of flyaways and taming my very thick hair a bit, making it look less volume-y and more smooth.A bottle of this in the salon is double the price on Amazon. I love that!</li>
    <li> I used this tonight for the first time and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  My hair has a lovely sheen and is wonderfully soft.  My hair goes a little past mid-back and I used about the size of a quarter&#x27;s worth, or maybe a tiny bit more, on wet hair.  At first I was a little worried, because unlike leaving conditioner on, there was no immediate feel that I&#x27;d put product in my hair.  I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d put on too much or too little since I couldn&#x27;t feel the product, or if it was going to do anything at all.  I thought about adding more but worried that I&#x27;d end up with greasy hair, so I held off.  Patience paid off, though, and when my hair was drier, I immediately noticed the new softness.  I&#x27;m glad I bought the product.</li>
    <li> Really helped my hair shine and feel soft.  We try other products after using this one.  I replaced it with a much more expensive one.</li>
    <li> Best hair oil treatment I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product not only smells amazing (like the shampoo and conditioner), but moisturizes my hair, and helps to significantly reduce frizz (even on swimmingly humid Miami summer days). The oil is viscous like honey and similarly colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:  I generally apply this product to my hair when it is lightly towel dried: my hair is medium-long in length, I drip a capsule-size drop of the oil onto my palms, rub them together, section my hair, then massage the product first onto my tips, and finally briefly onto to the mid shaft of my hair. I NEVER put this product on my scalp -- it would make my hair super greasy and dirty looking. After it is applied, I dry my hair again to remove excess water and oil, then run a wide-toothed comb through my hair, and let it dry. The results are awesome: I am constantly complemented on the luster and texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> I had used this brand of argon oil at my salon and never found it anywhere else. After the salon closed down I could not find it anywhere in the stores but was surprised to see it on amazon so I ordered it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;You need very little of the product, very light and gives a healthy shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> Always useful to protect hair in central heating winter conditions or when exposed to wind. Conditions well. Ideal for us oldies as the hair dries out. Not too heavy on the hair. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I see the term on a a lot of products on the drug store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend...we must have diff types of hair because I have not experience any long term benefit.  I say it&#x27;s ok because it smells nice and is silky not greasy.  It also makes combing unruly hair a bit easier.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, thick hair with a tendancy to frizz.  Using this oil before blow drying has left my hair so much softer and more manageable.  My daughter loves it too!</li>
    <li> This oil is a bit stronger smelling than I am used to... not unpleasant but I probably will not but it again. Good oil but the sent mixed with my hair spray is too much.</li>
    <li> Returning this product coz it has chemicals!! It is not pure argan oil !!</li>
    <li> You are the best always</li>
    <li> ok&lt;br /&gt;but  i ded not fiend any benefit after 1 month</li>
    <li> Although I read several negative reviews about the Agadir Argan Oil, I decided to try it and I have to say that it is a wonderful product.  I ordered it after much hesitation, based on what I have read, and it is excellent!!! The fragrance is very subtle and it dissipates a few minutes after applying to hair living my hair, soft, natural and shiny. I will continue purchasing Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment!!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  I use it while my hair is still wet, just rub about a teaspoon or less through my hair and it give is great body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is saving my hair.  It feels like I got a deep treatment conditioner after applying it.  I use it every time I get out of the shower now.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great for the hair and skin.  My friend uses it every day and swears by it.  It is great.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love this for my hair. It does wonders. Thanks for fast shipping</li>
    <li> my hair feels so great when im using this and it makes my hair shiny. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I Order it every few months as it last  a really long time Smells great and makes your hair really soft without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> lasts forever. cap is a little leaky.</li>
    <li> I stopped using conditioner because it always made my hair fluffy and never really added any weight or thickness. My hair is thinning slightly as I get older, and using this after I shower has made my hair feel thicker, heavier, and healthier.</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair - just a nickle-sized drop in your hands, rub it into towel-dried hair, and your hair turns silky, but not oily.  Just silky and shiny.  5 stars for the product and 5 for HBC Depot for it&#x27;s fast shipping time.  Love both of them!</li>
    <li> My sons are biracial (black and white) and I don&#x27;t like putting many chemicals in their curls. But this product works very well to keep the curls defined but not weighted down. Great smell too. Careful to only use a little!!!</li>
    <li> I try a few other different brans, I always come back to this. The odor is not over powering, is not as heavy as some other argan oils. It leaves my hair nice and shiny. I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Is a must have.</li>
    <li> The price for this hair oil is much less through Amazon than it would be at a salon. Delivery has always been prompt, and the product itself has always been a high quality hair oil.</li>
    <li> this product is a very good addition to what i use on my hair,it works very well on us grayed folks.thanks K.B.</li>
    <li> Perfect for healthy hair, skin and nails. I must have this on hand at all times. With argan &#x27;infused&#x27; products being the latest tred I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. However, I like to go straight to the source. When you buy a hair moisturizer with argan oil, I think you&#x27;re getting very little argan oil. I prefer to use my trusted beauty products and add this pure argan oil to them.</li>
    <li> Love tis for my hair.  It controls fly away hair and it spells simply wonderful.  It is economical to use.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to woman concerned with dry brittle hair. I love the smell and the smooth feel it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair treatment I have ever used.  Just 20 drops on my 20 inch hair makes the comb float through my hair after shampooing.  The BEST!</li>
    <li> Oil Hair Treatment is the best thing ever. This is my second bottle I have a third. My friend introduced this to me while I am on deployment and it helps me while I am out here.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and i put this in my hair after i wash it, makes it soft and manageable. I also love the smell of it, reminds me of a salon smell. I also put it in my hair in the mornings and it controls my frizzes.</li>
    <li> I bought this produce since I was looking for a replacement for a similar Nick Chavez product that I&#x27;ve been using for years which is no longer available. After using it several times, I probably will not buy it again. While it doesn&#x27;t bog down hair with an oily feel, it doesn&#x27;t deliver the same shine and manageability that I had come to love with the Nick Chavez product. It&#x27;s also overpriced for how much actual oil is in the product. I would rate this as simply &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34; As for the positives about this product, it works great even if you have fine, limp, or oily hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel oily or heavy. My beautician suggested a similar product by Wella, but I have not yet tried that alternative.</li>
    <li> Its smells really good as if you wear a franch perfume and it keeps your hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a better price for this Argan Oil than you will find with Amazon. It&#x27;s a great product for conditioning hair. It has a pleasant smell and leaves hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> This product is very light. Unlike the other hair oils where they are dense and heavy to rinse out, this product is a light weight, and doesn&#x27;t take forever to rinse out. It really helped restore the moisture in my hair after constant dying and styling.</li>
    <li> I love this for my hair, which tends to be dry.  It does not weigh the hair down (as long as you don&#x27;t over use it).  A little goes a long way so a bottle lasts several months (my hair is mid-back length).</li>
    <li> Gives a lovely sheen to hair,, very cool&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
    <li> Great line of products. I have long coarse hair and it is the perfect conditioning smoother.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and very good product , thanks</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my hair shiny and soft. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Have purchased several times and will continue to purchase.  I love how soft and manageable my hair feels when I use this (which is every day).  Has a great scent, too!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for anyone with thick curly hair. It makes comb out so much simpler. It moisturizes very well too.</li>
    <li> Use it every day on my curly hair to remove frizz</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this in my hair and I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky it was.  She was out of stock and unable to sell me a bottle.  I found it at a grocery store for $25.00 and thought I would check on Amazon first to see if they had it.  I was happily surprised to find it $7.00 cheaper with free shipping and this one came with a pump!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any different than using any other kind of oil. just a hype.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of mixed ethnicity and have incredibly wavy and frizzy hair that is oily towards the scalp and dry towards the tips.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of products in an effort to make my hair behave, including hair serums, masques, pomade, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked miracles.  I&#x27;m not particularly precious about having &amp;#34;100% Argan oil&amp;#34;  and, to be fair, the product that was sent to me does NOT say 100% anywhere.  They possibly changed the packaging prior to my purchase, but I&#x27;ve no complaints about false advertising.  On a side note: I&#x27;ve USED 100% Argan oil and it makes your hair super oily and smell like Cheetos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product the way another reviewer said: I mix it with my conditioner and allow to it sit for 1-2 minutes as a quick hair masque before rinsing it out.  In addition, I apply a bit more to my damp hair when I dry it.  Once my hair is dry, I&#x27;ll also usually rub a small (penny)-sized amount from mid-way through my hair towards the ends and do the same the next day.  My hair feels incredibly silky and smooth; my fly-aways, which have plagued me FOREVER, lie flat, even in my very humid city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing this product again.  It feels great and it smells divine.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I have been using Agadir for years and it does great wonders to the hair! You only need to use a little to go a long way. I had a number of surgeries and my hair was dry and broken and this helped to get it back on track and healthy again.</li>
    <li> Love it - please keep it in stock!</li>
    <li> Better than any Argan oil product for hair that I&#x27;ve tried.  I keep coming back to this one.  My daughters too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells divine, and it eliminates all the frizz and static from my hair when blow drying. I live in Louisiana, so it&#x27;s pretty humid, and frizz is no longer a concern. And coming this winter, I&#x27;m not worried about static. And did I mention it smells SO FREAKIN&#x27; GOOD??? Sometimes I just skip perfume. I wish there was a perfume that smelled like this. I&#x27;d buy that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type that likes to experiment with my hair and change up the color every so often and many times I have bleached and dyed my hair to the point where the ends would be horribly fried and just dead and frizzy!!! And also, i recently got a perm and the damage is even worse than it was when bleached. This Argan oil has saved my hair every time even now with this ugly perm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling silky and manageable than ever before. Even better than when my hair was at it&#x27;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it will say you can use it on dry hair, I&#x27;ve found that it works best when you apply it to damp hair and also use heat (blow drying for me). Since I don&#x27;t like my perm..I&#x27;ve been straightening out my hair by blow drying and the Argan oil really helped smooth everything out as if nothing happened. I know using heat too often also causes damage but it&#x27;s the only way it works on my hair! Like the ends don&#x27;t even look damaged anymore.  It&#x27;s really a miracle in a bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that though the oil is thick, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy or weighed down at all!! And I didn&#x27;t see my hair burning when I used heat..as I had feared would happen when you mix oil with heat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still going to use it (and have found that it works well as a pre-shampoo &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; treatment), but I won&#x27;t be buying it again. The perfume is nice, but overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of silicates.</li>
    <li> To be honest. would never spend $40 on hair oil, but this price made it worth it. I use this product instead of conditioner so it saves me money in the long run. Only works as designed if your hair is freshly cut and maintained.</li>
    <li> I learned about Argan hair products just a couple of weeks ago.  I read the reviews for the Argan Oil Hair Spray.  The box containing the bottle of spray also contained 2 small packets of this Oil Hair Treatment.  This is fantastic, although I cannot say the same for the spray - it left my hair so fly-away it drove me nuts.  Using just a dime-size amount of the Treatment was a totally different experience.  My hair has no fly-away.  Also no heaviness, which is something I watch out for because I have very fine hair.  My hair is now shiny and has a lot more body.  Wonderful addition for me -- being as my hair is so very fine, it has never and will not hold any sort of curl, not even a slight wave.  This Treatment left lovely small curls at the ends of my hair - which is long.  I&#x27;m so glad I found out about this Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> The description says it \\&quot;contains 100% pure\\&quot; argan oil, not that it IS 100% Argan oil. So they don&#x27;t lie per se it is just misleading unless you really pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty while I was out of Moroccan oil (which isn&#x27;t anywhere near 100% a than oil either) because I liked the smell. I&#x27;m also going to say something controversial here. I like the feeling or silicone type products in my hair, I don&#x27;t entirely care if something isn&#x27;t 100% oil for an everyday smoothing type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is dead matter from the time it comes out of your head. You can&#x27;t make something dead healthy. Dead things are dry and lack moisture, think of dried rose petals. You can&#x27;t make them alive and healthy again, you can&#x27;t resurrect hair, so essentially you&#x27;re just doing what you can to make it look and feel healthy and alive, like reconstituting dried fruit in water. You do that with oil, which is why your own scalp coats hair with oil and why brushing your hair to distribute that natural oil before washing hair is so important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what I do. I use whatever product makes my hair feel and look the best (isn&#x27;t that what we care about anyway?) and once a week I wash my hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove all of the build up and cones that have sat on top making it look smooth, and after it dries I apply a mixture of 100% natural oils, jojoba, coconut, and Argan with vitamin E added. I then shampoo my hair. The silicone products help to lock in that good moisture. I use the same theory and mix with my skin, applying the oil after exfoliating and then coating areas like knees or elbows and feet with Vaseline to lock in the oils. It has 100% changed my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I love it .&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much .&lt;br /&gt;Will not be the last order has I love the product so much.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product line from my great aunt and it has literally SAVED my highlighted, long hair!  I ordered the larger bottle from this seller and received my shipment very fast and exactly as ordered.  I will never be without this product again!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out this product because I was tired of paying $40 a bottle for Moroccan oil.  I have very thick hair, about shoulder length, and I had to use 3-4 pumps of Moroccan oil so I would go through it quickly...and I would still get frizzy ends.  I have now been using this new product for 2 weeks and my hair looks so much better than it did with the Moroccan oil.  I use about a nickel - quarter sized amount and my hair comes out smooth and soft every time after I dry it.  No more frizzy ends and I&#x27;m paying less than half the price of what I was formerly using.  I think it smells good, too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this argon oil for more than a year now, and I L-O-V-E it! It makes my hair so shiny and soft! And it only takes a little to make your hair go a long way! This is my first time buying it on Amazon, and it&#x27;s way cheaper on Amazon than in the salon! It arrived just as they estimated, and I will continue to buy it from Amazon from now on!</li>
    <li> I was impressed by how quickly the shipper sent the Agadir Argan oil.  It was packaged nicely, with no spills, which I have had a problem with in dealing with another shipper.  I have not tried the oil yet but will try to remember to update this review when I do.</li>
    <li> After trying both the spray and the oil I prefer the oil. The oil seems to spread more evenly on the hair and seems to give you more product in the long run. I have hip length hair that tends to frizz sometimes from being damaged. The product definitely helps avoid frizz, adds shine, and makes the hair feel softer. It also smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it after I wash my hair. When my hair is still somewhat damp I apply the oil and gently brush my hair to spread the oil. Remember be gentle wet hair breaks more easily than dry hair. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for damaged or dry hair. It&#x27;s just a temporary fix. Nothing can permanently restore or fix your hair. The key is to avoid damaging it in the first place. The oil is just a treatment you can use to make your hair look better and help protect it from further damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months. It is worth it, but it is full of silicon, when you shower you have to use a good amount of shampoo to remove it ( at least i do). I like it as much as  Kielh&#x27;s Argan oil, but i think i like the Kielh&#x27;s argan shampoo/conditioner/treatment more than this product line. But this product line is relatively cheap...</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter.  After damaging her hair all summer, she decided to give it a try.  Now, she wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Seems to last quite a while.</li>
    <li> My hair has been color treated for many years making it dry and brittle.  Agadir makes my hair shiny, smooth, and healthy.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
    <li> Agadir is the the best  hair Product I  have ever  Used. I told everyone I know  How wonderful  it is I  got it. On  amazon</li>
    <li> I use on set of this product, my hair came to alive 😍 I&#x27;m promise I won&#x27;t mass up my hair anymore</li>
    <li> This is the best argan oil that I have used.  It smooths the frizz, leaves a great shine without being oily and smells great.  Much better than other products I have tried.  Love it, use it every day.</li>
    <li> it smell so good!! it makes my hair soft and shine, i will buy it again! that&#x27;s pretty much it :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Put a very small amount in Palm, rub together. Just massage, come through hair, especially ends. If you use too much, hair looks greasy</li>
    <li> It is a Very good item&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> i love this product. it is amazing i don&#x27;t know what i would do without. very moisturizing and protects my hair from damage.</li>
    <li> We buy smaller bottles from our stylist but she stopped carrying these larger bottles. There are 3 women in my house who use it - we need a big bottle! Remarkably, this works on all hair types. Two of us have frizzy hair, and the oil controls that. One of us has straight hair, and it just gives her hair shine and control. One of us flat irons her hair, and the oil protects her hair. I used to use more expensive products but the last time I tried to it really dried my hair out! This product protects and hydrates your hair, giving it shine and control. It seems magical, and too good to be true, right? I was skeptical about trying it too, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it&#x27;s the only brand that smells divine.  I use it to finish my ends or I put it on before I go cycling so when I&#x27;m done my hair is conditioned.  One bottle lasts me over a year and this is half what it sells for at the salons where I&#x27;ve paid $40</li>
    <li> This Argan Hair Oil controls my wavy hair.  It makes it soft. I have some Pure Lavender Oil and added a little of it to the argan oil, I get compliments on how shiny and sweet smelling my hair is.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It does a great job on my hair and it smells AMAZING! I have medium length THICK hair. It does a great job for keeping my hair moisturized in the Georgia humidity. I normally apply it after I blow dry my hair and then style.</li>
    <li> I love this oil amazon has the best price available. I love amazon too,if they don&#x27;t have it right they will do what they can make it right.</li>
    <li> Really cuts down on frizz and helps with drying time. I live in Texas with the heat and humidity and this really helps my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has beautiful waist length hair. This oil makes it tangle free and silky smooth when I brush it for her. It has a pleasant fragrance too.</li>
    <li> Got the product within the week!&lt;br /&gt;Good deal for the price.  The item works really well and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I perm and color my hair regularly and have tried many products to &amp;#34;counteract&amp;#34; my regiment of mistreating my hair.  Agadir Argan Oil Treatment is the first product that I would highly recommend to others.  It is great.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly dry fine biracial hair and this stuff is amazing! Not sure what I&#x27;d do without it. There is another brand that is a little less expensive but I&#x27;ve tried it and the Agadir is better. It absorbs better and the smell is milder and better.</li>
    <li> This product was an excellent buy.  If it can help my 60+, dry haystack hair, then it should be able to help the great majority of those seeking hair texture and shine improvement.  I don&#x27;t care if it isn&#x27;t 100% pure argan oil and that it contains other ingredients. Note that this is not marketed as \\&quot;100% pure argan oil\\&quot;, but rather as an \\&quot;argan oil hair treatment.\\&quot;; emphasis here on the word \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;.  My hair is definitely the better for having used this product. Nor do I care that it is scented (a sandalwood scent) because truthfully, while you can smell it strongly straight out of the bottle, it does dissipate quickly when applied to just washed /damp hair.  After the hair is dry, you can barely smell any vestiges of it even when smelling your hair directly under your nose; and what you can smell is a faintly pleasant fragrance.  I rub the remaining traces of the oil left on my hands onto my face and that moisturizes it well and enhances my skin tone (remember, your face needs oils too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, I&#x27;m nobody special with special needs but when something works like it is supposed to, then I say don&#x27;t be reluctant to tell the world about it.  How many products can you say that about these days?  While the purchase price is more than I would like to pay for any hair care product, one uses so little of it at any one time that it is very economical to use over the long run (think .50 cents per treatment compared to one visit to the salon). You just have to initially bite the bullet when buying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to the point, on the issue of price, if this were indeed 100% pure argan oil, it would be prohibitively expensive. Pure oil was intended more for the skin and facial applications and not necessarily one&#x27;s hair.  I paid $30 for 4 ounces of Agadir Argan hair oil from a drugstore.  To buy the best quality \\&quot;pure oil\\&quot;, even on the internet, would cost you approximately $175 for the same 4 ounces; you do the math.  Therefore, it&#x27;s too expensive touse on your hair unless cost is of no concern. They don&#x27;t call pure argan oil \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot; for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I would say that this Agadir product has taken at least twenty years off the appearance of my hair.  It is more flaxen-like and also brings out the highlights in my salt &#x27;n pepper hair.  It will never again look like it did when I was in my twenties (what does?) but it does looks like a much younger person&#x27;s hair and for that I say \\&quot;god bless it.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair so smoth. Just couple of drops goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.  Great product</li>
    <li> this has helped my hair look healthy and not so dry.  it doesn&#x27;t affect styling or giving an oily appearance.  the longer it is on, it makes hair look better.</li>
    <li> Received this product as a free sample and I was so pleasantly surprised. It makes my hair look beautiful and glossy like a model!</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims to!  Gives moisture and control of my frizzy hair! smells great too!  I have thick curly hair and it works so well! This is the cheapest price for it too!</li>
    <li> As i age, i notice my hair getting thinner, and a friend of mine told me about Argan oil.  I looked for it at Beauty Salons but the prices can be crazy, so the next best thing is amazon! :)  I have been using this oil treatment for a few months now, and have noticed a tremendous change in my hair.  It looks healthier, and it&#x27;s growing, (it&#x27;s actually gone past a length that I haven&#x27;t seen in years) so I&#x27;m excited about my longer hair!!  I should, but I do not use it everyday.  I flat iron, curl, and blow dry my hair, so of course it causes a lot of damage, but this helps my hair stay as healthy as can be :) buy it! it&#x27;s worth it, and a little of this goes a long way.  It can weigh your hair down (because it&#x27;s so oily), so just try to apply it on your scalp and on the tips of your hair....</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I read in many reviews that it added shine to hair. I have not seen the shine I hoped for but the product does make my hair feel soft and less dry. I will continue to use it to counter the drying effects of the hair dryer, flat iron and coloring.</li>
    <li> I gave this item a 3 stars only b/c it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair...I wanted it for growth but instead my hair started breaking so I stop using this product ASAP...keep in mind not everyone hair is the same it may work for some and not for others...overall Argan Oil is good for hair, nails and skin....but I do feel there are just as great other products out there for hair growth :)</li>
    <li> For my Family and they all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not given it a 5 star only cause i want to see if my family will want to buy this product again and again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try this for yourself and you won&#x27;t be unhappy.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat frizzy hair and I straight iron every other day.  This keeps my hair shiny and it smells so good. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have the worst hair on the planet!  This product puts my hair in order without feeling greasy.  I would recommend this product to anyone and yes,everyone.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft, and easier to mange. helps with dryness.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for my hair but anyone leaves my hair as this does, I strongly recommend this product for damage hair</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shiny, full and beautiful...</li>
    <li> This thing dried out my hair. It made it frizzier and drier compared to before I started using this.</li>
    <li> Oh yea, I love it.  Smells so good.  Looks greasy in your hands, but when you apply to hair it seems to soak right in. Not greasy or heavy on your hair not many can live up to that.  makes it so easy to brush when wet, wow I haven&#x27;t done that with other products no matter how expensive</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel any different a all</li>
    <li> Makes my unruly hair look great and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it daily. It smells great and does not weigh my hair down. My kids and girlfriend uses it as well. We all have different hair types and no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is the right weight and consistency for helping your hair recover from the frizzes. I have used this brand for many years and Amazon has the BEST price.</li>
    <li> This product met all of my expectations&lt;br /&gt;Great product !</li>
    <li> Smells great works great!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It reduces the frizzies and makes my hair feel soft. And it has no drying alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels amazing... Works great!</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my hair daily. i wash my hair once a week to prevent my hair from drying out. I use conditioner between washes and this oil only, which leaves my hair healthy and shiny. I have no frizz even after blow drying my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little oil goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell great it keeps my hair nice and smooth with no frizz.  If I get to much on my hands I rub it into my nails and hands...great in the winter.</li>
    <li> This has made my life much easier.  My son is multiracial with tight curly hair.  This oil keeps his hair very soft and individualizes his curls.  It also dries nicely so he never has that wet look to him.  I always get compliments on how good his hair smells too.  Its a win-win!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have heavy, thick, coarse gray hair...and not only does it makes my hair soft and shiny, it also smells really nice. I use a very small amount rubbed in my hands, and then I work it through my damp hair, and then I style it as usual. Keep in mind that too much can cause your hair to be weighed down and look greasy, so less is definitely better.</li>
    <li> I received my sample of the oil. Later that night I took my shower and added the marvelous oil with my conditioner. I noticed my hair was softer, and smelled amazing! I went To the store the very next day to buy the bottle of the oil. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> *HEALTH ALERT*&lt;br /&gt;Please research- this brand Argan Oil is chock full of toxic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this when I initially received it because the smell is not near as pleasant as another brand I was using. I do however really like the way it looks and feels in my hair. Would give it 5 stars if the scent was improved.</li>
    <li> It absorbs very quickly into my hair, doesn&#x27;t really leave an oily sensation, just makes things shinier. Also I enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair...this stuff works great.  I usually buy Moroccan oil and it&#x27;s expensive, so now I mix the two and make them both last a little longer...I prefer this Argan Oil...it smells great and is just a great product.</li>
    <li> my wife use it this Oil  good product</li>
    <li> My hair feels - looks and smells good! I have been using this product for several years -LOST WITHOUT IT</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful in the hair. Use sparingly, you can always add more. Smells great, deep conditioning and leaves hair in great shape.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this oil. I love in Florida and have very fine hair. I put it on AFTER I straighten my hair. Keeps the frizzies tame.</li>
    <li> I will never not use this product as long as I live. I have red hair and its very hard to keep healthy. This does the trick</li>
    <li> works very well on my hair! will continue using it and  recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I use it daily.  I will always keep it with all my at home and travel products.  It keeps my naturally curly hair under control.</li>
    <li> This smells great and makes my hair feel soo soft! ! I will continue to purchase this hair oil and recommend it to all !!</li>
    <li> the information on this product is very misleading.  It states :Contains 100% pure and certified Argan oil.  The reality is there are many other ingredients in this bottle and most likely very little Argan oil.</li>
    <li> one of the bottles was dripping oil and it half way</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this product in stores, but so glad I can order it.  It is great for my hair (not greasy) and smells great too.</li>
    <li> I just knew this product that was suggested me by my hair stylist one year ago.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a  light good perfumed  oil with a light texture to use not only for style the hair but also as a nutrient for them.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair shining and without frizz, adding a light amazing spicy perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Suggested for frizzy, curly hair ........difficult to manage.</li>
    <li> great for dry hair !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this daily and my straight style flat irons so smoothly.  Protects the ends and puts moisture back into my hair. Amazon price is the best I&#x27;ve found.  I prefer it to the Moroccan Oil.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that I use for my hair.  My husband also likes this product.  Now he orders it just for himself.  Remember just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a great price on this product.  The formula in Agadair works wonderfully on my grandson&#x27;s long, curly hair.  I have tried other brands of argan oil and found them to leave his hair looking greasy and stringy.  This is the best brand that I have found.  It seems expensive until you understand that it only takes a few drops to get great results.  I have been using this on his hair for over a year and his rather coarse, curly hair is always soft and shiny.  Tangles comb out easily..</li>
    <li> Good fragrance and it easily absorbes into hair. It make my hair much easier to comb. You also don&#x27;t have any oily feeling.</li>
    <li> The oil works really well without being heavy. I applied it to damp hair before drying it and hair was soft and manageable. A big plus for me was the smell - it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair feel wonderful and it smells divine.  One bottle lasts a long time.............you just need a small amount to make your hair look great.</li>
    <li> Not oily, not sticky. It makes hair smooth, and has good smell.</li>
    <li> i heard about this product on youtube and heard great reviews so i decided to try it out and i love it! makes my hair feel really soft. i kinda dont like the smell but it is just a great product overall  (:</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. I love it</li>
    <li> I am always concerned when the product is an oil. My hair is oily more than it is not. My hair is a medium bob,  coloured and fine so I have several textures and lengths. Using about a quarter to half dollar size blob of oil works for me. The oil smells nice and gives me more styling than sun glitz. My hair seems to stay softer and retain its styled shape for two days, which for me is a revolution because I usually have to wash my hair daily. I will buy again, this product and from this seller.</li>
    <li> This is not pure argan oil, it&#x27;s an argan oil serum, which means it has added silicone.  I really like this treatment, it conditions, eliminates frizz, adds shine and provides thermal protection (thanks to the silicone).  I apply about a nickel size dollop to clean, damp hair (mine is below shoulder length) concentrating first on the ends and then working my way up, but avoiding the roots.  Then I take whatever&#x27;s left on my hands and smooth the top.  Next I apply my regular styling products.  This treatment produces similar results to Moroccan Oil or Macadamia Professional because all three are essentially the same thing.  However, if you want pure organic argan oil, it is available on Amazon for a very decent price.  If you use pure argan oil, apply it to damp hair in the same manner as I have described.  Give it a few minutes to soak in before you use styling products.  Pure argan oil is NOT a heat protectant so if you&#x27;re planning on using heated styling tools, another product that has silicone is required.  I also use pure argan oil on my hair but I use it at night on dry hair and then shampoo in the morning.  Or you can use it mixed in with any conditioning mask.  It works best with heat, either a hot towel or a heat cap.  I use argan oil both ways but for styling I prefer Agadir, Moroccanoil or Macadamia Professional treatments.  I do think they condition my hair and I expect it to look better and better over time.  Pure argan oil does nothing for frizz (I know, I live in Florida, the frizz capital of the Western Hemisphere) so one of these treatments is absolutely essential for me.  But if you want pure argan oil, do your research and you&#x27;ll find good buys on Amazon.  The last time I purchased some I paid $10 for 4 ounces, which is a huge bottle.  However, I will continue to use one of these argan or macadamia oil treatments because I use a curling iron several times a week and I need the thermal protection.  However, I don&#x27;t think any of these serums are suitable for fine hair.  Instead, I recommend Moroccanoil Light or if you want a spray, It&#x27;s a 10 Light.  Both are suitable for even the finest hair.  All in all, I recommend this product for the above stated reasons.

    <li> Got it for a friend with dry frizzy hair. Very next day she came and said&amp;#34; Look at my hair looks great&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Its worth buying again</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that I both perm for volume and highlight to blend in the gray coming in.  My hairdresser recommended this to help keep my hair from getting too brittle from all of the processing. (I have a shoulder length bob so breakage at the longer ends can be a problem.)  I really like it because I just spread a few drops on my palms and work it through the ends that are always the most brittle while it is still wet.  It doesn&#x27;t feel at all oily or weigh my hair down when it dries and really seems to help cut down on hair breakage when I comb it.  (I never use a brush, though).  It smells very pleasant...like Jovan Musk Oil and seems to help my hair air dry quicker.  This small bottle will probably last quite a long time even with every day use.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair but it is shorter on top. I perm and color and usually when the weather is humid I struggle with frizzies. I had seen versions of the Argan here and there and wanted to try it but it was too expensive. When I saw this on Amazon the price for 4 ounces was really good. I use about 6 drops after shampooing and massage it in well. My frizzies are almost non existant! Really glad I tried it. I also put a couple of drops on the top before rolling it and my hair looks and feels healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with the underneath of my hair getting dry and tangled REALLY badly (I&#x27;m a runner so it&#x27;s always getting pulled up!) I rub this into that section of hair and then a little bit on the rest of my hair, besides my scalp of course. WOW. I don&#x27;t what else to compare it to besides a baby puppy, my hair is that soft. I can run my fingers through my hair without anything catching and my friends have all pointed out how pretty and healthy it&#x27;s looking as well. I put in about a quarter sized amount when my hair has mainly dried and it doesn&#x27;t leave my mid-upper back length hair oily at all. Everyone reacts to products differently, however if you have similar problems I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll love it just as much :)</li>
    <li> I love this product and had been buying the 2 oz bottle and  paying a great deal more for just a 2 oz size bottle.  This is an excellent product and well worth the money.  My hair is very soft and and managable and since I have started to use the product I will not use anything else.  I am so glad to have found your site.</li>
    <li> Always received my broken cans and oil leaked twice in a row</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It smells wonderful, it makes your hair dry a little faster, and it make your hair shinier and less frizzy.  I usually put it on with my hair wet, and either blow dry &amp; flat iron, or scrunch it with some spray gel and let it air dry curly.  The last time I ran out of it, I tried using the spray version, and it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  It makes a difference.  Also, for reference, I have very fine, long hair that curls or straightens easily, though its natural state is curlyish-wavyish.  This product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
    <li> I was afraid upon buying this that my hair would be greasy.  But it isn&#x27;t. I usually put this in my hair after washing my hair and it is still damp. Just a few drops, as I have jaw length hair and it is soft and manageable. I can also use a few drops on dry hair and my fly aways and split ends are tamed. This a great product. Oh, and it smells great, too!</li>
    <li> I love this oil but I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive - hence the 4 stars. Works great in my wavy hair and my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair just after washing and conditioning. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> definitely a better buy here than at beauty salon. good for hair whether naturally curly or stick straight.  protects from heat tools.</li>
    <li> Love it. Even after I straighten my hair and put it in it fielding mess up my hair</li>
    <li> Good quality as expected</li>
    <li> Helped my dry scalp make it through a cold winter. I applied it for 20 minutes a couple times a week and let it soak in and my hair looked amazing. The bottle lasts a long time too since you don&#x27;t need that much of it. I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I use it on ky natural kinky afro hair as well as my silky weave (brazilian hair takes this oil extremely well). I would say on my peruvian hair it doesnt take that well and it kinda weighs it down. Other than that this product is great and it keeps hair fron getting tangled</li>
    <li> An outstanding product.  I really like this product because it has solved my problem with dry hair.  An excellent solution for hair nourishment and treatment.</li>
    <li> This is the beat hair oil ever!  It absorbs well, conditions great and doesn&#x27;t leave a brassy or greasy look to my hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great product and good price.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair for the first time and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It softens your hair and makes it shiny...and you only need to use a couple drops if you have short hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes my hair feel soft and it looks so shiny.  I have fine thin hair and this gives it a luxurious appearance I have never had before.</li>
    <li> My virgin brazilian deep curly hair loves this product. Makes hair soft and shiny! I will be buying this again soon :)</li>
    <li> This oil is great. My hair feels so much healthier than ever. I use it after every shower.  Just a small amount is needed so I know this 4oz will last awhile.</li>
    <li> Since using this, I&#x27;ve had to worry about fewer split ends.  I still have them, of course, but this product smoothes out my hair and gives the appearance of nice, smooth, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smooth with less frizzies.  I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  This is a reorder and I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps my hair SO SOFT (and I have horrible coarse curly hair). The price here is much better than anywhere I&#x27;ve seen it in stores. Reminder: this is not pure Argan Oil, it&#x27;s better!</li>
    <li> Great for hair, especially curly/wavy ones</li>
    <li> Again I recommend the Moroccan hair products to everyone. It leaves your hair not just soft but moisturizes without leaving hair greasy, little goes long way.</li>
    <li> The best value of all the argan oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;m really happy with it. Love the scent and it makes my hair soft, smooth, shiny and less frizzy. I use it on my skin as well, it absorbs right in!</li>
    <li> Seems good to me but my hair&#x27;s oily and it does make it a bit more so.  Still I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s good, but no great!</li>
    <li> Agadir works well. It works just as good as Moroccan oil, but the product is a thinner. This is good and bad. Good, because you are in more control of the amount you use. Bad, because if you use a lot Moroccan oil you may go through this a little quicker. The smell is nice and the product does what it says.</li>
    <li> Ok product, but there are better out there. Didn&#x27;t make my hair nearly as soft as other brands.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great! I have thicker, wavy, chemically treated hair. I&#x27;ve used John Frieda Frizz Ease and Moroccan Oil and this stuff is way better in my opinion.. took down my frizz halo without making my hair greasy. It made my hair soft and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This product works just as well as the more popular brand and 1/3 of the cost, it does not have the awesome smell as the other, but it&#x27;s still a nice smell</li>
    <li> I am a 72 year old lady and I have been using this product for 4 years.  The only problem I have is the fact I should have started using it sooner. People out in the public plus my friends, all ask How do you keep your hair so pretty and soft.  May I touch it?  Try it!  It really works.  The price on Amazon is a good price.</li>
    <li> Great scent and price.</li>
    <li> It just arrived hesterday and i used it today and wow my hair looks so shiny, it feels so soft and smooth. By far the best hair product i&#x27;ve ever use.</li>
    <li> Menopause has left my hair dry and lifeless but with this oil i have my hair back.  I have tried everything but this is great.  Just about a dime size after my shower  and then style and go.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for almost two years.  I don&#x27;t like to run out, so I make sure I order a new bottle well ahead of time.  It really adds shine and softness to hair, and helps to straighten waves.  Hair also dries faster after washing since the oil soaks up the water.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and the product is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Smells good.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> good price for a great product...this is the only thing that keeps my hair looking smooth and shiney!  Love it!</li>
    <li> the head and hair are  smother than before .....</li>
    <li> I does a great job keeping my hair hydrated.  It&#x27;s  a lot cheaper to buy it here than at the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Me and my spouse are fan of Argan Oil and have been using it for several years. We usually buy it from local Walgreens or CVS pharmacy. This is the first time we bought this product online. Although the product looks and smells genuine, it was not factory sealed. It was wrapped in a polythene bag and tapped around by hand. I just don&#x27;t like the idea of using a chemical product if I am not certain about the authenticity of it.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair and face.  Just ordered my 4th bottle.</li>
    <li> HI.....&lt;br /&gt;I have used and the results were very, very amazing .....&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to dispense with the curse .....&lt;br /&gt;I have won my admiration</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help with my dry hair that has a tendency to fly away and have strands sticking up that refuse to blend in.  I was using another oil that helped but I still had those renegade strands popping up.  This product has exceeded my expectations.  It makes my dry hair feel soft and silky.  I no longer have any problem with the fly away look.  I use it as directed on wet hair but then also put a little on after my hair is dry to add some shine.  Highly recommend.  Will also be trying the shampoo and conditioner soon to see how those work.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is the latest craze overseas. Bought this for my wife who bought the exact same brand and size for almost 4 times as much!</li>
    <li> Keeps hair healthy love it. Must use daily for results.suave also makes a good oil 5 five more words ok</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair and this is by far the best oil I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry out or weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It really make your hair more healthy!  Wish it comes with a bigger size.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> The last time I went to the salon to have my hair done, my hairdresser used this on my hair. My hair has a tendency to be dry on the ends and a bit frizzy. This has helped so much. Better than any other product I have used. Will buy again.  Pricey unless you can find it when it&#x27;s on sale, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Have used this before and so far it&#x27;s better than some others out there, has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t too oily on hair, leaves hair nice n shinny, seller did a great job,</li>
    <li> I like. thank you Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  Makes her hair smell great too.</li>
    <li> I was afraid it might make my hair oily or something. Not at all and I was able to notice a big difference in seconds. Awesome</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick with a hint of natural curl.  A pearl-size drop rubbed into my wet hair leaves it completely manageable, shiney and friz-free without a greasy look.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE HAIR PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Excellent product;  a little goes a long way. I have long hair, colored and keratin treated and I use this everyday.  Too much will give you an oily look.  It&#x27;s smells really good and I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  It does not make your hair look shinny like other product that I use.</li>
    <li> I love putting this in my hair.  It makes it soft, shiny, and smell great.  My hair is naturally curly/wavy and can get very dry on the ends.  This helps my haircuts last longer.</li>
    <li> My go-to product after shower!</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair shiny and smells wonderful!  I have continued to use this before and following drying my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for dry hair. It moisterizes without weighing your hair down. Will definately keep buying it!!! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is pleasant but a little overboard. I tried putting this in my hair before bed and couldn&#x27;t sleep. Also there is a definite chemical feel to it that seems slightly toxic. If you are at all sensitive to chemicals, get the organic oil which is  much more pleasant.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair oil. I have tried many other hair oil but this one is BEST.</li>
    <li> A small amount of this oil rubbed around your hands and gently massaged into your hair brings life and health to even hair damaged from coloring or outdoor abuse.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Great for hair and skin!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and im 54 years wise. This is all i use to blow dry and flat iron. Great product! Also run it through my ends before bed. Hair looks shiney and stays healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than five years.  It keeps my hair from getting too dry without being greasy, nor does it have a strolng scent.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil and it is silky smooth. I use it on my skin too.</li>
    <li> Living in a dry climate requires extra moisture for hair. Works better than most other oil hair treatments.</li>
    <li> Have been using this argan oil for a couple of years now.  It is the only thing I use on my hair.  Keeps my hair soft and manageable.  Doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate frizz but does improve it.  If you&#x27;re not heavy handed with it - it will not weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair shiny and silky.  My hairstylist recommended this product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I can&#x27;t imagine not using it.  I was first introduced to argan oil by a hairdresser.  He told me it helps hair to dry faster.  I have very curly hair and the argan oil seems to tame it.  Smells great too!  Amazon is the least expensive place to buy it.</li>
    <li> I used a different brand of Argan oil that I loved and tried this when I ran out because it was cheaper.  It was ok.  Biggest turn off was the VERY strong men&#x27;s cologne smell.  Not exactly what a woman wants to smell like.  Still worked well when blowdrying and flat ironing my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for any hair!! Your hair will feel fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenerates Damaged Hair Cells With Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure. Argan oil may prevent this damage and protect our hair against aggressive factors, maintaining it healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is an excellent rescue for hair that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Usually this item is over priced even for a 2oz bottle but I got it here for a cheaper amount and more in the bottle. It&#x27;s amazing on my hair no matter how many times I use it and smells great!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair and is waaayy to expensive</li>
    <li> I returned this unopened. My bad, I did not fully research the ingredients before ordering, so upon receiving my shipment I noticed there are  more additives than the current argan oil I&#x27;m using and I&#x27;m looking to get away from the dimethicone, cyclomethicone, etc. Honestly, I&#x27;m not so sure those aren&#x27;t more responsible for the soft hair than the token amount of argan oil. Nice but not natural.</li>
    <li> Its price is too expensive for its minimal effect that other products i use more cheaper and more effective</li>
    <li> I found this product just to be okay.  It does make it easier to comb out my damp hair and does help make it smooth.  Its a little on the greasy side and the smell reminds me of a hotel room that has been smoked in, but that&#x27;s just me.  I prefer a the HSI argan leave in treatment over this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shiny and smooth.  It also smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> this product make my hair shine</li>
    <li> This brand of argan oil works really well. It smells good and keeps my hair soft and looking healthy. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Product did not &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; my hair, just rinsed out and smelled goof.. I have awful frizz from radiation on my head. I would say you need good hair to begin with for this product. I wasted a lot of money trying hair treatments and finally found Wen sweet almond mint was the only product that made my hair soft and took out the frizz for a few days.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it! I use it on my naturally curly hair and it leaves it soft and moisturized. I just finished the bottle and have to order another so I felt inclined to write my very first review on amazon for this very product! Definitely recommend it. ;D</li>
    <li> I am a swimmer, constant lap swimming.  This product is what saves my hair, no dryness whatsoever.  I am happy with Agadir Argan Oil and will continue to purchase, as it also smells quite nice.</li>
    <li> This argan oil has a soft exotic scent and the oil is really good for your hair and skin.  I do not put this oil on my face because it is scented but will rub any excess anywhere on the body.  I have been using this specific brand for over 4 years and love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use in my hair. It maintains a silky soft feel and seems to keep my hair well protected from any heat damage when I blow dry and/or flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for years and used to buy this in the store but the price sky rocketed. I have found Amazon to be the most fist effective way to get my hands on this now.</li>
    <li> I love this oil it smells so good and feels great on your hair. I press my hair so this is perfect to get rid of that iron smell. It&#x27;s Light, It&#x27;s Smells Good, &amp; It Nourishes my hair...Love It *wink*</li>
    <li> Love this oil I use this on my face too. It drys really fast so on the go I use this oil. at night  I use the other argan oil</li>
    <li> Hair stylists that sell this charge way too much money. It&#x27;s great product and I buy more then one at a time as my daughter uses it also.</li>
    <li> This is the only argon oil product I&#x27;ve found that works really well without feeling sticky; my daughter and I love it. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped within the estimated time frame. The item smells good and helps to make my hair soft and manageable.  I am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> For a long time I couldn&#x27;t find a good leave-in hair product that would work for me. This one is perfect. My hair got much better since I&#x27;ve been using it (less split ends).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years. This is the best product I have ever used on my thin, dry, frizzy, slightly curly hair. It controls the split ends and fly aways while leaving my hair soft and shiny. It also doesn&#x27;t build up any unwanted residue. I use it every day. It helps manage my hair in a curlier style or when I blow it out.</li>
    <li> My hair can be dry and frizzy. Not with this stuff. I add a little bit - and regardless of weather I dry or leave my hair wet - it looks great - never grease. Smells awesome too. In the higest humidity my hair does not frizz. My hairdresser says my hair is in great contition - despite coloring. I think the Argan Oil makes a huge difference. I don&#x27;t ever go without it. Also, have traveled with the bottle and it does not leak.</li>
    <li> this oil makes my hair softer but you can only use a very small amount. it also has a slight odor that I don&#x27;t really like or it doesn&#x27;t mix well with the other smells from the other hair products-shampoo, conditioner, styling cream - that I put in my hair.</li>
</ol>
