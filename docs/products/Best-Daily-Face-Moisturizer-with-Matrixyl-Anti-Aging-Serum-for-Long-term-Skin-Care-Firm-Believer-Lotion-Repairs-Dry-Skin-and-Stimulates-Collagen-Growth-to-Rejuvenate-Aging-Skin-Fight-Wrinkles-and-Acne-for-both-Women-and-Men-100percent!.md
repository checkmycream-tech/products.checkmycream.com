<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a new product for me that I really love.  I tried a special that they had several months ago and really liked it so I decided to buy another face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see a difference after using 2x a day for 4 weeks. Will go back to using Roc products. The cream does smell wonderful though.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with my order</li>
    <li> Cannot use this product. Burned my face. Must return!</li>
    <li> I purchased all 4 products in this line and after using this and my acne medication I had a horrible reaction on my face.  I then received a phone call from the company trying to persuade me to leave positive reviews even after I explained my reaction.  I was very upset and left a horrible review. I then received a call from the owner of the company and she was very upset about my experience. She has worked and has since worked with me to find the problem and other options on products that will work for me.&lt;br /&gt; I have found out that my reaction was to a formulation change in my acne medication.  I am so impressed that there is company that cares so much about customers and is willing to go above and beyond what they have to. I have been using the product now for 2 weeks and have started to see results.  Ingredients are higher quality and natural and the products work well together, great skin care line and I am impressed. I have used many higher end skin care items before and these have far exceeded at a lower price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 and understand that only a facelift will get rid of wrinkles completely. I tried this looking for a good moisturizer to improve my skin condition. I&#x27;m happy to report that after 4 weeks of using this product my skin does in fact look better! My skin feels softer and the wrinkles around my eyes aren&#x27;t so noticeable. I&#x27;m pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This is a really smooth product and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve only been for a few weeks but, I like the feel as my skin tingles and I&#x27;m noticing less sagging. I like to use just a little bit at a time as it goes a long way and then follow-up the application with a moisturizer. My skin feels softer already and my wrinkles are slowly fading.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better facial creams I have purchased over the past few years.  After using it twice a day, I do have smoother firmer skin.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I decided to give Firm believer a try even though I&#x27;ve always been let down by all the other skin creams I&#x27;ve tried and boy am I glad I did! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and my skin is already vastly improved. Not only is it smooth and soft but I&#x27;ve also seen a remarkable improvement in my acne! In the short time I&#x27;ve been using it my skin already appears at least 5 years younger!&lt;br /&gt;Of course all of that is great but the best part is that Firm Believer is almost entirely natural ingredients. These ingredients like Shea butter and witch hazel really make all the difference. Why put artificial chemicals on your face when you can be using proven natural things?&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more of this wonderful cream! Firm believer was worth every penny and I recommend to anybody who wants to face a skin makeover or head off skin damage before it occurs!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I see much of a difference in my skin.  It has a great peppermint scent which is refreshing.  Didn&#x27;t see anything outstanding happening to my face.  This it is really good a repelling mosquitos outside because of the peppermint.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have only been using it for about a week, but I believe it is making a difference in the smoothness of my skin. It also seems to be helping control the acne other products have brought on. I will continue using it, and hope my skin keeps improving.</li>
    <li> I had been using &amp;#34;Meaningful Beauty &amp;#34;by Cindy Crawford for the last year , but wasn&#x27;t really happy with the products.I decided to try the Best Daily Face Moisturizer. Right the way I&#x27;ve noticed a change - it smoothed out the wrinkles and my face was simply glowing . I&#x27;ve been using that cream for over a month and planning to reorder!</li>
    <li> One year ago my skin was so much damaged that everyone refuse to find a answer and I started disliking myself. No one likes me but a twist  came in my life and that was firm believer and now I have a pleasant personality. My skin recovered and its look really awesome. A lot of thanks to this product for changing my life.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily for well over a month and see no change.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t irritate, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it helps smooth wrinkles with just a few days of use. I can&#x27;t wait to see after a month.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this cream.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Perfect for everyday, under makeup, before bed, ANYTIME!!!  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This product delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> My co workers noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I have a habit of changing skin creams every time I use one up.  Always searching for something better.  I found it!  I love Firm Believer face moisturizer by Resilient Beauty.  It goes on very smooth, a little goes a long way and makeup can be applied immediately after.  Of course, the best test is looking in the rearview mirror on a sunny day.  If that doesn&#x27;t reveal any flaws, you know you have found a winner.</li>
    <li> I love this anti aging cream. It doesn&#x27;t irritate me as other creams are and it has shown results with just a few days of use. It has repaired my skin which is really unbelievable. Thanks to firm believer and I strongly support this product.</li>
