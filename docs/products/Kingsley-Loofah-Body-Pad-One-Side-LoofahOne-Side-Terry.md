      <li>It&#x27;s good for  what I paid for it -it</li>
      <li>They work great, and make your skin feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>Great loofah to use instead of the ones on a stick or just a free hand loofah</li>
      <li>Good loofah, but more ridged than others I have used.</li>
      <li>The strap was nice though.</li>
      <li>This feels really nice on your legs, arms, everywhere, to gently&lt;br /&gt;take</li>
      <li>Also having more material for the body pad would have been nice since then it would be easier to use.</li>
      <li>My skin is silky smooth and I am loving the combination of these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That, coupled with its size, make it just an okay product.</li>
      <li>We love these.</li>
      <li>It is more flexible and not as abrasive but does an even better job and my skin is even smoother and softer than before I washed the loofah.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
      <li>I thought everything that you read on the internets is true, arrgghh!</li>
      <li>And this loofah rinses out easily and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The loofah part is just fine, though.</li>
      <li>Cheap stuff.</li>
      <li>Now will try to use the to clean lawn furniture in the Spring as I cannot think of anything else to use them for.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a full 1 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Half the reason I ordered this was to have a good grip, so that exfoliating would be easy.</li>
      <li>It is the only pad that is easy to use and makes me feel very, very clean.</li>
      <li>The scrubbing pad was useful, but the band and hook loop tore off after 1 month of use.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought it was going to be a bit thinker/more sturdy than it actually is.</li>
      <li>The item arrived super fast!  </li>
      <li>Molds to all the right places.</li>
      <li>Arrived super fast as claimed.</li>
      <li>and I love the hand strap on the back which makes it much easier to hold and use.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to exfoliate regularly.</li>
      <li>However it&#x27;s not as large as claimed:</li>
      <li>Much needed for a bath or shower.</li>
      <li>I was very</li>
      <li>After using this product for a week I had to get rid of it since it did not work very well.</li>
      <li>They are reasonably priced, durable, convenient handle, and get the job done.</li>
      <li>The size is just right, for overall use.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without my loofah.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is all natural and very durable should last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just washed this loofah in the washing machine on delicate cycle in a lingerie bag to protect it and now my loofah is even better.</li>
      <li>The pad was also too small to comfortably fit in my hand.</li>
      <li>Like the soft terry on the back as well.</li>
      <li>Unlike the traditional round variety, this item has a small convenient strap that allows greater versatility.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Half the reason I ordered this was to have a good grip, so that exfoliating would be easy. The elastic band does very little to help the thing stay in your hand. The loofah part is just fine, though. It&#x27;s a little too big for me, which makes it impractical to handle. And I have big hands for a lady.</li>
    <li> very hard not flexible not exfoliating</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my loofah. These are well-made and hold up for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice. As advertised.</li>
    <li> Much needed for a bath or shower. Great loofah to use instead of the ones on a stick or just a free hand loofah</li>
    <li> I have been buying these at Target and now they just disappeared. It is the only pad that is easy to use and makes me feel very, very clean.</li>
    <li> Molds to all the right places. Exfoliates well.</li>
    <li> perfect for shower and has a handle</li>
    <li> Not like the loofah pads I&#x27;ve owned before.  When wet, the &#x27;pad&#x27; became a full-blown loofah on one side, a 1/2 loofah on the other, and a sink in the middle.  In other words, it was not the flexible, flat pad I&#x27;ve been accustomed to.  I was very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE THIS OFF MY &amp;quot;BUY IT AGAIN&#x27; LIST.  I WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Update: I just washed this loofah in the washing machine on delicate cycle in a lingerie bag to protect it and now my loofah is even better. It is more flexible and not as abrasive but does an even better job and my skin is even smoother and softer than before I washed the loofah. I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair this loofah with Olay Age Defying Body Wash and the results are amazing!  My skin has never looked or felt better. My skin is silky smooth and I am loving the combination of these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This loofah is the perfect size and I love the hand strap on the back which makes it much easier to hold and use. Like the soft terry on the back as well. And this loofah rinses out easily and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is all natural and very durable should last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it in the beginning take it slow and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure until you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Very stiff and hard to mold around the body. Maybe it will soften?</li>
    <li> The item arrived super fast!  I honestly thought it was going to be a bit thinker/more sturdy than it actually is.</li>
    <li> The scrubbing pad was useful, but the band and hook loop tore off after 1 month of use. Cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found these pads, online. They work great, and make your skin feel so smooth. The size is just right, for overall use.</li>
    <li> These are great. They are reasonably priced, durable, convenient handle, and get the job done. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> This sponge is perfect.  It is not as big and cumbersome as a glove.  Unlike the traditional round variety, this item has a small convenient strap that allows greater versatility.  I have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> Good loofah, but more ridged than others I have used. That, coupled with its size, make it just an okay product.</li>
    <li> Used it once and the strap came off.  Poor manufacturing quality.</li>
    <li> We love these. Keep them in the shower so it&#x27;s easy to exfoliate regularly.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a loofah. It&#x27;s good for  what I paid for it -it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of loofahs for a while now and they&#x27;re getting harder to find so i bought this ones but they&#x27;re so hard even after several days soaking in water to soft it them they still very hard and rough, will not recommend.</li>
    <li> About what you&#x27;d expect for a loofah pad. No complaints, but no raves either.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and texture for the shower!</li>
    <li> Hard, scratchy, and larger than my hand.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week I had to get rid of it since it did not work very well. First off the loofah part was too rigid which made applying soap difficult. The pad was also too small to comfortably fit in my hand. Also having more material for the body pad would have been nice since then it would be easier to use. This lack of material combined with the rigid loofah make this product unusable. The strap was nice though.</li>
    <li> Finally, a loofa pad that does not turn into a brick once it gets wet!  This feels really nice on your legs, arms, everywhere, to gently&lt;br /&gt;take off dead skin.  I have used these pads for years, but some of them swell up into a rock hard thing that is hard to use.  Not this&lt;br /&gt;one.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Lumps up with rough knots. Hard as a rock loofah. Tried to use twice and even soaked it in a bowl of water but still awful. Bought a bunch to put out for guests. Now will try to use the to clean lawn furniture in the Spring as I cannot think of anything else to use them for.</li>
    <li> Works well. I like the strap to hold it on my hand</li>
    <li> Being old this helps me get the dead skin off my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using loofahs for years!</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast as claimed. However it&#x27;s not as large as claimed: It&#x27;s a full 1 1/2&amp;#34; shorter and 1/2&amp;#34; narrower that claimed. My wife says she&#x27;ll use it, but I bought it for me! I thought everything that you read on the internets is true, arrgghh!</li>
    <li> The body pad is as described.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Like the body pad. A little hard for me to uses. I wish it was just a little softer.</li>
