      <li>It is a very useful production for family use.</li>
      <li>It covers easily, doesn&#x27;t sting and heals quickly.  </li>
      <li>I dont bite my nails and since the redness has amazingly now gone away, they look kinda pretty for the first time ever.</li>
      <li>By the time they are done, the owie is forgotten and they are ready to have more adventures.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have noticed the redness from infection went away fairly quickly as well.</li>
      <li>I like it very much!  </li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s discontinued by Burt&#x27;s Bees, I will be buying several more tins to keep on hand!  </li>
      <li>This little tin has so many uses, I love it!.</li>

      <li>This is a great little product to help heal cuts, burns, and bites.  </li>
      <li>Since I do not have a green thumb, and have had no luck growing comfrey, this is great to carry in your purse or pocket for insect bites, abrasions, or burns.</li>
      <li>This is one of the most natural ointments you can purchase.  </li>
      <li>We use it on everything from fresh tattoos to diaper rash to insect bites and it always soothes and aids in healing.</li>
      <li>I ordered it never having tried it before, but I love all the things natural</li>
      <li>This stuff fixes it right up.  </li>
      <li>I gave some to a friend that was having an itching allergy and it relieved the itching and rash right away.</li>
      <li>plus i checked it on EWG and on a scale of 0-10 ( 10 containing the most hazardous products 0 being the least)</li>
      <li>My daughter very much, then I will come and continue to buy it for her,</li>
      <li>I accidently grabbed a hot pan one day and burned three of my fingers.</li>
      <li>I actually purchased many to give to friends.  </li>
      <li>I shall buy more later!.</li>
      <li>Might be good for small cuts or bruises.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that after using Dermatend, my moles scabbed over and fell off much faster after using the Res-Q.  </li>
      <li>Oh, I am grateful thanks</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for my wife as she had a skin infection which was very troublesome.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>my kids very like it thank you&lt;br</li>
      <li>I work at a bakery and missed the edge of the door to the walk-in oven and pretty much slid the back of my hand across the hot (400 degree hot) oven door.</li>
      <li>My wife had had chapped lips for months and tried many other products.</li>
      <li>they come in from outside with an Owie, we clean it up and put some &amp;quot;Guy Medicine&amp;quot; on it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure the cut healed any faster than if I&#x27;d put a topical neosporin/bacitracin ointment on it, but it was reasaurring to know the Burt&#x27;s Bees ointment was more natural and probably more gentle.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely highly recommended for stubborn skin irritations.</li>
      <li>Such a handy little tool...</li>
      <li>I use it for everything; mosquito bites, I live in savannah and we have chiggers and those things</li>
      <li>Completely!</li>
      <li>We will be buying more, as she has used it for other things such as insect bites, etc.  </li>
      <li>Completely meeting with my requirements!</li>
      <li>Even the residual discoloration and bumps that had been evident during earlier \\&quot;reprieves\\&quot; is vanishing.</li>
      <li>was down to my last part of the tin, so I came to order more of it and decided to give a review while I&#x27;m here.</li>
      <li>I feel comfortable letting the little ones apply this medicine by themselves.  </li>
      <li>Received within 2days pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive lips and have allergic reactions often on my lips.  </li>
      <li>Generally like the Burt&#x27;s Bee line, but not this product.</li>
      <li>but i spent much on shipping.</li>
      <li>Now 3 weeks later, the area is nearly back to normal.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY thing I have found that helps calm them down.  </li>
      <li>long burn right below my index and middle fingers which stings like hell and has a tendancy to slough skin whenever it gets wet or something rubs against it exposing the underlayer.</li>
      <li>It is a very small size and not enough to really rub on a large area to see if it relieves aches and pains.</li>
      <li>The container might seem small, but you don&#x27;t need very much and one may last you up to a year depending on usage.</li>

<li> Not only did I feel instant relief, but a few days later, the minor burns still hurt and were scabbing while the blistered burn was almost completely healed and I never had any pain.</li>
<li> Works for minor irritations (rashes, bug bites) without busting out the big stuff (steroids), which I try not to use often.</li>
<li> I had a tiny annoying bite or something on my lower leg, leaving it a very reddy, purplish colour, After applying the miracle salve, the redness went away by that afternoon and now its pretty much gone.</li>
<li> I had a scaly, itchy, dry patch on my shin for several months.</li>
<li> Five or six days later when it came time for my surgery, the cut was fully closed and healing well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have never found a product that worked so well on burns. I accidently grabbed a hot pan one day and burned three of my fingers. Two were barely red so I didn&#x27;t worry about them. The other blistered instantly so I put the Res-q-ointment on it. Not only did I feel instant relief, but a few days later, the minor burns still hurt and were scabbing while the blistered burn was almost completely healed and I never had any pain.</li>
    <li> This ointment can be used on any wound or skin problem you may have. I have tried 20 things that this company makes and this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> its&#x27;good  but i spent much on shipping. make it expensive. i wont recommend it to any.but it&#x27;s really good thing.</li>
    <li> This little tin has so many uses, I love it!. I have always been a cuticle biter, my left thumb being the worst victim, and sometimes they get pretty sore...Ive been rubbing res-q on them couple of times a day and before before bed... I dont bite my nails and since the redness has amazingly now gone away, they look kinda pretty for the first time ever. Ive had no urge to bite my cuticles anymore as the skin around my nails has gone smooth, and even my nails seem nourished.&lt;br /&gt;Also I had a tiny annoying bite or something on my lower leg, leaving it a very reddy, purplish colour, After applying the miracle salve, the redness went away by that afternoon and now its pretty much gone. Such a handy little tool...i,ll take it every where.&lt;br /&gt;Im travelling soon and the beauty is, I dont have to worry about liquids on the airplane!!! :) plus i checked it on EWG and on a scale of 0-10 ( 10 containing the most hazardous products 0 being the least) its scored \\&quot;1\\&quot; (low hazard ) ...its truly wonderful xxx</li>
    <li> I put this stuff on EVERYTHING. Burns, bites, cuts, bruises even sometimes pimples. Honestly, i always have one of these at home. The container might seem small, but you don&#x27;t need very much and one may last you up to a year depending on usage.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product to help heal cuts, burns, and bites.  We always keep a tin on hand.  It will stop a bite from itching and really seems to speed up the healing process on any small wound.</li>
    <li> Despite Burts selling out to Chlorox, we love this product. We use it on everything from fresh tattoos to diaper rash to insect bites and it always soothes and aids in healing. A little goes a LONG way, so this tiny tub will last a long time!</li>
    <li> We call this &amp;quot;Guy Medicine&amp;quot; and keep it around for our Grandsons to use.  &lt;br /&gt;When they come in from outside with an Owie, we clean it up and put some &amp;quot;Guy Medicine&amp;quot; on it. It covers easily, doesn&#x27;t sting and heals quickly.  I feel comfortable letting the little ones apply this medicine by themselves.  By the time they are done, the owie is forgotten and they are ready to have more adventures.&lt;br /&gt;I was down to my last part of the tin, so I came to order more of it and decided to give a review while I&#x27;m here.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife as she had a skin infection which was very troublesome.  Res-Q helped immediately.  It gave her relief of some of the symptoms which made the situation more tolerable.  It didn&#x27;t totally cure the problem but helped with symptoms.  We will be buying more, as she has used it for other things such as insect bites, etc.  Good, good product !!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing ointment.  It heals burns, scratches, and cuts quickly with a wonderful scent.  I actually purchased many to give to friends.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Not only does this heal minor cuts and other abrasions, it seems to reduce some of the scarring, at least, it did for me. I had a cut on my elbow that was sealed over, and this did wonders to reduce the discoloration and scar to a minimum. Plus, it smells wonderful and feels great. Works as a cuticle cream or fix for a hangnail as well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I had bad cold and my nose was red and hurt some much. But I put on the burt bees and my nose felt soooo much better.</li>
    <li> I like it very much!  it is a very good, very good parts, very good delivery, meet all of mine expectation.</li>
    <li> I almost forgot I had got this until I got a nasty burn on my right hand at work. I work at a bakery and missed the edge of the door to the walk-in oven and pretty much slid the back of my hand across the hot (400 degree hot) oven door. Now I have a inch + long burn right below my index and middle fingers which stings like hell and has a tendancy to slough skin whenever it gets wet or something rubs against it exposing the underlayer. It stings whenever air, water, clothing, etc. is on it. I put the ointment on and instant relief. It forms a barrier between the outside world and my burn. I have noticed the redness from infection went away fairly quickly as well. I&#x27;ve put it on several times a day, when it gets worn off, and have noticed the burn seems to be healing faster. It also keeps it from itching so bad. Plus it smells great so you get aromatherapy as well. I would definitely reccommend this for any scratch or burn you might get. Its thinner than antibiotic ointment and doesn&#x27;t get as goopy as that does when applied. Comes off clealy and no oily residue on my fingers, always a plus.</li>
    <li> I like it,it fit as expected,it looks beautful.its price is good.but i wish it more cheap better,that is all.i think.</li>
    <li> Works for minor irritations (rashes, bug bites) without busting out the big stuff (steroids), which I try not to use often. I got this weird rash on my palms from eating contaminated fish once, and the ointment helped alleviate the itching until the rash disappeared. I would have been very unhappy without it.</li>
    <li> I still wonder what makes this ointment work so darn good!! I use it for everything; mosquito bites, I live in savannah and we have chiggers and those things are annoying and bite you all up but this works great for that and i use it to keep them away it works too, i also use it for razor bumps or burns, pimples, cuts, you can even use it for dry skin too. This product works wonders, its only con is that it does have an awkward smell to it but hey it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for this, so hard to find in stores. Great for bruises helps with healing and pain. Received within 2days pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I like comfrey for dry, scaly skin. I used this ointment after I had some moles removed to help the skin heal and minimize scarring.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I had bad cold and my nose was red and hurt some much. But I put on the burt bees and my nose felt soooo much better.</li>
    <li> I had a scaly, itchy, dry patch on my shin for several months. I tried everything over the counter (from anti-fungals to antihistamines), went to the doctor and even tried a steroid pack. Nothing worked. One day while out of town, I found that the only thing I had to out on it was a tin of Res-Q ointment. Now 3 weeks later, the area is nearly back to normal. Even the residual discoloration and bumps that had been evident during earlier \\&quot;reprieves\\&quot; is vanishing. Absolutely highly recommended for stubborn skin irritations.</li>
    <li> good product ... my kids very like it thank you&lt;br /&gt;i will  think very nice your product. yoo y ......good</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous! You know those annoying little cracks you get at the ends of your nails in the winter when you have your hands in dishwater?  This stuff fixes it right up.  Smear a bit on the crack, cover it with a band-aid, go to bed ---- next day you feel all better!  Bought my first tin from a wonderful lady in Eureka Springs Arkansas a long time ago - she&#x27;s since gone out of business, I&#x27;m still buying it.  Works on burns, eyelids (I get nasty eyelid infections during allergy season), hands, feet - you name it - this stuff works!!</li>
    <li> This product is a very good one! It is very suitable for baby. Completely meeting with my requirements! I shall buy more later!.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive lips and have allergic reactions often on my lips.  This is the ONLY thing I have found that helps calm them down.  It is soothing and cool and works great on burns or cuts as well.</li>
    <li> It is a very useful production for family use.The shipping speed is very quickly and the item is wondful.Good deal.</li>
    <li> Helps with small cuts, dry patches, promotes healing. Always have several. One in purse, one in vanity, one in travel bag.</li>
    <li> Since I do not have a green thumb, and have had no luck growing comfrey, this is great to carry in your purse or pocket for insect bites, abrasions, or burns. I gave some to a friend that was having an itching allergy and it relieved the itching and rash right away.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product six stars I would! I ordered it never having tried it before, but I love all the things natural so I figured I could use it somehow. It just came yesterday and today I got a nasty painful burn on my fingers, I immediately put the ointment on my fingers and within minutes the pain was completely gone! Completely! I&#x27;m so impressed!</li>
    <li> I bought a tin of Res-Q ointment to accompany my Dermatend purchase.  I&#x27;ve been using it to speed up the healing process after I&#x27;ve removed moles from my skin.  It&#x27;s also supposed to reduce scarring.  I&#x27;ve noticed that after using Dermatend, my moles scabbed over and fell off much faster after using the Res-Q.  Since it&#x27;s discontinued by Burt&#x27;s Bees, I will be buying several more tins to keep on hand!  It really is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> both of my daughters get huge welts from mosquito bites. this product reduces the size of the bites AND stops the itching. i have little jars of it everywhere.</li>
    <li> It is a soothing ointment for bug bites or the itch that just won&#x27;t go away. I use it all the time without any side effects.</li>
    <li> She has a lot of bug bites and such that bother the heck out of her, She scratches them and makes them worse. Burt&#x27;s makes them better and nothing else has ever done the job. Nothing. Not in the 37 years we have been together.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most natural ointments you can purchase.  If you don&#x27;t like many harmful chemicals placed and going in on your skin I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I had some irritation over my eye and was worried about using a cream as it may drip into my eye and cause even worse irritations.  This product cleared it up after two or three applications.  I still use it to smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely itch and bump reliever ointment.  My son and I have been getting bitten up by bugs this summer and this thing helps us from going nuts and ripping our hair our from the itching and constant scratching.  I have to have this on hand for when we travel, or really its perfect for a diaper bag.  I highly recommend this for the summer months when creepy crawlies start making their way into your skin.</li>
    <li> I got a nasty cut on my arm one week prior to knee surgery, and I was worried about the risk of infection. I remembered the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Res-Q ointment I&#x27;d purchased recently, and began applying it several times a day to the cut and applying a Band-Aid.  Five or six days later when it came time for my surgery, the cut was fully closed and healing well.  I&#x27;m not sure the cut healed any faster than if I&#x27;d put a topical neosporin/bacitracin ointment on it, but it was reasaurring to know the Burt&#x27;s Bees ointment was more natural and probably more gentle.  My only complaint (and thus the 4 star rating) is the ointment tends to leave a green residue on clothing, so I find I have to wear a Band-Aid if I use it in a location (such as upper arm or knee) that will have clothing brushing up against it.</li>
    <li> Ointment has a strong menthol scent.  Just couldn&#x27;t get past the scent to use the product.  Generally like the Burt&#x27;s Bee line, but not this product.</li>
    <li> My wife had had chapped lips for months and tried many other products. Her lips have finally healed. It is also great on scratches or skin abrasions.</li>
    <li> I take this traveling with me in case I get any cuts or scrapes. It has come in very hand a few times, and heals my hand. There is no the burning sensation of alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, so you know its gentler on the body.</li>
    <li> I noticed  that this product already improved the appearance of the burns I had in less then 10 mins. amazing product, will buy again</li>
    <li> Doubt Burt will get the Nobel Prize for this ointment, contrary to the many testimonials. It is a very small size and not enough to really rub on a large area to see if it relieves aches and pains. Might be good for small cuts or bruises.</li>
    <li> My daughter very much, then I will come and continue to buy it for her, Oh, I am grateful thanks</li>
