      <li>we&#x27;re incredibly</li>
      <li>I am so so so happy I found this product.</li>
      <li>Smells great but way over priced</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a great value!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use it with their Cilantro Conditioner and it&#x27;s a great combination.</li>
      <li>I still wanted to get on here and give it a rating as it is a great product and saved me from scratching the scalp off my skull.</li>
      <li>I took it home (to Toronto) where my best friend is a stylist at a high end salon and even she says it is the best shampoo and conditioner she has ever used.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.  </li>
      <li>I had heard good things about it</li>
      <li>Good smell too.</li>
      <li>guess I am a guy who likes to be well kept and likes good quality product</li>

      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>It has an amazing tingly feel on my scalp and</li>
      <li>Really nice scent, just wish they made a dandruff version.  </li>
      <li>I stayed at a really nice 5 star hotel in LA with work and this product along with Cilantro Conditioner were in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Smells ok but a Suave Mint shampoo smells just as good and is cheaper</li>
      <li>I have more good hair days since I began using this, the cilantro conditioner and Dirt styling product.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s why the smell is so strong and lasts longer!</li>
      <li>My hair also stays cleaner and looks better even post work out</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>thank you Malin + Goetz for saving my hair, my scalp and my nail polish :)</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner most of the time.</li>
      <li>The smell of this shampoo is incomparable!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
      <li>Well, it is true that your teeth feel amazing after you brush them, but that minty-fresh feeling is nothing compared to the way your scalp will feel when you use this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Love how natural it is and how amazing my hair feels when using both shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>Very mild.  </li>
      <li>Does your hair get oily easily</li>
      <li>Nice and tingly and the whole bathroom smelled like mint.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel extremely clean and light weight.</li>
      <li>I am so happy, and will keep using these products as long as they make them.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair so clean feeling but not stripped.</li>
      <li>and I was sold, it&#x27;s a clear gel/liquid, which is nice to see there aren&#x27;t tons of dyes, and carries a light peppermint scent.</li>
      <li>I love warm showers, but having Malin Goetz Peppermint Shampoo takes the whole experience to a new level.  </li>
      <li>What really got me is the foaming action, my scalp was tingling in the best way and my hair was super soft and clean afterward, stayed that way too.</li>
      <li>Overall nice light mint smelling shampoo.</li>
      <li>Those with dandruff have a mild, though not necessarily unpleasant scent, and I did not.</li>
      <li>since I started using this shampoo the itchiness went away from first use, this was a miracle!</li>
      <li>Smells great, a little dab will do you - and I received the product the day after I ordered it.</li>
      <li>Great feeling on your scalp when you leave it on for a few minutes</li>
      <li>A fun product to use.  </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s now November) and I am SO THRILLED with my experience that I sought out a public forum just to rave about it.</li>
      <li>had just purchased over $300 worth of product.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
      <li>The peppermint scent was different from what I was expecting, I was expecting a sweet smelling peppermint like candy, but this is more strong, real peppermint.</li>
      <li>Just like the conditioner i first used these in a hotel in Califronia, i can&#x27;t say enough how much i love all of the products by this company!</li>
      <li>Smell is slightly minty and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to use it on hair only, nothing else.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is simply one of my favorite things in the universe.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo leaves my hair clean, soft and shining.</li>
      <li>wife is super sensitive to smells and ingredients in products but also has used them and has no problem.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
      <li>&amp; he wanted the large size when he ran out.....</li>
      <li>When I went most recently for a haircut, I met a new stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good shampoo, and there&#x27;s one for everyone, this just isn&#x27;t mine.</li>
      <li>when I buy a shampoo I need a great quality, not a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
      <li>This power was too much for me to wield.</li>
      <li>It really</li>
      <li>I figured it can&#x27;t be that strong, so it won&#x27;t stay in my hair for that long.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough to clear my sinuses, which is gross to some, but actually pretty cool in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>One of the things I appreciated about it was it literally takes a dime size to clean product out of long hair.  </li>
      <li>M + G) is my new addiction!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>like I just came out of a high quality barbers.</li>
      <li>While staying at an upscale hotel in New York, they gave us Malin &amp; Goetz products to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 29 and live in Seattle.</li>
      <li>Using the product the smell is nice but not strong enough for my liking.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>I only wash my hair every few days, but I started hiding the products that the maid was leaving just so that I could have more.</li>
      <li>The product lathers extremely well and a nickel size amount is enough to clean my short bob.</li>
      <li>I used the Peppermint Shampoo and Conditioner, and I have never had such SOFT, voluminous hair.</li>
      <li>I am a male Caucasian in my early 30&#x27;s with average straight hair.</li>

<li> I am a male Caucasian in my early 30&#x27;s with average straight hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve long gone to a barbershop called Rudy&#x27;s, but never mentioned the flakes.</li>
<li> I find it drying on my long hair</li>
<li> Event though the bottle is on the smaller side, you only need a little to get a lather.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a well-groomed guy and the flakes have always made me excruciatingly self-conscious.</li>

<li> The shampoo is thick and comes out clear.  </li>
<li> 20 bucks seems steep for shampoo but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> /&gt;Generally I wash my hair twice to three times a week, have color treated hair, and an extremely itchy scalp.</li>
<li> It contains ingredients that will sensitize other skin areas.</li>
<li> So itchy that one night I found my boyfriend holding my hand down in my sleep because he was awoken by me scrapping away at my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve either used Selsun Blue or really became painfully self-conscious when I saw the flakes forming on my shoulder or when I may have scratched my scalp for whatever reason.</li>
<li> I paired with the (Malin  + Goetz) Cilantro Conditioner and my hair is crazy soft, I keep a low cut</li>
<li> Oddly, the shampoo was cheaper at the barbershop than anywhere else online.</li>
<li> I think my hair is less...</li>
<li> I have long thick hair and exercise regularly, this always left me in a bad predicament since you are left with a sweaty head and by all means you don&#x27;t want to deal with washing your hair every time you work out if your like</li>
<li> Some people have been saying it&#x27;s too expensive, but you get what you pay for - and this is in line with other professional products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American male in my mid 20&#x27;s, not really a big shampoo tester but Ive used several products over the years from Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo, to the Herbal Essence ones in drug stores, medicated brands, and recently I&#x27;d been alternating between Doo-Gro and Mizani, both of which I got at the local beauty/hair supply. One use of this and I was sold, it&#x27;s a clear gel/liquid, which is nice to see there aren&#x27;t tons of dyes, and carries a light peppermint scent. What really got me is the foaming action, my scalp was tingling in the best way and my hair was super soft and clean afterward, stayed that way too. I paired with the (Malin  + Goetz) Cilantro Conditioner and my hair is crazy soft, I keep a low cut but I can definitely tell the difference. I think (M + G) is my new addiction!</li>
    <li> So So. Overall nice light mint smelling shampoo. Event though the bottle is on the smaller side, you only need a little to get a lather. Two reasons why I gave this product 3 stars. I am a male Caucasian in my early 30&#x27;s with average straight hair. Using the product the smell is nice but not strong enough for my liking. I used to use the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo and that was perfect. Nice and tingly and the whole bathroom smelled like mint. I&#x27;d say the scent is at a 1/4 strength of the tea tree shampoo. Also my biggest gripe... It dries my hair out. It&#x27;s hard to find a good shampoo, and there&#x27;s one for everyone, this just isn&#x27;t mine.</li>
    <li> The smell of this shampoo is incomparable! Great! It really is!&lt;br /&gt;But when I buy a shampoo I need a great quality, not a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;First quality, then the smell.&lt;br /&gt;And, for the quality, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, scent and right amount of lather. I use it with their Cilantro Conditioner and it&#x27;s a great combination.</li>
    <li> Like the product packaging and subtle minty/tingly shampoo. I think my hair is less...I have more good hair days since I began using this, the cilantro conditioner and Dirt styling product. Not sure what happened with the dandruff guy but I definitely have not seen any dandruff or anything but improved hair quality.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is simply one of my favorite things in the universe.  It has an amazing tingly feel on my scalp and the peppermint smell is just delicious.  I love warm showers, but having Malin Goetz Peppermint Shampoo takes the whole experience to a new level.  You know how toothpaste marketers talk about a minty-fresh feeling?  Well, it is true that your teeth feel amazing after you brush them, but that minty-fresh feeling is nothing compared to the way your scalp will feel when you use this shampoo.  I think I need to stop writing to go take a completely unnecessary shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had dandruff before but this product gave me flakes like you would not believe.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and they we&#x27;re incredibly rude.&lt;br /&gt;I had just purchased over $300 worth of product.&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I&#x27;ll stick with Kiehl&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Smells ok but a Suave Mint shampoo smells just as good and is cheaper</li>
    <li> I stayed at a really nice 5 star hotel in LA with work and this product along with Cilantro Conditioner were in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am a guy who likes to be well kept and likes good quality product but every so often you come across one which just feels different and nice.&lt;br /&gt;These products feel great, smell great and have a really nice refreshing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is super sensitive to smells and ingredients in products but also has used them and has no problem.&lt;br /&gt;More over she always comments when I sue the product that it smells like I just came out of a high quality barbers.</li>
    <li> Again, Ace hotel in Portland OR introduced me to this product line. Leaves my hair so clean feeling but not stripped. Love how natural it is and how amazing my hair feels when using both shampoo and conditioner! Recommend for short hair styled with products daily.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever.  Very mild.  Found it in a hotel in NY, then started buying it.</li>
    <li> Hubby had a travel size version that was in a hotel we stayed in &amp; he wanted the large size when he ran out.....I find it drying on my long hair so I don&#x27;t use it but for his short hair he loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this. 20 bucks seems steep for shampoo but a little goes a long way. The product lathers extremely well and a nickel size amount is enough to clean my short bob. The shampoo is thick and comes out clear.  Smell is slightly minty and pleasant. One bottle lasted me several months when used daily. It cleans well and non drying so I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner most of the time.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I had heard good things about it and it delivers where it&#x27;s supposed to.  One of the things I appreciated about it was it literally takes a dime size to clean product out of long hair.  It lathers nicely and smells good.  My big issue with this product is price.  Give it a try if you use Crew.  You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I iove this product! It has a nice pepperminty smell &amp; peppermint is also good for your scalp. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> While staying at an upscale hotel in New York, they gave us Malin &amp; Goetz products to use. I used the Peppermint Shampoo and Conditioner, and I have never had such SOFT, voluminous hair. I only wash my hair every few days, but I started hiding the products that the maid was leaving just so that I could have more. I took it home (to Toronto) where my best friend is a stylist at a high end salon and even she says it is the best shampoo and conditioner she has ever used. This all happened in May (it&#x27;s now November) and I am SO THRILLED with my experience that I sought out a public forum just to rave about it. I am so happy, and will keep using these products as long as they make them. Some people have been saying it&#x27;s too expensive, but you get what you pay for - and this is in line with other professional products. I am so so so happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, a little dab will do you - and I received the product the day after I ordered it. Amazing.</li>
    <li> the best shampoo i ever used.  hair is shiny and manageable&lt;br /&gt;All daughters and sons now want this shampoo all the time</li>
    <li> Unpleasant scent and I felt it did not clean my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the freshest, cleanest shampoo I&#x27;ve come across. Your scalp feels refreshed after using it AND your just smell fresh....not scented. Love it. Have already bought a second bottle.</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves my hair clean, soft and shining. The peppermint smells wonderful and is invigorates my scalp. Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo! Good smell too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 and live in Seattle. I was never told \\&quot;you have dandruff,\\&quot; I just knew I had flakes. I&#x27;ve either used Selsun Blue or really became painfully self-conscious when I saw the flakes forming on my shoulder or when I may have scratched my scalp for whatever reason. I&#x27;ve long gone to a barbershop called Rudy&#x27;s, but never mentioned the flakes. When I went most recently for a haircut, I met a new stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She and I got to talking and for some reason, I mentioned the flakes. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You don&#x27;t have dandruff. Does your hair get oily easily too?\\&quot; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said nothing, just looked surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I--well, I--uh-huh?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She explained those with oily hair just have poor chemical balance on their scalp. And not everyone with flakes has dandruff--some just have a poor chemical balance. Those with dandruff have a mild, though not necessarily unpleasant scent, and I did not. I never buy anything at a barbershop/stylist/whatever you&#x27;d call it. But she had jumped from flakes to oily without missing a beat. I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m not going to stop now. I&#x27;m a well-groomed guy and the flakes have always made me excruciatingly self-conscious. Oddly, the shampoo was cheaper at the barbershop than anywhere else online. I&#x27;ve not experimented with the cilantro conditioner, but it&#x27;s next on my list.</li>
    <li> Just like the conditioner i first used these in a hotel in Califronia, i can&#x27;t say enough how much i love all of the products by this company!</li>
    <li> Smells great but way over priced</li>
    <li> Although I did not purchase this shampoo from Amazon I still wanted to get on here and give it a rating as it is a great product and saved me from scratching the scalp off my skull. I have long thick hair and exercise regularly, this always left me in a bad predicament since you are left with a sweaty head and by all means you don&#x27;t want to deal with washing your hair every time you work out if your like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I wash my hair twice to three times a week, have color treated hair, and an extremely itchy scalp. So itchy that one night I found my boyfriend holding my hand down in my sleep because he was awoken by me scrapping away at my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using this shampoo the itchiness went away from first use, this was a miracle! My hair also stays cleaner and looks better even post work out and I no longer feel gross skipping washing my hair immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes its pricey, but it smells great, lathers on great &amp; certainly changed my life for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thank you Malin + Goetz for saving my hair, my scalp and my nail polish :)</li>
    <li> A fun product to use.  Just be sure to use it on hair only, nothing else.  It contains ingredients that will sensitize other skin areas.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Malin + Goetz peppermint shampoo knowing that my husband hated the scent of peppermint. I figured it can&#x27;t be that strong, so it won&#x27;t stay in my hair for that long. I was wrong! I absolutely love this shampoo. It is strong enough to clear my sinuses, which is gross to some, but actually pretty cool in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it smell while you&#x27;re applying it, but it continues to smell for hours after. I&#x27;m not upset that my husband doesn&#x27;t like it, because it&#x27;s my hair. It makes my hair feel extremely clean and light weight. It helps add shine to my dull hair and I use maybe a quarter-sized amount each day (I have thin shoulder length hair) and the bottle lasts around 6 months. That&#x27;s a great value!&lt;br /&gt;I may have to check out another scent for my next order. The peppermint scent was different from what I was expecting, I was expecting a sweet smelling peppermint like candy, but this is more strong, real peppermint. If that makes sense. I think that&#x27;s why the smell is so strong and lasts longer!</li>
    <li> Really nice scent, just wish they made a dandruff version.  Great feeling on your scalp when you leave it on for a few minutes</li>
    <li> This leaves behind a subtle peppermint scent. Soon after purchasing this shampoo I found out that if you use it in combination with the Axe Chocolate Body Spray you smell like a dessert item. I went to the gym smelling like this a few times and found myself to be irresistible to those with low impulse control. This power was too much for me to wield.</li>
