<li> It&#x27;s a little big probably, but it&#x27;s thin, so it slides in and out very easily.  </li>
<li> Not too small and not overly large either.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s larger than I expected</li>
<li> Bought this a long time ago.  </li>
<li> I have other make-up bags that will stand up with things are in them (as the bottom opens up and is flat), but this one does not do that.  </li>
<li> This item had the most awful odor.  </li>
<li> Hard to shop for a teenager, but this was truly a hit.</li>
<li> I like the pattern on the bag, hard to misplace, but no frills.</li>

    <li> Works perfect for my makeup!! No problems at all. It&#x27;s small enough to fit my purse and big enough to hold all my makeup</li>

    <li> This is a good bag...I use it for keeping personal female items in my work bag.  It&#x27;s a little big probably, but it&#x27;s thin, so it slides in and out very easily.  I have other make-up bags that will stand up with things are in them (as the bottom opens up and is flat), but this one does not do that.  So if you are looking for a make-up bag that will be easy to things in and out of on a counter, this is not your bag.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy zipper bag. I keep all my bills that need to be mailed out or payed in this bag. It matched the purse I bought from Amazon as well</li>
    <li> Great match for her zebra back pack</li>
