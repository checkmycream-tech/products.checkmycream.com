      <li>I bought it for my nine year old daughter</li>
      <li>the fragrance has grown on me, but I did give the perfume to my 8 year old daughter to wear.  </li>
      <li>Well, after using it the first time, it became a regular part of my daily routine.</li>
      <li>So I first bought this at big lots last christmas.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the cute bottle like Katy perry&#x27;s line does</li>
      <li>all in all I actually bought four bottles so far.</li>
      <li>The friend who I gave this to as a Christmas present totally ditched her old perfume and started using this one instead!</li>

<li> Love the scent, smells very expensive &amp; last long....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to pin down what it smells like, because I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s powdery or flowery, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot;.</li>

    <li> I LOVE this perfume. It was a gift for my friend, and it smells absolutely AMAZING!!!! I can&#x27;t really remember what the origional smells like, but I am thinking  about maybe buying one for myself :) And the it lasts for hours and the scent doesn&#x27;t fade away for a long time- In a good way! Good for gifts and it smells amazing--- and shipping was so fast! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND!</li>

    <li> Smells good, at a good price! However the scent doesn&#x27;t last long..have to keep respraying......boo! Still a good deal if you just want to try it!</li>
    <li> My first experience with this perfume was when I purchased it from a Big Lots in my town. I was just looking for something to wear occasionally when I went somewhere nice, and I&#x27;d heard great things about Katy Perry&#x27;s \\&quot;Purr\\&quot;. So, I saw it and thought, \\&quot;What the heck? It&#x27;s only $5. If I hate it, no real loss.\\&quot; Well, after using it the first time, it became a regular part of my daily routine. It has a really great smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering or too \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;, which is a huge plus for me. It&#x27;s hard to pin down what it smells like, because I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s powdery or flowery, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;old lady perfume\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a very subtle, modern scent, and I really like it. So does my husband, so that&#x27;s always a good thing. ;) I think if you&#x27;ve used or just smelled \\&quot;Purr\\&quot;, liked it, and would like to get a good quality alternative without spending $30+, this is a great choice.</li>

If you&#x27;re looking for a nice fruity spicy sweet musk this one is it!! and it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap which is a concern with perfumes that are cheap in price. It smells like an expensive perfume it&#x27;s just alot easier on your pocketbook. It does have a very similar smell to it&#x27;s original inspired version however it smell even better than Katy Perry Purr it&#x27;s a really a lovely little scent.</li>
    <li> for being a knock off and the low price, this is awesome.  im wearing it now! I doubt it stays as strong as the original would but at the end of the day I can still smell it on my clothes.</li>

    <li> I thought this would not even smell like it, to my surprise it does! My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in the cute bottle like Katy perry&#x27;s line does but whateve, I saved 1/2 off what I usually pay and no one can tell the difference.</li>
    <li> very good product, excellent fragrance</li>
    <li> My daughter luved so did I it&#x27;s nice light sweet flowery and not too strong would definetly reorder.Valerie luved it 3rd grader.</li>
    <li> Thank you for having this product! I knew I couldn&#x27;t afford to splurge on Katy Perry&#x27;s perfume, and my sister had been eyeing Meow for a while, so I feel very lucky that I stumbled across this gem! She ended up loving the smell, although I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the perfume/how it fades etc.</li>
    <li> Dirty water in a used bottle</li>
    <li> I have never smelled the original Katy Perry perfume so I cannot compare it to the original. But, I can say that this Kitty Girl perfume smells wonderful! My husband loved it too!</li>
    <li> The smell didn&#x27;t smell like Katy Perry&#x27;s Purr whatsoever, it took me right back to 8th grade.  I rated it with a 4 because to be quite honest the fragrance has grown on me, but I did give the perfume to my 8 year old daughter to wear.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, unless it was for her.</li>

    <li> U guys were awsome .I&#x27;m very happy for the results .I got it unopened so id give u a job well done .look forward to ordering from u again soon .thanks</li>
