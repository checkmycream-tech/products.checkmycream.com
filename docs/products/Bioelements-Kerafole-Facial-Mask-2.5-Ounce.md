<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. Makes your face feel so clean.</li>
    <li> I really like using this product, it seems when my skin is congested or looking dull, I use this three nights in a row as suggested in the product packaging and notice my skin is visibly smoother, more even and brighter in complexion.  I also like the tingly feeling as it makes me believe its working.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliation that I use once a week. It has made my skin very nice and smooth. It&#x27;s simple to use - use the scoop that is included in the box to apply to your face. Leave it on for up to 10 minutes (I started off with 2 minutes the first week, 3 the next, etc. until&lt;br /&gt;I hit 10 minutes) and wash off. It comes off easily and only tingles my skin for the first minute. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or red. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local salon ($$$$) and will buy here in the future. Used it daily for a week, typically just leaving it on till I needed to remove it to sleep, leave the house, etc., then contined to use it once or twice a week in the evening after washing away the day.  About a month into this routine and skin is noticeably smoother, have no breakouts, and overall tone is clarifying and firming.  I purchased it as a &amp;#34;decongestant&amp;#34; for my oily, blackhead prone skin, and I am very pleased with the results.  I also throw in a weekly clay mask to pull any crap this has loosened out of my pores.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME.  Smells great, feels great, and really works.  Worth every single penny.  It comes with a mini spoon so you don&#x27;t contaminate your precious mask.  When you dip in, it feels like you&#x27;re spooning out butter!  It doesn&#x27;t dry on your face and make your skin tight like some clay mask do, but leaves it fresh and soft feeling.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love bioelements and the kerafole smells so good my customers really like it.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for hard cauliflower like bumps on my face! Need to use 3 nights in a row</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the BEST product I&#x27;ve used on my face. I noticed an improvement in the look of my skin the first time I used it. My skin continues to improve with each use. I especially like that I can do the 10 minute treatment anytime because it isn&#x27;t one of those ugly white masks, it&#x27;s clear! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I think it clarifies he skin when used on a regular basis but it&#x27;s expensive so if that&#x27;s a concern try a plain old mud mask.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been amazing for my oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. Used in combination with the decongestant cleanser it has really helped in clearing up my skin and getting the oil under control. It feels all tingly after I first put it on but then goes away as I massage it around my face. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive areas like some masks do.</li>
    <li> All I can say is ... ***WOW!***&lt;br /&gt;This mask is amazing.  Makes my skin look amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Geesh!  Honestly, never in my life, have I ever seen a mask do what this mask does. We&#x27;re talking clean pores and clear skin in a MAJOR way.  After using this for almost a month, I&#x27;m about ready to trash some of my other masks.  (Yes, I would dump my expensive Borghese Fango Mud (check the price) for Kerafole. That&#x27;s how GOOD it is.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff *IS* amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Deserves TEN stars.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Love this product and how it makes my skin look and feel</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - I&#x27;ve found the best price for it here.</li>
    <li> I still have the full bottle. I don&#x27;t feel like it makes a difference on my skin. It definitely did not unclog my pores.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Bioelements products. It is a great product to keep your skin healthy and clear. I love this brand of skin products. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie, so when I find a winner, I&#x27;m excited! I get facials at a spa that uses Bioelements and I believe these are world class products. The professional grade products are awesome. After doing the 7 day purge with Kerafole, I really noticed a difference - smoother, brighter, clearer skin. Worth every penny.I will definitely keep this in my skin care rotation!</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> Did nothing to decongest pores. Worthless.. Gave it away to a friend who said the same after using it and threw it away.</li>
    <li> I originally balked at the idea of spending so much money on a mask, but one use and I was sold.  I&#x27;ve now used it three times in the past month, and my skin feels better than it ever has.  My skin is smooth, my pores are smaller (which is a HUGE deal for me), and I the impurities in my skin have decreased significantly.  It does make your skin feel tight after use, but just slap on some moisturizer, and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I read a review about Bioelements&#x27; mask recently and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did.  First of all it smells great, goes on easily and only takes a small amount to cover your whole face.  I put it on before my shower and before I&#x27;m ready to get out I simple wash it off. My face feels fresh, smooth and clean!</li>
    <li> I can feel this eating the dead skin off my face :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product. My skin feels so clean and looks really clear after use. I have very sensitive skin but have had no bad reactions to this product.</li>
    <li> I was having some issues with millia and a few cystic type bumps. Decided to purchase and try the 7 day purge. After the second night the bumps were noticeably flatter. By the end of the week it had dried up the bumps without drying the rest of my face. Millia almost gone. Skin is smooth and tone improved. I was so impressed I then purchased the facial cleanser and moisturizer. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. My hair salon uses this brand for their facials. Buying it there is about twice the price of Amazon. I have normal skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent facial cleanser that removes flaking skin.  You can feel it at work.  I will buy it again.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> Great mask! Makes my skin baby smooth and haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues with it. I haven&#x27;t had a break out either! Hope this keeps up! Amazon has the best prices!</li>
    <li> this product leaves my skin incredibly soft. i&#x27;m a big fan. i plan on getting this again and again and again...</li>
    <li> Awesome product that I use weekly to &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34;. I have very sensitive skin to products and react instantly by breaking out. This has not done that and I&#x27;ve used it weekly for a year.  At first you will notice that your skin will look worse, but that is because all of the purging is occurring. I recommend the purge first and then occasional use. Love Bioelements!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised.  I use it almost daily and the dead skin just washes away after use.  Just make sure to moisturize well after use.  I have oily skin with some sun spots and this seems to be working very well.  I&#x27;ll stick to this instead of my $125 a session micro-dermabrasion treatments at my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Love this mask - it is soothing &amp; clarifying and my face feels and looks great after using it.  I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and my skin loves it.  Will purchase again.  Another great BioElements product!</li>
