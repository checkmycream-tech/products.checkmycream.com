<ol>
    <li> Very satisfied with this oil.  I use it in my soap and cold cream bars.</li>
    <li> This oil works great on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and use this in the winter months as a moisturizer. Not the best smelling, but helps with clear skin. I take the tablets, too.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with this product- easily absorbed added to my body lotion and use directly on skin as well.</li>
    <li> I am using this as an infusion oil for lotion bars.  It works nicely for that!</li>
    <li> I love adding this to my body butters it adds just the right amount of moisturizer to them, without causing any irritating side effects that comes with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good for dry skin on face</li>
    <li> Evening Primrose is excellent quality.  I purchased as a supplement for my pups.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with hemp seed oil, safflower oil, and castor oil when doing the oil cleansing method. I have sensitive, combination, and acne prone skin. My main problems being blackheads and whiteheads. The hemp seed oil, safflower oil, and evening primrose oil are high in linoleic acid which helps soften sebum in the pores and help unclog them. Evening primrose oil is also hydrating and helps promote cell regeneration. The antioxidants it contains helps reduce inflammation as well. Adding the evening primrose oil to my regimen has greatly helped in reducing the whiteheads and blackheads and has helped my face stay hydrated even after cleansing. My skin has been much smoother and it actually has a glow to it that wasn&#x27;t there before. My combination skin as evened out as well with my dry patches gone and the oily spots getting under control. Since this oil can go rancid pretty easily and quickly, I poured some of it into an amber glass dropper bottle, and the rest I put in the freezer which helps prolong the life of the oil. I do this with the hemp seed oil and safflower oil as well. Evening primrose oil has now become a permanent asset to my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> love it! thank you for the quick ship.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologist to paint on finger and toe nails.  I use a small paint brush.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister for Christmas. She loves it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Great oil. It is working out so nice with my essential oils</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Sort of like &#x27;eau de wet dog&#x27; (and I have a dog, so my tolerance for wet dog smell is usually pretty high). I do notice that when I use it at night it helps clear up some of my acne, but the smell is just so bad it&#x27;s hard to bring myself to use it. I keep the bottle refrigerated to tame the smell  until my own skin heats it up. I keep looking around online to figure out if this is just how evening primrose oil smells or if I&#x27;ve got a rancid batch and I haven&#x27;t figured it out.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in good condition. No leakage. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great on my sons eczema ( don&#x27;t think the smell is as bad as other reviewers ). I use it with chamomile oil and almond oil for his skin and it is much better than steroid cream. I also use it on my skin at night,very moisturizing ( anti-aging benefits which I love .) would buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved using this as a carrier oil! It felt perfect on my skin, and it was a great quality as well.</li>
    <li> So nice to not have to break open the capsules.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and is as it was described. Helped with skin dryness, but not other conditions. Had to see dermatologist for other conditions so was not the products fault.</li>
