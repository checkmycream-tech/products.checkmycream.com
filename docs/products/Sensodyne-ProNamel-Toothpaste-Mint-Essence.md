    <li> Great for sensitive teeth. Fresh taste not overpowering</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  Keeps my teeth clean and bacteria free, and the taste is just fine.  I never have a problem with sensitivity with this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Items work out good as described</li>
    <li> Favorite Brand of Toothpaste that does not hurt my teeth and tastes great. Not sold in retail stores either.</li>

    <li> This works as my dentist said it would.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended and now cannot live without it.  Cannot find locally and order it online.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate the inside of my mouth. The taste is nice, nothing crazy minty, but a nice fresh mint. These 6.5oz tubes are ideal, because I feel like I go through the smaller ones too quickly.</li>
    <li> These were the bigger tubes as advertised. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my dentist and much cheaper through Amazon than the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste because I was getting cavities in the cracks of my fillings. Its expensive everywhere else. After doing the comparison elsewhere online, this 3 pack of 6.5 oz tubes is the least expensive at $1.25/oz. It can get upward of over $2/oz. Really? It&#x27;s still toothpaste! It does taste different than regular fluoride too, I can&#x27;t quite explain it, maybe that&#x27;s what healthy teeth taste like.</li>
    <li> I have only used Pronamel for many years!  I drink a fair amount of pop and eat fruits etc., so I trust in Pronamel!</li>
    <li> Sensodyne Pronamel Mint Essence - 6.5 oz. - 3...;  item comes  as described;  expensive, but still cheep to buy in bulk this way then from the store</li>
    <li> After checking with my dentist who praised the product, I bought it. It works as advertised. I now enjoy corn nuts.</li>
    <li> have used a long time/love/love</li>
    <li> Great price and service</li>
