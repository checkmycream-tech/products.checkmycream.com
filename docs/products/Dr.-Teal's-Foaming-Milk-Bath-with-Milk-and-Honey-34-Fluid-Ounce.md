      <li>I LOVE, LOVE,</li>
      <li>Its just okay.</li>
      <li>and I definately will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping it would work like a powdered milk bath that Burt&#x27;s Bees used to make that I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement for.  </li>
      <li>after using this in the bath my skin feels so smooth!</li>
      <li>Its an okay product.</li>
      <li>Plenty of bubbles, smells lovely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of these, and this one and the \\&quot;calm\\&quot; scents are my favorites.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite dr.teals because of how mostirizing it is.</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>and I am happy to say that the Dr. Teal&#x27;s has a very mild vanilla type scent, very calming and relaxing.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant, and it really does help make your skin feel smoother and softer.</li>
      <li>However, other than that this product is awesome.</li>
      <li>Like sweet cream, yum!</li>
      <li>The scent is very mild which appeals to me.  </li>
      <li>This smells so good and my skin is very soft with it.</li>
      <li>so I buy this once a year to take to our beach house which has a huge jacuzzi tub.  </li>
      <li>It feels great on the skin, especially after a day in the sun and salt water.  </li>
      <li>smells great, bought different scents and like them all.</li>
      <li>Fortunately the electronic product was wrapped in plastic and still works.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and nice smell.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell wonder, her skin feels great.</li>
      <li>Smells great and is very relaxing and soft.</li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim at my local Wal-Mart and I&#x27;m happy to say that it was worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as that was, but it does the trick better than other things I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>it was the full 34 oz size.</li>
      <li>The smell of this one is so sweet and mellow</li>
      <li>One reviewer said it takes a lot and only good for 8 baths, I don&#x27;t get that person at all.  </li>
      <li>The best, cannot find this particular Milk Bath in any of the other stores that carry Dr. Teal.</li>
      <li>Best of all and most important are its moisturizing effects on my skin which is no longer dry and rough.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to those who love baths.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for a long soak in the tub.</li>
      <li>, it makes it look so pretty!</li>
      <li>The bottle is actually about twice the size that I had expected, so was very happy.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to strong scents on stuff like this</li>
      <li>It smells so good, fresh and clean, and the foam is fluffy and plentiful!</li>
      <li>Smells so clean, leaves skin soft but feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Its far superior to Lander or any other brand and contains real milk proteins, so its more than just scented soap.  </li>
      <li>was very pleased that it made LOADS of long lasting bubbles and has a lovely scent and economicall too</li>
      <li>I take full advantage of it by having a nice bath at the end of an active day.  </li>
      <li>I have used numerous scents from Dr. Teal&#x27;s and found each to be enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>The most bubbles any bath product gives and, of the ones I&#x27;ve tried (Lavender, Camomille), this one is especially yummy in smell and texture.</li>
      <li>I use just one capful in my walk-in Jacuzzi tub and the foam it produces is luxuriously beneficial to the whole relaxation process!  </li>
      <li>The only drawback was some of it leaked out in the box because the top unscrewed.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth...</li>
      <li>Makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This was really a treat to get!</li>
      <li>As the title suggests, Dr. Teal&#x27;s is also a great value and is very long lasting with the 34oz size.</li>
      <li>While there are better and more expensive brands out there, I really find Dr. Teal&#x27;s gives you the most bang for the buck.  </li>
      <li>It takes a lot to make a really sudsy bath, but it does work.</li>
      <li>or so I use a gentle body wash but their day to day baths are soaking in this milk bath.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying this every summer, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This one in particular is very soothing.</li>

    <li> We don&#x27;t have a tub at home so I buy this once a year to take to our beach house which has a huge jacuzzi tub.  I take full advantage of it by having a nice bath at the end of an active day.  That&#x27;s where this great milk bath comes in.  I absolutely LOVE it!  I am very sensitive to strong scents on stuff like this and I am happy to say that the Dr. Teal&#x27;s has a very mild vanilla type scent, very calming and relaxing.  It feels great on the skin, especially after a day in the sun and salt water.  It doesn&#x27;t overpower any other scent you might want to use later, just gives your skin a silky smooth feeling and a clean scent.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this every summer, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a relaxing silky bubble bath. I love the smell and the feel of the water it creates. I read a reviewer say it doesn&#x27;t create bubbles. That is not true. I get plenty of bubbles as it is a foaming milk bath like the description says. Also I have very sensitive skin and this does not break me out or cause a reaction. I highly recommend this to those who love baths.</li>
    <li> One reviewer said it takes a lot and only good for 8 baths, I don&#x27;t get that person at all.  I share this with my daughter and we take separate baths (obviously) and we are passed 8 baths and still have almost half the container left.  I don&#x27;t see how I could use anymore because the bubbles would overflow the bath tub lol.  I would rather have just a plain milk  bath but my kid loves this product.</li>
    <li> I gift Dr. Teal&#x27;s bath products regularly and all my female friends absolutely LOVE this product (so do I)!</li>
    <li> Its an okay product. I like the milky feel that it adds to the water. However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. Its just okay.</li>
    <li> So soothing and the smell is great! The only drawback was some of it leaked out in the box because the top unscrewed.</li>
    <li> I use just one capful in my walk-in Jacuzzi tub and the foam it produces is luxuriously beneficial to the whole relaxation process!  The scent is very mild which appeals to me.  Best of all and most important are its moisturizing effects on my skin which is no longer dry and rough.  &amp;#34;Bubble baths&amp;#34; are fun and remind me of being a kid as an added benefit even though I might not care to admit that to the boys down at the neighborhood bar.</li>
    <li> This smells good and I buy it at Walmart all the time. It&#x27;s good for a long soak in the tub.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FOAMING BATH</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how hard it is to find bubble bath for adult. This product smells great and bubbles. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> I love this bubble bath. It smells great and produces tons of bubbles. The bottle lasts for about 15 baths or so. Depending on how much you put in each time, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would work like a powdered milk bath that Burt&#x27;s Bees used to make that I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement for.  It&#x27;s not as good as that was, but it does the trick better than other things I&#x27;ve tried.  The scent is pleasant, and it really does help make your skin feel smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> Plenty of bubbles, smells lovely.</li>
    <li> This bottle is HUGE and is listed at an absolutely amazing price. It smells heavenly, and I&#x27;m able to take super long, 90-minute baths without being dry skinned or uncomfortable. And best of all, the bubble foam lasts for most of that time!</li>
    <li> Another great product from Dr. Teals.  Makes my skin nice and soft has bubbles which I like and a great smell.  Try it you will love it</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Only gave 3 stars because the bottle was cracked and some of the contents leaked out.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this, but I can assure you that, you WILL NOT regret ordering this product!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!  OUTSTANDING VALUE!</li>
    <li> This smells so good and my skin is very soft with it. LOVE it!!! I like that you don&#x27;t need a lot for a good bubble bath too.</li>
    <li> The best, cannot find this particular Milk Bath in any of the other stores that carry Dr. Teal.</li>
    <li> Just though I&#x27;d let others know that you can get this exact same product for waaaay cheaper at Wally World. I paid only $4.87 for the whole bottle.  And YES! it was the full 34 oz size. What as value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it being a bubble bath, I didn&#x27;t make enough bubbles for me, and the bubbles it did make didn&#x27;t last very long (less than five minutes).  But I&#x27;ve been using mine as a shower gel.  It lathers very nicely using my shower pouf.  And it smells soooo good!  Like sweet cream, yum! And at 34 oz, it&#x27;ll last forever!</li>
    <li> We live in a dry climate so regular bubble bath dries their skin out to much. The Milk and Honey foams up well and also hydrates their skin. Once a week or so I use a gentle body wash but their day to day baths are soaking in this milk bath.</li>
    <li> Thinking this came of the land of Milk and Honey, I thought all my life&#x27;s problems would be solved by leaping into a tub of this foam.  Sadly, while I was soothed during the time of the bath, upon drying off I noticed the pile of unpaid bills, my dead dog still in the sink, my trailer home still missing 2 wheels, and my wife still having only 4 teeth.  Would have sent it back but my brother distilled it into something that tasted like milky vodka and we used it in the bong.</li>
    <li> While there are better and more expensive brands out there, I really find Dr. Teal&#x27;s gives you the most bang for the buck.  I have used numerous scents from Dr. Teal&#x27;s and found each to be enjoyable.  Dr. Teal&#x27;s will not fill your bathtub with bubbles, but you will have plenty of suds.  I actually prefer the lower level of bubbles in this bath.  Furthermore, the fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering at all.  As the title suggests, Dr. Teal&#x27;s is also a great value and is very long lasting with the 34oz size.</li>
    <li> I like this, it can make many bubble and has a nice smell. I think it&#x27;s good for making me relaxed.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is very relaxing and soft. Produces a good amount of bubbles. This is my favorite dr.teals because of how mostirizing it is.</li>
    <li> This smells great, feels great, but just doesn&#x27;t make enough bubbles unless you use a ton of it.</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin soft and smooth...for this price, can&#x27;t beat it!!  Anyone who hasn&#x27;t try this, you are missing out!</li>
    <li> Wonderful but way too pricey</li>
    <li> i didnt feel like this did anything for my skin and its my least favorite of all the foaming baths.</li>
    <li> Watery and not very foamy.</li>
    <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming milk bath is a miracle. In two baths it helped itchy patches of skin that no amount of moisturizer could help.</li>
    <li> this milk bath makes wonderful bubbles and leaves my skin moisturized, which I really need in the winter.</li>
    <li> This was really a treat to get! The bottle is actually about twice the size that I had expected, so was very happy. The milk bath smells terrific ~ foams great too!</li>
    <li> I had tried other Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath products, but I had only seen the Milk and Honey in bath salts form, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased that it made LOADS of long lasting bubbles and has a lovely scent and economicall too--a little goes a long way!  Nothing like a long hot soak to relax away those sore muscles and it left my skin feeling smooth and soft without any residue on me or on the tub.  Its far superior to Lander or any other brand and contains real milk proteins, so its more than just scented soap.  The label says it shouldn&#x27;t be used by persons who are lactose intolerant, which I am, however, I hadn&#x27;t planned on eating it!!  So I tried it anyway and I didn&#x27;t experience any ill effects whatsoever. Overall, it was a very pleasing experience and I definately will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> All of the Dr. Teal products rock. This one in particular is very soothing. The bubbles last till the water is too cold to stay in the tub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of these, and this one and the \\&quot;calm\\&quot; scents are my favorites.  The smell of this one is so sweet and mellow I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m a little more fond of this one than all the others, including the \\&quot;calm\\&quot;.  I hate the bubbles, but for some reason Dr. Teal&#x27;s has stopped making the type that puts out fewer bubbles.  I hope they rethink that decision, but until then I&#x27;ll be using this one.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helped me relax after a long day and week. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to just lounge and relax.</li>
    <li> love love love! after using this in the bath my skin feels so smooth!</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s great and it provides lasting bubbles so I have no complaints. Good for helping you relax after a grueling gym session.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift, it a bigger bottle than i expected. i smelled it before i wrapped it up and the smell was mild yet pleasant.</li>
    <li> My favorite bubble bath, ever! Smells so clean, leaves skin soft but feeling clean. I will continue to buy more and more!</li>
    <li> I love the long lasting bubbles an the sweet yet subtle smell of it. When I am in the tub I feel so relaxed and when I get out I feel the difference in my skin</li>
    <li> This has bubbles everywhere.  The scent is heavenly and relaxing.  One thing I have noticed is that my very dry skin is not dried out and is soft too.</li>
    <li> The lid came partially unscrewed and the liquid spilled all over another product that was shipped together.  Fortunately the electronic product was wrapped in plastic and still works.  I don&#x27;t plan to return the bubble bath because it works and most of the liquid stayed in the bottle...  Just a bit annoyed with the packaging.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and nice smell. Lots of bubbles too!</li>
    <li> My favorite bath additive.  Makes skin soft and smooth. Delicate scent.</li>
    <li> I use this for my daughter that has eczema and it works wonders. Not only does it smell wonder, her skin feels great.</li>
    <li> It takes a lot to make a really sudsy bath, but it does work. Expect to get 8-10 baths out of it.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It smells so good, fresh and clean, and the foam is fluffy and plentiful!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim at my local Wal-Mart and I&#x27;m happy to say that it was worth it. It&#x27;s a pretty big bottle...around the size of a shampoo bottle I think but like some of the other reviews before me, I think you do indeed have to pour a generous amount to create a lot of bubbles, which means you probably would get 6-10 baths out of it. However, other than that this product is awesome. Smells like what I imagined honey &amp; milk mixed together would be. The bubbles last long, the smell and the bubbles make me relax, and it makes my skin soft. For $5.31 at Wal-Mart, you can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. throw some rose/other flower petals in your bath too, it makes it look so pretty! (:</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this product. Highly recommend for anyone out there looking for a small gift for a birthday or anniversary!</li>
    <li> smells great, bought different scents and like them all. like the price and the bubbles are abundant get some for yourself</li>
    <li> I LOVE bubble baths, after reading the great reviews I decided to try Dr. Teal&#x27;s. I absolutely adore the smell of this product, the oatmeal honey really stands out and it made my skin very very soft. I enjoyed everything about this product except for the fact that there were little to no bubbles! I will still continue to purchase this for the wonders that it has done for my skin, however I will continue my search for a product with more bubbles!</li>
    <li> Smells good &amp; foams nicely.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my daughter for the baby&#x27;s bath at Grammy&#x27;s house. Perfect. Smells wonderful, good on baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The most bubbles any bath product gives and, of the ones I&#x27;ve tried (Lavender, Camomille), this one is especially yummy in smell and texture.</li>
    <li> It great for the bath. My son gets rashes and putting him in the tub with this stuff helps him heal faster.</li>
