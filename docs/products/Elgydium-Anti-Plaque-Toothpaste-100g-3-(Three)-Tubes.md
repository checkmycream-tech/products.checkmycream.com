      <li>Good experience.</li>

      <li>Tastes delicious and clean....</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>If it is good I will be giving it the 5 stars and recommending it to others:)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help to prevent Dental Plaque and tarter build up but smells great, tastes great, and  lathers very well and  because of that I will continue using it.</li>
      <li>The taste is great and very fresh.  </li>
      <li>Tastes very minty and has a great tube of metal of some kind.</li>
      <li>For years, my favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>most of Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s products don&#x27;t have fluoride in it.  </li>
      <li>Love it but the price</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>this is one of my most coveted beauty products - and that&#x27;s saying a lot for someone who has worked in the beauty industry for almost 2 decades.</li>
      <li>,then I belive this one is good product, you mouth feel very clean and fresh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got great mouth feel, and I&#x27;ve loved the other tooth products from this company before.  </li>
      <li>I wish folks would give this a try, so we&#x27;d achieve a steady, economical supply for this superior tasting and performing toothpaste!</li>
      <li>&quot; kind of this brand, but this regular kind does a much better job and tastes so much better.</li>
      <li>We used Sensodine before, the best toothpaste we could find in the states, but this toothpaste leaves your moth feeling much cleaner, tastes better, and has left both of us without swollen gums or any teeth problems.</li>
      <li>Nice tasting and the company shipped it extremely fast!</li>
      <li>Tastes great, low foam.</li>
      <li>I use this along with the brightner brand ...alternating them and the combination is really working nicely.</li>
      <li>Love the intense minty flavor and my mouth feels fresh and clean after brushing!  </li>
      <li>Plus, the expiration dates on the tubes are good for over a year, so I definitely recommend this seller!</li>
      <li>Friendly to all dentures and bridges; the anti-plaque formula works extremely well and tastes pleasant, no undue &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Hope you keep stocking it at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Used for two weeks and evident improvements on the teeth and mouth have been felt.</li>
      <li>Got the items on time and the related follow up were also ok.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is the best toothpaste, but it is so hard to find here in the states!!!</li>
      <li>if buying for a child I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certainly going to use this product,</li>
      <li>It really cleans your teeth</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years and really like it.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s really making me question my fluoride addiction, asking myself if it&#x27;s really necessary on healthy, well brushed, 40-something teeth....</li>
      <li>After using just a little bit when brushing your teeth, your mouth feels so clean and really minty fresh.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone who has the issues with toothpaste that i do.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel clean all day long.</li>
      <li>I like it because it has no harsh ingredients!</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m surprised to find it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride in it.  </li>
      <li>Aging seems to bring sensitive mouth issues for some of us - if you have a sensitive mouth, there&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;ve found to compare.</li>
      <li>The delivery was much quicker than expected and the price for 3 tubes can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>

    <li> This is the best toothpaste, but it is so hard to find here in the states!!! Sites carry the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; kind of this brand, but this regular kind does a much better job and tastes so much better. I was a little worried that these 3 tubes were shipping from the UK, but I got them in about a week after ordering!  Plus, the expiration dates on the tubes are good for over a year, so I definitely recommend this seller! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste, ever!</li>
    <li> Love it but the price this is toothpaste guys not Guy Savoie restaurant !!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! The taste of it afterwards isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up a lot., which is great. This may seem gross but before I used Elgydium, I&#x27;d only brush my teeth when i&#x27;d think about it (which was when i could feel &amp;#34;tooth sweaters&amp;#34; on my teeth). I just couldn&#x27;t find a toothpaste that DIDN&#x27;T have that overpowering mint flavor. I guess I have a low tolerance for &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; mint. My wife read an article recommending this toothpaste as being a product the writer wouldn&#x27;t be without. Voila! now i brush everyday, 2-3 times a day. Tastes great, low foam. Happy as can be. I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone who has the issues with toothpaste that i do. And i would also suggest buying it through NWhealthcare, as i had a great experience with this purchase. Happy brushing!</li>
    <li> Thank you I am very impressed with your service.The toothpaste arrived with my Aunt in Washington State,USA within 10 days of ordering.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was expected at the end of 1month.&lt;br /&gt;Have done this before,and will order again</li>
    <li> Very good after-brush taste and flavor. Used for two weeks and evident improvements on the teeth and mouth have been felt. Will continue use and feel the benefits.</li>
    <li> A wonderful lternative to the US brands filled with chemicals and sweeteners. Also, no cnaker or mouth sores in years of use.</li>
    <li> Nice finding a toothpaste &amp;#34;without&amp;#34; the whitening chemicals! Nice tasting and the company shipped it extremely fast! I will continue to do business with this company! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I want to use it for awhile to see how my next dental check up report is. If it is good I will be giving it the 5 stars and recommending it to others:)</li>
    <li> I go out of my way to find this stuff!  Love the intense minty flavor and my mouth feels fresh and clean after brushing!  Hope you keep stocking it at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> For years, my favorite toothpaste. Friendly to all dentures and bridges; the anti-plaque formula works extremely well and tastes pleasant, no undue &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;. No sugars, flourides, aspartames. Wish this were easier to buy in the US, but this is well-worth ordering and keeping on-hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got great mouth feel, and I&#x27;ve loved the other tooth products from this company before.  Although I&#x27;m surprised to find it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride in it.  I&#x27;m certainly going to use this product, most of Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s products don&#x27;t have fluoride in it.

I wish folks would give this a try, so we&#x27;d achieve a steady, economical supply for this superior tasting and performing toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy this version of Elgydium again because it actually contains parabens. I&#x27;ll stick with the anti-cavity version (green tube), which does not.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste.  Great seller.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Been using 2 weeks  and seems to be a good anti-plaque toothpaste</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good experience. Used to have some problem with the seller, this order was created to fix the previous error. Got the items on time and the related follow up were also ok.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t help to prevent Dental Plaque and tarter build up but smells great, tastes great, and  lathers very well and  because of that I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> this is one of my most coveted beauty products - and that&#x27;s saying a lot for someone who has worked in the beauty industry for almost 2 decades. If Toothpaste doesn&#x27;t seem like a &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; product to you then you need to try Elgydium. Your teeth will feel cleaner than they ever have in your life. I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but they are not lying when they named this the anti-plaque toothpaste. My teeth feel clean all day long. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!  Will definitely order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  A year or so ago I ran out of toothpaste in Portugal and bought some Elgydium at a pharmacy.  After using just a little bit when brushing your teeth, your mouth feels so clean and really minty fresh.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the brightner brand ...alternating them and the combination is really working nicely.</li>
    <li> I hate to say it, but I feel like a lot of the things in france just seem a little nicer.  We used Sensodine before, the best toothpaste we could find in the states, but this toothpaste leaves your moth feeling much cleaner, tastes better, and has left both of us without swollen gums or any teeth problems.</li>
    <li> Tastes delicious and clean....I have been using this for years and really like it. I like it because it has no harsh ingredients!</li>
    <li> Greatest toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Tastes very minty and has a great tube of metal of some kind. East to roll up</li>
    <li> very good toothpaste,before I orderd my firend told me this one is very good, so I just try ,then I belive this one is good product, you mouth feel very clean and fresh, I will buy again and big recommendate, thank you !</li>
    <li> The taste is great and very fresh.  It really cleans your teeth and I think it makes them look whiter.  The delivery was much quicker than expected and the price for 3 tubes can&#x27;t be beat.  I recommend this company to anyone and I will buy again from them.</li>
