      <li>But reapplying is just a joy for the senses!</li>
      <li>Very happy camper!</li>
      <li>Makes me feel great!</li>
      <li>Beautiful scent....</li>
      <li>Pikaki flower essence smells amazing!</li>
      <li>:o)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all good.</li>
      <li>I had to give this product 2 stars instead of 1 though, because I even though I don&#x27;t like the scent, it does seem be of good quality.</li>
      <li>This stuff is legendary for replicating the smell of fresh Pikake.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Will buy more scents from Kuumba Made!</li>
      <li>nice scent reminds me of pikake in hawaii</li>
      <li>this scent seems to be so perfectly balanced with everything a woman would want from a sensually soft, yet fragrant scent that stands out.  </li>
      <li>Very light and airy and it</li>
      <li>In the opening notes, this is definitely correct, but while Child has a dry-down that smells musty on me, this dry-down is just delicious.  </li>
      <li>I recommend Body Time as a much better smelling and better priced alternative: http://amzn.com/B00013MTA0</li>
      <li>I love, love love</li>
      <li>Wish there were more to choose from.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; scent and my favorite type of Jasmine.</li>
      <li>it is THE MOST unique scent i have ever smelled.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping!</li>
      <li>I enjoy kuumba made fragrances.</li>
      <li>But worth it since it is chemical free!</li>
      <li>this stuff smells clean &amp; inviting.</li>
      <li>This has a sweet scent.</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean, maybe a wee bit musky?  </li>
      <li>Pretty aroma but wears off too quickly.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is a soft and sweet treat!</li>
      <li>Beautiful scent - last all day long.  </li>
      <li>this is the most perfect soft, subtle, sensual, light, sweet, delicate, smooth, heavenly, divine, feminine scent.  </li>
      <li>fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly like the real thing</li>
      <li>evoke such strong memories.  </li>
      <li>The lasting power is decent, the sillage is moderate to good.</li>
      <li>For me it is a legendary disappointment.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last a long time, like most fragrances!</li>
      <li>The vivid memories of the Hawaiian Island that it brought back at the first sniff were unreal.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with Pikaki fragrance - from the beautifu garden isle of Kaua&#x27;i - handy roll on applicator - a bit smaller than some of the bottles for about the same price but still a nice way to have such a convenience.</li>
      <li>It is an odd smelling white musk with a nail polish remover note, nothing more.</li>
      <li>This will make you run through a bottle rather quickly, since they&#x27;re pretty small...</li>
      <li>Love the scent of this oil, but wish it would last a little longer, needs to be reapplied.</li>
      <li>This actually smells very much like White Shoulders.</li>
      <li>The container is small, but I still think the price is good, as it takes very little.</li>
      <li>last most of the day without having to reapply (at least for me it does).  </li>
      <li>and i find this truly divine, the complete opposite in fragrant scent compared to patchouli or myrhh.</li>

<li> and i normally wear very heavy muskly, earthy scents...</li>

    <li> Very light and airy and it last most of the day without having to reapply (at least for me it does).  The vivid memories of the Hawaiian Island that it brought back at the first sniff were unreal.  I have never expirenced having a perfume evoke such strong memories.  I am not good at desribing what something smells like but it has the scent of several different flowers that I smelled while on the islands.</li>
    <li> Pikaki flower essence smells amazing! Doesn&#x27;t last a long time, like most fragrances! But reapplying is just a joy for the senses!</li>
    <li> I have tried other Pikaki Lei fragrances but nothing comes close to the Kuumba Made. People always ask me what I am wearing, and stop to smell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as some of the others. I have to repeat it several times in the day.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite*♥</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a soft and sweet treat!</li>
    <li> Divine smell! Makes me feel great! Reminds me of Hawaii...</li>
    <li> Pretty aroma but wears off too quickly.</li>
    <li> I love, love love this stuff smells clean &amp; inviting.</li>
    <li> this is the most perfect soft, subtle, sensual, light, sweet, delicate, smooth, heavenly, divine, feminine scent.  it is THE MOST unique scent i have ever smelled. Every time i put some on i feel a sense of relaxation and oneness...not sure what its doing to my olfactory senses. this scent seems to be so perfectly balanced with everything a woman would want from a sensually soft, yet fragrant scent that stands out.  i can&#x27;t say enough about it you just have to smell it to understand...and i normally wear very heavy muskly, earthy scents...and i find this truly divine, the complete opposite in fragrant scent compared to patchouli or myrhh.</li>
    <li> Everyone is right, this is very similar to the expensive Child perfume oil.  It just doesn&#x27;t last as long and you have to reapply frequently.y</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this oil, but wish it would last a little longer, needs to be reapplied. But worth it since it is chemical free! Will be trying other kuumba made oils!</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent....fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This actually smells very much like White Shoulders. I&#x27;ve heard others say it smells like &amp;#34;Child,&amp;#34; which I have never smelled. It&#x27;s a white floral fragrance, a little green, a little sweet. The lasting power is decent, the sillage is moderate to good. I enjoy kuumba made fragrances. Wish there were more to choose from. The container is small, but I still think the price is good, as it takes very little. Body heat tends to amp up these oils.</li>
    <li> nice scent reminds me of pikake in hawaii</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent - last all day long.  Love it!  Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Pikaki fragrance - from the beautifu garden isle of Kaua&#x27;i - handy roll on applicator - a bit smaller than some of the bottles for about the same price but still a nice way to have such a convenience.</li>
    <li> This stuff is legendary for replicating the smell of fresh Pikake. For me it is a legendary disappointment. It is an odd smelling white musk with a nail polish remover note, nothing more.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed by the smell. It just doesn&#x27;t smell like all the other pikaki oil I&#x27;ve bought before. I think it is diluted with some other perfume. It is also a smaller unit than the last one I bought, which has lasted ages. I recommend Body Time as a much better smelling and better priced alternative: http://amzn.com/B00013MTA0</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had been told that it smells just like \\&quot;Child\\&quot;.  In the opening notes, this is definitely correct, but while Child has a dry-down that smells musty on me, this dry-down is just delicious.  Fresh and clean, maybe a wee bit musky?  Either way, I&#x27;m buying a second bottle.    My one complaint is with the longevity... it needs to be reapplied every couple of hours.  This will make you run through a bottle rather quickly, since they&#x27;re pretty small... but at this price, who cares?</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I was thinking it would have a Jasmine-type mixture of florals, but it smells heavily of Gardenia, which I really don&#x27;t care for at all. I had to give this product 2 stars instead of 1 though, because I even though I don&#x27;t like the scent, it does seem be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly like the real thing but it does! Very happy camper! Will buy more scents from Kuumba Made!</li>
    <li> I always get compliments whenever I wear this. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; scent and my favorite type of Jasmine. I find regular Jasmine too &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;. This has a sweet scent. I alternate between Pikake and Patchouli. Some days I&#x27;m a Hula dancer and some days I&#x27;m a Hippie. It&#x27;s all good. :o)</li>
