      <li>Do not purchase the Healthy Skin Rejuvenator or pay $50 for the refill puffs.  </li>

      <li>Hey you can buy the CVS brand refill pads for the Healthy skin rejuvenator by Neutrogena</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>The product is great (and reviewed by many on the main page for the product -- suggest checking it out).  </li>
      <li>It helps to keep my skin looking young and beautiful.</li>
      <li>This works nicely to give me a more gentle treatment in between the more vigorous treatment with the power scrubber, and makes this purchase a better value as well.</li>

      <li>I am very satisfied and I would definitely describe this as mild but very effective.</li>
      <li>This is a much better product than the original resurfacing cream.  </li>
      <li>The pads are easy to use, store and dispose of.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The pads for The Wave fit on the original \\&quot;Rejuvenator\\&quot; and cost around $6 for 30 pads - about 20 cents per pad...a much better deal.</li>
      <li>I know they aren&#x27;t available anymore, but that doesn&#x27;t make your tactics</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap there too.</li>
      <li>Another tip: after using the pad on my face, I use it to smooth my knees, feet, and ankles to prepare for self-tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a week and am happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>Results are smooth and naturally-looking.  </li>
      <li>My wife inially had difficulty finding replacement disks but Neutrogena followed through with additional information &amp; a 2 month supply of the diskd free.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soo smooth.</li>
      <li>After using them my skin feels so clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>The improvement was noticed after the first use, mostly an improvement in the tone,brightness, and smoothness of my skin.</li>
      <li>and I feel it&#x27;s getting into a more reasonable price range.  </li>
      <li>My skin really looks better than it has in years.</li>
      <li>Save you money they are new and in a white box , fit my old unit perfectly!!!</li>
      <li>I felt the smooth skin like baby face at the first try.</li>
      <li>I ordered and received refills of the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator Puffs through the new Amazon Subscribe and Save program.  </li>
      <li>in the first place!</li>
      <li>I was skeptical when I first bought the kit, but I&#x27;m very satisfied and happy</li>
      <li>Took longer to come in than expected but in great shape and they really help the skin</li>
      <li>and I see distinct improvement in the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
      <li>Overall I liked this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a really good price compared to store pricing, but I&#x27;m a little upset that I committed to the program at one price and as soon as my first order shipped, the price increased...</li>
      <li>I love how soft these make my face feel after treatment, but the price is a bit high.</li>
      <li>After the first order, the price jumped to $14.44.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to find them instore and Amazon is the only place I can find them.</li>
      <li>Keep it on low until you can adjust and be sure to rinse well afterwards.</li>
      <li>and I get the same or even better results of a microdermabrasion at a salon.</li>
      <li>It feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>My skin does seem softer and brighter and I am pleased enough to purchase refill pads.     </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference using this neutrogena product after the first use.  </li>
      <li>I liked the old way - with cream and sponge puff, but the cream dries if you don&#x27;t finish the whole bottle in a quite short period of time.</li>
      <li>It feels like a fresh, new layer of skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this product it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
      <li>yes 14.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s new item !!</li>
      <li>It is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my sensitive skin because of the prescription cream, and it does a great job of getting rid of the dry layer.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants smoother, softer skin and anyone looking to take care of some fine lines before they become big wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Suffice it to say, if Neutrogena wants to triple or quadruple its price for this product - depending on where you bought it - they must want to lose customers as well as phase out this product.     </li>
      <li>It really brightens up my face and improves the look of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like how my face feels after I use it.  </li>
      <li>and I really like this product.</li>
      <li>This product has really helped the appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel like it is ready to soak up whatever I apply after.  </li>
      <li>There is an alternative available in some stores which offers a soft sponge applicater that can be used with the applicator that comes with the kit</li>
      <li>I emailed Neutrogena regarding the refills wondering where I can buy the refills or is it true that they can only be purchased on line.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it to everyone with sensitive skin who wants the microdermabrasion feel without the irritation.</li>
      <li>I used a 20% off coupon to save a few dollars more</li>
      <li>Can do much better with plain cotton puffs.</li>
      <li>I am 44 years old but no one ever guesses that!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Neutrogena has relaunched this product because everyone has been asking about it. I love this product it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it make my skin look great it&#x27;s like someone said \\&quot;a mini facelift\\&quot;. I had this dark line across my nose and after a few days of using the puffs it was gone. Everyone please don&#x27;t be fooled and pay mark-up prices. You can find it in your local stores. Also check the product site it&#x27;s cheap there too.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER AS A GIFT WHEN SHE COULDN&#x27;T FIND THESE REFILLS&lt;br /&gt;ANYWHERE ~ SHE WILL BE 88 THIS MONTH &amp; HER SKIN IS STILL BEAUTIFUL &amp; SMOOTH!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL WHO&#x27;S THE FAIREST MOTHER OF ALL\\&quot; ......ONLY MY MOM!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT NEUTROGENA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JJ</li>
    <li> This gizmo feels great and invigorates my face. I&#x27;ve only used it a week and am happy with the results.  It has minimized pores and imperfections are less visible. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll keep using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! I can&#x27;t comment on its efficacy, but maybe it is the placebo effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found these rejuvenator puffs online, they are impossible to find in stores anymore. I use them 2 to 3 times a week (or at least try my best to - LOL) and they make an amazing difference in my skin. Even after the first use your skin will be incredibly smooth, and even though it sounds cheesy, it almost glows. I hope they never stop making them - not sure what I would do!!!</li>
    <li> The product, itself, was terrific.  However, I purchased it about 6-8 months ago and now Neutrogena has discontinued the line.  DO NOT purchase the scrubber as you will not be able to purchase replacement pads which renders the scrubber useless.  I have been searching for months for the puffs.  In store, they used to sell for about $18 for the refill pack.  Do not get ripped off.  Do not purchase the Healthy Skin Rejuvenator or pay $50 for the refill puffs.  I checked KMart and several other suppliers that were listed above.  All list the replacement puffs as out of stock.  Once again, a company discontinues a product after reeling everyone in.</li>
    <li> Suffice it to say, if Neutrogena wants to triple or quadruple its price for this product - depending on where you bought it - they must want to lose customers as well as phase out this product.     It&#x27;s a shame because I have used this since it came onto the market and have been buying the refills at Walmart for about $16, which I think is the top-end threshold in terms of pricing. Too bad for those of us who like the product but refuse to pay a ludicrous price for an item that clearly is not worth anything near the price. It reflects poorly on Neutrogena&#x27;s image.    I&#x27;m sure there must be a better competitor out there in the market.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I actually found it at a thrift store for $10. The refills? Holy cow. So, I did a search and found them at the KMart website for $20.49!!!  Hey, I&#x27;m happy to share ;)</li>
    <li> These are the replacement puffs for the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator.  The box comes with two plastic tubes of puffs (enough for 8 weeks at the recommended 3X/week) and replacement plastic snap-on piece which the puffs attach to.  The product is great (and reviewed by many on the main page for the product -- suggest checking it out).  The puffs are a little perfumy out of the box, but once you&#x27;ve wet them and they&#x27;ve lathered up a bit they aren&#x27;t too bad, and the scent washes off completely when you rinse your face.  I&#x27;d give these 5 stars if they were unscented, but it&#x27;s not that big a deal.  I had no problem ordering them from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product but I have looked for days for a refill pack.  I am not going to pay 4 times the regular cost to get them on-line.  Too bad Neutrogena has decided to switch to the Wave now that we have all invested in the other handheld gadget that isn&#x27;t that old.  I too will think twice before buying Neutrogena again.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received refills of the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator Puffs through the new Amazon Subscribe and Save program.  The cost was $11.50 when I subscribed.  After the first order, the price jumped to $14.44.  It&#x27;s still a really good price compared to store pricing, but I&#x27;m a little upset that I committed to the program at one price and as soon as my first order shipped, the price increased...</li>
    <li> The skin exfoliator leaves you with softer smoother skin in just one treatment!  I love these.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I&#x27;m an older woman with dry skin and it helps remove the old cells to allow new skin cells to grow.</li>
    <li> Will save you lots of money from going to professional microdermabrasions.  I&#x27;ve been using it and I get the same or even better results of a microdermabrasion at a salon.</li>
    <li> Save you money they are new and in a white box , fit my old unit perfectly!!! 14.99!!!! yes 14.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s new item !!</li>
    <li> This is a much better product than the original resurfacing cream.  It&#x27;s only been two weeks and I already notice a difference.  My skin is smoother, fine wrinkles less noticable, and some brown spots are starting to fade.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep on using it!</li>
    <li> The neutrogena puffs does what the company states they would.  My skin fees great.</li>
    <li> My wife inially had difficulty finding replacement disks but Neutrogena followed through with additional information &amp; a 2 month supply of the diskd free. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> You have seriously got ot be kidding charging folks this kind of markup! I know they aren&#x27;t available anymore, but that doesn&#x27;t make your tactics okay. I might have even paid $24, but seriously, your price is repulsive!</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift and I really like this product. After visiting literally every store in my town, I can only get the refills online and it will take 4 to 6 weeks to receive them.  I really like how my face feels after I use it.  It feels so soft and smooth.  I emailed Neutrogena regarding the refills wondering where I can buy the refills or is it true that they can only be purchased on line.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about weather this product would help me, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.  I am 52 and have some crow&#x27;s feet and forehead wrinkles and generally not great skin tone.  This product has really helped the appearance of my skin.  The improvement was noticed after the first use, mostly an improvement in the tone,brightness, and smoothness of my skin. After using the product 3-4 times a week for a couple months, the forehead lines and crows feet are still visible, but much less pronounced.  It also seems to have help the firmness of my neck, which is starting to look a bit saggy.      Another tip: after using the pad on my face, I use it to smooth my knees, feet, and ankles to prepare for self-tanning lotion.  Follow up with a good moisturizing lotion before applying the self-tanner.  Results are smooth and naturally-looking.  I use one of the gradual self-tanners designed to be used every time you moisturize, but I only use it every couple days or so, just for a little color.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Neutrogena Skin Rejuvenator for a Christmas gift, and in these past few months of using it I have noticed my skin has become much healthier - smaller pores, less oil, less discoloration from sunspots and a lot smoother. I am 44 years old but no one ever guesses that! I would recommend this product to anyone of any age as it is never too soon to start taking care of your skin.</li>
    <li> I am soo happy with this product. My skin feels soo smooth. I only use it once a week though and these refills will lst me for a long time. I have not been able to find them instore and Amazon is the only place I can find them.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The disks are disposable so we don&#x27;t have to use the same old sponge head and worry about bacteria growth. After using them 3 times a week (as directed), I notice how soft my skin feels. I have only been using it for a couple weeks so far, so not sure whether it&#x27;s helping to fade the sun spots. I believe the lines that are starting to form on my forehead is going away slowly. All in all, my skin is loving it!</li>
    <li> These are an absolute basic for me to have on hand.  I&#x27;ve got a good healthy stock of them from Amazon.  At the end of the day, the skin on my face feels like it&#x27;s crawling and crusty.  This exfoliates so well and reveals soft glowing moisturized skin.  I use these about once every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> terrible secondary market with prices through the roof! better to throw away the skin rejuvenator and go to the spa for the money.</li>
    <li> I actually did love this product, but the 24 count refill used to be about $13.00 at CVS, and now I am completely ANNOYED BEYOND BELIEF that its now 4x as much. The drug stores no longer carry them. $100 for 48?!?!?!? Are you kidding???? It would have been really great to know Neutrogena was going to pull a fast one! I will never buy another Neutrogena product again. Fool me once...</li>
    <li> Too bad this is discontinued because I love this product! It&#x27;s like a mini facelift, I will have a hard time finding a replacement...for now I am stocked up :)</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference using this neutrogena product after the first use.  The pads are easy to use, store and dispose of.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants smoother, softer skin and anyone looking to take care of some fine lines before they become big wrinkles.</li>
    <li> this product is great but I was disappointed that the only place I could find it was on Amazon; something like this should be available for purchase in Target or drug store.  I was also upset about the price!  $16.00 for a package of refills would make me think twice about buying the product again - which only cost $34. in the first place!</li>
    <li> You get instant gratification. I&#x27;m 49. I try to use it t least 4 times a week and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product by Neutrogena!  Finally I can do a deep cleaning process and not wake up with irritation from the micro crystals.  I&#x27;ve tried other microdermabrasion products and this is the mildest.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  My face is soft and after two uses, I saw a major difference in clarity.  Keep it on low until you can adjust and be sure to rinse well afterwards. You can buy the refill and use your same applicator from their other face kit.  I am going to continue using this and I would recommend it to everyone with sensitive skin who wants the microdermabrasion feel without the irritation.</li>
    <li> I have sensative skin and have not been able to use very many kinds of skin care or makeup products. I used Mary Kay for several years, but then got dry patches and had to stop. I couldn&#x27;t use Clinique or Alloette but have had no problems with Neutrogena moisturizers. I don&#x27;t usually use a cleanser besides just water in the shower. I have had no problems with this product even after using it for two weeks now. I am very satisfied and I would definitely describe this as mild but very effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2-3 years already. I felt the smooth skin like baby face at the first try. But it could take some time like my sister took a few times of try during one month to feel the same. I liked the old way - with cream and sponge puff, but the cream dries if you don&#x27;t finish the whole bottle in a quite short period of time. The new way - the disposable puff refills are good to use for a long time, but sometimes I have hard time because it has too much water (tried to wet with small amount of water, but didn&#x27;t really work), especially when I use it lying down. This is better than the expensive spa service if you&#x27;re deligent enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months and I see distinct improvement in the look and feel of my skin.  I frequently get dry patches but if I use these scrubbing pads regularly my face feels very sooth and doesn&#x27;t get dry patches.  I&#x27;m 50 years old so my skin is now suffering from many deficiencies that I never experienced in my younger years.  This product does seem to create an overall improvement in the surface appearance and my pores seem somewhat smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read lots of reviews mentioning the refills are not available in stores, just on-line, HOWEVER, I just found the refills at Bed Bath and Beyond for two dollars cheaper than they are here.  I used a 20% off coupon to save a few dollars more and I feel it&#x27;s getting into a more reasonable price range.  I really struggled paying eighteen dollars for 24 pads even though I was happy with the results.  I guess I&#x27;m just too thrifty! I didn&#x27;t expect to find them at Bed Bath and Beyond and was surprised to see them there, in the new drugstore-like area that they added to the store last year.</li>
    <li> At first the machine and pads were awesome to use for my skin. My skin was a little dry after the first week, but you only had to use a little more moisturizer to combat the dryness.  However, after a month, the machine stopped working!!!  Aaaaarrggggggghhhh!!! I can&#x27;t believe I spent money on this product and it only last 1 month....total rip-off from the company!</li>
    <li> I love this product so it was nice to find them on amazon at a cheaper price.  I use both the rejuvenator puffs and the resurfacing cream b/c they are interchangeable with the neutrogenia applicator.  I like both, but the puffs are my favorite.  After using them my skin feels so clean and smooth.  It feels like a fresh, new layer of skin.  It helps get rid of flaking skin.  It&#x27;s great to do as a prep for applying a skin treatment.  It makes my skin feel like it is ready to soak up whatever I apply after.  I&#x27;ve had professional microdermabrasion in the past, but it&#x27;s too expensive.  This is a great way to mimic microdermabrasion at home.  It really brightens up my face and improves the look of my skin.  I was skeptical when I first bought the kit, but I&#x27;m very satisfied and happy I decided to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Supposed to trust Amazon and their sellers. Got this item, it had a sticker on it that said &amp;#34;This item was meant to be sold exclusively at CVS, if you bought this from someone else please call [an 800 number] I did so. They wanted me to ship the product to them, I said no, I bought it from Amazon. They sold me the sale was illegal and I&#x27;d better return the item to them, there could be something wrong with it. I hung up. Received 2 more calls regarding this purchase. If this happens again I will call Amazon and insist on a return/refund. I used them. I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now and am familiar with it. THe pads were dry and sand like, not moist and full of soap as they usually are. A waste.</li>
    <li> Hey you can buy the CVS brand refill pads for the Healthy skin rejuvenator by Neutrogena they are square but they work the same or you can use the refill pads for the WAVE skin cleanser they work too.</li>
    <li> Recieved 1 box with 24 pads for $74 (including shipping). That comes out to about $3 per pad which can only be used one time and then throw away. Although I love the product I do not recommend.  Neutrogena discontinued this item and came out with another called \\&quot;The Wave\\&quot;.  The pads for The Wave fit on the original \\&quot;Rejuvenator\\&quot; and cost around $6 for 30 pads - about 20 cents per pad...a much better deal.</li>
    <li> Took longer to come in than expected but in great shape and they really help the skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 weeks and must say I do think this is a very good addition to the Neutrogena line. I did not find the pads overly abrasive. Like anything of this nature you need to experiment to see just how it will effect your skin. The applicator does have two speeds so you can experiment.  My skin does seem softer and brighter and I am pleased enough to purchase refill pads.     I have had the same problem with the replacement pads not being offered in our local stores. There is an alternative available in some stores which offers a soft sponge applicater that can be used with the applicator that comes with the kit but I did not find this as beneficial as the disposible pads offered with the kit. I will get the original pads here if necessary until our local stores start to stock them.    Overall I liked this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Like other here, I was not able to find these replacement puffs for the [[ASIN:B000V2DLJO Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator]] in my local drugstore(s) so decided to purchase them from Amazon instead. I love how soft these make my face feel after treatment, but the price is a bit high. So I decided after using a new pad, I rinse it and save it for a second use the next day. Rather than use it on the power attachment (which is problematic when there is no cleanser left inside), I just moisten the pad and squeeze on a bit of [[ASIN:B0013EP714 Neutrogena Healthy Skin Cleanser]] and scrub my face using that. This works nicely to give me a more gentle treatment in between the more vigorous treatment with the power scrubber, and makes this purchase a better value as well.</li>
    <li> I have used the Retin A for about 20 years and occassionally have the typical problems with skin flaking. I bought mechanical device at Target and the refills from Amazon. I use it 3-4 times a week. It is great. It is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my sensitive skin because of the prescription cream, and it does a great job of getting rid of the dry layer. My skin really looks better than it has in years. I get the refill puff  from Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; unit. You can find it under search. They send a box automatically, for whatever time period you choose,  there is a discount for buying it from \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; and they don&#x27;t charge for shipping! If you do a search for the product and the subscribe and save it should show up. Sorry to turn this into a commercial for that program :~)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It helps to keep my skin looking young and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Unable to get this product from local department store they were always out.found it at Amazon received the product almost inmediately does a good job of cleaning skin if used together with rejuvenator machine.  Recomended.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin very smooth and clean. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and will continue buying. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> do not believe what you read about this product. Can do much better with plain cotton puffs. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
