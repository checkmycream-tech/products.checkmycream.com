      <li>Stain away is simply the best there is.</li>
      <li>My dental hygienist originally sold me this product and it really works great.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my denture and partial.</li>
      <li>seems to work fine and does effectively what is intended to do...which is defend my mouth against germs, allow me an easy smile, and not have to tend or worry overmuch about scrubbing a mouthful of plastic every day.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I used it once and my dentures were so white it was remarkable.  </li>
      <li>It works very well for partials and easy to use!</li>

      <li>I really like this product!  </li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>This is better than anything I have bought in the local stores.  </li>
      <li>i used to use the tablets that dissolve in the water then bursts blue before belching barrages of buzzing, boiling bubbles blindly bouncing and brushing against my bare biters to leave behind a brilliant, blindingly bright and beautiful smile for me to tuck away inside my mouth...</li>
      <li>Especially when the program wants me to add more words</li>
      <li>Only way to be stain free every day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything that really worked, until now.</li>
      <li>Stain Away works very well.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this product and I have to say that the product really works.</li>
      <li>It really does make them whiter.  </li>
      <li>but I am a coffee drinker and this whitens really well.  </li>
      <li>I remember when I smoked, I used everything I could to get the nicotine off my dentures but nothing really worked....</li>
      <li>I USE THIS PRODUCT OFTEN, IT HAS MY DENTURE SPARLING, THANKS</li>
      <li>Cleans much better than other denture cleanser products.</li>
      <li>Worked better on my retainers than other cleaners did.  </li>
      <li>People who have a bridge or denture quickly learn that regular brushing does not produce the desired result.  </li>
      <li>A few minute soak prior to a good brushing makes all the difference in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>really cleans dentures in a professional way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying that I actually wear a partial or a denture, cuz that would sound old!  </li>
      <li>I am surprised.  </li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>You can be confident that you are fresh and ready to meet your day and people without ‘bad breath’ offence.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it once so far.</li>
      <li>Those hard to clean denture stains are removed without effort.  </li>

(God forbid.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quick, so you don&#x27;t have to leave teeth in a jar for an hour, and it really cleans them well.</li>

    <li> I remember when I smoked, I used everything I could to get the nicotine off my dentures but nothing really worked....saw this on the shelf of my pharmacy and it was at a time they were fighting for shelf space because of so many cleaners....I used it once and my dentures were so white it was remarkable.  13 years later I don&#x27;t smoke anymore but I do drink red wine and don&#x27;t have to worry about stains on my dentures....Thank you Stay Away.....don&#x27;t stop selling it!!!</li>
    <li> works great.  I was not getting new entures as clean as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> People who have a bridge or denture quickly learn that regular brushing does not produce the desired result.  I have tried several types of denture cleansers but Stain Away is the best on the current market.  A few minute soak prior to a good brushing makes all the difference in your mouth.  You can be confident that you are fresh and ready to meet your day and people without ‘bad breath’ offence.  Bob&#x27;s girl</li>
    <li> Nothing else works like it...nothing!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my denture and partial. I wish I had known about this years ago. As a smoker and ice tea drinker (I&#x27;m from the deep south, so drink I lots of ice tea year round) I&#x27;ve never found anything that really worked, until now. I&#x27;ll never be without this product again!</li>
    <li> Product was what I needed.  Cannot find in a local store.  I am a smoker and Stain Away works very well.</li>
    <li> Whitens and brightens, clears away bacteria and does all this in a few minutes.  I allow it to sit overnight but don&#x27;t need to.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Works really well! I don&#x27;t have to worry about it harming my partially metal denture,</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and works very well, even for in hard well water with high mineral content that often can stain partials and dentures.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  Worked better on my retainers than other cleaners did.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Was hesitant about using this because the ingredients are not listed, but decided to give it a try and so glad I did. Great product, cleans great! Will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Those hard to clean denture stains are removed without effort.  We have been using this product for several years and recommend it, especially to smokers.</li>
    <li> the best i&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Best denture cleaner ever used,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind giving each product a star but I do Not like having to write about it. Especially when the program wants me to add more words</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product and I have to say that the product really works. Cleans much better than other denture cleanser products. I had trouble finding the cleanser for partials and I found this on line and is the second time that I bought from this seller. I love Amazon, you can find virtually everything you need!! A very satisfied customer!!!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original.</li>
    <li> i purchased the product pictured and described and was delivered the same.  seems to work fine and does effectively what is intended to do...which is defend my mouth against germs, allow me an easy smile, and not have to tend or worry overmuch about scrubbing a mouthful of plastic every day.  i used to use the tablets that dissolve in the water then bursts blue before belching barrages of buzzing, boiling bubbles blindly bouncing and brushing against my bare biters to leave behind a brilliant, blindingly bright and beautiful smile for me to tuck away inside my mouth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and so it goes...and on and on...so, there it is and there you have it.</li>
    <li> Works great, just as described.  I don&#x27;t smoke but I am a coffee drinker and this whitens really well.  It works much better then the tablet type cleaner.</li>
    <li> Found the hard to find....a product that does what it says. This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Just the best! I have tried many products over the years but no other.Stain away is simply the best there is.</li>
