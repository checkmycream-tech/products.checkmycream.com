      <li>Nice tanning lotion with light scent</li>
      <li>I love this product I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I rotate between 3 and 4 lotions, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that this one is getting me any darker than the rest, but I have a very nice natural brown tan</li>
      <li>Works great, leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
      <li>I used this lotion all last summer and loved the results and it is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Very very nice and very moisturizing as well as bronzing....has a clean smell</li>
      <li>, you&#x27;ll see a nice color change after your first tan with the bronzer in it.</li>
      <li>no complaints, would purchase again, goes on smooth, would recommend to anyone</li>
      <li>BUT this is the only lotion I have found that still works GREAT even when it is out of date.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin soft and well moisturized and gives my skin a nice color of tan that I get complimented on a lot.</li>
      <li>I had been paying over double of this price at the local salon and was very glad to find it on Amazon for such a good price !!  </li>
      <li>It definitely does not leave streaks and it leaves a nice bronze tan.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon and Thanks Pro Tan for supplying such a good product.  </li>
      <li>The smell is ok, I thought it would smell a little better</li>
      <li>It softens my skin like crazy, soaks in nicely, and smells great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hot</li>
      <li>chose this product because I bought at tanning salon for a much much higher price.</li>
      <li>Overall I think this is a really good tanning lotion especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Dries fast with no oily residue on the skin.</li>
      <li>My tanning salon wants over $30 for this</li>
      <li>I feel like I can go straight from the tanning bed to the grocery store and people can&#x27;t smell me coming.  </li>
      <li>I am new to sunless tanning but this stuff is boss!</li>
      <li>I have used this about five times so far, I really like it.</li>
      <li>it was ok, didnt feel moisturising enough, smell was good, didnt stain clothes to bad, color was ok, will probably try a different lotion next time.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells so delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong smelling, bronzers are not too dark and do not streak.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is what I expected and the low price from Amazon makes it even better.</li>
      <li>I like the way this tanning lotion feels on my body, makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I did not have any allergic or sensitive reaction to this lotion either, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Just hope it stays available and don&#x27;t stop making it like others I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>Im from Florida jay recently moved up north and this lotion is the closest thing that I&#x27;ve found to my natural tan color</li>
      <li>Also the smell is good doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>

    <li> I recommend this lotion to everyone!!  I have tanned for years and have used many types of lotions.  I used this lotion all last summer and loved the results and it is by far the best I have ever used. It goes on very smooth.  Smells very nice and does not streak at all. I use it on a daily basis whether I am tanning that day or not. It keeps my skin soft and well moisturized and gives my skin a nice color of tan that I get complimented on a lot. Dries fast with no oily residue on the skin. I had been paying over double of this price at the local salon and was very glad to find it on Amazon for such a good price !!  Thanks Amazon and Thanks Pro Tan for supplying such a good product.  Just hope it stays available and don&#x27;t stop making it like others I have used in the past.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect shade for anyone I imagine. No streaks and smells freakin&#x27; amazing! I am new to sunless tanning but this stuff is boss! I&#x27;m buying another bottle today.</li>
    <li> chose this product because I bought at tanning salon for a much much higher price. The product is awesome. Got a great color for using this</li>

    <li> Great bronzer and smells great! Just be sure to wash your hands!</li>
    <li> helped me get great color before my wedding! good buy!</li>
    <li> I bought a sample of this product and loved it! Now I&#x27;m buying the bottle here because it&#x27;s less expensive here than buying at salon. I tested my tans before, and after, and this helped my tan get a medium darkness faster than tanning dry. I put the lotion on and did not wash my hands, and then afterward I played tennis. My hands did not stain and my tan did not run or streak from the bronzer, so I am happy with that. I love the smell and the moisturizing effect as well. I did not have any allergic or sensitive reaction to this lotion either, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great , my tan is even better&lt;br /&gt;Would totally recommend to others. Amazon is the place to buy from great price and shooing fast</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong smelling, bronzers are not too dark and do not streak.&lt;br /&gt;This is an ideal lotion for my medium complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who has plateaued and wants a little (not much) extra *uumph*.</li>
    <li> Most of the bottles on Amazon are out of date.*** BUT this is the only lotion I have found that still works GREAT even when it is out of date.</li>
    <li> this lotion has a bronzing tint to it that does not turn me orange or leave lines. the smell is as good as it gets for tanning lotions and my skin feels hydrated. definitely a great buy</li>
    <li> thank you very satisfied</li>
    <li> I would say that this has been my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; lotion when I NEED to tan and stay out and about.  It softens my skin like crazy, soaks in nicely, and smells great.  I rotate between 3 and 4 lotions, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that this one is getting me any darker than the rest, but I have a very nice natural brown tan and I am asked almost daily if I just came back from vacation!  The best thing, like I said, is the scent (and lack of scent after I tan).  I feel like I can go straight from the tanning bed to the grocery store and people can&#x27;t smell me coming.  And since there are no tinglers I am not beet red after either.</li>
    <li> Love the smell love it</li>
    <li> It is what I expected and the low price from Amazon makes it even better. No yucky feeling after tanning and smells good too.</li>
    <li> I like the way this tanning lotion feels on my body, makes my skin soft. Also the smell is good doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. It makes me darker as well I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
