      <li>This product lets me have nice nails without the worry involved.  </li>
      <li>They fit perfectly, and I was still free to move my fingers.</li>
      <li>So happy this product is available to order as most salons don&#x27;t carry them.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price - for a great value you protect most of your hands from UV exposure.  </li>
      <li>so they were very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>$7.95 a pair was more than I wanted to pay, but I could not find any competitor.</li>
      <li>I paid $9.95 &amp; got free shipping!</li>
      <li>Thank you for such great service!</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>These glove makes me feel better about placing my hand in the UV nail dryer at the salon i have been getting gel nails every 2 weeks and wanted something to protect me from the UV rays and the glove work for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to use them when doing my nails without them getting in the way.  </li>
      <li>It makes me feel better knowing that my hands are not being exposed to all the UV rays</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll use this one till the end. &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>Upon reading safe guards for getting gel nail applications and UV protection, I wear sunscreen and put on these gloves.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found these gloves here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>Everyone looks when putting them on but protecting my health is more important to me and my family.</li>
      <li>I ordered them for my daughter-in-law who was giving manicures and getting UV burns from the lamps, and she said they are much more comfortable than the latex gloves the dermatologist suggested she wear, and don&#x27;t make her hands sweat.</li>
      <li>AND, most importantly, they worked as advertised.</li>
      <li>I just bought these as I have seen too much sun in my day and get my gel nails done bi-weekly, so figured these gloves would be wise.</li>
      <li>They were delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>I used to slather on sunblock and anything else I could find before getting my nails done because my fingers would end up darker (tan easily) than the rest of my hand.  </li>
      <li>The gloves were shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>and they are fine.  </li>
      <li>They are comfortable and adequately shield the fingers, hands and most of the lower arm.  </li>
      <li>These gloves fit me fine</li>
      <li>really enjoy the peace of mind knowing that while my nails cure the rest of my  skin is protected from radiation and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>material seem cheap.  </li>
      <li>These gloves fit well</li>
      <li>Gel polish has to be cured with a UV light, so wearing the gloves will limit the exposure of the backs of my hands to potentially-damaging ultraviolet rays.  </li>
      <li>They fit comfortably.</li>
      <li>And my hands were getting all wrinkly too from the Shellac light.  </li>
      <li>These gloves are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>They fit just wonderful for my small hands.  </li>
      <li>So sad really wanted these to work, the length was great, just below the elbow, finger length was great too, just below my nails!!!</li>
      <li>I really, really like that I can protect most of my skin from the rays that are cooking my nails.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a bit satiny and not cottony, so they slide on pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Love my new gloves!</li>
      <li>My wife is very pleased with the gloves--since they slightly stretch, they fit well on hands of all sizes.  </li>
      <li>These gloves have softened and become easier to scrunch to just the right distance from my fingertips with each use.</li>
      <li>They fit fine length wise but were pretty snug on my thin hand(7 inch wrist) which may have attributed to the seam tearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I know that the most recent reports say that UV lights do not cause skin cancer, but I can tell you for sure that my hands have aged significantly since I started getting gel manicures.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Kinda funny, these look like elbow length evening gloves...</li>
      <li>Very affordable and worth it.</li>
      <li>The gloves covered a good portion of my nails and it was not easy to keep them pulled up</li>
      <li>I do have to tug on one of the fingers to make sure the nail bed is exposed, but hey, my fingers aren&#x27;t that long.  </li>
      <li>They fit very comfortable  on small and large hands.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery also.</li>
      <li>much so, that me putting it in and out made it rip a little.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Dual use for a very affordable pair of gloves:  </li>
      <li>I received these gloves from this seller in a very prompt and timely manner.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>Fit is similar, too ...</li>
      <li>gloves don&#x27;t stretch much so one of the seams of 1 finger ripped in the 1st use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you get Gel and/or Gel Polish nails and are worried about too much UV exposure, then this product is a must have.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely UV sensitive skin due to the medications I am on, and I absolutely love these gloves!</li>
      <li>I did this the very first time I used them, and by the time I was done with my nails it was quite apparent that they&#x27;re not made for scrunching.</li>
      <li>(I have very small hands) and were of good quality.  </li>
      <li>It is reassuring to think they are protecting my hands, and they are a comfortable fit for my relatively small hands (size 5-6 ring).</li>
      <li>I like that these gloves are long so that my arms are protected from UV light as well.  </li>
      <li>Very cheaply made, which means they do not fit very well...</li>
      <li>The thumb hole is adequate, but all the others including my tiny pinkie finger were going to sleep from the tightness of these gloves!</li>
      <li>Also, since I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;d rather not age my skin any faster than I have to.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I also have to pull down the ends a bit, but I&#x27;d rather have more coverage and pull them down as I see fit.</li>
      <li>However, for my purposes, that just made them easier to fold down so that they actually fit my hands.</li>
      <li>As to the fit they aren&#x27;t baggy or too tight.  </li>
      <li>I had an allergic reaction to the UV light dryer before I bought these gloves, and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a GEL manicure anymore.  </li>
      <li>so the only issue I have is they come very close to some of the nail beds</li>
      <li>Young people do not think about UV sun damage, but if you are over 50, you automatically notice sun damage, so I bought these to have my gel nails applied.</li>
      <li>they have a few stray strands of thread which I clipped off but work for their purpose of protecting hands from uv light.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;m a bit heavy, they don&#x27;t fit my arms as well as they could; this problem is easily solved, however, by rolling the open end of the glove down an inch or so.  </li>
      <li>They are a small price to pay to protect your health from exposure to UV light.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do , protect your hands from harmful UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;It has a silky feel and the fit it perfect.  The glove goes up  almost to the elbow.&lt;br /&gt;It is  great alternative to using sunblock on your hands while under the curing lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone getting gel manicures.</li>
    <li> Great product. The gloves are comfortable to wear and protect your skin from unnecessary UV exposure.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the peace of mind knowing that while my nails cure the rest of my  skin is protected from radiation and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;The place where I get my gel manicures does not have these so I just take them along myself.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I bought this, because I noticed my hands got really dark tanned from my &amp;#34;Shellac&amp;#34; Manicure.  And my hands were getting all wrinkly too from the Shellac light.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased these gloves to protect the skin of my hands and fingers when I&#x27;m at the beauty salon getting gel nail polish applied.  Gel polish has to be cured with a UV light, so wearing the gloves will limit the exposure of the backs of my hands to potentially-damaging ultraviolet rays.  The only criticism I have of these gloves is that they are sized for a person with average-sized arms.  As I&#x27;m a bit heavy, they don&#x27;t fit my arms as well as they could; this problem is easily solved, however, by rolling the open end of the glove down an inch or so.  Now as an added bonus, I&#x27;ve discovered that these gloves are also perfect to wear while I&#x27;m making jewelry:  the fingertips are cut out, allowing me to handle my wire, tools, and even the tinest of beads--but the gloves protect my hands and fingers from the HEAT of my high-intensity lamp (which has a magnifying glass attached) while I&#x27;m beading.  Dual use for a very affordable pair of gloves:  I paid $9.95 &amp; got free shipping!</li>
    <li> The gloves were shipped very quickly. I ordered them for my daughter-in-law who was giving manicures and getting UV burns from the lamps, and she said they are much more comfortable than the latex gloves the dermatologist suggested she wear, and don&#x27;t make her hands sweat.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made, which means they do not fit very well... however they still (hopefully) protect my hands from the UV lights when gelling my nails.</li>
    <li> Great value, work good with lots of sun protection… Fast delivery also.</li>
    <li> So happy this product is available to order as most salons don&#x27;t carry them. They are also very thin, so it&#x27;s easy to store in my purse so I don&#x27;t forget.</li>
    <li> These gloves work great for at home gel nails. It makes me feel better knowing that my hands are not being exposed to all the UV rays each time I do my nails!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves don&#x27;t stretch much so one of the seams of 1 finger ripped in the 1st use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin long hands. They fit fine length wise but were pretty snug on my thin hand(7 inch wrist) which may have attributed to the seam tearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s a fair product. If it had more stretch it would be great.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price - for a great value you protect most of your hands from UV exposure.  Like the other reviews mentioned, the gloves go on quite time if you&#x27;re &#x27;average&#x27; sized. I actually have pretty small hands and a thin wrist, and they&#x27;re a snug fit.  I also have to pull down the ends a bit, but I&#x27;d rather have more coverage and pull them down as I see fit. They&#x27;re a bit satiny and not cottony, so they slide on pretty easily.</li>
    <li> great quality. This is so necessary for any on that gets their nails done at home or take with you to the salon</li>
    <li> Is good this product.</li>
    <li> I take these with me to the salon every time i get a gel manicure! I had an allergic reaction to the UV light dryer before I bought these gloves, and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a GEL manicure anymore.  I saw these on the internet and decided to try them.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! They give me the protection I need.  My manicurist asked me to order some for her!</li>
    <li> I like that these gloves are long so that my arms are protected from UV light as well.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> they have a few stray strands of thread which I clipped off but work for their purpose of protecting hands from uv light. The finger parts don&#x27;t come down too far and can be pushed up if necessary.</li>
    <li> these gloves work great. I use them when I get a gel manicure every 3 weeks. A little long but comfortable</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found these gloves here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;They fit perfectly, and now I don&#x27;t need to worry about exposing my hands to the UV light.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful quality, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This Product is ok.&lt;br /&gt;You need to know that it is Narrow. I believe I have standard size hands and it fits me, but Tight.&lt;br /&gt;So much so, that me putting it in and out made it rip a little.&lt;br /&gt;I only used about 4 or 5 times. (So that&#x27;s why I took one start out)&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise, it does what&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again? Probably not. But I&#x27;ll use this one till the end. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with the gloves--since they slightly stretch, they fit well on hands of all sizes.  They are comfortable and adequately shield the fingers, hands and most of the lower arm.  She would recommend them to anyone concerned about protecting their skin from the ultra violet rays emitted from the UV nail dryers.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item. Great protection for my hands. Fit is perfect. I would recomend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I received these gloves from this seller in a very prompt and timely manner.  They fit just wonderful for my small hands.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to use them when doing my nails without them getting in the way.  Thank you for such great service!</li>
    <li> I just bought these as I have seen too much sun in my day and get my gel nails done bi-weekly, so figured these gloves would be wise. I also use sunscreen on my hands.</li>
    <li> Not that I have behemoth hands or anything, but I could be considered big boned, so I was worried these would be too tight at the elbow or in the knuckles. They fit perfectly, and I was still free to move my fingers.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the white is to further block the UV rays?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda funny, these look like elbow length evening gloves... Fit is similar, too ... Only, there at e no finger tips on them!</li>
    <li> Wanted so badly for these to work to use while driving. I am very fair and want to avoid additional sun damage. I have long skinny fingers, in fact my wedding ring is custom-made at a 3.5, YES that is not a typo I said a three and a half. The average size is a 7! So very long thin fingers indeed! I got these and tried wearing them while driving yesterday and with-in 8 minutes all my fingers were NUMB the finger holes are TOO TIGHT FOR ME! The thumb hole is adequate, but all the others including my tiny pinkie finger were going to sleep from the tightness of these gloves! Arm size was good, but again I have long thin arms, so I am not sure how these would work on anyone with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size hand, fingers or arms. They are going back to Amazon on Monday! So sad really wanted these to work, the length was great, just below the elbow, finger length was great too, just below my nails!!! But you can&#x27;t drive with numb fingers and I fear hands if I had left them on any longer!!</li>
    <li> This produce was a great idea but it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  The gloves covered a good portion of my nails and it was not easy to keep them pulled up so they didn&#x27;t touch my drying nails.  Also, the stitching was coming apart on some of the fingers when it arrived.  If you have very long thin fingers than this product will work for you.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the UV gloves. They fit very comfortable  on small and large hands. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I wore these gloves to the nail salon, and the fingers are just a bit too long for me&lt;br /&gt;but they did cover the areas exposed to the UV lamp.  I would recommend these to&lt;br /&gt;anyone who wants to protect the thin areas of skin on their hands.</li>
    <li> These gloves do block the UV rays, but they&#x27;re not the best quality. That said - I&#x27;m still using them. Since the fingers are cut long and my fingers are apparently short, I had to scrunch/fold the fingers down so that the gloves didn&#x27;t touch my polish. I did this the very first time I used them, and by the time I was done with my nails it was quite apparent that they&#x27;re not made for scrunching. The seams at the edge of each finger split and came apart, which doesn&#x27;t look very good. However, for my purposes, that just made them easier to fold down so that they actually fit my hands. It&#x27;s not like anyone&#x27;s going to see them, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about these gloves? No more only-tan-hands!</li>
    <li> These gloves have softened and become easier to scrunch to just the right distance from my fingertips with each use. They were a little harder to adjust the first time I used them, but after the third use - I would definitely recommend them for anyone deciding to invest in the CND Shellac system at home. It is reassuring to think they are protecting my hands, and they are a comfortable fit for my relatively small hands (size 5-6 ring).</li>
    <li> Love my new gloves! Take them with me to every gel manicure. Feel so much better now that my hands are protected!</li>
    <li> These gloves shipped and arrived promptly. They fit comfortably. $7.95 a pair was more than I wanted to pay, but I could not find any competitor.</li>
    <li> These gloves do just what I wanted them to do.  I do have to tug on one of the fingers to make sure the nail bed is exposed, but hey, my fingers aren&#x27;t that long.  I really, really like that I can protect most of my skin from the rays that are cooking my nails.</li>
    <li> gloves may indeed protect your hands and arms, but compared to other similar products, they are too tight.  Wish I had bought another brand</li>
    <li> No woman who gets gel manicures should be without these gloves.  They are a small price to pay to protect your health from exposure to UV light.  They were delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these gloves long enough to know if they are truly protecting my hands from UV exposure.  As to the fit they aren&#x27;t baggy or too tight.  I have short fingers so the only issue I have is they come very close to some of the nail beds but I just pull them back and they are fine.  They are comfortable and don&#x27;t fell awkward to paint your nails with them on.</li>
    <li> These glove makes me feel better about placing my hand in the UV nail dryer at the salon i have been getting gel nails every 2 weeks and wanted something to protect me from the UV rays and the glove work for me. Everyone looks when putting them on but protecting my health is more important to me and my family. I am reduce my exposure time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I know that the most recent reports say that UV lights do not cause skin cancer, but I can tell you for sure that my hands have aged significantly since I started getting gel manicures. Now that I am using these gloves, I feel that I am doing everything possible to protect my skin and I am hoping those ugly brown spots will not get any bigger or darker!!</li>
    <li> I have had twenty eight skin cancers.  This product lets me have nice nails without the worry involved.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Upon reading safe guards for getting gel nail applications and UV protection, I wear sunscreen and put on these gloves. Young people do not think about UV sun damage, but if you are over 50, you automatically notice sun damage, so I bought these to have my gel nails applied.</li>
    <li> These gloves fit well (I have very small hands) and were of good quality.  They will definitely help protect my hands from the harmful U/V rays of my nail dryer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have extremely UV sensitive skin due to the medications I am on, and I absolutely love these gloves! Awesome!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for those concerned with UV exposure.  Protects hands, fingers and forearms against radiation while allowing nails to cure properly.  Works just as well as those gloves costing twice the price</li>
    <li> These gloves are fantastic.  If you get Gel and/or Gel Polish nails and are worried about too much UV exposure, then this product is a must have.  I used to slather on sunblock and anything else I could find before getting my nails done because my fingers would end up darker (tan easily) than the rest of my hand.  Also, since I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;d rather not age my skin any faster than I have to.  These gloves fit me fine and I had plenty of stretch room so they were very comfortable.  AND, most importantly, they worked as advertised. I love them!</li>
    <li> Great protection from UV light, and a bonus...it keeps your fingers separated to avoid smudging and smears! Very affordable and worth it.</li>
    <li> It had a run in it. Not worth mailing it back. Think maby they should look at there products before sending them out ):</li>
    <li> I feel the gloves material is not good quality.  material seem cheap.  gloves themselves are not well made.  unhappy with this purchase</li>
