      <li>I am extremely impressed by the nice texture of my hair...</li>
      <li>SO IT COMES VERY HANDY TO ORDERED FROM YOU AND HAVE IT DELIVERED AT HOME</li>
      <li>Bought this shampoo (along with the conditioner) for my mum who ordered it once from QVC and thought it was amazing!</li>
      <li>the smell is nice!</li>
      <li>Nice poof!  </li>

      <li>Kind of like a gel shampoo.  </li>
      <li>THE BOTTLES WERE SHIPPED EACH IN THEIR OWN PLASTIC BAG.  </li>
      <li>and some may find that this has negative effects, but do your research and try to make the best choice that fits best.</li>
      <li>and I have a lot of very fine hair.</li>
      <li>so far i am very happy with this product, the shampoo has met my expectations and when combined with the conditioner yields better results.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for fine hair...or messed up haircut!</li>
      <li>Was using Rogain Shampoo-Fat is better, along with Fat Creme.</li>
      <li>I used a Volumizing Shampoo for almost twenty years that worked magic on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I gave the thickening creme another chance and used it with my Paul Mitchell For Blondes only shampoo and conditioner, and it was awesome.</li>
      <li>I tried it and love it .  </li>
      <li>She did too many layers</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY shampoos this to me is a winner.</li>
      <li>I tried the Fat Hair Leave in Creme and LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Love this brand&#x27;s hair spray</li>
      <li>It helps to use the Samy Mousse to add even more body to your hair.  </li>
      <li>everyone&#x27;s genetics is different, so some people may find this to be the best beauty product on earth</li>
      <li>Since each person&#x27;s hair is different, of course, you need to try both and be the judge of what works best for you.</li>
      <li>THIS SHAMPOO WORKED OKAY WHEN I GOT IT..</li>
      <li>LOVE THE SHAMPOO.  </li>
      <li>more volume.</li>
      <li>With so many layers (???)</li>
      <li>suspect that most people get the \\&quot;thickness\\&quot; in their hair from the Thickening Creme and maybe a bit from the Thickening Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and I feel like I have a full head of hair again!</li>
      <li>Again, the article did state that the shampoo did work best on grey hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the company that made my original shampoo eventually went out of business!  </li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really just using it to finish it up at this point, and then I use a good conditioner to make up for it.</li>
      <li>Although shampooing it twice does get it more clean with this product.    </li>
      <li>While I would rate \\&quot;Bumble and bumble\\&quot; thickening shampoo &amp; conditioner 5 stars, on my fine hair Samy&#x27;s FAT Hair thickening shampoo &amp; conditioner has the \\&quot;leading edge.\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>I have oily hair that is fine.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks great and feels a little thicker -- nice shine and bounce.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair tangle free and THICKER FEELING.</li>
      <li>My sister hates this product too, she thinks it was a cheap brand I bought, and I point to the price sticker on the bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t much care for the smell of this product, which seems kind of chemical-y to me, but it does not linger once it&#x27;s rinsed out.  </li>
      <li>but I thought I&#x27;d throw in my two cents worth! :</li>
      <li>Samy Fat Hair is like that - instead of a lot of foaming additives to rinse out of your hair like we are accustomed to, Samy Fat Hair rinses out so easily you won&#x27;t think you got your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair and I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s made any difference in the thickness of my hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair, at all.  </li>
      <li>just the right amount of it!</li>
      <li>I recently found an article on the web from Good Housekeeping and their findings on hair \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; shampoos.</li>
      <li>so my hair wasn&#x27;t getting as clean as it normally does leaving it greasy at the top.</li>
      <li>I also use the thickening creme prior to blow-drying and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be back for more...!</li>
      <li>I have read great reviews of the shampoo so if you have limp hair, I&#x27;d say to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>in my experience i have found useful to read the one and two star reviews on products first and then weighing my options.</li>
      <li>This shampoo made my hair looks oily, and it didn&#x27;t give much volume to my straight and fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it is a good thing to have low sudsing action.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine flat hair.  </li>
      <li>First, there was no change to the quality of her hair.</li>
      <li>even though it&#x27;s more expensive it smells better, makes my hair thicker, and cleans it better.</li>
      <li>This is the first time there&#x27;s not a fragrant and fresh smell to my hair product, and I know it&#x27;s just an additive, but really this thing smells like chemicals.</li>
      <li>First place went to Pantene&#x27;s Hair Thickening shampoo, now discontinued.</li>
      <li>thanks, Amazon!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I want in a shampoo</li>
      <li>I will look into the entire line of products since they don&#x27;t contain too many chemicals.</li>
      <li>However, if you have fine hair, especially if you have gray, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>Cons- didn&#x27;t care for the smell , it was barely nonexistant smells like lightly scented almond.      </li>
      <li>and with my fine hair leaves it a bit thicker and fuller; plus, to a small degree better feel and resilence.    </li>
      <li>Second, and most important, we have just discovered - by process of elimination - that these two products were the cause of her VERY severe acne outbreak on her back and hairline.</li>
      <li>I have short, straight, fine greying hair.</li>
      <li>I use Pantene volume and can&#x27;t say I can tell much difference between that shampoo and this.</li>
      <li>also the shipping was very  timely.</li>
      <li>Thanks D.O.</li>
      <li>I used both brands and found neither to do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>It works well and doesn&#x27;t smell so much that I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of the products effectiveness, it doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable also.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t lather as that really doesn&#x27;t relate to the cleaning ability, but this leaves my hair kind of oily-looking, therefore requiring me to shampoo with a different shampoo prior to using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product really just dries out my hair, and I guess just cleans it.</li>
      <li>so i needed to find another solution fast.</li>
      <li>The price is very competitive even with paying for shipping.</li>
      <li>the shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds much but keep in mind that no shampoo has suds by nature.  </li>
      <li>I bought the shampoo over a month ago and find it REALLY HAS made my hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; thicker and look thicker.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit odd but not horrible - small price to pay for the good results.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair is coming clean when I shampoo with this, but when dried, it looks clean.</li>
      <li>first, i have learned that buying products on amazon can be risky as far as quality and authenticity is concerned.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pity, as I was very optimistic when I ordered this due to the other excellent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mainly because of the smell.</li>
      <li>it made my hair a little more fuller    </li>
      <li>Now, the time has come to find a new Volumizing Shampoo that will make my very soft, straight hair look like it has some body.  </li>
      <li>The texture is a bit sticky after a shampoo, but I can live with that.</li>
      <li>It smells like something I do not want to use, but okay lets get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Dont notice any difference in my hair using this product :(</li>
    <li> Pros- it made my hair a little more fuller    Cons- didn&#x27;t care for the smell , it was barely nonexistant smells like lightly scented almond.      - Shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well- so my hair wasn&#x27;t getting as clean as it normally does leaving it greasy at the top. Although shampooing it twice does get it more clean with this product.    I will go back to using Bumble &amp; Bumble even though it&#x27;s more expensive it smells better, makes my hair thicker, and cleans it better.</li>
    <li> I have short, straight, fine greying hair. I have been searching for a \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; shampoo now for months since Pantene quit making their \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; shampoo. I recently found an article on the web from Good Housekeeping and their findings on hair \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; shampoos. First place went to Pantene&#x27;s Hair Thickening shampoo, now discontinued. They also listed Bumble and Bumbles thick hair shampoo and Keratase which are both a bit more expensive than regular store brands. I used both brands and found neither to do much for my hair. GH also listed Samy Fat Hair Shampoo and found it did have the ability to coat strands of hair (ESPECIALLY GREY HAIR) and give it a thicker feel. I bought the shampoo over a month ago and find it REALLY HAS made my hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; thicker and look thicker. I never use rinse out hair conditioners but I like \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; conditioners. I have used Nexxus and Bumble &amp; Bumble brand leave in&#x27;s- of which- neither really made my hair feel thicker- only fluffier- more volume. I tried the Fat Hair Leave in Creme and LOVE IT. Makes my hair tangle free and THICKER FEELING. For me, the Fat Hair products I&#x27;ve used so far have made my hair feel thicker. Again, the article did state that the shampoo did work best on grey hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and the fact the shampoo doesn&#x27;t have a lot of perfume smell to it. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> works about the same as all the other products on the market, did not see any noticeable reason to spend more and wait for order to arrive, i will just stick with products i can pick up local</li>
    <li> I used a Volumizing Shampoo for almost twenty years that worked magic on my hair.  It was hard to get on the East Coast and I ended up buying it via the internet from hair dressing shops on the West Coast.  About five years ago, I heard it was being discontinued by the company and I managed to purchase enough to last me this long.  Now, the time has come to find a new Volumizing Shampoo that will make my very soft, straight hair look like it has some body.  I&#x27;ve found out this is easier said than done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo, which a national publication said women with naturally white hair loved, failed me in a big way.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair and when I used its Thickening cr&amp;egrave;me, which is supposed to make my hair look even better, I end up with hair with a small amount of body but without its usual shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smell of it but I&#x27;ll use it for a while, without the styling cr&amp;egrave;me since I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s making the shine disappear.  This is only the third shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so I may have miles to go before I sleep in my bed with hair that has proper volume and shine but I thought I&#x27;d throw in my two cents worth! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: the shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds much but keep in mind that no shampoo has suds by nature.  They put a chemical into it to make it suds up because people want their shampoo to make suds.  Secondly, when you rinse it out of your hair, your hair won&#x27;t squeak, even though it&#x27;s totally rinsed.  For some odd reason, that really bothers me but all shampoos are different as is my not-so-lovely-hair.  I have read great reviews of the shampoo so if you have limp hair, I&#x27;d say to give it a try.  Maybe you won&#x27;t have stubborn hair like mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the company that made my original shampoo eventually went out of business!  Figures it would!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this shampoo didn&#x27;t work well for my hair.  It can be a good thickening shampoo for whom has a curly hair.  This shampoo made my hair looks oily, and it didn&#x27;t give much volume to my straight and fine hair.  For this reason the product should write the information on the package.  Sueli</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo (along with the conditioner) for my mum who ordered it once from QVC and thought it was amazing! Searched everywhere on the net for somewhere to buy it the UK but had no luck. In the end opted to order it from the US which didn&#x27;t cost anymore or take as long to be delivered had I ordered it from the UK! Will definitely be back for more...!</li>
    <li> Compare to \\&quot;Bumble and bumble\\&quot; thickening shampoo and thickening conditioner.  Samy&#x27;s FAT hair looks and feels similar to \\&quot;Bumble and bumble\\&quot; -- and with my fine hair leaves it a bit thicker and fuller; plus, to a small degree better feel and resilence.    My \\&quot;Bumble and bumble\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner bottles are 8 fluid ounces each; compared to Samy&#x27;s FAT Hair at 10 fluid ounces each.  Samy&#x27;s FAT Hair shampoo and conditioner cost less than \\&quot;Bumble and bumble\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner.    While I would rate \\&quot;Bumble and bumble\\&quot; thickening shampoo &amp; conditioner 5 stars, on my fine hair Samy&#x27;s FAT Hair thickening shampoo &amp; conditioner has the \\&quot;leading edge.\\&quot;    Since each person&#x27;s hair is different, of course, you need to try both and be the judge of what works best for you.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO WORKED OKAY WHEN I GOT IT..&lt;br /&gt;I AM INTO ALL ORGANIC THINGS FOR MY HAIR NOW..&lt;br /&gt;BUT THIS WORKED WELL..</li>
    <li> I have a problem with strongly smelling products, so I checked with a few of the previous users before buying this.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t smell so much that I can&#x27;t stand it. That said, it did work well but I didn&#x27;t notice my hair any thicker than any other volumizing shampoo. For the cost, I believe I&#x27;ll just go back to my previous choice.</li>
    <li> i wanted to wait a few months before writing this review to give a more objective response. first, i have learned that buying products on amazon can be risky as far as quality and authenticity is concerned. in my experience i have found useful to read the one and two star reviews on products first and then weighing my options. so far i am very happy with this product, the shampoo has met my expectations and when combined with the conditioner yields better results. everyone&#x27;s genetics is different, so some people may find this to be the best beauty product on earth and some may find that this has negative effects, but do your research and try to make the best choice that fits best. i had tried a shampoo that i shopped on amazon that boasted having caffeine to invigorate the scalp, well it was making my hair fallout at an expedited rate so i needed to find another solution fast. fat hair has met my expectations and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this shampoo. Mainly because of the smell. You know it&#x27;s bad when you&#x27;re dreading using your shampoo. This is the first time there&#x27;s not a fragrant and fresh smell to my hair product, and I know it&#x27;s just an additive, but really this thing smells like chemicals. It smells like something I do not want to use, but okay lets get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the products effectiveness, it doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair. I have very thick, oily hair. The product really just dries out my hair, and I guess just cleans it. My sister hates this product too, she thinks it was a cheap brand I bought, and I point to the price sticker on the bottle. I&#x27;m really just using it to finish it up at this point, and then I use a good conditioner to make up for it. Don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
    <li> This gives hair the thickening qualities for people who have very thin hair!!! Walgreens used to carry it but not any longer. Go to Amazon for EVERYTHING!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair is coming clean when I shampoo with this, but when dried, it looks clean.</li>
    <li> The product is very good and the service was great. also the shipping was very  timely. i would recomend this product and service to anyone.  Thanks D.O.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this product makes my hair feel thicker and fuller.  Kind of like a gel shampoo.  Smell is neutral, which I like.  No other product works like this for me.  Actually user of this product for half a year already, but stores in my area stopped carrying it.  So I guess I&#x27;ll be ordering it from now on.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product for my thin, flat hair. Love it and it is hard to find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> His FAT HAIR products are the best on the market regardless of price. Having tried FULLER THICKER HAIR, LOREAL SHAMPOO FOR THICK HAIR AND ROGAINE and numerous others over the years  the SAMY quality is far better and for only a few dollars more. You need to use Shampoo, conditioner and the FAT HAIR gel together.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SHAMPOO.  THE BOTTLES WERE SHIPPED EACH IN THEIR OWN PLASTIC BAG.  GOOD THING BECAUSE THE CAPS  ON THREE OF THE SIX  BOTTLES ORDERED WERE LOOSE.  I LOST ONLY ABOUT A HALF A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO, BUT WHAT A MESS!</li>
    <li> I have used this both by itself as well as in a combination with the [[ASIN:B000ONZA3U Samy Fat Hair \\&quot;0\\&quot; Calories Thickening Conditioner 10 fl oz (300 ml)]] and the [[ASIN:B00902QRQK Samy Fat Hair Thickening Creme 5.25 Fl Oz / 155 Ml (Pack of 2)]].  Of these three products, this is the only Fat Hair product I&#x27;m certain I will not be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair, at all.  I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t lather as that really doesn&#x27;t relate to the cleaning ability, but this leaves my hair kind of oily-looking, therefore requiring me to shampoo with a different shampoo prior to using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is no difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance if I use this alone or combined with the other two products.  If it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair and I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s made any difference in the thickness of my hair, there&#x27;s really no point in my buying this again.  It&#x27;s a pity, as I was very optimistic when I ordered this due to the other excellent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that most people get the \\&quot;thickness\\&quot; in their hair from the Thickening Creme and maybe a bit from the Thickening Conditioner.  They rate the shampoo rather well because they use it as part of the complete system and don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;d get the exact same benefits if they didn&#x27;t use the shampoo at all,instead only using the other products.</li>
    <li> SINCE I HAVE THIN HAIR I HAVE BEEN USING THE &amp;#34;FAT&amp;#34; HAIR PRODUCTS FOR A LONG TIME, SOMETIMES IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND IT IN A LOCAL STORE; PLUS THE GAS AND THE TIME.  SO IT COMES VERY HANDY TO ORDERED FROM YOU AND HAVE IT DELIVERED AT HOME</li>
    <li> It does make my hair a little bigger and fater.</li>
    <li> If you can get past the smell, Its&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not a really good smell.  It does good things for your hair.  I have very fine flat hair.  I was complaining to a coworker about the crown of my head, my hair always parts there and flattens out.  She told me she had that problem also but this shampoo stops that.  I tried it and love it .  It makes your hair fuller, and keeps the friz down.</li>
    <li> Nice poof!  I have oily hair that is fine.  It added body that I did not think existed.  The texture is a bit sticky after a shampoo, but I can live with that. Please note, I noticed this is an everyday shampoo, not a once every other day shampoo.  It does not combat oily hair or other product buildup.</li>
    <li> Was using Rogain Shampoo-Fat is better, along with Fat Creme. I&#x27;ll keep using it.It does exactly what I want in a shampoo</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
    <li> I use Pantene volume and can&#x27;t say I can tell much difference between that shampoo and this. Love this brand&#x27;s hair spray but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
    <li> No paraben, no fragrance and no sulfate...I thought it wouldn&#x27;t make me hair look fuller, in the contrary! My hairdresser was trippin the last time she made my haircut. She did too many layers and I have a lot of very fine hair. With so many layers (???) my hair got flat and I have now to use a brush to correct the bad waves. I used to just dry my hair head down...This shampoo gives volume, without making your hair too crazy. It&#x27;s like it thickens every single hair on my head. I am extremely impressed by the nice texture of my hair...however I am not feeling this way about my hairdresser. I will look into the entire line of products since they don&#x27;t contain too many chemicals. I will also look for an other hairdresser. I recommend this product for fine hair...or messed up haircut!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Saw a write up for it in Glamour and thought I would try it.  I did and it&#x27;s great.  I have very fine hair, and I feel like I have a full head of hair again! Can&#x27;t find it in stores, so thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> My daughter used this (and the Samy Fat Hair Thickening Conditioner) for almost 2 months. First, there was no change to the quality of her hair. Second, and most important, we have just discovered - by process of elimination - that these two products were the cause of her VERY severe acne outbreak on her back and hairline. Within 3 days of ceasing to use these products, her skin is almost clear. We can&#x27;t determine which of the ingredients cause the outbreak, but we&#x27;ll be comparing labels against these two from now on.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I did not like this shampoo, and I used it with the conditioner that goes with it plus the thickening creme. I made my hair very dull, and very dry feeling. I gave the thickening creme another chance and used it with my Paul Mitchell For Blondes only shampoo and conditioner, and it was awesome. I will let my husband use the shpo and cond. Also I got the hair spray from fat head, if you want a very very firm hold you will like, it coms out of hair fairly easy just too firm of a spray for me.</li>
    <li> It lasted longer than i thought! i never ordered it again...it worked to a certian point and then just felt like ordinary shampoo. the smell is nice! just the right amount of it!</li>
    <li> I read about this on some online review, said it was the best thickening shampoo for gray hair (which I now have quite a bit of).  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and just bought another bottle.  My Bumble and bumble now sits there, half-gone and unused.  This shampoo gives me a great result.  I don&#x27;t much care for the smell of this product, which seems kind of chemical-y to me, but it does not linger once it&#x27;s rinsed out.  The shampoo itself is very thin, almost watery, consistency, so I find I use quite a bit of it.  However, if you have fine hair, especially if you have gray, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  I also use the thickening creme prior to blow-drying and am very pleased with the results.  Great prices, too!  That thickening creme seems like it will last me for years!</li>
    <li> I can see a fullness in my hair just after one washing.  I am very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY shampoos this to me is a winner. The conditioner works well with it plus the thickening cream. The price is reasonable also.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, very straight hair.  I used the shampoo but not the conditioner.  My hair looks great and feels a little thicker -- nice shine and bounce.  Very happy with the product.  The smell is a bit odd but not horrible - small price to pay for the good results.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it is a good thing to have low sudsing action.  Samy Fat Hair is like that - instead of a lot of foaming additives to rinse out of your hair like we are accustomed to, Samy Fat Hair rinses out so easily you won&#x27;t think you got your money&#x27;s worth.  But that is NOT the case!  You hair will immediately feel thicker and when you dry it (naturally or with a blow dryer) you will see thicker hair.  It helps to use the Samy Mousse to add even more body to your hair.  Samy Fat Hair is not sold in all stores.  Try Walgreens or order from Amazon.  The price is very competitive even with paying for shipping.</li>
