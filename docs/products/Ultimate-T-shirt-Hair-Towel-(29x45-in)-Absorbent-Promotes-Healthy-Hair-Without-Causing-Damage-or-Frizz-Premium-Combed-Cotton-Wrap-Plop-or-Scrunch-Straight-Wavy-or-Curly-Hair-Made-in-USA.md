      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>I was under the impression this would absorb the moisture out of my hair better than a towel</li>
      <li>I love it -</li>
      <li>This product is nice; however, I thought it was going to be more like a soft t-shirt kind of material.  </li>
      <li>It is absorbant, comfortable and cool!</li>
      <li>The RePear towel has made a huge difference for me and has stopped my hair from breaking and falling out so easily.</li>
      <li>Hair was shinier with less fly aways!</li>
      <li>I have fairly long hair, and this wraps up beautifully.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Great, easy little product!</li>
      <li>Best hair related purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
      <li>that when you put it in a turban, it&#x27;s super light and not topheavy like your bathtowels are, plus you can tuck in the tail to the nape of your neck, so it really stays put.  </li>
      <li>Well this is better than an old t-shirt.</li>
      <li>I just tried Re-Pear for the first time, and the product delivers- less frizzy and happy curly hair.</li>
      <li>So for me it makes getting ready easier because it dries my hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what they say.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as bulky as a large towel.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy my Hair RePear Ultimate Hair Towel!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so much lighter than your bath towel</li>
      <li>The material is very soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine Bryant</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cooler in the summer.  </li>
      <li>I am able to stop my hair from being dripping wet while I apply product without frizzing it up.</li>
      <li>Microfiber doesn&#x27;t even come close to being this gentle.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
      <li>It tames my natural curls for shiny straight hair days and also those bouncy curly hair days!</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I live near the beach &amp; the humidity makes it difficult to have good hair days!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and gentle on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a few more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been reading about how your normal bath towels damage your hair for a while.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s expensive, but it feels so nice and so gentle on your hair!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and just after a few uses I could see a difference.</li>
      <li>On this journey everyone said use an old t-shirt instead of a towel.</li>
      <li>I just wrap my hair in the towel for a few minutes and it&#x27;s ready to style and go!!!</li>
      <li>Wash your hair as normal then dry off with the Hair RePear towel, brush and presto all ready to go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big enough that I can tuck it in which prevents it from unwinding until I&#x27;m ready.</li>
      <li>The stitching around the edge to prevent fraying is colorful and adds just a little pep to the fabric.</li>
      <li>I recently stopped chemically straightening my hair and am embracing my naturally 4b/4c texture.</li>
      <li>I use it when my hair is dry too - to keep it dry in the shower, and it&#x27;s compact and thin enough to wrap tightly, yet comfortably and stay on my head -  even when I bend over in the shower (tucks up nicely in the back at my neck).  </li>
      <li>They have long hair and the towel is so gentle on their long hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this towel to wrap my wet hair, even though I don&#x27;t have enough hair to &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is much smoother and showing less signs of breakage since I started using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent my entire life trying to tame 3B curls, mostly because I never really had anyone to show me how.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly large towel, made from very soft and thick t-shirt fabric.</li>

<li> When my hair grew back it was very thin and fine, so when I started using the Hair RePear towel</li>
<li> I have long hair</li>
<li> and I like to wrap it up in the towel and let it air dry for a while before blow drying.</li>
<li> My only issues are: I wish it was a bit more absorbent and a little less expensive.</li>
<li> I cut off a few inches a couple times a year because of it (and I don&#x27;t have split ends, I&#x27;ve been to numerous hairstylists about this).</li>
<li> I only ordered this just a few days ago and just washed my hair this morning and used the towel...</li>
<li> Ok the difference between wrapping your hair in a normal heavy giant towel and wrapping your hair in this towel is really shocking.</li>
<li> My hair comes down to mid-shoulder blade and there is plenty of room for someone with mid-back length hair.</li>
<li> I have wavy hair and it is much less frizzy.  </li>
<li> After years of harsh chemicals, I started fully embracing my curls, doing hair research, and have spent the last 8 years growing out and cutting off the damage.</li>
<li> I asked my hairstylist about it, as he uses terrycloth towels, and he pointed out that he doesn&#x27;t rub my hair with them, or wrap it up very tightly at all.  </li>
<li> And since I have very thin, short hair, I don&#x27;t need or want the bulk.  </li>
<li> I will continue to use it although I am a little disappointed in it.</li>

    <li> Great product. Wash your hair as normal then dry off with the Hair RePear towel, brush and presto all ready to go. Hair dryer no longer needed.</li>
    <li> This towel is amazing. I have fine hair and just after a few uses I could see a difference. Hair was shinier with less fly aways!</li>
    <li> I recently stopped chemically straightening my hair and am embracing my naturally 4b/4c texture. On this journey everyone said use an old t-shirt instead of a towel. Well this is better than an old t-shirt. I am able to stop my hair from being dripping wet while I apply product without frizzing it up. The size of it is great and I don&#x27;t mind keeping it on longer if I need to.</li>
    <li> I love my Hair RePear towel that I have used for 8 months! It tames my natural curls for shiny straight hair days and also those bouncy curly hair days!</li>
    <li> Awesome for my super frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> We love these towels.  I&#x27;ve been through chemotherapy twice, and after losing my hair the second time, I came across this towel.  It&#x27;s soft and gentle on my hair.  I have two teenage daughters that use these towels.  They have long hair and the towel is so gentle on their long hair.</li>
    <li> I love my towel!  Since using it, my hair is softer and healthier.  I have wavy hair and it is much less frizzy.  This is a great product and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my Hair RePear Ultimate Hair Towel! I like knowing I&#x27;m doing something good for my hair instead of using towels that are damaging it. I began searching for a towel to take with me when I travel and found the Hair RePear. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I expected. My only issues are: I wish it was a bit more absorbent and a little less expensive. All in all I really love this towel!</li>
    <li> Been using a t-shirt after using a Turbie Twist to dry my hair but now will use only the Hair RePear! My hair has no frizz after using it - much love to the creator! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent my entire life trying to tame 3B curls, mostly because I never really had anyone to show me how. After years of harsh chemicals, I started fully embracing my curls, doing hair research, and have spent the last 8 years growing out and cutting off the damage. But I find that my ends are always heinous and my fly-aways are from obvious breakage. I cut off a few inches a couple times a year because of it (and I don&#x27;t have split ends, I&#x27;ve been to numerous hairstylists about this). A lot improved by switching shampoos and conditioners and I begrudgingly spend more on a leave-in than an overpriced and complicated Starbucks coffee. But still the problem with the ends. A few months ago I heard a tip about how normal towels actually damage the hair. I only ordered this just a few days ago and just washed my hair this morning and used the towel...my curls look almost as gorgeous as if I took the time to twist and wrap my hair. The ends aren&#x27;t frizzy and coarse and I didn&#x27;t feel any strands pull and break. Such a simple solution. It&#x27;s a fairly large towel, made from very soft and thick t-shirt fabric. My hair comes down to mid-shoulder blade and there is plenty of room for someone with mid-back length hair. The stitching around the edge to prevent fraying is colorful and adds just a little pep to the fabric. I&#x27;ll be buying a few more.</li>
    <li> This product is nice; however, I thought it was going to be more like a soft t-shirt kind of material.  I was under the impression this would absorb the moisture out of my hair better than a towel but it doesn&#x27;t.  I will continue to use it although I am a little disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this towel! It is absorbant, comfortable and cool! I am ordering a second one. Totally recommend</li>
    <li> I love it - I&#x27;ve been reading about how your normal bath towels damage your hair for a while.  I asked my hairstylist about it, as he uses terrycloth towels, and he pointed out that he doesn&#x27;t rub my hair with them, or wrap it up very tightly at all.  Since I like to do both of those things, I decided to try this &amp;#34;towel&amp;#34; out.  It basically feels like a T-shirt but is shaped like a towel.  Bonus:  it&#x27;s so much lighter than your bath towel that when you put it in a turban, it&#x27;s super light and not topheavy like your bathtowels are, plus you can tuck in the tail to the nape of your neck, so it really stays put.  Great, easy little product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Hair Repear towel!!  We are moving and had started packing boxes.  My husband packed away my RePear towel and after 2 days of trying to use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; towel again, I was unpacking boxes to recover my RePear towel!  The RePear towel has made a huge difference for me and has stopped my hair from breaking and falling out so easily.</li>
    <li> Too big. It could make two.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have long hair and I like to wrap it up in the towel and let it air dry for a while before blow drying. It saves a lot of blow drying time and is the perfect size for putting hair up while getting ready. The material is very soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine Bryant</li>
    <li> I just tried Re-Pear for the first time, and the product delivers- less frizzy and happy curly hair. Microfiber doesn&#x27;t even come close to being this gentle.</li>
    <li> Ok the difference between wrapping your hair in a normal heavy giant towel and wrapping your hair in this towel is really shocking. Yeah it&#x27;s expensive, but it feels so nice and so gentle on your hair!</li>
    <li> Love this towel - I have fairly long hair, and this wraps up beautifully. Soft material and definitely helps keep the frizz down.  I use it when my hair is dry too - to keep it dry in the shower, and it&#x27;s compact and thin enough to wrap tightly, yet comfortably and stay on my head -  even when I bend over in the shower (tucks up nicely in the back at my neck).  Dries quickly. Great quality. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair is short.  I just wrap my hair in the towel for a few minutes and it&#x27;s ready to style and go!!! So for me it makes getting ready easier because it dries my hair quickly.  My hair is shinier and smoother.</li>
    <li> Three years ago I lost all my hair to chemotherapy.  When my hair grew back it was very thin and fine, so when I started using the Hair RePear towel I didn&#x27;t expect too much.  To my surprise it worked wonders on my hair!!!  My hair is now fuller and more shiny.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I live near the beach &amp; the humidity makes it difficult to have good hair days!  After using the Hair RePear Towel, I&#x27;m amazed at how manageable my hair is! No Frizz, No FlyAways, Just Shine!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this towel to wrap my wet hair, even though I don&#x27;t have enough hair to &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; it.  It&#x27;s not as bulky as a large towel.  And since I have very thin, short hair, I don&#x27;t need or want the bulk.  It&#x27;s much cooler in the summer.  It&#x27;s big enough that I can tuck it in which prevents it from unwinding until I&#x27;m ready.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best hair towel! I had been looking for a t-shirt towel for awhile and was so pleased to find this one. It does exactly what they say. My hair is much smoother and showing less signs of breakage since I started using it. It is the perfect size and so lightweight. I will be recommending the Hair RePear towel to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it. Best hair related purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Will be giving these as gifts to friends.</li>
