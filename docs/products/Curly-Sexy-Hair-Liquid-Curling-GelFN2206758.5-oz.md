      <li>It drys perfectly and isn&#x27;t heavy.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best product for curly hair and usually pricier.</li>

      <li>It arrived fast and the product was as advertised!!</li>
      <li>went from super curly to nearly straight in some places!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still not as good as some other products in this class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>works well on my very straight hair to set curling brush curls.</li>
      <li>I tried this one, and it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>this is more then enough</li>
      <li>this was a christmas present and my grand daughter loved&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I have currently shaved it all off, this product worked to keep my hair neater than most</li>
      <li>I got compliments the first week I used it.</li>
      <li>if you want soft curl or something more natural then go for the cream!</li>
      <li>I crunch more hair with it when i dont have time to blow dry it.</li>
      <li>Finally something for us folks with tons of fine wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It was much cheaper on amazon than in the hair salons.</li>
      <li>It really helps my curly hair and keep it untangled and from being frizzy.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair and this gel is lightweight, but still defines very well.  </li>
      <li>Worked really well.  </li>
      <li>you want to much info</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>Paid way too much for something that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>It gives my curls a boost of gorgeousness and it also feels natural!!!</li>
      <li>(I would give all other tried products a one or two star).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend sexy curly hair cream over this one (5 star).</li>
      <li>It holds and you do not have to use that much to have a decent hold.</li>
      <li>I split between the cream and the gel, but I feel that this holds the style a little better than the cream.</li>
      <li>It left my hair soft &amp; flexible &amp; it&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
      <li>As a male with curly hair, it has been a trial to look professional with longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need hairspray or any other products to complete my look!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a major change in hair texture over the last year...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down like regular gel unless you use too much.  </li>

    <li> I have curly hair but when it doesn&#x27;t get enough moisture- the curls aren&#x27;t defined and they flatten. I have tried numerous products which always disappointed me. This product is awesome, actually works and is worth the price. I get a lot of compliments on my hair which I attribute to this product.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product.  Didn&#x27;t hold my curls at all.  I don&#x27;t think this stuff smells good either!  Paid way too much for something that didn&#x27;t work.  I can get my cheap stuff at Walmart and keep my curls way better than this stuff!</li>

    <li> It works fine... but it&#x27;s still not as good as some other products in this class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that fact that it&#x27;s a gel pump vs a spray/mouse.</li>
    <li> this was a christmas present and my grand daughter loved&lt;br /&gt;and you want to much info this is more then enough</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Finally something for us folks with tons of fine wavy hair.  Add a diffuser with this product and boom.  Instant big fluffy defined wavy hair.  I am in love.  Flat irons and limp, Marcia Brady hair....I DONT THINK SO!!</li>
    <li> It arrived fast and the product was as advertised!! It&#x27;s the best product for curly hair and usually pricier. I was happy to see that it was on sale so I got 3 bottles!</li>
    <li> I love my curly hair and this liquid gel works best in it!  It drys perfectly and isn&#x27;t heavy.  Helps with my fizzy days too!  It&#x27;s a liquid gel so it distributes well through my curls without having to run my fingers through my hair and mess up the curl.</li>
    <li> The product is sticky and difficult to use. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> only product that works well with my mixed thick hair</li>
