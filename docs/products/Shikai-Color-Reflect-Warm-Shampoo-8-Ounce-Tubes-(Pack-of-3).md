### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Shikai is my ideal hair product system.  </li>
      <li>Good ingredients and a great shampoo!</li>
      <li>Nice smell, cleans well and looks great!</li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is a bit drying, so you need to use a good conditioner after washing.  </li>
      <li>Even my hairdresser has commented on how nice my hair is and how I must be using a good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, nice lather, nice fruity scent, and it doesn&#x27;t seem drying or stripping.</li>
      <li>It does bring them out a bit, which is nice.</li>
      <li>So far I have tried 2 types of Shikai Shampoo and conditioner and they have been wonderful.</li>
      <li>Soooo glad I gave ShiKai&#x27;s warm shampoo</li>
      <li>This shampoo seems OK  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more coppery, which was my goal.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have been using this and color reflect gold for years and love both products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Notes: I make sure to distribute it evenly throughout my hair</li>
      <li>Love this with my color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I love Shikai as they are cruelty-free.  </li>
      <li>but it also doesn&#x27;t make it super nice.    </li>
      <li>I think you will enjoy  :  )</li>
      <li>I have fine, medium length hair,</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything amazing for my natural highlights, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to magically have bright red highlights or anything.</li>
      <li>Great for color-treated and dry hair.</li>
      <li>but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural and leaves my hair feeling amazing.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>However, this shampoo is great for removing buildup from other shampoos and rinses out incredibly clean.</li>
      <li>love this shampoo, as a natural (fading) redhead; this is the best product to restore your hair to its previous glory!!!</li>
      <li>For the price, it is worth trying</li>
      <li>This is a pretty nice shampoo but after going through 2 bottles, it hasn&#x27;t brought out any of my red highlights.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo consistently for a couple of months, and my lengthy, wavy hair really does appear healthier and more vibrant thanks to the lack of sulfates and color enhancing henna.  </li>
      <li>I ordered it as a subscribe and save subscription, but canceled my subscription after the first batch.  </li>
      <li>I just wish it was a tad more moisturizing for my coarse naturally-curly hair.</li>
      <li>I love that this shampoo brings out the red in my color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I was a little nervous about switching from a \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; shampoo to a natural shampoo with henna, but had heard of the great properties of henna.</li>
      <li>I have been dying my hair various shades of red for years, and this is hands down the best affordable color-protecting shampoo I&#x27;ve EVER used.  </li>
      <li>Especially during the summer months this was nice as my hair used to tend to get a bit washed out / more blonde from sunshine and this helped maintain a little more red.</li>
      <li>Really brings out the highlights.</li>
      <li>but this did nothing for my color and it is very drying.</li>
      <li>I think that if your hair is dyed, it will work really well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and have always loved the red tendency of my hair</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and tangle free and imparts just the right amount of color to maintain the red.  </li>
      <li>I recently started trying other products, even ones recommended by my hair dresser, but none of them are as good as Shikai for cleanness, color extension, or body.</li>
      <li>so it really accentuates natural reddish hair very nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this a few weeks ago, and overall I found it to be a very nice non-irritating shampoo that was cleansing but slightly moisturizing as well for my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly, highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>Makes your hair shiny and feel silky, with no frizzy, flay-away hair, which are the reasons I pay far too much money on this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This, on the other hand, is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Its nice to see products for redheads, as there are very few on the market!  </li>
      <li>The result is very natural, though people have asked me what I have been doing to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Using this product I&#x27;m still a strawberry blonde (versus true red) but that is what I was hoping for - something that would enhance my natural look and not be drastic.</li>
      <li>natural looking tones and shine, tons of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really brings out the red undertones in my hair, but without the brassiness of dyes.  </li>
      <li>your color and b) make your hair silky soft.</li>
      <li>It does allow natural variance in tones (highlights / darker hairs)</li>
      <li>I believe it is specifically formulated for color treated hair, rather than natural.  </li>
      <li>I cannot attest to what effects this product would have on someone with dyed red hair, but I HIGHLY recommend for natural redheads and strawberry blondes!</li>
      <li>I get nice subtle red highlights.</li>
      <li>I consider myself a light brunette and with consistent use I&#x27;ve found it has made a subtle but visible difference in the overall shimmer of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it consistently for 5 years, never once switching to any other shampoos because of buildup or residues.</li>
      <li>I have natural red hair and this product did not boost my color at all.</li>
      <li>I have chronic Lyme disease and have slowly had to switch over to more and more natural products as chemicals tend to cause bad reactions.</li>

<li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble finding something that will a)enhance</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find a good color enhancing shampoo and the last one that I tried (an expensive natural brand), came out like mud and clumped on my hair while I was trying to wash it...</li>
<li> I am guessing that the level of henna in it is highly minimal and just really enough to give you some of the other benefits of henna, such as its strengthening and anti-inflammatory  properties.</li>
<li> slightly dry.  </li>
<li> Again, I wouldn&#x27;t expect a transformation, and it does take a little time to work, but if you are a light/medium brunette with some natural highlights who doesn&#x27;t want an extreme change, this may well be what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br</li>
<li> - this added just a slight extra depth of red color, but subtle enough to blend with my natural color and not look dyed or fake.</li>
<li> Feels like it weighs my hair down and makes it straw</li>
<li> Not even slightly.</li>
<li> Just a little boost.</li>
<li> Not even a little.</li>
<li> It is a little drying though</li>
<li> and I let it sit for a few minutes.  </li>
<li> imagine trying to wash your hair with dried mud</li>
<li> Just not worth it--for me at least.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t really notice it enhancing my hair color in anyway, but that wasn&#x27;t my intention in purchasing the product, so I am not too disappointed.</li>
<li> No more searching!  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair terrible</li>

    <li> love this shampoo, as a natural (fading) redhead; this is the best product to restore your hair to its previous glory!!! natural looking tones and shine, tons of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!  It makes my hair so soft and tangle free and imparts just the right amount of color to maintain the red.  It&#x27;s so difficult to find a good color enhancing shampoo and the last one that I tried (an expensive natural brand), came out like mud and clumped on my hair while I was trying to wash it...imagine trying to wash your hair with dried mud and you&#x27;ll get the picture.  This, on the other hand, is fantastic.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble finding something that will a)enhance your color and b) make your hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and color reflect gold for years and love both products.  Good ingredients and a great shampoo!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo. I have been using it consistently for 5 years, never once switching to any other shampoos because of buildup or residues. It&#x27;s natural and leaves my hair feeling amazing. For those who have mentioned issues with the color enhancement; what I do is shampoo and leave the shampoo on my hair while I shower, rinsing my hair at the end of my shower. I get nice subtle red highlights. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost a year and I love it.  I have fine, medium length hair, slightly dry.  This shampoo really brings out the red undertones in my hair, but without the brassiness of dyes.  The result is very natural, though people have asked me what I have been doing to my hair.  This shampoo is a bit drying, so you need to use a good conditioner after washing.  I get this through the Subscribe and Save progam, so I never run out and I get a discount to boot!</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems OK  but nothing special.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t make it super nice.    It didn&#x27;t seem to fade my color, nor extend it.    For the price, it is worth trying I guess.  I ordered it as a subscribe and save subscription, but canceled my subscription after the first batch.  Just not worth it--for me at least.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It smells amazing and makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable. It doesn&#x27;t do anything amazing for my natural highlights, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair to magically have bright red highlights or anything. It does bring them out a bit, which is nice. Just a little boost. I think that if your hair is dyed, it will work really well. I will definitely buy this again, and I think it has probably earned itself a permanent place in my hair care routine!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shiny and feel silky, with no frizzy, flay-away hair, which are the reasons I pay far too much money on this shampoo.  Great for color-treated and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love this with my color treated hair.  Really brings out the highlights.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice shampoo but after going through 2 bottles, it hasn&#x27;t brought out any of my red highlights. I actually had someone ask me if I dyed my hair a darker shade of brown. However, this shampoo is great for removing buildup from other shampoos and rinses out incredibly clean. It is a little drying though so I definitely would recommend using a leave in conditioner if you use this.</li>
    <li> Shikai is my ideal hair product system.  No more searching!  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo consistently for a couple of months, and my lengthy, wavy hair really does appear healthier and more vibrant thanks to the lack of sulfates and color enhancing henna.  I consider myself a light brunette and with consistent use I&#x27;ve found it has made a subtle but visible difference in the overall shimmer of my hair.  It&#x27;s more coppery, which was my goal.  I cannot attest to the results on those with darker hair.  Again, I wouldn&#x27;t expect a transformation, and it does take a little time to work, but if you are a light/medium brunette with some natural highlights who doesn&#x27;t want an extreme change, this may well be what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: I make sure to distribute it evenly throughout my hair and I let it sit for a few minutes.  I also use the conditioner and occasionally use a sulfate-containing shampoo to clarify, but the majority of the time the Shikai products are sufficient.</li>
    <li> So far I have tried 2 types of Shikai Shampoo and conditioner and they have been wonderful. I highly, highly recommend this product and I just ordered their face and body products to try out next.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few weeks ago, and overall I found it to be a very nice non-irritating shampoo that was cleansing but slightly moisturizing as well for my fine hair.  Its nice to see products for redheads, as there are very few on the market!  I didn&#x27;t really notice it enhancing my hair color in anyway, but that wasn&#x27;t my intention in purchasing the product, so I am not too disappointed. I am guessing that the level of henna in it is highly minimal and just really enough to give you some of the other benefits of henna, such as its strengthening and anti-inflammatory  properties. Overall, I would definitely recommend to other natural redheads or those using hair dye. I think you will enjoy  :  )</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, nice lather, nice fruity scent, and it doesn&#x27;t seem drying or stripping. However, I noticed no color difference my light-brown hair. Not even slightly. I like Shikai products, but this did not performed as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am puzzled by the unfavorable reviews for this product.  I have been dying my hair various shades of red for years, and this is hands down the best affordable color-protecting shampoo I&#x27;ve EVER used.  I believe it is specifically formulated for color treated hair, rather than natural.  I recently started trying other products, even ones recommended by my hair dresser, but none of them are as good as Shikai for cleanness, color extension, or body. I am switching back and sticking with this one!</li>
    <li> I have natural red hair and this product did not boost my color at all. I am 38 and the color has dulled over the years. I am still not gray so I don&#x27;t want to color but this did nothing for my color and it is very drying.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about switching from a \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; shampoo to a natural shampoo with henna, but had heard of the great properties of henna. I have chronic Lyme disease and have slowly had to switch over to more and more natural products as chemicals tend to cause bad reactions. Soooo glad I gave ShiKai&#x27;s warm shampoo a try earlier this year! Nice smell, cleans well and looks great! The skin on my neck was constantly irritated (eczema-like) and went away within days of switching to ShiKai. Even my hairdresser has commented on how nice my hair is and how I must be using a good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and have always loved the red tendency of my hair - this added just a slight extra depth of red color, but subtle enough to blend with my natural color and not look dyed or fake. Using this product I&#x27;m still a strawberry blonde (versus true red) but that is what I was hoping for - something that would enhance my natural look and not be drastic. Especially during the summer months this was nice as my hair used to tend to get a bit washed out / more blonde from sunshine and this helped maintain a little more red. It does allow natural variance in tones (highlights / darker hairs) so it really accentuates natural reddish hair very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have never dyed my hair I cannot attest to what effects this product would have on someone with dyed red hair, but I HIGHLY recommend for natural redheads and strawberry blondes!</li>
    <li> I love Shikai as they are cruelty-free.  I love that this shampoo brings out the red in my color-treated hair.  I just wish it was a tad more moisturizing for my coarse naturally-curly hair.</li>
    <li> Feels like it weighs my hair down and makes it straw like. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair color. Not even a little.</li>
