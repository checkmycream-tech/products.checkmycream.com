<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very convenient and I love it!</li>
    <li> I think I have been treated unfairly. I ordered what I saw for price posted. I made no mistakes you did. I am very upset. I never had anyone to do what you did to me. Upset is an understatement. Goodbye !!!!!</li>
    <li> nice to have backups with the 4 pack but they were all packaged together so a lot of &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; when the pack itself was opened.</li>
    <li> I am trying to heal my feet and get them smooth and soft. With this pumice stone I can see my feet are getting smoother. This stone is the best I have ever used it is gentle but gets the rough skin. I use this every day and the health of my feet are getting better.</li>
    <li> I found that it didn&#x27;t really work on my callouses nor my excess skin.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product at a great price. The little hanger/rope makes it great for the shower and storage. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This set of pumice stones is a great value. First, they work. Second, there&#x27;s four of them. Each one will last a long time. So, collectively, they&#x27;ll give you fine-feeling feet forever. OK, maybe not exactly forever, but for a long time for such a low price. What more could one ask for? Oh, and fast ship, too!</li>
    <li> This product is a steal at the price it is being sold at. I paid less than $5 for a pack of 4 pumice stones. It works very very well at removing callouses and I keep one in my shower to exfoliating purposes.</li>
    <li> This little stones work as intended. I&#x27;m currently using these to remove the calluses on the palms of my hands and the rough dead skin on my feet. It works but you need to put some muscle into it. I&#x27;ve been using them while showering and in the morning at least every two days. My hands feel softer after the second day. Mind you that you should apply lotion to the area you are scrubbing off to make the skin softer.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do... gets rid of dead skin!!</li>
    <li> This is not effective!  Choose another one if you would like to actually exfoliate...</li>
    <li> Great value for a 4 pack of good quality pumice stones! They work great. They&#x27;re a good size, fitting easily in your hand without being too small. I like the straight \\&quot;brick\\&quot; ones, since you can use all the surfaces. My last one was \\&quot;ergonomic,\\&quot; which means it was curved. So the inside curve was virtually useless and so were the sides. You&#x27;ll get more use out of a straight one like this. The 4 pack will last you a year.</li>
    <li> The 4 pack is great.  I have enough for the year.  Fairly smooth but does the job amazingly.  Complete change on my feet and it dries quickly.  Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good value, because the four stones you get are of pretty decent size. The only thing that I would note is that when you first open them up and use them, they&#x27;re pretty crumbly. This gets better though with use.</li>
    <li> Great price - works well in the shower.  Four will probably last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a pumice stone, you&#x27;ve found it and cheap! i dont really know what i&#x27;ll do with 4 of them but it was the same price as buying 1</li>
    <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Works great - good quality - lasts forever!</li>
    <li> My feet were crusty..These stones helped take care of it. Gets the job done for a very low price. It comes in a pack of four and each stone lasts for months.</li>
    <li> I love these pumice stones! Very cheap and get the job done! Buy a 4-pack and share with your friends and loved ones, they&#x27;ll thank you for it!</li>
    <li> Great deal and it is a four pack. You must buy!</li>
    <li> Calluses have plagued me for many years.  I have always associated calluses with hard work and felt a sense of pride about these collections of dead skin.  I know that my  body produces calluses to protect vulnerable areas, such as on fingers.  What I did not know was that there is a danger to ignoring calluses.  Over time a callus can grow large, develop cracks when dry and under pressure, then crack and be subject to infection.&lt;br /&gt;So, I asked my podiatrist what I could do to keep calluses under control.  She suggested that I get a cosmetic file or a pumice stone and file them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the AquaBella Pumice Stone from Amazon and am learning about pumice and its uses.  Pumice is volcanic rock that is created when lava and water are mixed.  I knew that pumice is used to make lightweight concrete and that it is a major ingredient in laundry soaps and toothpaste.  I was not aware that pumice is used as an exfoliant  to help remove dead or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AquaBella Pumice Stone works very well.  I have been rubbing the stone over my calluses when I shower.  The wet callus reacts with the pumice and flows down he drain.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who wishes to control calluses.&lt;br /&gt;It is working well for me.</li>
    <li> Love my pumice stones, these work excellent with a great foot scrub. I had some issues with dry skin on my feet and callouses, but using this product daily makes the difference.</li>
    <li> Pumice stones were purchased for use by myself and my wife. I expected a lower quality product, but was pleased with how sturdy these pumice stones are. They exfoliate extremely well without being too rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> These get the job done and they are great for the price. They work just fine for me and I would probably purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Does its job. Paired with sugar scrub and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> These did not work. Too smooth, just slid on my skin...could not pumice anything with these.</li>
    <li> The lady who does my pedicures always noted how rough my feet got in-between pedicures. She suggested I merely gently and briefly rub a pumice stone on my heels each time i shower. This has done the trick!  My feet are still super soft even a month after my last pedicure.  I like that this one has a string from which to hang in the shower.</li>
    <li> Packaging could be better.  Lost 5 to breakage out the box.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. An excellent value. All four of the pumice stones were completely intact and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> These work great on my feet. They come individually wrapped in clear plastic and are a nice size to hold.</li>
    <li> I always buy soft pumice stone but decided to give this a try.  I soak my feet in Epsom salt, lather my feet with Dove and then use the stone.  It works on the heels of my feet but stone is so hard that it actually scratch and cut my toes.  Keep the stone away from your toes!!!</li>
    <li> This pumice stone four-pack is an incredible value. I use the pumice stone during my shower and it really removes dead skins and rough spots for just about anywhere. It&#x27;s a very high quality block of pumice, I&#x27;ve seen and used imitations and over time they rot and quickly become dull. This lasts quite a few weeks, of course depending on usage. It also has a convenient string, perfect for storage and to secure it to your wrist to avoid letting it slip and crack. I use the string to let it hang in my bathroom fixture to air dry.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Half way expected it to crumble after a few uses but it holds up well and does not hurt.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone.  Not much to say other than it works.  There is nothing magical about it.  If you want to get rid of the dead skin, this does it well.  Like the price and size.</li>
    <li> After using them my feet are so soft, even my husband use them and they work perfect! We loved it! &#x3D;0)</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing out calluses that have been building on up my hands since I started power lifting at the gym. I give them a quick brush down after a session and my skin has been getting back to its normal soft state over the past couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this purchase.  It is what I expected, came quickly, works like it should, and I think I paid a fair price.</li>
    <li> I am no  dermatologist but these work well on my feet, which seem to accumulate more dead skin than I&#x27;d like. They also seem more durable than previous stones I have had, but that&#x27;s based more soft opinion than hard evidence.  recommended.  The attached  rope also makes handling more convenient.</li>
    <li> Began using it, but it seemed that it was not effecient, I expend much more energy than I would scrape off in skin so it was a short life experience.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates and not too roughly. Like to use it when I run my hands around any not so smooth areas and then exfoliate and apply lotion afterwards. Can&#x27;t really say anything bad about something so simply used. Good price too.</li>
    <li> First of all,it is rectangular not the photo.I like the actual shape  and it works well in the shower.Yes I would buy again</li>
    <li> When I bought this set of pumice stones, I was torn between a pumice stone and a \\&quot;ped-egg\\&quot;. Eventually I made the decision to go with the pumice stone, and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. I like to think of myself as a well groomed man and while I enjoy the blue collar/hard working feeling of having calluses on my hands and feet, I enjoy the reaction that my deceptively soft hands and beautiful feet garner much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this pumice stone on a less than regular basis, waiting for a callus to become more a nuisance before I finally decide to take the stone to it. The stone works well, especially at the end of a shower. It can shave the biggest of calluses down in one scrub. As I expected some calluses would be harder to get rid of then others, but on some occasions I&#x27;ve really had to scrub nearly as hard as I could for the pumice stone to start taking effect. Which can be scary at times as putting that sort of strength into grinding ones open flesh with a rock can be more than a little unsettling. However, when the stone does slip to non callused skin I have experienced no damage or pain regardless of how hard I am scraping.  This could be easily avoidable if the pumice stone is used on a regular basis (which I would probably say is a better idea than the way I choose to do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con to the set of pumice stones is the fragility of the stones. I keep mine on the side of my tub in an effort to use them more often. But a slip from the edge of the tub broke the stone in two. A pro to the con could be that now I have an extra stone and more scrubbing are. 5 for 4!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so inexpensive but it serves its purpose! The quality is good and it is very lightweight. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I found this pumice stone ineffective at callus removal. If that&#x27;s a reason for purchasing it, then look at something else.</li>
    <li> Stones were inexpensive and do the job.  But the tend to disintegrate and create debris in the shower, which isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Nice size for handling&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with 4 separately wrapped stones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- I got LOTS of dust from the stone on my feet and in the basin I was scrubbing over&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t notice hardly any difference in the rough skin on my heals... makes me wonder if it was working at all&lt;br /&gt;- There were a few rough edges around the outside of the stone, but the stone seemed mostly smooth, which I thought might lead to it being less effective</li>
    <li> I really liked these. They were very affordable, and I am glad I bought them. I have had a bad case of athlete&#x27;s foot that I could not get rid of with the normal sprays and powders, but within a couple days of using one of these pumice stones in the shower, I was good to go.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for an unusual and specific purpose. My can of shaving cream left multiple rust rings on our porcelain counter. This did the trick! You&#x27;ll receive four large pumice stones, all of good quality.</li>
    <li> These work great and last quite awhile.  This is also a great price for 4 stones!  I would probably pay this amount for one at the store.</li>
    <li> This was perfect - I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this at any drugstore or department store that wasn&#x27;t coarse enough or was geared toward women.  I get rough heel skin in the winter and I hit my feet with these one time in the shower and haven&#x27;t had an issue since.  As a four-pack, these should last me for many years.</li>
    <li> It does not sand anything on my calluses. I gave it to my mom but she said the same thing I said</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning that brown stuff off of the bottom of the toilet bowl. LOL I like that it comes 4 in a pack.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for another purpose than to reduce callouses &amp; slough skin. So for my purpose they work fine. The ones I got were rectangular and not paddle shaped but that does not interfere with what I&#x27;m using them for a bit. They are a nice stone for my purposes.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It comes in a pack of 4. The stones are very durable and do their job. I read another review, stating that the stones crumbled upon arrival..please keep in mind, that these stones are shipped and there is always a possibility that the packages could be mishandled. Since I&#x27;ve had the stones, they have been durable.</li>
    <li> I had these huge callouses on my feet, so I did was any American would do...purchased these bad ass Aquasential pumice stones! Now I can go into the shower, scrub my feet, and walk around with confidence knowing my big ugly yellow callouses won&#x27;t be inflicting pain and suffering on the masses.</li>
    <li> The picture has changed since I bought these - the ones I got were rectangular. They work just fine and I have plenty to last me a while. One or two might be cracked on arrival but you&#x27;re just rubbing them on your feet, a small piece works as well as a big one.</li>
    <li> They work great and can&#x27;t beat the price! They&#x27;re exactly like the pumice stones my parents used to buy in the 80s in Europe!</li>
    <li> The product seems to be of good quality and size. However the surface is so smooth it does not remove heel calluses very well. Also the stone is too hard. It doesn&#x27;t seem to wear down at all. I plan on taking a grinder to it or sandpaper to see if I can roughen it up a bit. At this pace I will never wear out 1, let alone 3. If you are looking for a stone to smooth out your calluses but not to remove them this product might be fine for that.</li>
    <li> These worked pretty well.  They are an oval shape rather than a rectangle as pictured.  That doesn&#x27;t really affect the usefullness of them.  They&#x27;re cheap and seem to work well enough.</li>
    <li> Just a regular pumice stone, same thing I can buy at the 99 cent store. If you want something gentle and mild for exfoliating your feet, this is the product for you. I wont recommend it for feet that need heavy exfoliation</li>
    <li> Helps keep my feet clean and dead skin free. I had slight athelets foot but cleaning it a LOT, using over the counter medicine and this foot scrub cleared my foot right up. It no longer itches and the dead skin is gone.</li>
    <li> These are your basic pumice stones for a great price. Buy this and you likely wont need to buy another pumice stone for several years. Also nice you want to buy for multiple people in the home or if you want to include in a self made spa gift or something. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchase this set a while back and have to say, these things last forever! I&#x27;m still only on my second stone, so for the cost these are worth the price.</li>
    <li> the only reason that I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because it wasn&#x27;t true to the photo.  The stones that I received were plain square blocks.  I would have preferred the ones pictured only because it&#x27;s a more comfortable fit in my hand.  Otherwise, they serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> Great for my callouses!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price per unit of these pumice stones.  While they&#x27;re not bad, they never felt quite right.  My skin still feels a tad rough after using them.  But at the same time, it seemed difficult to really dig down on the tougher calluses.  I&#x27;ve had vastly better luck with the Pedx stone.  It&#x27;s been worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> This is just as effective as pretty much any other brand.. there isn&#x27;t much special out there and for the price paid you can&#x27;t really find better... I dropped one and it chipped on my shower tiled floor.. HOWEVER I consider this a plus because any other brand I have tried smashes to smithereens once it hits the floor.</li>
    <li> Nobody wants hard feet.  This stone effectively files down any dead matter.  It&#x27;s a great price too.  They seem to be made well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s somewhat rare stone. 4 pack for $5 bucks including shipping pretty good deal. Dirt will be gone from the area that is applied. Make sure not to hurt yourself by pushing too hard.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for christmas gift but they were found early by my girlfriend. She has already started using them and absolutely loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for a small gift or as stocking fodder at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems well made, the stone is very soft so it puts off  lot of grit as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a simple plastic wrap, 2x2 layout of the stones. So you will want to take them out to be more presentable.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something very rough. This is not rough enough for me . I thought it would be a harder material . I have a stone here at home that seems to be made of harder material . It has had some use . I was wishing to replace it  with a similar product . That  was not the case .</li>
    <li> This product is great when used with a sugar scrub; when used alone, it does not seem to do too much.</li>
    <li> I had bought this from a store called Tokyo because on Amazon I was required to purchase up to $25-35 before I can get this product. It came individually wrapped and cost me about $3 but it seemed like an ok price. I tried it the night I got it in the shower and it totally worked!!! I had some pretty bad calluses on my heels. They were very rough and whenever they were dry, it would have black stuff stuck to the dry skin. When I started rubbing them with the pumice stone, some white stuff came off and I had thought they were from the stone itself but afterwards I realized it was the dead skin that had come off. I began by soaking my feet in some hot water, dipped the stone in it to get it a little wet then started rubbing. Soon after about a minute or 2 I saw the black stuff slowly disappearing and when I rubbed my heels with my fingers it felt a lot softer. I continued for another minute or so and when there weren&#x27;t anymore black stuff, I decided to stop. If you rub too much it can cause your skin to be damaged because it may even break the healthy skin. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> They disintegrate extremely fast. I guess that&#x27;s why it comes in a 4 pack.</li>
    <li> Love these!! They work great and were a great price!</li>
    <li> Doing a happy dance. I&#x27;ve tried so many chemicals to remove rust and hard water stains on the sink and toilet porcelin. Read to try a pumice stone so purchased this 4-pack. Voila! With a little elbow grease the stains are gone.  500 stars!</li>
    <li> These pumice stones fit easily in the palm of your hand. They do the job and they don&#x27;t break, as was my experience with other stones. It&#x27;s been about 2 months I&#x27;m still on my first one. I am very willing to buy this again and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> One star because that&#x27;s how many of the stones were intact when I opened the package</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like these at all. Got some heel cream instead, so I have no use for these now.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some thing a little more agressive. If your a girl Bla bla bla.&lt;br /&gt;If you work for a living and get caluses you will not be happy</li>
    <li> Great price, good quantity (4) and it does the job. It&#x27;s not ergonomic or in some fancy shape, just a block, but that&#x27;s really all you need. Scrub gently, you don&#x27;t need to apply much pressure. Works well. Overall pleased and would recommend this if you want something simple for exfoliating/cleaning, especially feet and heels.</li>
    <li> This pseudo pummice stone is way too hard on your skin to do much to smooth callouses. It needs to be soften so that its abrasive action is not painful.</li>
    <li> No complaints. It does what it says. isn&#x27;t too rough but just enough to smooth off skin. Works great dry or in water.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of these a long time ago, and I&#x27;m still using the first one. They&#x27;re pretty durable and seem to do the job just fine. I love how you can hang it up in the bathroom... I have a suction hook that I use to hang it up on.</li>
    <li> It is what it is i think... a cheep item but you ger what you pay for and it does what it is intended to.</li>
    <li> This really helped. My feet are getting smoother and smoother each time i use it. Its obviously not going to happen quickly but tue results tend to be shown on the spot.</li>
    <li> This pumice stone works very well at smoothing the callus on your heels.  I used it after the Microplane Foot File XL Pro Natural, and it smoothed my heels after removing most of the callus with the foot file.</li>
    <li> works great to great dead skin off</li>
    <li> Not same shape as advertised and first one I opened was broke in half.</li>
    <li> These things are such a great value. For some reason I&#x27;m obsessed with soft feet, hate calluses, so these things are great. I leave them in my shower and use them almost daily. I&#x27;m on my second one now and the only reason I had to throw out the first was because I went away for two weeks and didn&#x27;t realize I left it in a puddle on my shower shelf and it molded. On it&#x27;s own these things will last months each and you get four of them.</li>
    <li> Like many of us, I have used many foot care products over the years. I do prefer in shower tools, and also prefer to keep my feet in good condition rather than repair damage. Aquasentials Pumice are the perfect density for this purpose. I waited to write this review in order to be able to give my opinion after using the pumice first.&lt;br /&gt;I soap the pumice and spend a few minutes carefully scrubbing my heels, and calloused big toe. I am so pleased that these areas always feel smooth, never in need of anything but my regular lotion. I live in the mountains and love to go barefoot! My feet are not filthy but they really do look great after I scrub with this pumice.&lt;br /&gt;The batch that I received will last a very long time. I am thinking that for the price, these Pumice Stones with a few other lovely bath products will make great gift baskets!</li>
    <li> Not durable, broke almost immediately. Bad purchase</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. I was expecting something a little smaller due to the comments of some  of the other reviewers, but the product was the perfect size and works beautifully. I will definitely recommend the product, though given the durability and number in the package, I doubt  that  you will need to get these often.</li>
    <li> Cons: maybe a bit large for the smaller lady&#x27;s hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: so great, this is the real thing, nice large surface area and not being round helps keep the focus, nice loop for hanging outside of the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet apparently need work, I have owned this thing for a few weeks and only used it about 3 times for like 20 mins each. The corner crumbled a bit when I applied it to the top of my nail. You get 4 of them. In a two person household this means the extras go in the back of the closet for some many years from now. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissatisfied. Buy this product now.</li>
    <li> I actually use these to clean the hard water stains in my toilet bowl. Cleansers just don&#x27;t cut it with the hard rural water where I live. These pumice stones are a really handy shape that lets me clean without my hand cramping so fast. They don&#x27;t crumble after the first use like some I&#x27;ve purchased before from other stores and they&#x27;re a great price. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, better price ever, it makes my feet  very soft and only once week is enough for my feet be very soft!</li>
    <li> Does the job, smooth toes and heels now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work complete magic as I had hoped, but at least my heels no longer catch on the sheets. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Decided to try again as it is used in the shower AFTER my feet I water softened. Last product I used was to be used on dry feet wich took to much skin off. Soap feet and Pumice Stone use gently and my feet were callous free after third use. Too much Too fast and feet will burn.....</li>
    <li> I have rarely used pumice stones, but i got these anyway. They were cheap, came in large quantities, and was very useful.</li>
    <li> These are not high quality pumice stones. I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> love these!! they&#x27;re real pumice stones, and such a great price for 4 of them!!!</li>
    <li> These are great little pumice stones.  Just the right size for hanging in the shower.  Each one is wrapped in plastic, so they won&#x27;t crumble all over where you store them.  Great value too!</li>
    <li> not as good as the description</li>
    <li> these work so much better than a pumice on those handled options.  You realize how cheap those are and that this method is a far superior option</li>
    <li> Great deal and product. Works well.</li>
    <li> good product for the price</li>
    <li> Pumice Stones are always on my shopping list. I covered my back with this order. I just love them. Thank-you</li>
    <li> it was very cool seeing immediate results with this pumice stone. works especially well to clear any clogged pores and reduces the appearance of inflammation.</li>
    <li> This pumice performs as described and as expected. It is smooth enough that it is not irritating to use, yet it effectively works to remove calluses.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat four of these for the price they are offered at. They are great for your feet and should last almost forever even if used regularly. The rope they put in the corner is pointless but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the product. Great value!</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Great price</li>
    <li> I have very dry feet with lots of callous and I&#x27;d just like to say that the pumice stone is still better than the bar. I use it every day and it lasts very long.</li>
    <li> These are pumice stones.  Not sure what else there is to say.  They were stones and they were pumice.  The little rope thing was not needed but whatever.</li>
    <li> I think it works ok.  I haven&#x27;t ever had another kind so I can&#x27;t compare very well but I think these work well.  The four pack will last me about 20 years so I should be good to go!</li>
    <li> Bought this randomly at a store cuz it was cheap and i needed something to smooth out my feet. It&#x27;s the only foot smoother thing I&#x27;ve kept for as long as i&#x27;ve kept this one. I could not ask anything more from it, exfoliates perfectly, the large size is perfect to hold, not too rough and not too soft/smooth and the handle is a must for me, which i didn&#x27;t know until i owned one.  I&#x27;ve used the same 1 for years. Easy to disenfect with boiling water.</li>
    <li> One side of stone has a large sticker glued to it and it won&#x27;t come off without leaving a large area of residue.  I tried soaking it off, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I guess not the highest-quality pumice stones, but you get 4 of them and they work just fine. Very affordable.</li>
    <li> Works great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Good value.  One for the feet, one for the toilet bowel and 2 in reserve.  Nothing removes a calcium ring in your toilet bowel like a pumice stone.  Gets the job done easily without scratching the bowel.  Does a good job on my feet too.</li>
    <li> Getting rid of those calluses really makes a difference in your foots appearance. On my way to have the pretty feet I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
    <li> BEST pumice stones, no kidding. Recommend 100%</li>
    <li> It works OK, but I would like something that has a more corse surface to eliminate hard skin on feet.</li>
    <li> The pumice stones work as they&#x27;re supposed to. My feet feel much less scaly than they normally do in the winter.</li>
    <li> This pumice stone is completely ineffective on the soles of adult feet..  Should have paid a little more and bought a better product.</li>
    <li> Great pumice stone. I use it all over my body too. Great for getting rid of the dead skin.</li>
    <li> A 4-pack for a little over 5 bucks? Perfect. I used one of these stones about every 2 days on my feet. They work well, easy to hold and scrub. Not much else to say... Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a persistent rough spot on my foot.  When this stone arrived, the directions alluded to using it in the shower as an exfoliator. I ended up trying it for both purposes and can say it worked fine. Not painful at all in the shower and eliminated a rough spot on my foot which I am sure will come back but now I have something to get rid of it painlessly.</li>
    <li> a little hard to hold but works as expected</li>
    <li> Best one I have found!!!</li>
    <li> while it was smaller than anticipated, it still worked. but i had to hold it differently than my previous, larger one.</li>
    <li> What can I say if it doesn&#x27;t fall apart in your hands its just fine. They are inexpensive and do the job.</li>
    <li> I like the size of these pumice stones and that they come four in a pack, that way everyone in the home have their own, and you have a while until you need to reorder! Another gem I found out is that I can use these pumice stones to remove pills and lint from clothing. I know it sounds crazy but it works way better than the sweater stone. It doesn&#x27;t smell like sulphur, it doesn&#x27;t stain, crumble or break apart and most of all it&#x27;s much more economical to own than that sweater stone!</li>
    <li> It removes the dirt on the skin as well as hair.My hands and feet look better .I have learnt to rub gently as otherwise sensitive skin starts burning.</li>
    <li> Great product for a really great price. What more can you ask for? Amazon does it again, Go for it!</li>
    <li> Works well but a little rough and would prefer something a little less hard, but will do for now..thank you</li>
    <li> Product came as described and works just as expected. I like the fact that it comes with a rope so you can hang it to dry to prevent mildew from growing in the pores.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know how hard it is to screw up a pumice stone? but they didn&#x27;t. the things work great. they even come with directions! i liked that a lot!</li>
    <li> Good at getting the dead skin off of my feet, and getting 4 for the same price as 1 of a fancier brand is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Immediate results!  These work great and I&#x27;m very pleased to say that my foot is much smoother!  4 pack is really a good bargain!</li>
    <li> Pumice stones are exactly what I needed and do an excellent job.  Thank you for the efficient manner in which this order was handled.</li>
    <li> Too soft for what I had intended to use it on.</li>
    <li> This rock did the job. It got rid of all the calluses. My only concern is that little bits of it are crumbling off at the sides, but I&#x27;m not to concerned because I have three others! A very good product in all, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve sever seen for a pumice stone. It works well for exfoliating my feet and the rope at the top is great for storing it in the shower when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> These work great I use them when I take my shower an my feet are looking very much better and feeling great.THANKS AGAIN AMAZON will surly buy these again</li>
    <li> I had a callous on the bottom of my foot and it was really annoying. Using this everyday for 10-20 seconds in the shower got rid of it.</li>
    <li> This works fairly well. It isn&#x27;t too rough, but effectively removes dead skin from my feet. Not much more to say.</li>
    <li> They fit comfortably in the hand, the little rope is good for hanging on any shower aids that have posts for such things, and my poor feet are feeling softer already.</li>
    <li> My pumice stone arrived rectangular so it&#x27;s not as effective as if it were round, but it was a great price and does what it needs to for how cheap it was.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is the glue they use to keep the cardboard marketing material stuck to the stone.  STOP DOING THAT, it clogs the stone in that spot.  Otherwise, works very well.</li>
    <li> The stone fell apart as I took off the wrapping.</li>
    <li> This item broke into pieces right away. You can still use the large pieces, if it breaks accordingly, but that defeats the purpose of the handle and wastes so of the stone. It doesn&#x27;t exfolate well anyway, so the product is useless.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t take away from the product because I&#x27;m pretty sure it works well, and I have other applications for it, but it just doesn&#x27;t work the way I wanted on my man feet.</li>
    <li> This 4-pack of pumice is a good buy.  The stone is just what it is suppose to be and the rope handle is very nice.  Unintentionally I found a use for this I am so glad to have discovered.  My tub is made of fiberglass.  There are spots on it where water collects and sits and over the years a hard mineral build up has grown.  I clean the tub on a regular basis - usually with Magi Eraser, but these mineral deposits remained - not so, after very few seconds scrubbing them with my pumice stone - which did not damage the tub at all.</li>
    <li> These pumice stones nicely exfoliate. I have one for feet and use a separate one for my hands and elbows. As with any pumice I have previously used, there are little grains that rub off, but that&#x27;s to be expected. I recommend storing outside of the shower, to avoid any build up of bacteria. I also sanitize mine.</li>
    <li> This is good for scrubbing off calluses, but it&#x27;s not a wonder product or anything. It&#x27;s very grainy and disintegrates as you scrub. So, little grains of the pumice stone end up all over the shower. I first noticed this would be an issue when I opened the package, because little sand-like particles fell out everywhere. For the price, it might be a good trade off. This is a good product if you want a cheap pumice stone. But remember, it&#x27;s cheap. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These are good, basic pumice stones for an affordable price.  The bag they came in had some stone dust, but the products were all intact upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Sides are very smooth, so this pumice doesn&#x27;t do a good job on really rough heels.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for a 4-pack. These pumice stones are a bit smoother than some others I have tried, and therefore a bit gentler. That can be good or bad - gentler works for me because I don&#x27;t need my pumice to have much power. But if you&#x27;re looking to remove more than just a little dead skin, you&#x27;ll want something stronger.</li>
    <li> one out of four arrived broken. they are also very dusty. overall seems low quality.</li>
    <li> Surprised how hard it was to find these things for sale-- feels really good to scrape away dead skin in the shower.  These ones are a bit too chalky white for my taste, hope they are manufactured responsibly.</li>
    <li> this took away all the dead skin on my feet, and i had some nasty looking feet i recommend this to anyone who is on there feet all day long cause once you use this you will feel like you have a fresh pair of feet once all the dead skin is gone and your feet will not stink i used it every night for about 20 mins under warm water for 4 days of the week before taking a shower and within two weeks all the dead skin was gone from my feet and i haven&#x27;t even finished the first stone yet, you don&#x27;t wanna try and rub all the dead skin off in one day cause not matter how much water you use it will make your feet feel irritated and you will get cuts and irritate the skin</li>
    <li> Great product, but just a bit smaller than most other stones. Works well on my feet and also scrubs away hard water stains!</li>
    <li> Feet and hands scrub scrub scrub no more dead or callus hands or feet they work as billed and you can&#x27;t beat the price for 4 bars</li>
    <li> Large size and there is quite the quantity for the price. has nice string on it for hanging in the bathroom. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> My wife had a problem with calluses, and after using the stone for 2 weeks along with lotion very day her feet are nice and soft. I would recommend soaking your feet first just to soften the callus, or even using the stone towards the end of the shower. The skin will be scrub! I would recommend this to anyone having problems with calluses.</li>
    <li> They work how they are supposed to, come in a pack of four as advertised but you really do need to get them wet in the shower for them to work properly.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace my Ped Egg. The Ped Egg is great but nothing is better than a pumice stone. It is coarse enough to soften your feet and it does not gash your feet like the Ped Egg. Excellent value and great service. Worth having.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t been able to find the old plastic/foam style product I had been using. This is much better and much less expensive. It looks like it will last a lot longer and is easy to clean. I use this on my feet almost everyday in the summer and even in the winter and never have hard/dry skin when I do.</li>
    <li> Not shaped like the rectangle pictured (shaped like a rounded peanut sort of shape), but it&#x27;s a great little pumice!</li>
    <li> I like this shape and manufacturer best.  It is robust enough to remove calluses while gentle enough to not cause injury.</li>
    <li> Every time I bought a pumice stone in the past it would wear down extremely easy. My feet are very tough, I spend a lot of time barefoot in the summer. These are really great and work really well on my feet, they are a little sharp, but if your feet are as tough as mine it&#x27;s great. The key is to soak your feet in warm water before, that way it makes it easier to remove the callus and it&#x27;s gentler on feet. Loved this product, will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, it is 4 4 inch long (aprox) stones. They seem fine, not as rough as what I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> I am glad I got the 4 pack of these pumice stones.  Wearing black sandals all the time, I get the black marks on my heals and chapped skin.  These are cheap and worth it!  Work really well.</li>
    <li> It is what it is. It works great, you&#x27;ll notice an immediate difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They want 7 words, so here they are</li>
    <li> better then a ped egg in my opinion wish i would have been aware of this product sooner great one</li>
    <li> they seem to hold together well and not turn into dust like some reviews on some other stones, Idk about these things but they seem to work fine and my order came with four as apposed to other offers that only come with one. seems like a no brainer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size and package, but it constantly leaves dust/powder behind when picking it up/putting it down (let alone using it).  It&#x27;s much softer than stones I have gotten in the past, and is starting to smooth out on the edge I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Great to have a 4-pack of these for such a low price. Would / will buy again. Works even for very rough skin. Use every day for best results. May take a couple of weeks to get down to super-soft skin (if you are very callused), but worth the patience.</li>
    <li> A little awkward for my hand to hang on to. The ones I received were shaped like a rectangle. I found this is a little too course for what I needed but I still use them and finish with a smaller file paper.</li>
    <li> Got them due to my heals starting to crack up in the fall. Scrubbed with them once a day and within a week the cracked skin was gone and there was no significant wearing of the stone. Would probably work well for getting rid of clauses as well. Didn&#x27;t need 4 but they will easily last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did come with a dust on them but that washed off easily.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t start crumbling apart after a few uses, like some cheap pumice stones do.  Unfortunately they come with stickers attached, and the glue seems to stay onto the pumice stone no matter what I do - so you loose a little surface area on one side.  They&#x27;re still a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice little stones. They arrived individually packages, which was nice. I gave a few away and kept the few I needed. Glad to have had the option to add this on to my order.</li>
    <li> This is a great 4 pack of pumice stones. It is well packaged and the stones are covered with plastic so they are protected until needed. Stones work great for using on callouses and feet.</li>
    <li> Great! Inexpensive set of four. Love having the little rope attached. Works great on my feet.</li>
</ol>
