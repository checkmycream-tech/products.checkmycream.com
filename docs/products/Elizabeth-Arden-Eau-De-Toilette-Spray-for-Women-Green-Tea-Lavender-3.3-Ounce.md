      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I just love the scent.</li>
      <li>A plus :).</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.  </li>
      <li>This smells so lovely.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume for my mom who is a huge lavender fan but ended up getting some for myself too because I liked it so much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>lovely aroma, does not overpower you</li>
      <li>I just love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the lavender scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Has a lovely light scent and feel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost like a cross between Este Lauder &#x27;Beautiful&#x27; and Jessica McClintock Lilly of the valley.</li>
      <li>For those of you gals that don&#x27;t want to wear a heavy scent, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>It smells like a cheap kid&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
      <li>It is a light scent, but can still be worn on cooler autumn or winter days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Elizabeth Arden products for years, the Lavender Green Tea wonderful.</li>
      <li>Now I can alternate between two great smells.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to wear it again, it&#x27;s bringing back memories of happier times.</li>
      <li>I wish I got mine here (but will re-order here) as it is double the cost on the Arden website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great perfume.  </li>
      <li>It is so smooth and calming.</li>
      <li>What is the use of a good fragrance when it doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>It is a very clean, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Both are very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This is a very light, not too heavy fragrance and will be great for the summer.  </li>
      <li>This is more \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; than EA Green Tea EDT (also a great fragrance) because of the touch of lavender in it.  </li>
      <li>Love lavender, but it&#x27;s one scent that everyone seems to have a different version of, for instance, there is a &amp;#34;scratchy lavender scent that you get in some soap (which I kind of like, I have to admit)</li>
      <li>Buy it as a gift, was a huge success.</li>
      <li>, then there is sickly sweet lavender that you find in some oils, and the list goes on..</li>
      <li>I love this scent so much that I even spray my pajamas before bed.</li>
      <li>Nice soft lavender fragrance</li>
      <li>If you carry your fragrance bottle in your purse all the time and apply perfume several times throughout the day, then this perfume would be good choice.</li>
      <li>the real mccoy at a fantastic price!  </li>
      <li>A light summer fresh scent with a hint of lavender.  </li>
      <li>It is strong when first applied, but mellows down beautifully.  </li>
      <li>sprayed anywhere close to your face, it does seem a bit strong at first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a special occasion fragrance but a great everyday scent - very light &amp; fresh and great for summer</li>
      <li>I always use the regular green tea which I love for the freshness and wonderful smell and then decided to try the lavender.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and is very soft.</li>
      <li>green tea part is just wonderful as it&#x27;s there in the background, just strong enough to &amp;#34;calm you down&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I only spray one or two spritzes on my shirt in the morning (avoiding my chest, because I will break out if it touches my skin), and by the end of the day, my shirt smells amazing.</li>
      <li>old granddaughter wants some for her own.</li>
      <li>Love it for daily light deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant odor.</li>
      <li>I used it right after surgery because it is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It is pure Mild fragrance</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances, so I decided to try the Green Tea Lavender because I also love lavender.</li>
      <li>Love Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea, I also love the fragrance of lavender.</li>
      <li>It is a very natural and light fragrance and should not affect anyone with sinus problems in the household.</li>
      <li>fast shipping!</li>
      <li>and it did not last more than 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I first got this eau de toilette as a gift from a cousin.</li>
      <li>I tried applying the fragrance by applying a fragrance-free body lotion on skin first, but that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t describe exactly what it smells like.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I discovered this perfume in a department store almost 2 years ago; the pretty bottle caught my eye.</li>
      <li>I have to warn you it is a bit strong when first applied but mellows very nicely and lasts, so use sparingly a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I love lavender, and it is a hard scent to find, sure you can find vanilla, berry, jasmine, ect.</li>
      <li>About an hour later, the scent had died down to something beautiful, and I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it.</li>
      <li>but lavender....not so much.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the original Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden.  </li>
      <li>I tried it first by directly applying it onto my skin</li>
      <li>I like the scent -- a little more sophisticated version of Green Tea.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely adore the Green Tea line, and I can easily see this being one of my all time favorites.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok if you are goning to be in an open airy surrounding, but it&#x27;s too over powering for closed in spaces.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this daily for almost 2 years, and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and it was one of my late husbands favourites on me.</li>
      <li>I pair it with the Secret Lavender deodorant, and it ends with a light, clean, but not overpowering lavender scent that lasts till you shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lavender scent is very fresh and soothing, yet subtle.</li>

    <li> the real mccoy at a fantastic price!  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Buy it as a gift, was a huge success. Balanced Fragance</li>
    <li> lovely aroma, does not overpower you</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and it was one of my late husbands favourites on me. I&#x27;m so happy to wear it again, it&#x27;s bringing back memories of happier times. For those of you gals that don&#x27;t want to wear a heavy scent, this is perfect. I&#x27;ve worn Elizabeth Arden products for years, the Lavender Green Tea wonderful.</li>
    <li> The scent is very cheap !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will shop for my perfume either Saks fifth avenue or bergdoff Goodman</li>
    <li> This is a very light, not too heavy fragrance and will be great for the summer.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift to a friend.  She LOVES the lavendar!  She wears the /EauDeToilette and also sprays it in her bedroom before sleeping!  She said using it both ways provides her with excellent convenience to sleep and yet love the whole day!</li>
    <li> Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;This does not have any scent of Lavender. I can&#x27;t describe exactly what it smells like. It&#x27;s a moderate weight scent and it was not at all what I wanted. I can&#x27;t smell lavender at all. It&#x27;s almost like a cross between Este Lauder &#x27;Beautiful&#x27; and Jessica McClintock Lilly of the valley. To me, the scent just doesn&#x27;t marry well. It&#x27;s ok if you are goning to be in an open airy surrounding, but it&#x27;s too over powering for closed in spaces.</li>
    <li> Love it for daily light deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant odor. Does not stain clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Scent pleasant, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Will use again.</li>
    <li> Has a lovely light scent and feel.  Elizabeth Arden has some great scents, this is one of my favorite!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  It is a very clean, fresh scent.  Whenever I wear it I have people comment on how good I smell!  Would recommend to this anyone who doesn&#x27;t like a heavy scent.</li>
    <li> I discovered this perfume in a department store almost 2 years ago; the pretty bottle caught my eye. I sprayed some on my wrists and continued shopping. About an hour later, the scent had died down to something beautiful, and I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it. I bought it (for 3x Amazon&#x27;s price, unfortunately), and I&#x27;ve used it every day since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sprayed anywhere close to your face, it does seem a bit strong at first. However, within minutes, it smells amazing.  I only spray one or two spritzes on my shirt in the morning (avoiding my chest, because I will break out if it touches my skin), and by the end of the day, my shirt smells amazing. I love this scent so much that I even spray my pajamas before bed. Sometimes, I even spray my bed.. It&#x27;s that good. The lavender scent is very fresh and soothing, yet subtle. Most body sprays give me a sore throat, but I have no problem with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this daily for almost 2 years, and I&#x27;m still on my first bottle. It&#x27;s only a little over half empty. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this product, you should, especially for Amazon&#x27;s price. Just don&#x27;t buy it from a department store and get ripped off like I did!</li>
    <li> Love Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea, I also love the fragrance of lavender. This fragrance is beautiful the best of both, Refreshingly Beautiful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea for years. it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances, so I decided to try the Green Tea Lavender because I also love lavender. Both are very clean and fresh. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mom who is a huge lavender fan but ended up getting some for myself too because I liked it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a special occasion fragrance but a great everyday scent - very light &amp; fresh and great for summer</li>
    <li> fragrance is nice but has almost no staying power.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the original Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden.  So when they came out with the lavender scent it had to be a win.  And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  A light summer fresh scent with a hint of lavender.  Perfect for after shower or a night on the town.</li>
    <li> I love lavender, and it is a hard scent to find, sure you can find vanilla, berry, jasmine, ect. but lavender....not so much. I have to warn you it is a bit strong when first applied but mellows very nicely and lasts, so use sparingly a little goes a long way. I will reorder when I run short.</li>
    <li> I always use the regular green tea which I love for the freshness and wonderful smell and then decided to try the lavender. If you like lavender (which I do), you will love this one!! Now I can alternate between two great smells.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It is so smooth and calming. I used it right after surgery because it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this fragrance anymore at the stores I have looked for. When I found here I was so happy that I got three at once ;)</li>
    <li> I just love the scent.</li>
    <li> It is pure Mild fragrance So I like.</li>
    <li> Like the scent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Carry it with you... you&#x27;ll have to use it several times a day.</li>
    <li> Love the lavender scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering. My boyfriend sometimes uses this- I catch him spraying it on before we go out.</li>
    <li> I like the scent -- a little more sophisticated version of Green Tea.  However, it&#x27;s very weak.  After two hours, it is simply gone. I don&#x27;t like to have to reapply scent, so I probably won&#x27;t buy again.  Green Tea Lotus lasts much longer than this one.</li>
    <li> What is the use of a good fragrance when it doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes. I tried it first by directly applying it onto my skin and it did not last more than 15 minutes. Also, applying perfumes on an oily skin, helps contain the fragrance and makes the perfume long lasting. I tried applying the fragrance by applying a fragrance-free body lotion on skin first, but that didn&#x27;t help either. If you carry your fragrance bottle in your purse all the time and apply perfume several times throughout the day, then this perfume would be good choice. I like the subtlety of lavender. It is definitely not overpowering and it is a good fragrance to have.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the Green Tea line, and I can easily see this being one of my all time favorites. However, the packaging was awful (Just some paper with the perfume on the BOTTOM of the parcel) so it arrived with a severely cracked lid that can&#x27;t be used anymore.</li>
    <li> This smells so lovely.  Every time I wear it, I get a compliment on how good I smell.  :)  It&#x27;s great for day or evening.  I love this scent!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the item and very fast delivery</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance--light and fresh.</li>
    <li> I first got this eau de toilette as a gift from a cousin. He thought I might not like it because of the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; touch. But I simply loved it! And it has become my favourite scent for the day. It lasts long enough, and I&#x27;ve used it in the evening too. Every time I wear it, someone compliments me for the great smell!</li>
    <li> I wish I got mine here (but will re-order here) as it is double the cost on the Arden website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great perfume.  Love lavender, but it&#x27;s one scent that everyone seems to have a different version of, for instance, there is a &amp;#34;scratchy lavender scent that you get in some soap (which I kind of like, I have to admit), then there is sickly sweet lavender that you find in some oils, and the list goes on..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like lavender that actually SMELLS like lavender and this does!  It is strong when first applied, but mellows down beautifully.  And it lasts a long time with me.  I pair it with the Secret Lavender deodorant, and it ends with a light, clean, but not overpowering lavender scent that lasts till you shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green tea part is just wonderful as it&#x27;s there in the background, just strong enough to &amp;#34;calm you down&amp;#34; the way the smell of tea does.  It&#x27;s a wonderful perfume and I&#x27;m glad that I have it.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and is very soft. Muy suave y agradable para después del baño, no me gustan las fragancias fuertes y duraderas, asi que debo usar muy suaves y ligeras. Esta la recomiendo.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lavender scent - this is not it.  There is no lavender smell.  It smells like a cheap kid&#x27;s perfume.  If you like a sweet, fake smell, go for it.  I gave it away, I couldn&#x27;t even stand to use it every once in a while.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very light to wear any season.  Hubby loves it. A plus :). I looked everywhere for this.  Thank you amazon.  You always rock !!!</li>
    <li> Sweet aroma, good for this time of the year, summer!</li>
    <li> I had never worn this fragrance before this purchase.  It is a light scent, but can still be worn on cooler autumn or winter days.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing scent which is not too flowery and not so musky.  This is a good scent if you want something a&lt;br /&gt;Little different from time to time.  It always gets compliments and has no age preference.  Not only do I like it but my 13&lt;br /&gt;Year old granddaughter wants some for her own.</li>
    <li> Nice soft lavender fragrance</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful fragrance for those who want a light and uplifting scent.  This is more \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; than EA Green Tea EDT (also a great fragrance) because of the touch of lavender in it.  I have a hard time finding the right floral scent for me but this was a great discovery.  It is a very natural and light fragrance and should not affect anyone with sinus problems in the household.</li>
