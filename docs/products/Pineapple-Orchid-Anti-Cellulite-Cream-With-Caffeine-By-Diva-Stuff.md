      <li>My skin looks great and soft!</li>
      <li>I also recieved samples of other products and they are excellent as well.</li>
      <li>nice soft skin, nice smell....cellulite......not gone yet....</li>
      <li>This lotion was the first Diva Stuff product that I tried, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I feel that my skin is so smooth and the appearance of cellulite has diminished.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast though and the samples were nice too.</li>
      <li>From someone who has had cellulite since im a teenager and now at 37 its really going away!!!</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and rich.</li>
      <li>My legs are now smoother with less dimpling and I will keep using this great product for sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had great success with the entire Diva Stuff line of products, and the pineapple orchid anti-cellulite cream is no exception!  </li>
      <li>Keeping my fingers crossed, but so far I love it!</li>
      <li>Besides the fact that it leaves my skin very smooth it really is diminishing the cellulite I&#x27;ve had all my life.</li>
      <li>(I use it right after the Pineapple Orchid Anti-Cellulite soap bar) and it works!</li>
      <li>Both work extremely well, smell great, and are affordable.</li>
      <li>Combine that with proper diet, hydrate yourself properly and use one of Diva Stuff&#x27;s wonderful anti cellulite soap bars in the tub, and you&#x27;ve got yourself a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Diva&#x27;s Pineapple Orchid Anti Cellulite Cream IS SUPER AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;After showering I messaged the cream into my \\&quot;problem</li>
      <li>However I really really like the Keylime Pie cream!!</li>
      <li>and my thighs were tight and the product smells great</li>
      <li>even my boyfriend noticed a difference which was enough for me not to mention it smells amazing</li>
      <li>Smooth skin, love the smell but as far as the cellulite, haven&#x27;t seen to much improvement</li>
      <li>This feels like it is working right away.</li>
      <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s working very well!</li>
      <li>Okay, so as a 21 year old woman who has had cellulite since she was 14, wow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream little over a week with coffee soap and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>cream has some amazing ingredients in it like grapefruit, green tea butter, and rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Very sticky and does not feel like it absorbs.  </li>
      <li>Maybe with time it might work but requires to much product so goes really fast.</li>
      <li>really need to try this.</li>
      <li>I could never get the way every woman wants them.</li>
      <li>I Really Really Like.</li>
      <li>this didnt really do anything - i added some cayenne peppe to stimulate blood flow and do</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Really work, thank you</li>
      <li>I do feel a tightening, and it absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>and I have to say that it really works.</li>
      <li>It really does smell like a blend of Pineapple and Orchid.</li>
      <li>If this actually did work, it would cost lots more then ten bucks,  </li>
      <li>I am in complete amazement over this and highly recommend this to anyone who is considering buying this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember exactly how I stumbled across this line of products, but since I&#x27;ve tried them, I&#x27;ve basically purchased the entire collection.</li>
      <li>and when you use it with a cellulite massager, it does not smooth over your skin easily.  </li>
      <li>Smelled good but small jar and no  real difference seen with using it</li>
      <li>and WOW, I saw results already.  </li>
      <li>it has all natural ingredients and helps lessen my cellulite (oh that dreaded word)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much smoother and only in a couple uses, you can see a difference.</li>
      <li>so im surprised i even have celulite</li>
      <li>also particularly fond of this company because they make a wide assortment of natural bath and beauty products, with their cleansing face scrubbies, lip balms, lip scrubbies, dual action soaps and hair conditioners being my all-time favorites in their product lineup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this lotion a short time and already see a noticeable decrease in my cellulite, with the area being much smoother than before.  </li>
      <li>Now I am completely hooked on the cream and literally can not get enough of it.</li>
      <li>As to the effectiveness, after using one jar (which didn&#x27;t go very far) I&#x27;m not sure it made much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Ive always been active and in decent shape but my legs and butt</li>
      <li>A good moisturizer would work as well and be less expensive.</li>

<li> did nothing for me and its a pretty small jar - just not worth it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great, having used it yet so not sure if it works!</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong diva stuff smells like heaven! But I don&#x27;t think this is one of the best things I have got from diva stuff. Some of their stuff I Really Really Like. I don&#x27;t think this teally does anything but smell nice and leave little tiny grim flakes on me from this cream. I&#x27;m going to use this up I Will not be buy this again. However I really really like the Keylime Pie cream!! I would say don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Not worth your time or money.</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot. However, I&#x27;m not sure that it helped decrease the visibility of my cellulite at all. Smells nice though.</li>
    <li> I had previously used the Pineapple Orchid cream minus the caffeine and I would suggest that one instead.  The caffeinated version made my skin break out on my legs really bad and I had these itchy, irritated pores for a solid week.</li>
    <li> I love this company and all of its products!!! Would give 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Diva&#x27;s Pineapple Orchid Anti Cellulite Cream IS SUPER AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;After showering I messaged the cream into my \\&quot;problem areas\\&quot; and I can already see a difference after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has some amazing ingredients in it like grapefruit, green tea butter, and rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;The pineapple orchid scent is so yummy I find it hard not to want to taste it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Diva Stuff for the wonderful products.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple...it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not sure if anything does. It made my skin feel dry. A good moisturizer would work as well and be less expensive.</li>
    <li> Really work, thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream and the soap bar with coffee and I have to say that it really works. My skin looks great and soft!</li>
    <li> Always a skeptic, I had to try to see if this would work... My legs are now smoother with less dimpling and I will keep using this great product for sure. Also leaves your skin soft and smooth as well as smelling wonderful!</li>
    <li> Slow working but works</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have been using for almost one month and now it is over. I feel that my skin is so smooth and the appearance of cellulite has diminished. It has a wonderful smell too. I am considering buying it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember exactly how I stumbled across this line of products, but since I&#x27;ve tried them, I&#x27;ve basically purchased the entire collection. This lotion was the first Diva Stuff product that I tried, and it&#x27;s amazing. It smells incredible (I use it right after the Pineapple Orchid Anti-Cellulite soap bar) and it works! It&#x27;s a rich cream that penetrates your skin and leaves it firmer and smelling awesome. A little bit goes a long way too, so it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> This product smells and feels nice but I see no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I ended up being allergic to this and got pimples all over my thighs that lasted 2 weeks! So I can&#x27;t say if it works because I discontinued after 2 uses. The shipping was fast though and the samples were nice too. I did buy the coffee soap from this seller and I think it&#x27;s working very well!</li>
    <li> The texture is smooth and rich. The smell is the most unique and magnificent thing, almost indescribable! It really does smell like a blend of Pineapple and Orchid. The genius to put those two things together... and finally, products for the Diva in all of us and not just a select few who can afford them.  I have used many of the DS items and this is among my favorites.</li>
    <li> This smells AMAZING! I use daily after my shower and after the cellulite reducing soap. These items work well together.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it it makes my legs feel. it has all natural ingredients and helps lessen my cellulite (oh that dreaded word)</li>
    <li> this didnt really do anything - i added some cayenne peppe to stimulate blood flow and do 100 ballet 2nd position squats - that helped as did body brushing- i am slim to begin with (5 7 and 123lbs)- so im surprised i even have celulite-so i increased my walking did the squats and that is what helped -</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great success with the entire Diva Stuff line of products, and the pineapple orchid anti-cellulite cream is no exception!  I&#x27;ve only been using this lotion a short time and already see a noticeable decrease in my cellulite, with the area being much smoother than before.  Combine that with proper diet, hydrate yourself properly and use one of Diva Stuff&#x27;s wonderful anti cellulite soap bars in the tub, and you&#x27;ve got yourself a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also particularly fond of this company because they make a wide assortment of natural bath and beauty products, with their cleansing face scrubbies, lip balms, lip scrubbies, dual action soaps and hair conditioners being my all-time favorites in their product lineup.  GREAT stuff!</li>
    <li> I cannot decide which cellulite cream I like most, this one or the morocon mint.. Both work extremely well, smell great, and are affordable. My legs feel tighter and look smoother. Along with lots of lunges, walking, and using this anti Cellulite cream, and the pumpkin roll coffee soap in the shower I can honestly say my legs look so so so much better. I have been fighting this cellulite for years and of all the products I have tried, this is the best cream out there (in my price range). I like it better than the Bliss Fat Girl Slim products (and they are not cheap).&lt;br /&gt;You really need to try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the present small</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream little over a week with coffee soap and the results are amazing. I would say 80% of my cellulite is gone (I also regularly work out and diet) And the smell is so delicious. Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because when I bought something else from Diva Stuff, this came in as one of my samples.  I used it for just a few days and WOW, I saw results already.  Had to buy it.  I&#x27;m hoping by using this product as recommended, that it will eventually all be gone.  I would definitely recommend this product.  And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it has a very pleasant scent to it.</li>
    <li> did nothing for me and its a pretty small jar - just not worth it</li>
    <li> Very thick not absorbent. Can&#x27;t tell if it works... Smells nice and moisturizes... Maybe with time it might work but requires to much product so goes really fast.</li>
    <li> 4wks and my thighs were tight and the product smells great</li>
    <li> smells good, but i didnt see a difference. wouldnt buy it again</li>
    <li> This cream made no difference in my skin, it is way to thick and when you use it with a cellulite massager, it does not smooth over your skin easily.  Very sticky and does not feel like it absorbs.  Let&#x27;s face it, no cream will get rid of cellulite but we keep wasting money hoping that we will find a miracle cream that will.  If this actually did work, it would cost lots more then ten bucks,  you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Okay, so as a 21 year old woman who has had cellulite since she was 14, wow. This stuff is amazing. I use it after I use Diva Stuff&#x27;s Anti Cellulite mudpack, and my skin feels amazing. It&#x27;s much smoother and only in a couple uses, you can see a difference. I love love love Diva Stuff.</li>
    <li> nice soft skin, nice smell....cellulite......not gone yet....:0( still trying</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think any cellulite cream would ever work but this cream has proved me wrong. Besides the fact that it leaves my skin very smooth it really is diminishing the cellulite I&#x27;ve had all my life. Ive always been active and in decent shape but my legs and butt I could never get the way every woman wants them. Well amazingly I started working out my legs again and in addition have been applying the cream 2-3 times a day. Within a few days I noticed a difference.  Now I am completely hooked on the cream and literally can not get enough of it. From someone who has had cellulite since im a teenager and now at 37 its really going away!!! I am in complete amazement over this and highly recommend this to anyone who is considering buying this product. I also recieved samples of other products and they are excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Seems like this cream made a better moisturizer than a cellulite banisher. To be fair I didn&#x27;t use it as often as i shoud have so that could be the reason.</li>
    <li> The pineapple cream is amazing it works even my boyfriend noticed a difference which was enough for me not to mention it smells amazing</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think any cellulite cream would ever work but this cream has proved me wrong. It works great and feels great on my skin. I really love the smell of it to. Im really in love with it :0</li>
    <li> love this cream and the smell of it ive also used the bar soap even thouh i dont like using bars. only wish you made body wash  out of the same stuff and smell. if you ever do please let me know asap i would def buy.</li>
    <li> I do feel a tightening, and it absorbs fast. I have used other brands and they are greasy or just ineffective because they are thin. This feels like it is working right away. I have extremely bad cellulite, and I am using this coupled with working out. Keeping my fingers crossed, but so far I love it!</li>
    <li> The scent and thickness of the lotion is amazing. I been using it the last two weeks so im hoping i see results soon.</li>
    <li> Save your money this stuff does not even rub into your skin. I saw no difference, it smelled good though.</li>
    <li> Smooth skin, love the smell but as far as the cellulite, haven&#x27;t seen to much improvement</li>
    <li> I am very skeptical of beauty products but this lotion really works!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my cellulite. May be allergic to something in the cream. Can&#x27;t tell for sure if it&#x27;s this product since I also used the soap. Smelled great though!</li>
    <li> Smells great. As to the effectiveness, after using one jar (which didn&#x27;t go very far) I&#x27;m not sure it made much of a difference. I am using the Diva Stuff cellulite soap and &amp;#34;The Stick&amp;#34; roller twice a day to stimulate those clumpy fat cells and help them lay flat and that combo seems to be improving the bumpy appearance. So yay!&lt;br /&gt;( http://www.amazon.com/Perform-Better-Stick-Self-Roller-Massager/dp/B0028BO94M/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_sg_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1RD1GMSDPMHBQFZF3ZCE)</li>
    <li> Smelled good but small jar and no  real difference seen with using it</li>
    <li> Smells good and is moisturizing. I am not really sure that it works to diminish cellulite though.</li>
