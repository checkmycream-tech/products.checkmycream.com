<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with product and delivery</li>
    <li> Great product works amazing</li>
    <li> This product seems to make my hair feel thicker (in the good way) and healthier. Almost out and would consider buying again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I got a real shampoo and conditioner. Before I bought it from my hairdresser and it was wonderful.  When I got a set from Amazon, it was nothing like the shampoo and conditioner I used before. It dried my hair out and hair look more damaged.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good shampoo aaaaand conditioner, but not that 2in1 stuff. It&#x27;s 2in2.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this shampoo after buying the smaller versions at Walmart. I&#x27;m so glad I found the liter bottles!!! They last so long! Not to mention it does wonders for my damaged hair! (I went from natural black hair to bleach blonde)</li>
    <li> This was whatever. I&#x27;ve tried many matrix products and this was my least favorite. It didn&#x27;t do much to my hair at all. The only thing I liked was that it was sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo &amp; Conditioner after recommendation from my hair dresser. Bought smaller size due to my skeptical nature :D))...&lt;br /&gt;Wash number one and I was thrilled!!Beautifully soft and silky hair, moisturized but not oily. When you touch the hair...feels like every hair strand is happy...&lt;br /&gt;After it finished...replaced it with a slightly cheaper shampoo...with obvious regular results...will buy this again...maybe bigger bottle this time...also smells lovely!</li>
    <li> I DO NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF THE CONDITIONER , BUT I DO LOVE HOW NICE BOTH THE SHAMPOO AND THE CONDITIONER MAKE MY HAIR LOOK AND FEEL !</li>
    <li> You DO NOT need to have keratin treatment to use these products. They make your hair super smooth and styling is such a breeze (which is tough with my curly hair). They are sulfate-free which is great. Price is awesome. Unfortunately do not come with a pump.</li>
    <li> The product is the greatest keratin shampoo and conditioner that are on the market today.  If you have need for keratin products you have to give this a try, you&#x27;ll never use another product again!</li>
    <li> shampoo and conditioner truly make my hair feel smooth and thicker. I feel my hair has gotten stronger! I also use the leave in conditioner. I have fine blonde hair. Even my bf commented that my hair feels thicker and shinier !</li>
    <li> We bought this after recommendation from the doctor. It exceeded my expectation and I would highly recommend this product without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> Received 2 shampoos instead of a shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> i have always used Biolage products for my hair and love it.  this particular product is not my favorite.  I have very processed hair so i thought this would be perfect.  I find that my hair is more dry and it does not do a very good job of detangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely still purchase biolage but not this particular product again.</li>
    <li> I just received the Matrix Biolage Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have already used it a few times and love it!  Prior to this, I used Biolage for color treated hair - which was good and I liked it, but my hair still felt a little dry.  I thought I would give this one a try and I can&#x27;t believe the difference!  My hair feels silky smooth and healthy!  My hair is color-treated, and I blow-dry, and curl it.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miracle product, but it really works for me.  My hair dresser said that as you get older, your hair loses Keratin.  That&#x27;s part of the reason I tried this product.  I really like the way my hair feels, and it has a nice smell.  It&#x27;s a good price for the amount that you get.</li>
    <li> love love love love love it, absolute best product for hair that has been treated chemically, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product</li>
    <li> This products are very good for dry ends like my hair. I was using Mirta De Perales keratin line and basically was drying my hair and making my hair more prone to breakage and I went to the beauty supply and I ask the girl what can be a good product for dry ends and she told me about biolange keratin dose and I start using it ..What I like about this shampoo and conditioner it&#x27;s make my hair silkier and soft and my ends now are very moisturize ... I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> The shampoo and condition are really good - you can see the difference right away</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are amazing, I have colored my hair since I was young and it is very dry and over-processed.  I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days and already my hair is softer and less frizzy looking, it smells AMAZING and these bottles will last some time.  Definitely purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I had been using Mane &amp; Tail to help my hair grow.  Although I have noticed a difference in length and strength, I also noticed my hair getting very dry and frizzy.  I bought this combination and after one use, my hair is significantly less dry and frizzy and it smells great all day.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Immediately made a difference on my natural curly hair. Recommend to anyone with damage to their hair. My location even has a lot of harsh minerals.</li>
    <li> We used this product from a different vendor before and never had a problem.  But this particular set seems to leave our hair greasier and heavy.  We never had this problem before.</li>
    <li> Its ok, but I really feel that after using other biolage products that this one is a knock off (fake product). Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any keratin treatments done to my hair at all but this shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel like it&#x27;s had all of the softening and strengthening treatments it ever could hope for.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be better than Biolage by Matrix Hydratherapy that&#x27;s why I ordered this because I want my long straight hair to shine everyday. But my expectations of this product is so high. I like the shampoo but the conditioner is so so. I may keep using the shampoo but will get the Hydratherapy conditioning balm instead.</li>
    <li> I love my Matrix Biolage. It smells great and it makes my hair manageable after washing it as I have super curly hair that tangles when it dries. I am happy with my purchase and when I am out I will buy again as long as this seller is still available!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve tried all different things and I feel like this is awesome for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great summer humid heat product because it smooths the hair and takes away the frizzies. Love the way my hair feels and looks when using these products.</li>
    <li> The best hair product I&#x27;ve bought.  Amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks amazing after this biolage on...every girl should have this ..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but I love this so much that wanted to say something. I&#x27;ve tried so many sulfate free shampoos including Paul Mitchell, Moroccan oil, GK Global and this is my favorite . I noticed a difference after one shampoo . I&#x27;ve had a few Keratin treatments . I actually prefer the Keratin treatment just on the front bang area but did a couple of treatments on my whole head over Spring and summer. I continued to just do Keratin on the front but normally I have very full wavy hair in the back. My hair has been so flat and didn&#x27;t have spring to it. Kind of thought I changed my hair texture for good . Hair just felt lifeless . Just one time of using this and hair feels like it came back to life . I&#x27;m thrilled . My hair texture is fine , wavy but very full looking. I will definitely buy this again . To think I was paying so much money for like Moroccan oil , which I love but this works so much better.</li>
    <li> Brings shine and life back to hair! I noticed a difference after the first use. Finally feel like I am doing something  good for my hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended that I use a Matrix product which then sent me on a search through all the products offered by Matrix/Biolage.  My head was spinning after I found all the different options.  I have long wavy hair that gets tangled easily so it is difficult to comb without pulling out a lot of hair.  I also cannot leave it down very much for fear of more tangles.  I do not put heat or hairspray or other styling products on my hair.  After much reading I thought perhaps a shampoo without Sulfites would be a good idea.  This is the only sulfite and parabens free shampoo/conditioner offered by Matrix/Biolage.  I purchased the combo to try it out.  That was a few weeks ago.  I really like it.  The smell reminds me a little of suntan lotion.  I still get some tangles but not as badly as before and my hair feels soft.  I did purchased one of the pumps which I am using in the conditioner bottle.  You can use the bottle without it, but it is large and difficult to maneuver when slippery so I think the pump is helpful to have but not mandatory.</li>
    <li> Shampoo and conditioner combination was reasonably priced and made my hair supple and less frizzy without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> I love these products!!! I have fine hair but it&#x27;s very long and heavy. This shampoo and conditioner keeps my hair super healthy without weighing it down at all. I have much less breakage since using these.</li>
    <li> most horrible stinkiest shampoo and conditioner i have ever used.</li>
    <li> Im only giving this 1stars because i habe to.  The shampoo, It does have salts in it, it does have acids in it that are not good for color treated hair and it made my hair feel very dry, before i applied the conditioner, it almost seemed like a clarifying shampoo.  Maybe i didnt get the REAL biolage keratindose????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was ok, and the leave in spray just ok too.  I actually had to add in some of my own argan oil because my hair was dry after i finished blowing it out.  The set of shampoo, conditioner and leave in silkening spray did nothing to help combat the frizzies i have from having slightly eavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i didnt get the real stuff, but im not impressed in the least.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It has made my hair feel alive again. This was a great price for the size.</li>
    <li> I needed something to help repair my poor over processed dried out hair...My hair feels so much softer &amp; silkier and looks shinier.  I really love this combo.</li>
    <li> It did not do anything for my hair &amp; dry the crap out of it!! I had to buy new shampoo n condition. I wish I can return it.</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever but I felt it was a must!!  I have thin, long hair, but after dying it every 12 weeks my hair has become incredibly dry and FRIZZY!!! I tried this line (the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in spray) and the results were amazing.  When it ran out, I tried Biolage Hydrasource(because it was cheaper) and nope not the same!  I have even tried Pureology&#x27;s Hydrate line and I still like this product better.  I am going to the salon this week and exchanging my products!  I see a difference after 1 USE.  And the long term benefits are a total transformation!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful!  kind of pricey but my hair&#x27;s never looked better.</li>
    <li> Made my neck itch for some reason.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Hair looks great and sleek and shiny.  Just what I needed.  Sulphate free so order this matrix product if that is needed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  First time I&#x27;ve tried it for my very overly processed hair..leaves it feeling silky smooth and beautiful.  Will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was good for keratin treated hair as I had just done one on myself, when I received this set in the mail, I immediately noticed that it is not sulfate free, and it did exactly what I assumed it would, within 2 weeks time, the keratin was completely stripped from my hair, 2 or so months sooner than it should have. As a regular shampoo and conditioner its fine, but do not at all recommend for keratin treated hair</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, price per ounce &#x3D; to store brand costs, and very nice fresh scent. Much more convenient to buy pumps (work great) or fill a smaller bottle if limited space.&lt;br /&gt; Throughout past 20 years fighting with my COLORED DRY HAIR this shampoo comes CLOSEST TO CLEAN WITHOUT STRIPPING my hair.&lt;br /&gt; With my hair so dry I have made &amp;#34;formulas&amp;#34; of my own with cheaper to high end products. This is my favorite one:&lt;br /&gt;  **** I mix 1 PUMP SHAMPOO + 1/2 PUMP CONDITIONER + FEW DROPS OIL****  for my thirsty processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;  No need to rinse and repeat (low suds may temp you) but I follow with conditioner and rinse, or use small amt as leave in conditioner for manageable and shiny, ready for any styling.&lt;br /&gt;(Lots of suds if used alone as gentle clarifying agent for my dry hair ONLY if absolutely necessary.)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It smells wonderful and I can tell my hair is healthier after using it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Was a little skeptical to order shampoo online but this product has really made my hair loads better. It not only made my really worn out and dry hair softer, but it also made it more manageable. The value is amazing since the same product is way more expensive in department stores. To be honest the product was better than I expected. Totally worth the price. I live in Minnesota where the weather also dries out your hair. Not anymore! Thanks for a great deal.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this product, right after first use, hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> Finally found a shampoo that works!!! :-) :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very exciting</li>
    <li> THis is a good buy for biolage. Good shampoo and conditioner, but still feel I need a clarifier once a week or so as it seems to build up in the hair.</li>
    <li> Product arrived damaged</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Smells good and my hair looks awesome!</li>
    <li> Hair is shinier, stronger and not as dry.  Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> how can you go wrong with a dose of keratine added to biolage products?i love that I can buy this size it last me so much longer than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo bottle</li>
    <li> Very Happy with these Shampoo and Rinse.....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product only for a little over a week (3 washes) and I can already tell a difference in my hair. Hair seems softer, stronger, and has more volume. I recommend buying if you are looking for product to bring life back into your hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser washed my highlighted hair with this &amp; I totally loved how the vibrancy , shine &amp; manageability this product has helped, especially with my frizz and makes combing better without tangles. I highly recommend this Advanced line. Great price for these 2 big bottles.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  The price was better than I could get at a retail store, plus it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It has done wonders for my over-treated, aging hair. The bottles are large and difficult to handle. I bought some smaller dispenser bottles to fit into the shower and I can find no fault with them now.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to anyone, made my hair so soft and shiny. I have no issue with grease with this product,</li>
    <li> Hair so smooth after used that is incredible</li>
    <li> My hair became rather dry, after coloring it to often. I got this shampoo and found that it&#x27;s a bit too &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;. It kind of made my hair look like it had not been washed in a few days. Don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My wife bought smaller bottles at the beauty parlor.  They were expensive.  When I saw the price on these I bought them.  I will continue to buy them because of the great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> shampoo is great but conditioner,...well I still prefer Pantene... sorry</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ambivalent about this shampoo.  I moved to Hawaii and between the sun and salt I need something really moisturizing.  I have loved matrix products in the past, but this makes my air look greasy by the end of the day</li>
    <li> this was for my wife just to say okay...</li>
    <li> My hair has been bleach, stripped, and dyed for years. I&#x27;ve broken and dried out my hair numerous times. Using these product has helped repair and soften the damage that has been done. I recommend this products for anyone with processed hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Smells good , lathers good!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. It smells so good and makes my hair feel amazing!</li>
    <li> The wife loves it, she said it was worth the money.</li>
