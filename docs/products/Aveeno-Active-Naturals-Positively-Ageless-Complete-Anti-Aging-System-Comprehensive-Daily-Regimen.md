      <li>And if one doesn&#x27;t like it, I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good stuff, works well</li>
      <li>Neither moisturizers are greasy and the eye cream is also good, but does not have any spf.</li>

      <li>Love it, this is great.  </li>
      <li>The eye liquid is superb, and helps with my puffiness, and laugh lines.</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno and it works great</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>Most sets come with three products, so I feel like this is a great deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both me and my spouse face becomes more smoother, fine line is gone and just beautiful!</li>
      <li>The scent of the products is very light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the night cream!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Anyways the night cream was really good, in the morning felt the skin felt more smooth and even (so looked beautiful).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that I saw results in the reduction (in some cases elimination) of the fine lines around my eyes, though it hasn&#x27;t done anything for the under eye bags or the purple-ish tint in the inside corners of my eyes.     </li>
      <li>So amazing,</li>
      <li>To my surprise, my skin looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>The feeling of the product on my skin is quite nice.</li>
      <li>this particular package is wonderful to use for traveling.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is wonderful, always makes my face feel fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant fragrance and the facial wash feels so good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first step is cleansing, and this facewash feels great.</li>
      <li>The moisturizers were great when I first started using them, but with the extended use I see a difference with my skin&#x27;s oil production.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth without causing you the stretch</li>
      <li>but I kind of like that in a night cream because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it rubs off easily.</li>
      <li>I love the Aveeno Positively Ageless line of skin care, and this 4-pack of the essentials is a great bargain.</li>
      <li>in all I&#x27;m quite pleased with this set.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and have decided I don&#x27;t want to use it on my eyelids or lips any more.</li>
      <li>The night cream is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with it when I was using it daily.</li>
      <li>the sunscreen in the daily moisturizer does an excellent job.</li>
      <li>I passed it on to my mom, she has tougher skin and can probably benefit from it more than me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to handle SPF in my moisturizers and the day-time moisturizer in the kit is SPF 30</li>
      <li>day and night creams were just okay, and not that moisturizing.</li>
      <li>My skin is looking firmer and more radiant.</li>
      <li>I love the pack for travel.</li>
      <li>If you are in my age range (50-60), I think you will love it, too.</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno</li>
      <li>- I feel completely confident going without concealer, foundation etc.</li>
      <li>*strikes a sexy smolder*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aveeno makes great products and at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>longer I use this, I&#x27;m sure I will see even more of an improvement.</li>
      <li>After just four days, my skin feels softer and looks more even.  </li>
      <li>This will help more for indoor person</li>
      <li>The Aveeno products were recommended to me many years ago by my son&#x27;s pediatrician.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely loved them all the first couple weeks, however, while I 100% love the cleanser and the eye serum, the moisturizers have been lackluster.</li>
      <li>I bought this starter set for my sister who loved it so much that she went and bought more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good trial size to the Positively Ageless line of Aveeno.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed, even my friends have noticed and asked me about it, and the best part is I&#x27;ve been able to go for the natural for the first time in years</li>
      <li>This product leaves my skin feeling soft and looking great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t overdo it like most products out on the market.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after seeing reviews on here and wanted to give it a try to combat the fine lines that were appearing around my eyes.</li>
      <li>As and almost 30 something I have been looking for a skin care product that works to help ward off those fine lines.  </li>
      <li>It firms the skin and smooths out fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise it works fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 32, and have some fine lines that were not smoothed at all.  </li>
      <li>It is fine and does not clog the pores.</li>
      <li>but I love using this set very much!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The exfoliant does a marvelous job with smoothing my skin. The eye liquid is superb, and helps with my puffiness, and laugh lines. Both the day and night creams are wonderful as well. I have oily, sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts. These products have not resulted in any problems for me, something that&#x27;s a rarity. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This works unimaginably good in my face! It is cheap compared to other facial products but I love using this set very much! I even recommended it to my mom, sister and soon to-be brother in-law. Both me and my spouse face becomes more smoother, fine line is gone and just beautiful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new facial product ever since the Nivea Q10 products stopped being sold in the U.S.A. and I&#x27;ve finally found something!   This Aveeno anti-aging system is really good!   My skin felt better in less than a week!   My skin is smoother and stays uniformly moisturized all day.  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes with the slightest exercise.  The cleanser isn&#x27;t abrasive or irritating and I like having a day moisturizer that has sunscreen and a night cream that does not.  Neither moisturizers are greasy and the eye cream is also good, but does not have any spf.</li>
    <li> As and almost 30 something I have been looking for a skin care product that works to help ward off those fine lines.  This product leaves my skin feeling soft and looking great.  After two weeks of use I can definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> Expensive for what is in the kit.</li>
    <li> Well package just thought it was little big bigger. I like how it feels on skin, cleanser and creams makes skin smoothy and soft. Im young to talk about the wrinkles cuz i still dont have, but it makes your skin brighter and you noticed it.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for $25 gift limits. ..Great products in one box.. . .Have never seen this combination in the stores.. .Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and really helped me when I was suffering from extremely dry skin. It feels really good day to day also.</li>
    <li> Good for holiday gift</li>
    <li> I am lucky to have pretty nice skin but it was looking a little dull and tired.  This system is wonderful.  It firms the skin and smooths out fine lines.  I feel like I look 10 years younger.  It also does not break out my skin like many other products.  I have found the night cream to be a little heavy so have been using the day cream, eye cream and cleanser.  Finally, a product that does what it promises.</li>
    <li> I have used Cetaphil for a long time as my morning moisturizer and decided to try something for my eyes and night time.  I bought the System and i do like it.  Leaves your skin soft and seems to make a difference.  I am not expecting miracles by any means, but I think it does help.  I would recommend.  Update as of 2/11/11-I really like this kit.  My skin is very soft so I bought the individual night and day cream as well as the cleanser.  I haven&#x27;t had to buy the eye cream yet because you don&#x27;t need much which means it last a while. Having said that, everyones skin is different so you have to find moisturizers that work for your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d have to say I am impressed with this kit. I purchased this after seeing reviews on here and wanted to give it a try to combat the fine lines that were appearing around my eyes. I&#x27;m happy to report that I saw results in the reduction (in some cases elimination) of the fine lines around my eyes, though it hasn&#x27;t done anything for the under eye bags or the purple-ish tint in the inside corners of my eyes.     I&#x27;d like to point out for us girls who have the Normal/Combination skin (I have an oily t-zone, normal everywhere else) that these products are heavy. The moisturizers were great when I first started using them, but with the extended use I see a difference with my skin&#x27;s oil production. I&#x27;ve never been able to handle SPF in my moisturizers and the day-time moisturizer in the kit is SPF 30 so that is probably the culprit.  While using the night cream, if I had my window open during the night or if it was a little too humid I would wake up in the morning and my face would feel heavy and almost like the moisturizer didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin.     I give this kit the 4 stars because the sizes are generous and the products work!</li>
    <li> It is really good for your complexion and the price is excellent.  I use it every night and day.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products and was expecting this to be great, but I was a little disappointed.  I love the eye cream, the night and day cream, but the wash is the part I don&#x27;t love so much.  It&#x27;s not as thick and exfoliating as I would like.  I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get my face as clean as I would like (I have combination skin), and it doesn&#x27;t remove make up all that well.  Other then the face wash I would recommend the rest of the products.  The day lotion is by far my favorite item and I will continue buying that.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;m 35 and a redhead, so fair, sensitive skin. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; skin regimen.  I&#x27;m getting married in a few weeks and decided no time like the present!  This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave me oily at any point.  After just four days, my skin feels softer and looks more even.  I&#x27;ve also been using the eye and day cream on a deep crease I have in my neck (recently lost a bunch of weight) and it&#x27;s improving that.  I&#x27;ve also been applying it on just one hand and can notice a difference in dryness and creasing.  Another huge plus is that with the exception of the night cream (perhaps because it&#x27;s thicker) a little bit goes a long way, especially with the cleanser.  I maybe use a dime size amount.  The eye cream is nice to give a pleasant little massage around the eye area with your ring finger.    Anyway, I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was tired of putting on so much concealer to hide the fact that I work too much and sleep too little which made me look a lot older than I am, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to do anything.  To my surprise, my skin looks amazing.  I&#x27;ve noticed, even my friends have noticed and asked me about it, and the best part is I&#x27;ve been able to go for the natural for the first time in years - I feel completely confident going without concealer, foundation etc.</li>
    <li> I love this set so far. I have been using it for a week now, and can already notice a difference in my skin. I think it smells great too! I was using the TimeWise line from Mary Kay, and I felt like it was making my skin worse.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This set has done wonders for my skin! It&#x27;s almost looks like it not only reduced the fine lines in my skin but it evened out my skin tone as well. I definitely feel more confident about going out of the house without applying a foundation or mineral powder. I especially like the SPF-30 in the day moisturizer. It&#x27;s a good trial size to the Positively Ageless line of Aveeno. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this because I thought it would be pretty natural and good for sensitive skin but I was disappointed. I am not saying it is a bad product but it gave me an allergic reaction right away. I do have very sensitive skin and perhaps one of the ingredients caused the topical reaction which looked like red bumps all over my face. I wish I knew which ingredient caused the reaction so I could stay away from it in the future but I didn&#x27;t want to keep using it to find out. I passed it on to my mom, she has tougher skin and can probably benefit from it more than me.</li>
    <li> The cleanser was great. I love that it exfoliates gently. Some scrubs are really harsh. The smell was pleasant, too. I have oily skin so finding moisturizer, especially night time moisturizer, can be tricky. This was light and didn&#x27;t turn me into an oil slick. If you needed heavy duty moisture, I don&#x27;t know how much this would help you. For my needs, it was just right.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend ordered this and she really likes it a lot.  She has ordered other products and been disappointed.  She is very happy with this one and the way it has made her face look and feel.  I have noticed a difference as well.  I will be ordering it for myself when I run out of what I am using now.</li>
    <li> First off, I am only 24. I&#x27;m using all of these products as a preventative measure for problems further down the road. My review is based off of this intention. I have normal to oily skin and slightly uneven texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the array of products included in this anti-aging system. It&#x27;s *all* here for you; an eye cream, daily/nightly lotions, and a gently exfoliating facewash! Most sets come with three products, so I feel like this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step is cleansing, and this facewash feels great. It&#x27;s got a great, gently exfoliating texture and hardly any scent at all. This is something I really appreciate. It leaves my face feeling fresh and soft. It doesn&#x27;t do any heavy-duty exfoliation, but it definitely gets the job done. There is a lot of product in this tube as well, I feel like it will last me until my next automatic delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second would be eye cream. I also really like the texture of this cream and it doesn&#x27;t make the skin around my eyes burn. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but tons of other products irritate my eyes like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two face lotions are great as well, very little scent and a light texture. They are heavy enough to moisturize everything and I stay hydrated all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m quite pleased with this set. I have used it 4 weeks now and I see a noticeable difference in my skins evenness and texture. I feel great not having any makeup on at all!</li>
    <li> I switched to Aveeno products about three years ago after I got tired to paying top dollar for premium department store cosmetics.  In my experience I can say that Aveeno products are just as good, if not better, than any department store cosmetic line, and the Positively Ageless Complete Anti-Aging System is an outstanding cosmetic regimen.  The exfoliating cleanser works great for my skin type, and the day and night creams are the perfect consistency.  I also use the eye cream daily and nightly, and it really does reduce wrinkles and puffiness around my eyes.   I have used this Aveeno Anti-Aging System a little over three months, and at age 51 I feel like my skin looks fresher, healthier, and has fewer lines.  You simply can&#x27;t beat the price and quality of Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I like Aveeno body lotion so thought I&#x27;d try their face care.  Surprised that the individual containers are so small, but then it is supposed to hook you, not overwhelm you.  And if one doesn&#x27;t like it, I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Especially like the facial scrub.  Skin feels really clean.</li>
    <li> Love it, this is great.  To bad I can&#x27;t buy it locally.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find this System and give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST: check the expiration date on the box really carefully. Out of three sets on the store shelf (I purchased my box in Target), two were more than 6 months behind the expiration date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my set every morning and evening for 6 weeks following all the rules and recommendations, and I have to say I don&#x27;t see any visible results whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the tubes is very nice. The scent of the products is very light and pleasant. The feeling of the product on my skin is quite nice. But I don&#x27;t see ANY improvements. Alas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase this set again for myself? NO.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this set to anyone? NO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using 2 Aveeno products together. My skin needs lots of help right now. I was using Ageless Vitality and suddenly couldn&#x27;t find it. I finally saved enough money to splurge and decided to see what Aveeno product I could find to use. I read rave reviews about Positively Ageless and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser leaves my skin squeaky clean. I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and have decided I don&#x27;t want to use it on my eyelids or lips any more. I read the instructions and they say it can be used to remove makeup, but I have a different cleanser I&#x27;m going to continue to use to remove my mascara with. Then I wash my face with the Positively Ageless cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can already see a huge improvement in my skin. My pores are smaller and the wrinkles under my eyes that have been driving me crazy are greatly reduced already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the 2 Aveeno products together takes a little more time, but as I said, my skin needs lots of help. I&#x27;m going to be looking for a job and don&#x27;t want to have old lady skin. Ageless Vitality Elasticity Recharging System really works. I was very impressed with it when I was using it daily. I couldn&#x27;t believe how it helped my skin. Aveeno makes great products and at a reasonable price. You can&#x27;t go wrong no matter which one you choose.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveeno products for the past few years and I have not had any problems with it....this particular package is wonderful to use for traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my mom as present for her birthday and she was very very  happy. thank you</li>
    <li> Not my favorite product by far.  I will continue to use but will not re-buy.  My skin has awlays been dry but with this product leaves it extra dry and I am not happy with that.  Also the SPF in the lotion tends to burn when I put it on but that usually happens with all spf.</li>
    <li> I have used every different anti-aging regimen that I can think of, always to be disappointed. I saw an add for this set in a magazine and decided to give it a try since every other Aveeno product that I have used for dry skin has worked extrememly well. If this product works as well for you as it has for me, you will not have to wait four weeks to see younger looking skin. You should notice it in under a week. It goes on very smooth without causing you the stretch the under eye skin to get it to absorb. It has a very pleasant fragrance and the facial wash feels so good. A little goes a long way with these products. That is always a positive thing. Give it a try! I&#x27;m tired of throwing away my money to see zero results just like so many of you are. This one will not let you down!</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the facial scrub; the instructions said to use it every morning and every evening which I did.  But after using it several times I had rubbed a layer of skin right off my cheeks right under my eyes.  I had to stop using that item.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed that the facial scrub was emollient and can&#x27;t imagine why one would use that twice a day every day.  After a week I am again using the other three items with no problems  but I cannot use the scrub.  Otherwise I do like the product.</li>
    <li> I just turned 29 and wanted to start a good face regiment. This is a great product! One week into it and I can already tell a huge difference!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Aveeno for a few years and I do love it. I use a combination of Positively Ageless, Rx for brown skin and Shiseido Ibuki line. I always get compliments on how good my skin looks. I even had a woman come up and touched my face in Hone Depot once. I was shocked. My husbands eyes got big and he just walked away in disbelief. I was just speechless that this woman would be bold enough to walk up to a complete stranger and touched their face. No matter how good it looks. Lol!!!</li>
    <li> I started used this about a year ago. the system with cleanser, day cream and night cream works good for me other than the eye serum, which only make the wrinkles around my eyes more visible, so I didn&#x27;t use it much. Anyways the night cream was really good, in the morning felt the skin felt more smooth and even (so looked beautiful). day cream has high spf, so it should help sun exposure, but I started getting acnes and more sun tan even if I go for a little while in the sun. so discontinued the use. Otherwise it works fine. This will help more for indoor person</li>
    <li> I love it!  I wish I had found it earlier.  If you are in my age range (50-60), I think you will love it, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for close to a month and a half. I absolutely loved them all the first couple weeks, however, while I 100% love the cleanser and the eye serum, the moisturizers have been lackluster. My usually dry skin has become slightly oily and broken out lightly in an area, I think its because the moisturizers are a little lighter and my skin produced excess oil to compensate. Either way, I swear by your cleanser and just bought the Positively Ageless scrub! :)</li>
    <li> I usually like AVEENO products, use their baby line all the time for my kids. I was expecting this set to be just as good as any other baby aveeno product but....Cleaners is probably the best item of the set. Night and day creams are fine, absorb quickly and skin feels comfortable. However, the eye cream makes my eye area so stiff that I want to wash it off immediately, and I did... Maybe it&#x27;s because of the anti-aging lifting effect but it just not comfortable and doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture.</li>
    <li> I bought this collection for my mother and she absolutely loves it! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this product.</li>
    <li> Each step starting with the cleanser is light and refreshing. The eye cream is gentle and feels soothing. The day cream feels light even though it has 30spf. The night cream is my favorite. It is rich yet goes on lightly. I love the pack for travel.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this product because I saw some other reviews that it at least lightened skin, and helped smooth some fine lines.  Well, I have been using it every day and every night for about a month now, and I&#x27;ve seen no difference.  I&#x27;m 32, and have some fine lines that were not smoothed at all.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle worker, but I thought maybe just a little bit of a difference.  After the first few days, I thought I saw a little bit of a difference, but then it stopped.  I&#x27;m going to use it till I run out, but I think my next purchase will be the Ole Henriksen line.  Hopefully that will help.  It basically does it&#x27;s job as a moisturizer, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> For a few extra dollars I bought not only my eye cream but got a bundle: night cream, day lotion and cleanser. Ive been using it for a few days now and my face feels replenished. I will even consider purchasing it in the future as a gift for other women.</li>
    <li> So far I am enjoying this product, although I have to admit I chuckled when I used the day moisturizer for the first time - it looks, smells and feels like regular ol&#x27; 30 proof sunscreen. Also, they give you such a small bottle of moisturizer (it would have received 5 stars otherwise), I feel like I&#x27;m going to run out! We&#x27;ll see how it goes; maybe I&#x27;ll be mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say - I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin is less dry/flakey and is 3x softer than it was. Although it might look like it&#x27;s regular ol&#x27; sunscreen, there&#x27;s definitely some good stuff in those bottles! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, something to note... I have VERY sensitive skin, and I have not had a reaction to this product (I break out in hives). For those looking for a gentle skin care product, look no further.</li>
    <li> A gift for mom that I know she will appreciate and use. I love Aveeno</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno&#x27;s body lotion and thought this starter kit would be the same. My skin is sensitive and this kit made it even more sensitive. After using the \\&quot;Starter Regimen\\&quot; for only two weeks, my skin started to burn and it even became flaky. I gave Aveeno&#x27;s face care product a try, but do not recommend these products at all. I became a fan of Biotherm -- it&#x27;s worth spending (a little) more money.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin dry, under eye areas are horrible. Just waste of money because I am not going to use it. :( Probably, it is my type of skin, but very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and recently started experiencing red blotchy spots on my cheeks and forehead. This product line did not fix that problem after 3 weeks of faithful use. In fact it stung when applied, especially the eye cream. I just Started using CeraVe products yesterday and already my skin looks clearer and healthier.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno and it works great but I cannot vouch for positively Ageless bit. It is fine and does not clog the pores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my mother and she loves all the products. works well for her aging skin. great investment.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it works well on my skin. I have previously used many products that say the are gentle and have not had great luck.</li>
    <li> I thought everything working together would be great</li>
    <li> Sunscreen is too greasy, facial scrub is amazing though! Didn&#x27;t really cared for the eye cream nor the night cream. I&#x27;m def buying the facial scrub from now on!</li>
    <li> This is for aging skin. I use all Aveeno products and they are great i feel like this is the best products on the market for skin and face products. This product definitely works i do see results with using it everyday. Comes with day and night creams. I recommend this Aveeno products for all ages.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Aveeno set for about 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t see much of a change. They eye firming cream is not eye firming. If you use the exfoliating scrub, then the eye firming serum and then the daily moisturizer (as directed) there is a bit of a burn for about a minute after the application and it makes my skin red for about 10/15 minutes. I am a little disappointed with the &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; or lack thereof. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on the set, especially since it&#x27;s pretty much travel size.</li>
    <li> Made my skin incredibly dry and after a few days of the routine, the daily moisturizer started to burn my skin.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product. The cleanser is wonderful, always makes my face feel fresh and clean. The eye serum is lightweight and quickly absorbs. My favorite is the night cream! It has a heavier feel but I kind of like that in a night cream because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it rubs off easily. The only negative to me is the daytime moisturizer. I like to wear mine under makeup but this one is a bit too heavy so I use it very sparingly. All in all, I have seen a softer, finer texture to my skin with diminished pore size. The darker areas under my eyes have improved quite a bit as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have terrible, over worked man skin!  Aveeno products are the only thing I have found that can even get my hands and feet remotely soft.  I recently started using their facial products and I am very happy with them.  I use the sunscreen everyday and the really like the way leaves no residue.  As a man, trying to take care of my skin, there is no problem with using Aveeno products.  No smell, simple packaging and no stupid pictures on the box.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have never purchased anti-aging products before, but I am almost 25 and I&#x27;m seeing very fine lines on my face! So I went to the store and bought this product. Now I have only been using this for a few days, but I have noticed some difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-my face feels wonderful &amp; not greasy like it usually is. I believe the few negative comments I read about this product about dryness was because they did not have the right skin type. I have naturally oily skin and my skin is perfectly hydrated without being shiny :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I had a scratch on my face from my daughter (I had to cut her nails) &amp; I swear this product sped up the healing process! So amazing, I mean really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Clears acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My eyes appear brighter &amp; less sleep deprived than they usually do! *strikes a sexy smolder*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer I use this, I&#x27;m sure I will see even more of an improvement.I am on a tight budget, but this was defiantly worth the money if you have oily skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my Mom. She has been using Aveeno shower products because she has sensitive skin and breaks out easily, so she was excited about this product.</li>
    <li> I always wonder when I order a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; kit of something if there will be enough product for me to actually use and evaluate it.  This kit has everything and the containers are full-sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all but the day cream, which doesn&#x27;t provide quite enough moisture for my skin type.  I really like the cleanser.  It does a good job without being irritating.  The granules for exfoliation are very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry and very sensitive.  I had no issues with sensitivity to any of these Aveeno products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend using Aveeno because I have seen a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
    <li> Male 40 years old love this product used daily and it shows when I am among my friends of same age.</li>
    <li> I love the Aveeno Positively Ageless line of skin care, and this 4-pack of the essentials is a great bargain.My skin is looking firmer and more radiant. the sunscreen in the daily moisturizer does an excellent job. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love these products but they are so hard to find packaged like this in local stores, and was glad to have found them here.  I have dry itchy skin and so need extra moisturizing...these are great!  The Aveeno products were recommended to me many years ago by my son&#x27;s pediatrician.  He had skin ailments and the Aveeno products were soothing for him, so I&#x27;ve continued to use their products.</li>
    <li> The product was no better and no worse than any other cleansers or moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, but I was disappointed for a couple of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Sulfates&lt;br /&gt;2)VERY strong odor - reminiscent of the perfumes my grandmother wore, and very chemical-smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had expected something a little more natural. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have made that assumption just because they slapped a leaf on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microbeads in the cleanser did feel good on my skin without being scratchy, but I think exfoliating twice a day is excessive.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, works well</li>
    <li> The eye cream was actually very drying to my under eye area.  The facial wash lasted about 1 1/2 weeks, and was just okay.&lt;br /&gt;The day and night creams were just okay, and not that moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I bought this starter set for my sister who loved it so much that she went and bought more. I tried it, though, and I am not impressed. It is nowhere near the quality of the lotions I&#x27;ve been using. My skin always feels dry when using this. The smell is the worst thing, however. I&#x27;m an not that oversensitive to smells, but there should definely be a scent-free version. I can&#x27;t use this. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> Thank you the item is great!</li>
    <li> brought this for my wife she loves it uses it every night.she says when she gets low not to let her run out.</li>
    <li> used aveeno before but very disappointed in this line.  The only product that I felt was benedificial was the scrub.  Yet it did not compare to others I&#x27;ve used.  I could not tell the difference between the day or evening moisturizer and the eye cream flaked off when it dried.  I have mature skin so mature skin can make a pretty good assessment to products.  The moisturizer did not get obsorbed or rathe my skin which is dry did not benefit from the moisturizers.  It does immediatelly with plain ole coconut oil.  The benefit is that for the price you get to try out the product line without too much expense in diisappointment.</li>
    <li> Excellent product !!!!</li>
    <li> After an extend research for a lotion to even my skin tone, reduce dark spots and fine lines I end up with Aveeno Positively Ageless. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I can see the results. My face looks clean, brighter and the dark spots reduced. I totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> Totally awesome  , saw a difference in 2 days , will continue to use , loving it x</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Aveeno products. This is my first time trying the positively ageless line and I really like all of the products in this kit. It makes my skin look great! My only complaint is that I wish the moisturizer and night cream came in larger tubes. I will definitely purchase these products again.</li>
    <li> The face creams leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized with out being too greasy. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for the right product and I&#x27;m so happy to have come across positively ageless by Aveeno. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t overdo it like most products out on the market. Bonus: it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I am 23 with normal skin, thinking I would try this product because I love Aveeno body lotion. It reacted really harshly with my skin. In the beginning I broke out upon using it (I rarely break out), but that went away after a few days. From the beginning I felt a burning sensation every time I put it on, thinking that it would subside with use. After a few weeks, the skin on my face had flaked and cracked and was drier than when I use no moisturizer at all. Unfortunate due to the amount I paid for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Day cream leaves a film, but wash and night cream are awesome!</li>
