      <li>was very glad to find this in the new, economical larger size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was recommended by our pediatrician and it really did help my son a lot with his dry skin! Would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works on dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  My hands are always in water which make them sound like sand paper.  I use some of the Lubriderm and my hands feels so soft.  I also use it as a moisturerizer on my face.</li>
    <li> Use it daily. A good buy.</li>
    <li> I have eczema so this lotion is really good for dry skin. Plus, it&#x27;s really thick, so you have to work the lotion on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t easily fade away as soon as you apply it. I highly recommend this product. So after subscribing to it and thinking it was really cheap, I stroll into Walmart one day to find that the shelf price was $1 cheaper than Amazon&#x27;s subscribe&amp;save option, but this bottle also had a \\&quot;$1 off instantly\\&quot; coupon on it.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical that this would help with the bumps on my upper arms (keritosis pilaris) since it seemed like nothing else helped but this honestly has! My KP has improved so much that I am no longer embarrassed to wear short sleeves!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin patches on my elbows, I guess from resting my arms on my desk. I had applied lotion at least once a day for a few weeks with no improvement. I bought this lotion and within a few days the dry patches were gone. I highly recommend it. The lotion feels greasy when you first apply it, but that feeling goes away fairly quickly. It is cheaper at walmart.</li>
    <li> We love this lotion! My husband and I both work at a hospital and this lotion is great for dry hands. It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly. This price is great for this size. It does not burn my hands like some lotions do and it heals cracks quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lubriderm therapy lotion for many years now and I have to say its the very best of its kind really hydrates the skin and leaves a smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about [[ASIN:B003JT4S7U LUBRIDERM Advanced Therapy Lotion, 24 Ounce]].  This lotion is thicker than the regular Lubriderm product and lasts so much longer.  My hands are very dry and it&#x27;s even worse after my pool exercises.  I use this lotion twice daily...and that replaces the hourly applications of other lotions that I have tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing worse than waking up because my hands are dry and beginning to crackle!  That hasn&#x27;t happened since I found this particular product and purchasing through Amazon costs far less than what I was paying at the drug store.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> The lotion is soft and non-greasy.  It glides on and absorbs pretty good.  It does not have an overpowering smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so soft, i rub it all over my wife before we go to bed. It is wonderful</li>
    <li> love the product, gives all day moisturizing. I have been using this product in a long time and I love it.</li>
    <li> excellent product recommended for future purchases, I hope to continue buying their products in the future, thank you very much in advance</li>
    <li> It is not greasy and hydrates my very dry skin and love the scent. So that is why I gave it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I think this dried out my skin more than it moisturized. I used this in late spring when my skin was just a bit dry and it made no difference/made it a little more dry. I can&#x27;t even imagine what it would have been like if I used it in winter. Switched back to Eucerin and my skin is once again soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> Hello the cream do I come torn and empty because they packed it badly, that solution can give me? I could not write before, but I want to know because they sent the cream badly embada and if they were sending theirs other one, not to lose my money</li>
    <li> We had been using regular Lubriderm &amp; I thought this would be even better, but...My husband put it on his arms last night and today woke up with flaming red skin with a million itchy bumps!</li>
    <li> Worth money for a large size.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion! I couldn&#x27;t believe what a great price I got for such a large size. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with eczema for years! And to make matters worse, my skin is really sensitive and reacts to almost every lotion on the market. After I shower, my skin is terribly dry, flaky, and won&#x27;t stop itching! I tried Eucerin which my doctor recommended before and it felt so heavy and thick on my skin, I felt like my skin couldn&#x27;t breath, and the itching didn&#x27;t stop. I threw in the trash only a few days after purchasing it. I saw the Lubriderm cream when I was in Right Aid and was curious, so I bought it. Smells nice, I pretty like it. Best of all, my skin feels well moisterized the whole day! I don&#x27;t get ashy a few hours after application as I did before, my skin feels nice and soft and my eczema seems to have disappeared. I almost forgot I had it! I also had lines (somewhat like cracks) on my skin from chronic dehydration and I noticed these disappeared after using this lotion only for a few days. Highly recommend this lotion to anyone with sensitive skin! I myself, will definitely be buying this product again!!!</li>
    <li> I will get this again for sure, such a great value!!!</li>
    <li> The lotion is alright but the pump didn&#x27;t work so it&#x27;s a pain to use.  I wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> Warning! I accidentally found the same product 24Fl. Oz. for 8.99 at my local Target. (And it&#x27;s NOT on sale..) Just be aware and check before your purchase.</li>
    <li> I think this lotion would be fine for normal to slightly dry skin. Or for use as an after sun lotion in summer. But for winter dry or very dry skin it is just not good enough. It is non greasy so it would make a good lotion to keep at your desk. If you need a lotion for very dry winter skin, try Vaseline Intensive Care Rescue Repairing Lotion, Gold Bond Ultimate Healing, or Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Calming Creme. All three work very well on extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> actually I bought it for my aunt and she liked it very much, it is very soothing and softening for her.</li>
    <li> Great lotion to help with dry skin.  Tried a number of other products, they did not do much.  Lubriderm Advance solved the issue with 3 days of use.  Why Amazon vs local stores?  16 oz bottle was more costly at 3 other locations then this 24 oc bottle.  Money saver if you are a prikme member as well.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- 24oz is huge! enough for daily use for 9 months&lt;br /&gt;- great brand for low price&lt;br /&gt;- I like the push dispenser. better than digging my hands in cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I typically use [[ASIN:B002BWOXZ8 Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 16-Ounces]], which lasts for 6 months. I find that this moisturizing cream is longer lasting and lets your skin retain moisture for longer (with that elastic feeling). I also noticed that for 24 oz, this product is actually cheaper than the 16 oz moisturizing cream by a considerable amount. I believe the above is the reason why the manufacturer prices them differently. You pay for what you get! :)</li>
    <li> My local store stopped carrying this product for some reason so this price can&#x27;t be beat!!!Fast shipment and  a really good deal.</li>
    <li> A staple in our house.&lt;br /&gt;1. goes on easy.&lt;br /&gt;2. thick and satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;3. takes care of the whole family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as my Mom says -- Don&#x27;t go in for the ruse that you need one kind of cream on your face, another under your eyelids, another for your legs etc...

    <li> you get a better price per quantity also this is the best lotion for very dry skin even doctor recomend</li>
    <li> Been using Lubriderm for many years and it seems to do the trick for me.  Not a complete solution to the winter skin blues, but does a reasonable job keeping my skin comfortable without being greasy or sticky.  Got several in the house in various places so I can always get a blob.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so hydrated.  I like the pump bottle and the smell, while not being overwhelming is pleasant.</li>
    <li> Very good, although still a bit sticky, but much better than cetaphil, and this advanced therapy really does a better job than the daily moisture lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it every time after a shower. non-greasy, yet moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using it for several years, its the best. Not too greasy but leaves your skin moist. Great choice.</li>
    <li> Great overall moisturizer. Works well on all body parts.  Works instantly and lasts all day.  I recommend this even if it costs more than other lotions.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I meant by that, but this stuff moisturizes well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and stays pretty well - not needing to be reapplied repeatedly. Good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin so silky smooth</li>
    <li> I have incorporated Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Lotion into my routine during my first pregnancy. It makes my skin feel so smooth, nourished and NOT Dry, itchy or flakey. Has vitamin E in the ingredients which is great for skin during pregnancy. I use this as an all over body lotion as well, especially after getting out of the shower and after I have shaved!</li>
    <li> Best lotion and I won&#x27;t use any other.  I&#x27;ve tried too many lotions and this is only one that gets rid of dry skin.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this from a local drug store because my skin has been really scaly and dry in the cold winter. It isn&#x27;t as greasy as other products i&#x27;ve used, which is the main reason i purchased the product. i HATE greasy lotions that make you feel like you need to wash your hands after using it. Most of the time i&#x27;d rather have dry hands than greasy hands. This lotion was a good purchase, and i might keep buying it as needed.</li>
    <li> My skin is always very dry, and I have terrible psoriasis in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried so many ultra-moisturizing body creams, lotions, salves, butters...But I SWEAR BY THIS LOTION. It is by far, the only product I&#x27;ve used that can battle, treat and even prevent my red, itchy skin and psoriasis. Not only that, but it&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly, non-greasy, easy to work with and the smell is very light. I apply after every shower, when my skin is damp and hydrated, which allows the lotion to glide on easily, and create a nice protective barrier for the day!</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Big bottle and fair price.  I hate shopping in stores for this stuff, so I set up the subscribe and save.  Makes life a bit easier.  This is a decent lotion.  That said, I am a guy, so what do I know.</li>
    <li> excellent product and quality.  Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I am Australian and first used this product whilst I was travelling in the USA in 2011. I now order  it through Amazon from Australia. Fantastic moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my legs itching in the middle of the night.  I deduced this was cause by swimming every day.  A co swimmer suggested I try this product and I did and I have no more itching.  After each swim I rub in a small amount on each leg and I can sleep all night.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and he loves this lotion, fast asorbing is what he likes about it, and unscented. Yay!</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with my kerotosis Polaris. This body lotion changed my life. I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t come back so soon. I forget to moisturize for a day and it starts to come back. But overall , it feels great on skin and helps to keep skin soft.</li>
    <li> Love how soft my hands and feet are after this. I have dry calluses and this helped them a ton! Will keep using!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion--I have been using this llotion for about 2 years.. I have dry feet and this has made them stay nice all winter.  I only put it on once a day and it is GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this size because I use it up so fast.... I can not use all lotions as I break out, but with this one I do not.</li>
    <li> Especially in the winter, the skin on my hands gets crazy dry.  This is the only lotion that helps.  Other lotions don&#x27;t do as good of a job</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. I use this every day after showering and it feels good on the skin. I do have dry skin and this seems to keep it moist.  There is a faint scent but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  The reason I bought it here on Amazon was due to the price. The drugstore carries this at a higher price.</li>
    <li> LUBRIDERM IS VERY GOOD FOR VERY DRY SKIN.  IT RUBS ON SMOOTH AND SOOTHING TO THE SKIN. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Hi love the Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Lotion. It keep my dry skin from itching. Nothing seemed to work until I tried this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is good until you use cetaphil lotion. lubriderm is my second choice.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion. Helps most dried skin survive in winter. Also helped while pregnant (fall thru early spring). No claws on my belly.&lt;br /&gt;Update post delivery....and did not get stretch marks when I use it in combination with olive oil.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product, since it is the only one that works for her Keratosis pilaris (benign rash, red bumps, aka \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot;). By the way, I would advise against using the last description... Anyway, the cost of this product is exceptionally low compared to brick-and-mortar stores. Try this calculation and you&#x27;ll see the same: (cost of in-store product) / (ounces of in-store product) x (24 ounces). This apples-to-apples comparison lets you know how much you can save and, believe me, it adds up quickly! If you already use this product, purchasing it on Amazon is a no-brainer. If you&#x27;re considering this as a new customer, I say just go for it. Even if you are unhappy with the results, chances are very good you know someone who will benefit from it and would surely appreciate the quantity.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really, really good and moisturizes well. I would definitely recommend this product to other people out there.</li>
    <li> I am purchasing this for the second time.  The price is right.  It lasts for almost two months.  It is also fragrance-free.  AND it works well for dry skin.</li>
    <li> The best hand lotion I&#x27;ve found. Lasts longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;I was very glad to find this in the new, economical larger size. I had previously only found it in tubes.</li>
    <li> LUBRIDERM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST MOISTURIZING CREAM &amp; YOU CAN KEEP IT ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO TAKE IT, WHETHER UNDER THE SUN OR IN THE COLD, LUBRIDERM HAS PROVEN TO ME &amp; MANY CUSTOMERS THAT IT IS THE BEST CREAM OUT THERE. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CHANCE AND BUY IT</li>
