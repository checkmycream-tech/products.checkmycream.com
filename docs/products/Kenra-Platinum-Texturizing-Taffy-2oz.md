      <li>Love Love Love!</li>
      <li>(I prefer to make my own or go without), but if you don&#x27;t style your pixie right, you don&#x27;t look so good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product that lasts a long time and keeps your hair smelling great.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and washes out easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got my haircut a few months back and my stylist used this to ease some of the massive frize and static from my hair. I fell in love with it instantly and the smell is my favorite. Will order more soon!</li>
    <li> Product showed up with a broken cover. Some product had leaked out and the broken cover makes it impossible to use while travelling.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love it, holds your style while not being to stiff and it smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I have very short hair with lots of layers.  This product is great for texturizing my hair with how my hair is cut in lots of layers.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great and you only need a tiny bit and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Gave used for several years. Will not weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> The best texturizing paste.  They use it in my salon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this taffy for over a year now and love it. It tames frizz, and also helps guide styling. This taffy doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily or wet at all. The smell is also wonderful. Just a little on your fingertips does the trick. This container will last a LONG time. I highly recommend this stuff- it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Kenra Hair Taffy.  It has lasting, holding power.  I have short hair and use the taffy to create a \\&quot;stick up\\&quot; do.  The product does a great job even when it is humid out.  It also has a nice fresh smell.  I would recommend this product to everyone that wants a firm, lasting hold on their hair.</li>
    <li> Good product, makes my hair exactly how I want it! But.... since ive been using this product ive been getting these REALLY bad pimples right on my hairline, nownits not just a couple pimples my whole hairline on my forehead is red!! So i searched ingredients that cause acne and I was stunned when I saw this products ingredients... it has 4 ingredients that are known for causing bad acne, there are: OLETH-3, OLETH-10, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE and TRIETHANOLAMINE. I suggest not getting this product, there are many other taffys that are acne free.</li>
    <li> Great hair texturizing product. A little dab will do you just fine. Smells nice and washes out easily. My hair always looks better styling with it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works well without weighing down. This is my second jar.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! As others have stated, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to get the look you want.  I have short pixie hairstyle that I like to spike.  This product does it without making my hair stiff or wet looking. I am SO happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone! Also smells great too!</li>
    <li> This taffy is the perfect texture to work with fine hair.  Not too heavy or sticky.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is the real deal.  The scent you&#x27;re expecting and the pretty lavender color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I don&#x27;t purchase from a local salon, I&#x27;m always worried the product is a &#x27;knock off.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the taffy and wondering if this product will work for you, let me tell you it is the BEST thing I&#x27;ve found for my extremely fine-and-absolutely-no-body hair.  Since I have that problem, my hair is cut very short.  I use the taffy to give volume to the top and the wispy bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s allowed me to go three weeks between salon visits instead of two, because I can &#x27;volume-ize&#x27; less as the hair grows.  I start with almost-spiked and  move to just-give-it-body as it grows.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I wish it came unscented.  The smell is nauseating.  Makes your hair shiny and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It is just the right amount of &#x27;sticky&#x27; to keep my short hair style sticking up.  It smells wonderful.  You don&#x27;t need much to get the job done.  I have used Bed Head Manipulator for years and it is quite like that product.  I still like my Bed Head and switch off between one and the other, but I will continue to purchase the Taffy product as long as it is available.  I would recommend it to a friend who liked spiky hair.</li>
    <li> Great for flyaways. Not too strong smelling. Smells like grape airheads.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great smell. Don&#x27;t eat it. It doesn&#x27;t taste as great as the smell. Nope, it&#x27;s definitely not grape laffy taffy in there...</li>
    <li> I recently went to a very short hairstyle and my hairdresser recommended this product.  I love it.  It helps maintain volume in my fine hair and it gives dimension to my style by separating out some pieces.  Beware though it does not take much, a dime size in the palm of your hand.  Just rub product onto both hands and run it through your hair.</li>
    <li> As always I love the product and I received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Holds amazing but not super stiff.</li>
    <li> I actually use this product for my long naturaly curly hair as well. Its a terrific way to tame frizz and makes oh so perfect curls. Great tool in the hair product closet!</li>
    <li> I continue to love and use this product.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this stuff.  Smells good though.  I gave the jar away to a kid who likes to spike his hair.  If you don&#x27;t want spikes, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a very long time, it is the best texturizing product on the market (IMO)....and it smells AMAZING!!!  Product received as shown and with 2 days.  Very happy!!  Will buy again since it&#x27;s cheaper here than it is at the store.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and you only need to use a little.</li>
    <li> This is the best texturizing taffy I have ever purchased.  My hair dresser used this on my a couple of times and I ordered it to use at home myself because the smell was so great.  I have naturally curly shoulder length hair, and it adds beautiful light control and super shine!  Eliminates all the frizzies without the weigh down and greasiness of a shine spray.  Use very sparingly, a little goes a long way.  This jar will last me about 3 months.  Smells amazing, my daughter says my hair smells like her strawberry shortcake doll!  Would not recommend for guys due to this reason! I also use this for my daughter&#x27;s longer straight hair to control fly-aways and frizzyness and it works great for that also.</li>
    <li> Great product and very good price. Keeps hair manageable and if used correctly it won&#x27;t feel sticky. Hair looked good for 2 days.Shipped reasonably fast. Recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and has for 3 years, she loves it and ordering it saves going from place to place to find it.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, get alot of comments on how good my hair looks.</li>
    <li> One only  needs to use a tiny bit for body. It  doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or greasy. Natural look.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product because I asked her why her hair always looked so good.  \\&quot;It&#x27;s the Taffy.\\&quot; she said.  I found it on Amazon for less than the local salons even with shipping.  It works so well with my fine hair.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this product is perfect for me</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and it does a great job maintaining my hairstyle without making it look sticky or greasy. Does not require any real skill to apply or use a plus for those of us that don&#x27;t like to spend a ton of time on our hair but want it to look great.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I&#x27;ve used other moulding gels &amp; have a heavy feel on the hair.  This is great because it keeps the hair in place without a heavy gummy feel.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff my hairstylist uses to give texture and shape to my pixie length hair. I&#x27;m kind of cheap when it comes to beauty products (I prefer to make my own or go without), but if you don&#x27;t style your pixie right, you don&#x27;t look so good. I&#x27;ve tried 5 other tub-style beauty/drug store styling products and they&#x27;re all either too sticky, waxy, clay-like, greasy or stinky. The more I mess with my style trying to get the shape right, the more the other products break down and I&#x27;m left with hair that looks smooth and flat, just like it did before I put anything in it. UGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after 8 months of frustration, I decided to splurge on the good stuff. The Kenra Taffy gives my super fine hair texture and a piece-y look. The pieces also stay where they are put all day! It also seems to be re-workable so if it takes me a few tries to get everything right, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the styling product losing its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does smell like taffy. I&#x27;m female and I find the scent to be quite strong and a little too sugary sweet for my taste. I&#x27;m not sure how they consider it a unisex scent. I&#x27;m willing to get used to the smell, because it really works well for the style I&#x27;m trying to create.</li>
    <li> Great fixative for short pixie cut!</li>
    <li> This product is what I put in my hair after I have straightened it, but before I style &amp; spray it. I have very fine hair and it is cut in a short bob and stacked in the back. I put this in my hair to give it some fullness/body before spraying it with my Kenra hairpsray. It does not make my hair look oily and it&#x27;s not tacky, it just gives it some oomph. I love this and can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> Love it but really $$$$. It smells great and works really well. I will order more for sure in the future</li>
    <li> Been using this taffy for years and I find it much easier to just buy on-line when my supply gets low.  Prices are usually cheaper on-line thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper to order than purchase in my local salon. I have used this product for years and use it every day. I small jar last forever with my short hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  Works to get rid of frizzy hair without weighting down my already heavy, oily hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 2 years ago. I fell in love with it. I always had a problem with fly away hairs after blow drying and the taffy solved the problem. It left my hair fly away free, shiny and it smells great. I originally purchased it at a salon and they no longer carried the product. I was so happy and delighted when I did the research and found it on Amazon !!!</li>
    <li> The product I received was in a kenra container as pictured but was either, damaged,old, or a copycat. I have been using this product for several years. When this one arrived, the color , texture and smell were similar to the original but were very off.  I am very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this texturing taffy, so I decided to try it.  My hair is much too thin and fine to use it though.  It weighs my hair down and sort of leaves a greasy feeling behind.  I love the smell and I wish I could use it.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time.  It is so easy to style your hair and it helps your hair from going all over the place.  It is alot cheaper online then at the hairdressers so I usually purchase it online.  It also smells so good.</li>
    <li> I like this taffy. I like the smell.  It gives lift and texture to my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a decade.  Perfect hold and great smell.  Far superior to any hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair.  My stylist first introduced me to Texturizing Taffy when she cut my hair into a short style.  The taffy separates the hair and makes the highlights stand out more.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products on my straight, color treated hair that is thick and of short to med. length without getting the results I wanted until this one!! easy to use, good on my hair, not sticky, hard or heavy. Get up the next morning and run my hands through it to refresh the style and that&#x27;s it!!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this after a haircut and I loved it. Salons sell so much of it they seem to be out of it when I need it. Glad to be able to order it here. It shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now and love the texture-look it adds to my hair.  Is also an asset for holding stray hair in place.</li>
    <li> This texturizing taffy is the greatest finishing tool Ever for my curls.  After my styling is essentially complete, I rub just a bit of this onto my hands and lightly run through the layers with particular attention to the ends.  A little additional can be deployed for extra definition.  It provides shine, hold and smoothes out any frizzies at the ends of my hair.  Have used for years and will continue.  Ordering on Amazon is great since almost every other place I&#x27;ve purchased it frequently runs out and it has been difficult to find on occasion.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years. . .nothing handles my hair better than this stuff!  Short, spiky hair without any greasy aftereffects!!</li>
    <li> Smells Amazing!!! Works awesome! This is gooey but gives great texture to your hair. It gives perfect beach waves.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit tacky. Was surprised. But a good product and nice scent.</li>
    <li> This is the finishing touch to my hair do at home. It separates and makes my very thick hair have a good professional looking texture without a greasy feel. I do apply it every day, covering the tip of my finger, without a visible build up for as long as six days.</li>
    <li> A little Taffy allows you to style your hair before you use hairspray.....it&#x27;s wonderful and all you need is a little to do this.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this texturizing taffy!  Don&#x27;t want to ever be without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a really busy mom of 4 and never really have time to \\&quot;do\\&quot; my long, straight hair. Washing &amp; blow drying was about as good as it was getting for a while. My hairdresser/sister-in-law introduced me to this. She knows I don&#x27;t do much with my hair, but stuck a little in after a haircut one day. I didn&#x27;t suddenly have model-like hair, but this product did instantly add a little texture &amp; shine and made my hair feel wonderful all day! Not to mention the SMELL! This stuff smells like HEAVEN!! My husband will walk up &amp; just sniff my hair when I have it in :)  I love this product...and that&#x27;s coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t do hair! :)</li>
    <li> I use this when my hair is shortest, within the first two weeks of a haircut. It provides a very soft but firm hold that does not fade or droop throughout the day. And the scent is OMG incredible! I wish I could find cologne with this scent!</li>
    <li> The best product for my hair. Love the smell. Soft yet it holds. Always have used this product since I found it.</li>
    <li> Too sticky - feels like I have honey in my hair all day.</li>
    <li> It works great and only takes a little.  My hairdresser told me about this and to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juli</li>
    <li> kenra taffy works wonders in my uber short hair.  easy to apply &amp; style my hair &amp; can restyle without another application.  smells nice too.  highly recommend &amp; will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price</li>
    <li> I went to a new hair stylist that introduced me to this, and I bought it right at the salon, though after seeing the price difference now I know I should have just ordered off of amazon. A little goes a long way, but my stylist showed me that if you just swipe your finger tip in it, spread that amount on your hands and clap your hands towards your head, it breaks the fibers up and allows you to apply it much more lightly and evenly than just rubbing it in your hair, which can get pretty gunky as this stuff is STICKY! It looks like you have purple confetti coming off of your hands. I use it daily, and will continue to as I love the product.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT stuff for those who want control.</li>
    <li> this is the best texturing hair product -not greasy or heavy...and the price was $5 less than at a local shop..great deal!</li>
    <li> Kenra has great products - this is one of my favs!!  I would recommend Kenra to anyone who wants to try a great product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My hair is fine.  This product allows me to keep that kinda messy look in tact and makes my hair smell great at the same time.  Love Love Love!</li>
    <li> Everything as promised.  Would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, only wished it were not sooo expensive ! Like the way it seperates my hair, great for styling.Smell is great too.</li>
    <li> I am now on my 4th container.  It smells wonderful and it works awesome!  Great product!  Nothing works better!  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a little tricky at first but once you learn how to use it, it is exactly what you need.</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing ends of hair and before curling hair. It&#x27;s a great product that lasts a long time and keeps your hair smelling great.</li>
    <li> I love this taffy! I mainly use it as an antifrizz agent and it works great. The smell of it adds to great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this Kenra texurizing taffy at the beauty shop a year ago and didn&#x27;t care for it as my hair was med long. I got it cut short and put this in my hair, everyday I get \\&quot;Your hair looks so good, what did you do.\\&quot; \\&quot;Do you have naturally curly hair\\&quot; \\&quot;How can I get my hair to look like yours\\&quot; I have beautiful white hair mixed with dark gray and it is very pretty but this taffy makes it look just fabulous. I love this product.[[ASIN:B000Q6KZW6 Platinum Texturizing Taffy Unisex by Kenra, 2 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Love Kenra products and this is no exception.  This has been great for my short hair.  It helps give it dirty texture and helps with styling on the 2nd day.  I only wash my hair every other day.  With this product, my 2nd day is always better than my 1st day of clean hair!</li>
    <li> A little dab will do you...throw your hairspray away!  The shorter your hair is, the better the results.  This cool container of this awesome product will probably last me a year.  It is so well worth the price.</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to Kenra taffy, and I really like it with short hair.  Instead of my hair laying flat I can scratch my fingers thru my hair and give it some lift and it actually curls some.  Later in the day it seems to lay down but if I use hair spray after the taffy that problem&#x27;s solved.</li>
    <li> Great for the tossled look</li>
    <li> I love, love this stuff. I keep having to buy more because if it is not one of my three teens taking it, it is my husband... The best texturizing product on the market. Just don&#x27;t get it too close to the scalp unless you want the wet look. I use it to pull and piece my ends to finish my style.</li>
    <li> My former stylist used this product and I loved it. Switched stylists and my new one uses a different product so I purchase this for my own use at home. Great hold, wonderful scent, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I got introduced to the Kenra Platinum Texturizing Taffy by my hair stylist and was happy with the results I have had from using the product.  It works well with short hair, though its value starts to break down if you start to let your hair get long.  A little goes a long way with this, so two of these usually last me several months.  You can easily do a spiked kind of intentionally-messy look, a faux-hawk, or tons of other things with this and have it stay in place all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is kind of a matte finish that keeps the hair together but without clumping.  The product has a kind of light, almost fruit-like smell to it, which is noticeable but not overpowering.  It&#x27;s probably not what you want if you&#x27;re going off to one of those mechanical-bull riding type nightclubs.... but if you&#x27;re doing the metro/preppy/alternative club scene (or you&#x27;re a woman), you&#x27;ll probably get complements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint is that if you put it in during your morning routine and wear it all day, or go to sleep without washing it out of your hair, it tends to kind of break down and starts to develop an odor.  If you&#x27;re crashing after the clubs, probably not a big deal, just shower in the morning.  Otherwise plan on washing it out and reapplying after a long day before going back out at night.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this works like it should for the money.  I can but something similar at Walgreen for half the cost.</li>
    <li> Items arrive on time and as described</li>
    <li> completely satisfied with purchase and fast delivery</li>
    <li> ive used this stuff for years, i think the best part about it is the way it smells. but it has very good hold and works all day</li>
    <li> Best Taffy Ever for thin hair</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and this last one that was sent to me was more like a liquid than taffy. It had a strange smell to it as well. Not sure if it was tampered with or what but I will never order it from here again. Never have had an issue with it till now. It&#x27;s a great product but someone had to have messed with it. Watch out for this.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells awesome, and works perfectly on my hair.</li>
    <li> Not only does this make your hair piecey, with just a small dab of the wax, it has a great scent.  I have used it for several years, and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT TAFFY NUMEROUS TIMES. USE LIGHTLY OTHERWISE CAN GET GUMMY.</li>
    <li> I use this product when I don&#x27;t have time to do a lot of styling to my hair.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have used in a while.  I have medium/short hair with lots of layers and it is easier to style using this product.  Also, it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Good value and works great.</li>
    <li> good product. good for the short fringe of hair around my face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recommend for thin hair--makes it oily</li>
    <li> I believe the product does what it was designed to do, add texture to your hair.  I like the product.</li>
    <li> smells great... and does the job! :)  its great... I have tried many other similar products and always end up coming back to this one!</li>
    <li> I got this from a salon initially, but paid a great deal more.  I try to get these two at a time as they are perfect for short hair.  It is not too heavy, but gives me enough volume for the entire day.  The shipping was quick, and transaction was very easy.  Great seller, and no worries here.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome....looks sticky in the jar but is buttery smooth when you rub in your palms and apply to hair.  I use it to tame flyways and when I have static in my hair when it is dry outside.  It smells like cotton candy too.  Great product!</li>
    <li> great product use it all the time in my hair</li>
    <li> Here in Arizona the heat doesn&#x27;t just make one uncomfortable, it takes a toll on styled hair. Normally texturizing products tend to melt and leave one with an oily forehead and little else. This product holds up much better than any other - and I have gone through most of them.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have purchased many, many &amp;#34;hair gel&amp;#34; products.  This one works for me the very best.  I have been using it for probably 5 years now.  It&#x27;s not always easy to find in retail, but on Amazon, it&#x27;s always there!</li>
    <li> Great product-not sticky!!!!</li>
    <li> Salons don&#x27;t keep in stock here in the winter, too much overhead. Coworker complained about not getting the style right. It does help to use the right product (what the hair stylist recommended but didn&#x27;t have). Now if someone would just tell her how to use it. I can unfortunately achieve this look and no every style is not meant for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
