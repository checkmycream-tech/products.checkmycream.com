    <li> I was hoping to get this beautiful bright flowers filled wheel , well....  think again , contains 2 of each,there are 3pcs in some slots maybe in 3 of the 12 slots , not precisely the bright  colors that appear in the advertised picture and its a small wheel just so u know .</li>
    <li> Do not buy it...................................... flowers were everywhere and only received a few flowers that came out hole. The rest where all broken up. you can go to 101customnails channel to view a video I have posted to see how they came out. I open them and take them out on this video and if you watch you will see that this is not worth buying. Very disappointed. Will not buy from this buyer again......................................</li>
    <li> I am actually pretty happy...none of my flowers were broken, and I actually got 37 flowers instead of the advertised 36... I posted a couple pics of how they came for you all to see.</li>
    <li> very nice flowers comes in great colors love using them for me and friends....really not much else to say but awesome flowers</li>
    <li> Flowers aren&#x27;t as bright as they are in the picture but are nice</li>
    <li> I ordered these dried flowers and received a wheel full different color and shape rhinestones. I didn&#x27;t want that, I wanted to get the flowers &gt;&#x3D;( NO STARS FROM ME!!!!! Only reason they get one is to get my message here!!!</li>
    <li> It comes late by 3 wks ! I&#x27;ll never think to order from them again !&amp; the number of it so bad some are broken&#x27; &amp; this way of placing the flowers is so bad !</li>
    <li> Very fragile. But they are beautiful and look great layered. And can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Their cute ive bought them before but Ebay &amp; these only come With w flowers each slot/: disappointed but cznt do nothing bout it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some wonderful dried flowers out there made for nail-art, and these are definitely NOT among them. Very cheap. Most of the flowers were either half-there or broken up completely. The color variety isn&#x27;t even remotely the same as pictured, nor are they as brightly colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied to the nail AS DIRECTED, they look awful. The color changes upon adding top coat and makes your nails look like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> thanks again it work out really well thank again.</li>
    <li> Received them. Haven&#x27;t used them but love the way they look and feel.  So far very happy.</li>
    <li> Colors not as bright but they look very nice</li>

    <li> These flowers are cute but very hard to work with. They don&#x27;t sit on the nail right and break when you try to adjust them. I will not it these again nor will I recommend these. They&#x27;re cute but very frustrating to work with</li>
    <li> Very cheap product. Smears all over your nails and does not look good.</li>
    <li> I used these for my daughter who is a tween, in her manicure. They are a great accent. I also used these for my artwork and illustrations in adding the flowers to the hair of my illus. There are a lot of uses for these that go beyond just nail art. I enjoy them in all of my artwork.  I hope you found the review helpful.</li>
