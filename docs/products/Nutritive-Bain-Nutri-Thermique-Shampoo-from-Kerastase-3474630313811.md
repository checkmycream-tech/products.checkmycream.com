      <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go on and on about this wonderful product, but</li>
      <li>great shampoo for colored hair and feels more natural without all the perfume smells  </li>
      <li>PERFECT shampoo for fine and dry hair.</li>
      <li>This morning I used Panteve Pro-V Smooth and my hair feels more fantastic with this than the Kerastase Shampoo.</li>
      <li>This one was okay, nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see it sold on Amazon and the price was pretty decent.  </li>
      <li>great for colored and fine hair; keeps the color longer and it is very concentrated so you do not have to use much.</li>
      <li>This is a great shampoo but for the price I expected a better result.</li>
      <li>My hair feels smooth.</li>
      <li>Such a great product.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth, but still clean and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>Hair is clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>The first couple of times it was okay</li>
      <li>Exactly what my hair needed to get healthy again.</li>
      <li>It is more pricier than most shampoos, but I would rather pay more for something that will not only clean my hair well, but protect too.</li>
      <li>Added benefits: shiny hair and clean fragrance</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner, it makes my blonde, bleached hair look and feel super healthy!</li>
      <li>The shampoo is very good, it works so good with the hair and you only need a little of the product.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon :)</li>
      <li>The pricing was very reasonable on this item and I recieved it very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It was quick and super easy to lather, made my hair feel soft, and I was able to comb through my hair with my fingers while I rinsed it out.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my naturally wavy, wispy hair turn smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>The ends are still dry but seem to hold more moisture and are more flexible and \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>My hair is sensitive, fine, color treated and well... fried!</li>
      <li>I have used this many times in the past but the two bottles I purchased through here did not smell right or do a good job on my hair.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell dreamey, it&#x27;s an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I finally believe that I&#x27;m on my way to healthier, stronger, and hopefully, longer, hair!</li>
      <li>I think it was worth of my money.</li>
      <li>I was just trying to save some money by buying it online and it turned out to be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Kerastase  &amp;#34;Authentic&amp;#34; products are fantastic, just make sure to buy them from a reputable, authorized seller.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s defo worth the spend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am not positive about this but just want to put it out there so that I give a fair representation of my experience.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my fine limp hair so healthy and full!</li>
      <li>; (whew) is a fine product that I highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as expected!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s also very gentle on my hair.</li>
      <li>Very well packed!</li>
      <li>My hair also looks more shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this in combination with Nutritive Conditioner from the same brand</li>
      <li>Fast delivery like the product very much</li>
      <li>and like I said it&#x27;s very quick and easy to lather so a little does go</li>

      <li>Hair is soft nurish and full of life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good but price is a bit high according to quantity</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product after Dove shampoo dried out my hair.  I wash my hair every two or three days and it is much better now since I have used this product for 3 or 4 months.  It was also more than 25% cheaper on Amazon than it was at the beauty salon.</li>
    <li> Kerastase never disappoints. This shampoo leaves hair feeling soft and makes it look healthier from the first time you use it. Very good for treated hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it makes my blonde, bleached hair look and feel super healthy! I also use some other items from the same collection.</li>
    <li> My hair was severely damaged and it shed every day. After I use this shampoo, my hair feels and looks great. Why did I not know about this shampoo before? I had tried countless shampoos and it stops here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair very smooth</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS SHAMPOO...MY HAIR AND SKIN ARE DRY SINCE A MOVED TO NEW MEXICO...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M 47 AND MY HAIR IS NATURAL,I DON&#x27;T COLOR OR BLOW DRY OR DO ANYTHING TO IT, BUT AFTER WASHING AND CONDITIONING IT WAS FEELING REALLY DRY AND TANGLED. KERASTASE SAVED MY HAIR..NOW FEELS MUCH BETTER AND LOOKS HEALTHIER TOO.IT MAY BE PRICEY BUT WORH IT!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M REALLY GLAD I FOUND THIS SHAMPOO AND I WOULD RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really knock my socks off after I paid a pretty penny for it.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times now and my hair is alright.  This morning I used Panteve Pro-V Smooth and my hair feels more fantastic with this than the Kerastase Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for at least a decade.  I have thick, coarse, naturally curly hair that is about half white.  I have tried many, many brands of shampoo, both OTC and from salons.  Keristase is the best by far!  It leaves my hair so soft and silky making it unnecesary to use a conditioner.  Apparently the company has changed the formula recently.  The shampoo used to smell like a men&#x27;s aftershave.  It now has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just a tiny amount goes a long way. A dime size portion is enough to make a rich lather when I wash my shoulder length hair. It smells good and I have no tangles when I comb it out. Leaves my hair soft and silky instead of dry and frizzy like other shampoos. I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years.</li>
    <li> You know how when you put shampoo in your hair you have to put conditioner so you could comb your hair? Not with this shampoo. The moment you put it in your hair you could take a comb and comb that hair without pulling.  Hair is soft nurish and full of life. Plus, these product smell wonderful.  Love them all!</li>
    <li> The pricing was very reasonable on this item and I recieved it very quickly.  High praise for this seller!</li>
    <li> This product may have been ok exept for the smell it has a very unpleasant smell. It may have been old if it wasn&#x27;t old and it still has this odor new I would not recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this many times in the past but the two bottles I purchased through here did not smell right or do a good job on my hair. I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> i have curly hair so its naturally on the dryer side. this shampoo feels and smells great plus its really made a difference with my hair. i use this with the Kerastase deep conditioner and i have silky hair by the end of my shower!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews, but it was totally not worth the money. I have relatively dry/curly hair and this product did nothing for me. I would not buy this again, because it does not do what it says it will do. I would not recommend buying this product...and I&#x27;m an honest critic.</li>
    <li> PERFECT shampoo for fine and dry hair. A truly great product - worth the money.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is very good, it works so good with the hair and you only need a little of the product.</li>
    <li> I have only uses this product once,  I can&#x27;t say I was exactly impressed. no fragrance. I don&#x27;t want be unfair.  I will use again soon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously and highly recommend this shampoo.  The price I paid was almost half the price I normally pay at the beauty salon.</li>
    <li> I thought this shampoo was supposed to moisturize your hair. I bought the conditioner to go with it. Even with conditioner, my hair was still really dry.</li>
    <li> I love Kerastase Products!  I usually use regular shampoos but since I  got pregnant I wanted something to pamper my hair and this shampoo  left my hair looking wonderful, you could see the diference... It is expensive but you wont regret buying it!</li>
    <li> This is another great shampoo! I think it will be good for most hair types. My hair can be difficult at times, and this seems to be the one things that helps it look good.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to shell out the money for Kerastase products, and let me just say I don&#x27;t regret it one bit! I&#x27;ve just about tried almost everything under the sun-- Biosilk, Redken, Rusk, Biolage and nothing even came close to producing the results that I got from this miracle. Of course I had my concerns and was a bit skeptical as to what this shampoo can deliver and do based on all the hype and great reviews I had been reading. Almost like it was to good to be true... I have super outrageous hair, and not in the good way. Since I&#x27;m half Cuban I have pretty ethnic hair- curly, thick/coarse, dry, unruly...you name it, I had it going on. So when I tried this shampoo out last night (along with the Oleo Relax Slim Masque and Elixir Ultime) it was like butter in my hair. I have never ever in my life had my hair feel so soft, feel moisturized and be so detangled just from SHAMPOOING ALONE! It cleanses real well too. I could immediately feel the effects the second it touched my hair. It was quick and super easy to lather, made my hair feel soft, and I was able to comb through my hair with my fingers while I rinsed it out. I never in my wildest dreams would have thought a shampoo can make my hair feel so soft. It was almost like using conditioner. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about was the scent. I guess I was expecting it to be more on the potent and sweet side, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Another observation was the size. When I received the package I was a little surprised at how small the bottle was especially given the price and I didn&#x27;t think it would last me too long, but it packs a punch that I just only used about 2 quarter-sized pumps worth of it and viola! It got the job done and like I said it&#x27;s very quick and easy to lather so a little does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go on and on about this wonderful product, but just know if you&#x27;re considering it or hesitant on purchasing it... JUST GET IT! You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. Sounds weird, but it is not fruity and pungent smelling like the mass market brands that are easier to find. It does a nice job protecting hair that is blown dry every single day! Though, who knows because I stick with this brand!&lt;br /&gt;Price was great. Was shipped from Europe, and arrived safely within the expected delivery time frame.</li>
    <li> A salon recommended these products to me and I bought them.  My hair does not look or feel any different than it does with cheap shampoo I buy in the drug store.  Not sure why anyone would spend the extra money.</li>
    <li> I have used many different products before and am a firm believer in salon products; I was just looking for something different because it seems like my hair responds well to change.  This brand was recommended to me a few years back by a stylist when I got my hair permanently straightened.  I never used it then but recently my hair has been extremely dry and prone to breakage so after weeks of research, I decided to get this based on the good reviews.  The first couple of times it was okay but after several usage, I found that this product leaves buildup in my hair which can&#x27;t be remedied with a clarifying shampoo. It also leaves may hair dry which was a bummer given its reputation.  I bought the Redken clarifying shampoo and honestly feel that it leaves my hair softer and shinier and it&#x27;s a clarifying shampoo (a good one but nonetheless)!  I waited to review this shampoo because I wanted to get a good feel for it; I&#x27;ve used it about a couple months now and as much as I don&#x27;t want to given the cost, am unfortunately ready to toss the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not positive about this but just want to put it out there so that I give a fair representation of my experience.  I&#x27;ve read that you&#x27;re only supposed to use a very small amount of this shampoo.  I felt that I couldn&#x27;t do that because a small amount just didn&#x27;t seem to clean my scalp thoroughly and I suspect that this may be partially causing the excessive dryness.  Overall, I was not pleased with this shampoo and will definitely not repurchase. Wish I could return it but it&#x27;s way too late; at least I can say that I&#x27;ve tried it for myself.</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected! Too disappointed !</li>
    <li> the product did not lave the desired results.  I threw it away.  I would never buy it or recommend that someone else buy it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick coarse curly hair &amp; blowdry straight &amp; this shampoo transformed my hair! It likes like I should be in a pantene ad because that is how good it looks! :)</li>
    <li> my hair is more frizzy than ever ! expensive for nothing ! do not buy this product coz it&#x27;s a waste of ur time and money ! KERSTASE line is just another lie to steal ur money !</li>
    <li> if you have color treated hair you need this shampoo. when i use it rather than other shampoos it lengthens the life of my color.&lt;br /&gt;you should also try Kerastase leave in conditioner - saves times and leaves hair smelling good and looking great.</li>
    <li> Hair is clean and smooth. Added benefits: shiny hair and clean fragrance</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes your hair healthy and smell good!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery like the product very much</li>
    <li> great for colored and fine hair; keeps the color longer and it is very concentrated so you do not have to use much.</li>
    <li> This is not at all the same shampoo as the one I purchase at my salon. Same bottle, completely different shampoo insides. I would not purchase from this seller again</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo but for the price I expected a better result. Nevertheless, my hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair. Works well on my hair and  had made my hair so much healthier. The Bain 2 left it too soft.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!! Everything I expected and more, I buy this on Amazon all the time.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell dreamey, it&#x27;s an amazing product.  Kerastase rules.  Kerastase &amp;#34;Nutritive Bain Nutri Thermique Intensive Nutrition Shampoo&amp;#34; (whew) is a fine product that I highly recommend.  My hairdresser uses it.  Makes my hair smooth, but still clean and bouncy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my fine limp hair so healthy and full! I know it is expensive but believe me it is worth every penny. I get soo many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my hair needed to get healthy again.</li>
    <li> bought the Bain Satin 3 from Amazon- TWICE - and both times received some other Thermo something product instead of the requested product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my hair!</li>
    <li> I am suffer form a terrible hair for year, until now than I am using the Bain Nutri- Thermique!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks God!! my hair is a lot much more manejable and healtly!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this product!!</li>
    <li> makes your hair very dry and unruley !!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed by the results from using this shampoo - I have extremely dry hair that is so staticy from the winter weather and I did quite a bit of research on the best shampoos/conditioners for dry/damaged hair. I use this shampoo along with the Keratase Nutritive fondant and to be honest, my Clear Scalp therapy shampoo/conditioner works WAY better and for less than half the price of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never recommend this product or purchase again.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected.  Does not work well at all.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser got me started on this shampoo.  I love how it makes my naturally wavy, wispy hair turn smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!! My hair feels smooth. And looks healthier. The price is affordable. Much less then the price in the hair salons</li>
    <li> After going to the hairdresser and her telling me that my hair was extremely dry, I decided to give this line a try.  I&#x27;ve used practically everything, from Nexxus to Paul Mitchell, Mizani to Biolage.  Nothing has worked.  Yes...this shampoo is very pricey, but I went back to the hairdresser less than two weeks after I bought this shampoo (and the 5-vial treatment from their Resistance line and the anti-frizz serum), and she noticed a HUGE difference in the moisture level of my hair.  I can honestly say that I finally believe that I&#x27;m on my way to healthier, stronger, and hopefully, longer, hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo!!! I really recommend it... i love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It made my hair very strong. But there is one downside. My hair feels very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;But I think it was worth of my money. I will keep on buying them.&lt;br /&gt;Giving 4 start because it&#x27;s too expensive. Other than that, I would definitely use it.</li>
    <li> great shampoo for colored hair and feels more natural without all the perfume smells  also you do not need conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  I was happy to see it sold on Amazon and the price was pretty decent.  It is more pricier than most shampoos, but I would rather pay more for something that will not only clean my hair well, but protect too.</li>
    <li> I have typically purchased this product at full retail price through my hair salon.  Ordering this through Amazon allowed me to save time and money. The product was sealed, brand new, and is the exact same product that I have been using for years. Great! Thanks Amazon :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like shampoo made in heaven!! Felt like I didn&#x27;t even need conditioner! I have very fine, damaged and processed hair. I am in love with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo as a Christmas present. I have been using it ever since. Great product, I will buy more</li>
    <li> I have long, thick &amp; curly hair and live in a very dry climate - this is the only line that moisturizes my hair without weighing my curls down - definitely worth the $$$$</li>
    <li> Very good masque! shampoo! Smell really good! Very well packed! Arrived on time. This is a very high quality product.</li>
    <li> I have received at the time and I am testing the product quality now.</li>
    <li> Actually made my hair worse</li>
    <li> I fried my hair last year and I&#x27;ve tried so many products to fix it.  This one was okay, nothing special.  I&#x27;m not going to get it again, but it wasn&#x27;t a purchase I regret.  I just my best advice here is don&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable, no small feat for processed hair!</li>
    <li> Such a great product. I have used since 2013. It lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair .</li>
    <li> bad choice, this shampoo is too intense.  never feels like you have rinsed it completely out.  stick to one of the other bain nutri formulas is my advice</li>
    <li> Just got this bottle and pretty sure it&#x27;s fake. The color is not the same as pictures on the bottle and The company is from Canada. And from other reviews I&#x27;ve read, kerastase doesn&#x27;t sell to Amazon, just salons. For a few bucks more you can purchase at your salon. I&#x27;ve stopped using kerastase for a a few months and my hair looks horrible. Pay the money it&#x27;s defo worth the spend.</li>
    <li> Made my normally frizzy hair tame and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is a rip off! Do not buy from this seller. This isn&#x27;t the real shampoo. It seperates in the bottle and comes out clear unless I shake it first. Plus it smells horrible. I have used this shampoo before, I know what it&#x27;s supposed to look and smell like.</li>
    <li> I like how my hair feels soft but not weighted down.  Need to use more of it than I had thought to get it to lather up.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo i use.  I have extremely dry hair and it is the best product to help my hair stay healthy.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo. My hair never felt dehydrated and It never knotted my hair. I would give his Shampoo 10 stars if I could</li>
    <li> My hair is sensitive, fine, color treated and well... fried! Sadly it doesn&#x27;t respond well to most shampoos, protein treatments or heavy conditioners. I thought I would have to just cut off my hair really short to get rid of the dry ends but now I am reconsidering this idea. I just started using this shampoo and after only a week I can see a difference. The ends are still dry but seem to hold more moisture and are more flexible and \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot;. My hair also looks more shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this in combination with Nutritive Conditioner from the same brand and it&#x27;s also very gentle on my hair. These products are not cheap but worth every single penny!&lt;br /&gt;For those with similar hair issues I also recommend taking a multivitamin with vitamin E, biotin and iron. You&#x27;ll see the difference! Avoid oils, serums and protein treatments, they just make matters worse.</li>
    <li> Purchased Jan 7, 2015 from &amp;#34;Brand Names for Less&amp;#34; and I believe this is not the authentic product.  It smells different than the previous shampoo I bought at my local salon and it made my hair feel dry and brittle. I was just trying to save some money by buying it online and it turned out to be a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Kerastase  &amp;#34;Authentic&amp;#34; products are fantastic, just make sure to buy them from a reputable, authorized seller.</li>
