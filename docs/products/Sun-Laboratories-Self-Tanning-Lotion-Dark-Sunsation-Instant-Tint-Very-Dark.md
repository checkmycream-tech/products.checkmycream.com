      <li>First off, this bottle is huge!</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look orange and although it has a mild odor, it isn&#x27;t offensive.</li>
      <li>and I always choose self tanners that are dark because some of it washes off in the first shower and it looks great and smooth after.</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and can&#x27;t possibly expose my whole body to the sun enough to get any kind of tan.</li>

      <li>My favorite had been Faux Tan by Bare Minerals</li>
      <li>This is the best self tanner i have ever tried and i have tried alot of them gives you a perfect natural glow and doesnt turn you orange or smell horrible.</li>

      <li>Just love this, I could not say enough about it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best self tanner i have ever tried and i have tried alot of them gives you a perfect natural glow and doesnt turn you orange or smell horrible. I definately suggest using a kabuki brush or gloves so your hands dont turn orange but dont hesitate to buy this product just try it you will be more than happy with it. I got the 8 oz and am planning on buying the 32 oz next this is my self tanner forever enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have probably tried every brand, type, spray tans, mystic tans, airbrush tan, fake bake, xen tan, st tropez, million dollar tan, tan towels (Kate Somerville &amp; hsn), tarte, Lancôme, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, etc.....&lt;br /&gt;I find that LOTION self tanners last the longest and in my opinion this Sunlabs dark sensation very dark (which is their darkest formula) is the best of them all. It&#x27;s has a pleasant smell, it has a darker color (not orange @all) than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried, it doesn&#x27;t get weird as it fades, can be layered for deepening color, and lasts the longer than everything else I&#x27;ve used. Of course with any self tanner u MUST continue reapplying to keep the tan and it is important to exfoliate thoroughly @least once a week and start over. I tan at night and moisturize in am.....moisturize every day to keep skin from drying out and this helps the fading/sloughing process as well. Ok for face as well....no problems with it @ all. Wear drs gloves when applying to body and get a densely packed like kabuki makeup brush to do backs of ur hands and u will never get the dreaded tan palms !! Try it, I don&#x27;t think u will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in the past and am generally satisfied with its results. I am VERY fair-skinned so I have to be careful when choosing self-tanners because they often look unnatural. Not this product. It gives a very nice, dark, and relatively natural looking tan with minimal streaks (provided you rub in quickly and evenly). It can stain so avoid putting on clothing until it feels completely dry. It never looks orange.  It does have a scent, however, it smells more like cherries or almond oil than that obvious fake-tan smell that so many self-tanners smell like. I don&#x27;t mind the smell of this at all. Great product and would recommend!</li>
    <li> This product was okay, goes on fine and has a nice scent. However, it never absorbed into my skin, therefore even several hours after application, it was still very much still on top. I basically had to apply, wait a few hours, and then shower in order to use this product. If not, the product would come off on everything, clothes, sheets, even the papers on my desk! Maybe my skin just didn&#x27;t react properly, but for me it was to much of a hassle to use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> love love love! no streaks, smells good, easy to apply, looks natural! Just make sure to exfoliate your skin before application to avoid splotchy marks</li>
    <li> Need a couple applicaitons to get dark though</li>
    <li> As advertised. Received within shipping time given</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Used this product years ago, and loved it.  Not sure what changed.</li>
    <li> I love this tanner. It gives a great color and no bad smell! I have extremely fair skin and I always choose self tanners that are dark because some of it washes off in the first shower and it looks great and smooth after.</li>
    <li> This is THEE Best bronzer Ever! Must use a tan glove.I leave it on my pale skin overnight.Then wash in Morning and Wow! Never orange since its green based.A MUST!</li>
    <li> One of the best self tanning products I have ever chose to use.  I am glad I purchased.  The product arrived as estimated time stated, was in the condition as pictured, and is an overall great product as advertised.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather pale and this gives me the most darkest, natural tan ever! It also doesn&#x27;t&#x27;t streak if you moisturize and here&#x27;s a BIG TIP, if you got it on your hands and it won&#x27;t come off just use toothpaste with a wet rag and it will rub off :)</li>
    <li> I have used Sun Labs many times and the order i received from this buyer is either fake or old. It is not the same and did not work whatsoever. Please be careful where you buy from, authentic sun labs dark sunsation is a great product and i am very upset i did not receive what i paid for.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products. My favorite had been Faux Tan by Bare Minerals but the price was a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be very similar. My only advice would be blend well on hands and feet. But that was my error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color looked good even on my pale skin and the price was great $40 for 32 oz!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s messy and stinks, doesn&#x27;t leave much of a tan after showering, even if you leave it on for 12 hours</li>
    <li> smells good and goes on even. Best price I have found is on Amazon. Best tanner I have found too!</li>
    <li> Just love this, I could not say enough about it. I found it to be my now go to self Tanning lotion. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to use a self tanner.</li>
    <li> This is Sun Laboratory&#x27;s darkest and longest lasting self tanner. I usually apply every 4 days after my shower. It doesn&#x27;t look orange and although it has a mild odor, it isn&#x27;t offensive.The larger bottles are the most economical way to go if you use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and can&#x27;t possibly expose my whole body to the sun enough to get any kind of tan. This product doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as others, but it still needs constant upkeep. I will keep trying to find an acceptable balance. The way it blotches as it fades from my ankles and wrists is unnacceptable.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff! I am convinced that there are no better self tanners out there. At least nothing that looks as natural and smell as good. I used to be so stress because I just couldn&#x27;t get tanned. Tanning salons and the sun don&#x27;t work on me so out of desperation I tried this. Best decision ever! I gotta admit the first time I put it on it was a bit uneven and my hands and feet were super orange but the more I did it the better I got and now I&#x27;ve got the system down pat. Just be patience and eventually you&#x27;ll find a technique that will work for you. I don&#x27;t use the scrub or the maintainer but my tan comes out very even and stays on for a week. I would use the other products if I wasn&#x27;t so lazy. I get compliments all the time on my tan and I swear everyone think it&#x27;s my natural skin color. My natural skin color is as white as a sheet of paper you can literally see my veins. After one application I look like Kourtney Kardashian. This stuff is amazing!  So amazing I buy a huge bottle at a time!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sun Lab sunless Tanning lotion for YEARS!  It is an immediate tan, natural looking, non streaking, moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell bad! My legs look smooth and glossy after application!  I love ordering thru Amazon!  It&#x27;s fast and the price is the same as Sun Labs as well as the extreme convenience of using my Amazon account to order with!</li>
    <li> Best self tanned!  This one bottle lasts me 6 months and I use this 3x a week.  Starts to get patchy toward the end of the bottle but amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> Yes! I love this stuff. It comes out as kind of a dark chocolate colored lotion. I dry brush before I get into the shower, and then I exfoliate with a loofah in there. Afterwards I use this stuff over everywhere except my face. The color is instant. One application can get you a slight tan like you&#x27;ve been out in the sun all day. A few, and you will look pretty tan. There are two things I don&#x27;t like about it though, one might be user error:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have problems where my bra band rubs the lotion away on the front of my chest and makes it a little splotchy, not sure how to avoid this. I scrub pretty hard there before I put on lotion to make sure it&#x27;s all exfoliated, but I still have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I live in a hot climate, and frequently I&#x27;m hot after I take a shower: if you sweat at all after putting this on for about the next 4 hours, you might get some tan stuff on your clothes. Just letting you know. I think they have a product to seal it in, or something. I just have to be careful to not wear white after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;But other than those two things, it really does what it says!</li>
    <li> I have used this tanner for years, i recently got a spray machine for my home so I use solutions now but i love love sunlabs lotion, it is dark, its natural looking. I recommend buying a mitt to apply it, the application is way smoother than with gloves. This is a great product, my number 1 tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the way it goes on great. Perfect color,but make sure to exfoliate before applying! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good color. Takes quite a while to dry and can be a little uncomfortable to sleep with on. Color fades somewhat smooth but also quickly. Applying 3 times a week would give the best results. The product it&#x27;s self goes on smooth and works best with plastic or latex gloves.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love how dark this makes me. I get so many compliments and people are surprised it&#x27;s not my natural tan.</li>
    <li> I like this Sun labs tanning lotion, make sure you wear rubber throw out gloves.  It works really well then, because you can really rub it in and not have to worry about your palms.  Cant wait for summer, I would order from these guys again,  good product, I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> love it.  Doesn&#x27;t have the typical order that other tanners have and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product all year around. I saw how well it works so I bought one as well. The tan does not look fake .I did notice that the product will accentuate  any rough spots or flat clear moles  you may have .</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, applies well, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad like some do. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands in the past and now only use this one.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! If you don&#x27;t get good results with it, you are using it wrong. Make sure to exfoliate a lot before you use it and don&#x27;t put too much on knees, elbows or ankles. Your color develops in a few hours and lasts up to a week if you moisturize regularly. I like to use it twice a week to keep up my tan, every other day on my face. For my face I mix it into my normal moisturizer about 50/50 ratio. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with breakouts or it feeling too greasy. I know this may seem like a lot of money but you get a ton of it and it will last you a long time. I still have about 1/4 left and I&#x27;ve had it for several months.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes to change my skin color to more of a tan color but got an orangish color. I had to wear gloves because it turned my hands dark orange. It&#x27;s very messy and also broke my skin out(but everyone has different reactions to certain products) I only applied it to my legs, and noticed a different color, but not a color I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the natural Colorado look.  It does not last as long as I thought it would.  I would say you should apply every two days.  I love the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The title says it&#x27;s dark but when it came it&#x27;s the very dark just an FYI.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this tanning lotion for over two years now. It&#x27;s much more cost effective to buy the big bottle of this. I usually mix it with my regular lotion to it will soread easier and abosorbe easier. I get great color from it and receive lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; all the time! I have recommended this lotion to many people and they seem to like it as well. Great product and prompt shipping!</li>
    <li> Returning ASAP . Stains Red.. looks like Sun Burn! - not bronzy or tan at all! I have never had stained palms before I can usually apply tanner to one leg, arm , etc and wash hands in-between parts; not with this.  I am stained RED so badly after a second of contact with this lotion but Its too thick to spread with latex gloves on! really disapointed because I had high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> it comes off on your cloths and everything I use it because I bought it but will not buy any more will try something else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years. Tried lots of different self tanners but this my fav....It goes on dark so you can see if you have streaks and fix that right away, not orange-y, non smelly. It stains the skin immediately so it took some skill to learn how to check my skin thoroughly and learn how to fix mistakes. Use latex gloves to apply!! And tan the top of your hands and fingers after. Just use alcohol to remove or blend spots/ streaks by patting area with a cotton round. The best results are to put it on before bed and wash before getting dressed. You can put it on when you go out, but it will stain clothes so wear dark colors and if you sweat or get water on your skin, it will streak; embarrassing! The price is great considering I used to by the 8oz bottle of &#x27;very dark&#x27; for about $30!! Never again.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful! Very moisturizing and smells great upon application. You will smell the product as it develops though so, I advise applying at night! It has a color guide that helps application. I would also recommend buying an application mitt, buffing mitt, and, back applicator. Those tools will give you a flawless application. To make sure your back is applied evenly after using the back applicator I also use a towel and rub the towel back and forth on the areas I couldn&#x27;t reach to achieve even coverage. I would also suggest you moisturize your knees, elbows, and ankles before Sunlab application. Those areas tend to soak up more color and can appear dark and not realistic.  Another tip I would recommend is to have a jar of baking soda, liquid or foaming soap, and, a stiff nail brush waiting by the sink. I would apply lotion to ur legs and torso then using baking soda and soap mix scrub the palms of your hands and in between fingers. Then apply your shoulders, arms and back. Then rescrub hands with the baking soda and soap. Works really well. Then I apply a thin amount to the tops of my hands and wrists with the application mitt. I then buff my entire body and walk around for about a half hour naked! Yes naked before I put on black silk pjs. The silk helps by not sticking to the skin and prevents color transfer to my sheets. I wake up shower off the color guide and apply a moisturizer! The results are a beautiful realistic tan that will last for 3-4 days. The tan also fades nicely. I am very white so, I reapply the sunlabs two days after my first application.  Best product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I had my share of sunless tanning lotions and by far this one is the best. Gives you a nice sun-kiss glow with one application. No orange!!!</li>
    <li> First off, this bottle is huge! An 8oz usually lasts me about a month. The first application comes out a little streaky but you get the hang of it and the more you use this product, the more even it looks. I get so many compliments on how tan I look. I&#x27;ll never step foot in a tanning bed again! Also, I use a glove to apply it because it will turn your hands dark brown, but I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years! It is great, natural and easy to use.  Spread a thin to moderate level of product over your whole body every other day. Top it with a glitter sunscreen and you will have gorgeous skin tan skin every day of the year.  Everyone so far has thought it real, even the dermotolgist gets made a at me for &amp;#34;being in the sun,&amp;#34; when its fake.  Love this product.  I have tried them all. This is the only one that does what it says with NO streaks!</li>
    <li> This paricular product works better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. It smells nice during application (almond/cherry smell). It goes on smooth and because it&#x27;s tinted, you can see where it needs to be blended in, to ensure even coverage. There is one draw back and that&#x27;s the dreaded processing smell (the amount of time one has to suffer the awful smell, until its safe to shower).  The smell appears a half hour after application.  During my initial research, I read comments claiming there&#x27;s no smell.  It&#x27;s not true.  BUT, it&#x27;s not quite as bad as a spray tan, if that helps in your decision.  For me, the tan lasts 7-10 days, showering once per day.  I gave this product 4 stars.  Until someone can come up with a self tanner that has zero processing smell, I&#x27;ll be forced to vote in this direction.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and  I am obsessed. I used to tan in tanning beds or in the sun but thats so bad for your skin. So now I use this. Its easy to put on and it lasts a long time. its not organe due to its green pigments. it has a coconut-ish smell. The product shipped very fast and the bottle arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Smells good and fast to absorb, but wears a little ehhh.  The inside of my knees and elbows or wherever rubs the most seems to show very quickly and noticeable that it&#x27;s fake tan.  Color is good.  Brown not orange.  If you have the time to exfoliate and apply this every day you will probably be ok.</li>
    <li> It does turn my knee caps a little weird looking, but if you need a nice quick BROWN tan then this is the best one I have ever used. As far as arms, chest, face, legs, and stomach goes, this is the only one I would ever use. Trust me when I say I have had some pretty ugly looking fake tans but this one looks very real. I get alot of compliments when I use it.</li>
