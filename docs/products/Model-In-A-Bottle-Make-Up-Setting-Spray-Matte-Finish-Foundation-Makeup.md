<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this stuff.  Once sprayed on your made up face...you don&#x27;t have to worry about it again...till its time to take it all off!  Keeps it all in place...all day long</li>
    <li> I originally started using this product 6 years ago. From make up start to finish, my makeup lasted 18 hours for my wedding - all because of Model in a Bottle. I continued to use it for special occasions and for important events. I finally ran out of the two bottles I had and decided to reorder... nervous, since I purchased the originals directly from the developer at the IMATS.&lt;br /&gt;This product from amazon is exactly the same thing - just a different bottle. Which, whatever! As long as it does what it&#x27;s supposed to! I think the new spray style is much more efficient, so I&#x27;d actually give 6 stars, if I could!&lt;br /&gt;This one has a fragrance, but I love it. I always get compliments on the smell.&lt;br /&gt;We work hard on our make up! Your hardwork deserves this product! ;)</li>
    <li> I love this spray!!!  I now only touch up once a day instead of every hour</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected. Thought it would come out in a mist but came out like a heavier spray. It felt sticky and thick at first but as it dried it went away. I am going to try putting it in a small misting bottle and see how that works</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years. Have tried other brands that make the same claims but they do not compare. Well worth the price. I recommend purchase from the Model in a Bottle site rather than other sites that offer the product.</li>
    <li> Make up will not move. Great for summer months.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the spray after watching a YouTube video and it the ladies gave it 5star reviews. After using it a couple of times I did see a difference in how my makeup looked. It did have a matte finish that did in fact last hours. Being that my face is semi sensitive, on first application it does have a tiny burn (not serious enough to cause worry) which disappears within a couple of seconds once it starts to dry. It seems like a product that can be used everyday if your the type of person that wears makeup daily, but i prefer to use it for special occasions and days when i want to look dolled up! Great product, great price and I definitely recommend it to all you make up fanatics out there!!!!</li>
    <li> I was sent sensitive formula but it&#x27;s advertised as original formula. It should be specified which type of spray so you know which you are getting.</li>
    <li> this product does not hold what it promises. My makeup comes off and rubs against clothing. Also, my mascara still loses its hold and I end up with racoon eyes a few hours later (we live in FL and the humidity is very high). I was hoping this product would be the much needed relieve for makeup to last longer than a few hours.</li>
    <li> I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different but with all the amazing reviews this got, I decided to try it out. Biggest mistake ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only get really oily on my forehead and I had hoped this stuff would help control it. No way. Not only does it have a very strong floral scent that smells like old lady perfume, but it made my entire face oily! The nozzle doesn&#x27;t mist the spray out evenly so it sprays out in chunks instead of a smooth mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the product for me.</li>
    <li> I heard about this spray from makeup artists, so I decided to give it a try. It was horrible! For something that you spray on your face, it was very fragrant and stung for about 30 seconds. It was not enjoyable at all and after about a week of trying to get used to it, I had to throw it away and buy what I normally use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. It is the equivalent of spraying hairspray on your face.</li>
    <li> Make sure you put your hair in a towel or headband before spraying. It makes my fine hair stick to my face and it makes a strange coating on it. I use a cool blow dryer after spraying to the count of twenty before opening my eyes. Seems to help. Nice scent. I prefer the matte one.</li>
    <li> i follow Carlibel on Youtube. She mentioned it and talked about how it sets your makeup. also for oily skin-matte finished look! I have oily skin even if i use powder it down BUT this is magic! especially in the summer this product is great for a glowy-sort of matte look. my makeup stays flawless and is no where near oily. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my makeup lasting all day.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. When it dries, there were spots on my face. Also, I was oily again within an hour.</li>
    <li> After spraying this on, my skin has this matte feeling that it&#x27;s never had before, I have really oily skin &amp; this helps so much with that &amp; keeps my makeup looking fresh for a long time. After you spray it on it feels wet &amp; sticky &amp; makes your face feel a bit tight but that doesn&#x27;t last very long at all &amp; then it feels perfectly natural &amp; my face feels dry now &amp; not like an oil slick 8-D  Usually after putting on makeup I have to use a couple oil absorbing sheets in less than an hour, ugh!, today it&#x27;s been over 5 hours since I put on my makeup &amp; this spray &amp; I haven&#x27;t had to use any oil blotting sheets, my skin still looks fresh &amp; dry! 8-D  I am very happy with this spray &amp; will definitely be getting more before I run out.</li>
    <li> This does work INCREDIBLY WELL! I am definitely one of those girls who forgets she has her face on and rubs the mess out of her face, but I was SHOCKED when I looked in the mirror yesterday and say that my face HAD NOT BUDGED AT ALL and it was still matte. Even my eye makeup was intact. So, no doubt that this works! When I went to take my makeup off with a makeup remover wipe, it came right off. Not sure how water-proof it is.. but I&#x27;ll update when I try that.&lt;br /&gt;Now for some flaws I found:&lt;br /&gt;1.) it is very sticky when you first spray it. I got some in my hair when I was applying it, and i was basically a STRONG HOLD matte hairspray. So, i&#x27;m not so sure how good that is for your skin... but, oh well.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The perfume smell is STRONG. I&#x27;m not sure what sort of smell I was expecting, but it&#x27;s a very Chanel perfume-ish smell. It does go away after awhile, but I would practice not breathing through your nose for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I gave this 5 stars because it does do exactly what it is supposed to do. I can tolerate the 2 minor set-backs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any luck with this product. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong? I would love it to \\&quot;set\\&quot; my eye makeup more than anything, but if it even gets on my eyelids (I spray with eyes closed of course) my eye shadow \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; during the day, as does the skin around my eyes. It looks worse than when my makeup just melts off, which is what I was trying to combat with this. I keep trying it, hoping to hit on the distance, or amount of product, that might help it be more effective for me. But so far, no luck.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I loved it! It sets my makeup, doesn&#x27;t crease, and has me looking fresh all day. However, the bottle is so chincy. The spout broke on the third day I had it. I&#x27;ve had to use more than the \\&quot;5 sprays a day\\&quot; because the stuff can&#x27;t get out of the nozzle. It&#x27;s ridiculous. I won&#x27;t buy this again, but since I like the actual formula, I&#x27;m definitely going to look for something similar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this product before but recently saw it on one of the television shopping channels.  I live in NC and being July - the heat is on! (along with the humidity!!).  I&#x27;m so tired of my makeup melting off my face two hours after applying it so thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It really works!    It took a few times to get the application correct for me - spray distance, level of application, etc.)  Now I&#x27;m a pro.  I read another review where it was suggested to use a hairdryer on cool to help dry after applying - this worked great too.    Product dries to a matte finish with no residual \\&quot;stickiness\\&quot; and my makeup now stays on all day no matter the temp or level of humidity - LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> So some people are saying it doesn&#x27;t work on oily skin.  Well I don&#x27;t have oily skin, I have normal skin, and it still doesn&#x27;t seem to be a miracle.  It maybe makes my makeup last a bit longer, but it&#x27;s definitely not keeping me \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; all day or looking like I just applied my makeup.  Really if that happens, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using a primer, not model in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is all right though, as it does make makeup last a little longer than normal and sometimes I want every edge I can get.  The problem is, this bottle is tiny.  It says \\&quot;300 sprays\\&quot; are in the bottle, but you can&#x27;t cover your whole face with one spray.  If you want staying power, you need like 7 sprays.  That means this bottle should only last ~43 real uses.  Sometimes I spray on like 1-2 sprays but in that case I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference and I&#x27;d just as soon not waste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, it works only ok and maybe would be best saved for special occasion uses rather than everyday ones.  If you want your makeup to last longer, buy a good primer and longer-lasting makeup products.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOOOVE this product. I used Loreal&#x27;s  setting spray for a funeral and it held up ok. I used Model In a Bottle the next day for a family function and my makeup didn&#x27;t budge, the exception being my lip gloss. I fell asleep with my makeup on and woke up with very little out of place. My new favorite find!</li>
    <li> This stuff does a really really good job at keeping my makeup in place all day. I have super oily skin,  and always have to worry about my makeup sliding around during the day.  Not with this Model in a Bottle.  I spray it on my face after my makeup is complete, and it all stays in place until I wash it off at night!  No touch ups needed. No makeup sliding. It looks as good 12 hours later as it did when I first did it that morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I got through my makeup wearing life for so long without this. It&#x27;s awesome. It works just like it says it will. My skin gets very oily during the day and my makeup starts to slip but the matte finish keeps my foundation in place all through a work day. I haven&#x27;t needed to touch up with powder like usual or use an oil blotting sheet-which i always have in my purse. I&#x27;ll be buying this again when the bottle runs out for sure.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my extremely oily skin. The makeup still smudged.. but I didn&#x27;t need to blot as often while using the product. It also has a really strong smell. I had to hold my breath while I sprayed it. I think this would work best with dry/combination skin..</li>
    <li> I had little hope of this actually working, but SURPRISE it does!  The distance spray ratio thing took one time to get right, and the scent is a little strong at first but dissipates quickly.   I live in hot humid country and am a shiny mess by noon if not before..this helps.  You still sweat but your makeup stays put and the shine is decreased by a good 75%! Completely worth it. I will order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after hearing about it from a co-worker. I was thinking it would help keep my face from getting to shiny since I have oily skin, so I got the Matte finish spray. The only thing I ended up liking from this product is the smell, it smells really nice I would rather use it as a perfume. At first when you spray it on it makes your skin feel tight but after a few hours my skin got shiny &amp; there&#x27;s no way to touch up your face with out it looking like your peeling. Since its like a shield &amp; the layer plus your makeup come off with it so if your apply more cover up it likes flaky. So I would only recommended this product for people with normal to dry skin i guess that&#x27;s why it worked on my co-worker so well because her skin is dry. I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for better products for my oily type of skin..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ! I used it before going stand up jet skiing and rope swinging all day, my makeup was still perfect at the end! I have to fill in my eyebrows because they are light and they were still perfect too along with my bronzer, foundation, blush, and mascara (I did use waterproof mascara though). I also worked a double shift in a restaurant where there is a lot of grease then went to the gym and my makeup looked like I could go out. I will defiantly buy more when I run out !</li>
    <li> Not good for sensitive skin! Burns while applying and caused a painful rash to form within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;However, my first and only application of it definitely made my makeup stay pretty all day regardless of heat or humidity so if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend,it&#x27;s like a hairspray for the face.   I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and so far it has not disappointed me. I have normal to oily skin and since using the product I have not experienced any breakthrough nor have I had to re-apply my make-up through out the day. My make-up can last at least 12hours and when it does start to break down it flakes off and by this time I am washing it off for the night. This is a most have for the professional make up artist or for anyone seeking a solution to making their make up last.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this product helps to control the shine I get when I wear makeup and does a pretty good job of keeping my makeup looking fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is amazing! I have been trying different products to try to manage my oiliness... and this stuff has done it! I applied this over 12 hours ago now and my face still feels fresh! My makeup stays on longer and my skin looks so much better. The only thing I still have to work on is the application- it is not fun to spray on the face, especially since it is done with eyes closed! Bottom Line: Give this a try!!</li>
    <li> not the product, but the company.  i have not even opened the bolttle, because it was not what ti thought it was!!!  i casked to return , they say no because it&#x27;s a liquid,   duh.... it &#x27;s a make up product, it&#x27;s a liquid!   i think, i should beable to returnm bolttle unopened!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on purchasing this item, I do makeup for side jobs and i wanted a good sealer that would stay all day, I have used this for a week and it does work,  Make sure that if you want to spray this after your makeup is done, wait for your mascara to dry before you mist this on,</li>
    <li> It does half the trick by my skin being so oily it keeps the eye makeup on great but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on my foundation, but I will take what I can get because my eye makeup use to run off so I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> i do bridal faces and this product works wonderful to set the makeup for hrs. it does not smudge or fade.</li>
    <li> I love this setting spray I used it for my wedding in the caribean and Even do I was sweating a lot my makeup lasted more tha 12 hours. I recomend it a lot. I keep on buying this product for my makeup business for brides and party makeup it great</li>
    <li> I put it on in the morning, it does smell very good and doesnt feel like its on your face, however, I went dancing.. It came off very easily, did not set my make up in place at all, I would recommend getting another kind of spray, I got all nighter, it worked great!</li>
    <li> This is the best product. I highly recommend. I use Model in a Bottle every day. You will love it!</li>
    <li> I received my product days before it was expected! I was so excited to use it for New Years Eve for the first time. I sprayed it on and unlike some other I did not noticed any water spots and it kept my makeup on until I woke up from my hangover the next day and it was still as fresh as it was when I first did it until had to wash it off! This is a must have for any makeup freak like myself! I can NOT see myself without it now that I have discovered something so amazing!</li>
    <li> Model in a bottle did not quite live up to my expectations. I tried using it to set pigment that I applied to my hand. I first used an eyeshadow base (Nyx) then applied about 4 very different pigments right next to one another. I sprayed model in a bottle per the directions and let set for 1 minute then gently swiped a clean finger trough the colors and instant smudge. Model in a bottle seems to work well with foundation but not so much for setting pigments, or eye shadows.</li>
    <li> I have always used Urban Decay&#x27;s Dew Me Make Up setting spray but decided to try Model in a Bottle because it was a lot cheaper.  You get what you pay for. This spray smells and after spraying it on I could smell it for about an hour and it drove me nuts before it finally went away.  The spray bottle is crazy - it pumps out big droplets not a fine mist like the Urban Decay spray bottle.  I ended up putting it in my empty UD bottle and the mist is now perfect but the smell is still there.  It is a heavy perfumey yucky smell.  It does work but you have to deal with the smell and if you dont have a different spray bottle be prepared for big drops to land on your face in a weird pattern.</li>
    <li> I live in a very hot environment and can&#x27;t do without this product. I initially made a mistake of spraying it too close to my face and i had white particles all over my face. However, once i got the required distance, it&#x27;s been amazing. There was a particular day I closed a lil early from work (5hrs) and I got home did house chores for almost 2 hrs and was sweating profusely. I took my blotting paper and blotted my face and my makeup looked fresh like I had just applied it.  It was absolutely unbelievable. I also have the Urban Decay spray which I used once and never used again. I have a dry skin. but that made my skin look oily after about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;MIAB is the best.!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist in Los Angeles and I personally use this all of the time. Keeps the best matte finish, I&#x27;ve tried many others (NYX, urban decay, etc) and this is the only one I use now. If i go out dancing this keeps my makeup perfect all night when everyone else&#x27;s is sweating off, perfect it humidity.</li>
    <li> I have used a few setting sprays and I really don&#x27;t see much difference. Don&#x27;t be fooled my the name it has no magic in its formula. I will say...... it has a great smell.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite setting sprays. It is my favorite all the way down to the packaging! A little goes a long way! The product is of great quality. The smell is fantastic.  Does not create an oily finish. I use this product a lot with my professional brushes from MAC and Sigma. I also like using this with my blender sponge and applying my foundation to make it last all day and night.</li>
    <li> First, the good part. This item arrived within a few days of my order. I used it and it definitely improved the appearance of my skin. My makeup lasted really nicely too, until I washed it off. No sticky skin. I will use this again if I want my makeup to last and last and last. The low? I doubt this would give me 300 applications. Also, some stinging in my eye when  opened after spraying. Maybe you need to wait longer to open eyes? I did break out a little after using this product, so  would not use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Eh...it&#x27;s okay. Middle of the road. But I have SUPER OILY skin so keep that in mind.  This let&#x27;s me go (maybe) an extra hour before blotting, but it wasn&#x27;t life altering like I had hoped.  I use it for special occasions, but it&#x27;s not impressive enough for me to feel like it&#x27;s worth using everyday.</li>
    <li> I eagerly awaited this after reading a number of reviews, and unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t live up to them.  I commute on the stinky NYC subway and train system and I have yet to find a shadow base or finisher that can make it through the commute.  This product goes on very sticky and takes awhile to dry.  Once it dries you can see where the spray landed on your face and eyes - looking like darker splotches.  So you have to put shadow over it to smooth it out.  By 11AM it had faded noticeably.  It also itches!  By 3PM the color was gone from my eye shadow.  Very disappointed.  Was really hoping this product could make it through the day!</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is its heavy fragrance. Its equivalent of you spraying Perfume on your face. But other than that i love it. It does exactly what its supposed to so. I went to the pool and was in the water for hours then went home showered and went to a party. Didn&#x27;t have to touch up my makeup once  and that&#x27;s saying something.I have every oily skin and with this my makeup didn&#x27;t budge and and my face stayed matte. It smells like it has alcohol in it and I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday bc it startedto</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed about this product.  I do like the product but am not in love with it.  It does keep your makeup in place but I think I started to have an allergic reaction after about 3 days.  I do use it however if it&#x27;s going to be a long day, but have decided I can&#x27;t use it every day!</li>
    <li> Amazon considers this &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; which I think is just for shipping purposes or something, but still scares me.  I used the spray about three times.  I have used Urban Decay&#x27;s all nighter and De-Slick.  I was hoping this would be better as I&#x27;m not a huge fan of those.  It did nothing.  Did not create a matte finish and stung.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily skin and I&#x27;ve tried all different types of makeup but nothing ever seems to last more than a few hours on my face. I can put on makeup at 8am and by 1pm it&#x27;s barely there! I am SO happy that I read others&#x27; reviews about this product and took a chance. It is WELL WORTH the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps prevent makeup from smudging onto your clothes. A must have product for anyone who wears cosmetics. Love it!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, love it</li>
    <li> It will hold your makeup in place, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with dry skin. The primary ingredient is alcohol, and it will both dry out your skin and burn when applied.</li>
    <li> It made my foundation incredibly sticky and didn&#x27;t set anything, even with powder applied. I also had a horrible breakout on my face from this. I never ever get a bunch of pimples all at once and I got 5 on one cheek in a day from this. Could be allergic to something in this but I just don&#x27;t plan on using this setting spray ever again. I much prefer other setting sprays I&#x27;ve paid more for in the past.</li>
    <li> seller and shipping was great. item didn&#x27;t make my make up stay on much longer then usual</li>
    <li> No stars, smells like patchouli, I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out of my nose all day. It comes out in big droplets.</li>
    <li> Pro:  It does have very good oil control. Face doesn&#x27;t feel oily in the afternoon. Usually  I have to use 2 sheets of blotting paper to remove shine.   Cons:  The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work well, sometimes spritz a little, sometimes too much.   When the liquid touches my skin, it stings a little. Very strong alcohol?   Fresh clean scent?  WHATEVER! It has VERY strong perfume smells that lingers for a couple of hours!!   Makeup doesn&#x27;t look fresh as long as when I use other brand.  After 6 hours, I look at my skin really closely, I see dry white crusts all over my my skin!       Not going to buy anymore!!!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing setting spray ever! The consistency of this product of a little thicker than other setting sprays but it literally keeps your makeup on all day. I apply my makeup on in the morning and this stuff keeps it on, even after a sweaty workout, until night time when i take it off.</li>
    <li> Really sets your make up and keeps it on for hours.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom&#x27;s wedding in July since I would be doing hers and almost everyone else&#x27;s make-up. The bottle itself is beautiful looking and lightweight. I don&#x27;t know if it was the fact that I used lotion, primer, foundation, concealer AND powder before applying this but it definitely helped the make-up stay on everyone&#x27;s face all night long! In fact, my mom committed the ultimate no-no and didn&#x27;t wash her face that night and woke up looking exactly the same as the night before (I don&#x27;t think she wanted to take the make-up off, lol).   I can see this bottle lasting a long time since I only need to spray about once or twice and only for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent however it didn&#x27;t keep my makeup on for very long.  After continued use it also made my face sting a little. Will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the spray and everything about it. Do not use if you have sensitive skin because the alcohol is strong in this one.</li>
    <li> The best setting spray on the market.</li>
    <li> I do makeup for photoshoots, prom, homecoming, senior pictures and other misc things and this is my pride and joy!&lt;br /&gt;I have to make sure my clients are satisfied from my work and that means lasting through hours of dancing and other shenanigans.&lt;br /&gt;I do 4 sprays in total when using this doing the asterisk type shape and that makeup will stay put. For my dry skin, this can be a little too drying so if thoughout the day I start to look a little dull I will spritz some water and glycerin mixture on my face to keep looking dewy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, after using this you cannot apply more product (i.e. foundation, blush, highlighter) without it having the risk of looking cakey and too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the Ben Nye setting spray which I also really love but this doesn&#x27;t smell like mouthwash and seems to have just the same amount of stay-put-ness ha ha!&lt;br /&gt;It also comes in a beautiful glass-like bottle which looks nice on a makeup desk or vanity so that&#x27;s just a great plus!&lt;br /&gt;You can also buy this in the sensitive formula because it could agitate some skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;-Staying power: 9.5/10&lt;br /&gt;  -Can withstand 95 degree weather or humidity&lt;br /&gt;  -Hugging someone? No leftover foundation marks on their black shirt.&lt;br /&gt;  -Can withstand a decent amount of rain.&lt;br /&gt;  -Doesn&#x27;t settle into creases if used properly. (Don&#x27;t overdo it)&lt;br /&gt;-No unpleasant or strong smell&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes! Totally worth the $15 or so! Especially if you use nice foundation and don&#x27;t want it coming off 2 hours after you apply it :)</li>
    <li> I love Model in a Bottle, I wore it for a wedding and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause me to look greasy after trying other finishing sprays so I had to pick up a bottle.  I knocked off a star because the bottle had leaked slightly during shipping making the bottle (which is glass) a bit sticky.  It wiped off without too much difficulty and it was a small amount (not enough to bother with returning or like I was cheated out of product).</li>
    <li> Broke me out in a really bad rash all over my face. Maybe I should have gotten the sensitive one, but I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin. I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many setting sprays (Ben Nye Final Seal, Urban Decay All Nighter, Skindinavia Original, &amp; Green Marble SELR) and this is the BEST HANDS DOWN. I have high expectations for setting sprays as I go to concerts, raves, &amp; outdoor festivals so I need my makeup to last because I&#x27;m dancing &amp; sweating. I just tried this last night for the first time &amp; I went to an all-night rave I had my makeup on since 2pm until 8am the next day &amp; I kid you not, I looked in the mirror when I came home &amp; I seriously didn&#x27;t look that bad AT ALL (can&#x27;t say the same for my hair..), my makeup didn&#x27;t budge! This stuff is INSANE! I thought Ben Nye Final Seal was the best for a long time until I tried this. My makeup went through the gauntlet that night &amp; I came out looking relatively similar to when I first applied my makeup. This is strong stuff, if you have dry skin, I&#x27;m not sure if this would be the right product for you as it is alcohol-based which is what makes it so effective. I also don&#x27;t understand how this wouldn&#x27;t work for some people as some claim it didn&#x27;t make their makeup last..I have REALLY oily skin &amp; my makeup stayed almost perfect with this. Once it&#x27;s dried it doesn&#x27;t mattify your skin, but it gives your skin a smooth matte feel. My makeup doesn&#x27;t rub or transfer off, for example. I accidentally dipped the side of my hand in a glob of DUO dark tone lash glue when I was done with all my makeup &amp; my hand grazed my chin so some stuck to my chin &amp; it dried (you know how tough duo is if you use it, it&#x27;s kinda hard to get off) I had to rub it off &amp; use a q-tip to wipe the rest of it off, when I looked at the q-tip, the q-tip was literally clean! NO makeup transferred at all, I was mind-blown! I will forever use this setting spray..my search is over.</li>
    <li> Great product, however I now know I can buy hairspray for a lot cheaper &amp; get the same effect from that</li>
    <li> Not only does it not work, it burns your face with alcohol!  Tried several times but it burns your face and eyes so bad that it makes your eye makeup run from the tears!! The bottle doesn&#x27;t mist your face but sprays the alcohol blend on you.  And the smell...not good either.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it on \\&quot;the good buy girls\\&quot; on tlc. They supposedly went swimming and slept with their make up on. This product does not work like that! It has not worked for me at all! I put it on before going to the gym and it made my make up worse with streaks where I sweat. I have also used it when going to the beach for the day or pool, didn&#x27;t work either time.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this EVERY day, but it&#x27;s a miracle for special occasions or long days. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This setting spray is awesome! I just ordered my second bottle of it. It was my first setting spray I have ever tried and I keep going back to it. I&#x27;ve tried this, Urban Decay&#x27;s \\&quot;All Nighter\\&quot; and Skindinavia&#x27;s \\&quot;No More Shine\\&quot;. I really wanted to like the Skindinavia&#x27;s spray as well as the Urban Decay one, for the fact that a small bottle is quite expensive. Well, Model in a Bottle is wayyy better in my opinion. When I used the other two sprays, UD &amp; Skindinavia(which are both manufactured by the same company, so considerably similar), I felt like I was spraying water onto my face. Both had a plain/boring smell, and I literally felt like neither of them did a thing for my makeup. The Model in a Bottle, first off smells great!! I absolutely love the smell, it is not overpowering, in my opinion. But it does have a strong scent, so if you aren&#x27;t into scented makeup you may dislike it for that reason. As far as the product&#x27;s \\&quot;locking power\\&quot; it works!! Once you first spray it, your face feels tightened and a bit stiff, BUT this goes away quickly- I work a 8-9hr work day and it stayed all day long. I looked as if I just applied it. So I tossed the two higher-end brands, more expensive brands to the side!! I still used them because I spent well over $60 on two sprays, but Model in a Bottle is worth the, what? $15? Heck yes! It also lasts about 2 months or so, give or take. I am a person who wears makeup everyday, so if you only wear makeup occasionally this will last you way longer! I would recommend it all day long!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now. I personally don&#x27;t think the mist is fine enough, and it feels very blotchy when sprayed on the skin. It also burns a little bit when first applied (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin what so ever). It does have a fragrance which is light and not over powering. This product seems to keep me matte longer, which was definitely what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Model in a bottle is amazing.  I can go all day long and even after a work out at the gym, my face has the fresh morning look.</li>
    <li> I was a makeup artist for many years and when Model In A Bottle first came out, I jumped at the chance to try it! I was really happy with the staying power that this gave not only to my client&#x27;s makeup, but my own as well. It is key not to spray it to close to your face, otherwise it will leave drops on your face. You want to spray it far enough so that it comes out as a mist. I especially recommend this for brides, special events or for people in film/television.</li>
    <li> This product came recommended to me, but honestly it&#x27;s just cheap hairspray for your face.   At first my face was sticky and shiny (followed the directions, didn&#x27;t over-apply or spray too close), and then it dried tight. It even smells like cheap hairspray.   It worked okay to set foundation makeup for a while longer than it would stay on normally, but I really purchased it to set my eye makeup. NO GOOD at all. My eye makeup looked fine for about an hour or two, then it gunked and creased up really bad later. I had to wash my makeup off in a public bathroom while I was out because it looked so bad.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product :3 Believe me, the makeup DOES stay and when I  had it on, I did not sweat AT ALL!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Make up stays put for 12 hours and it doesn&#x27;t compromise the color or texture of make up.  This is a winner.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have oily skin and live on the humid North Carolina coast. It does exactly what it says it does. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This does exactly as it promises! holds all day and there is no stickiness or unbearable smell. its very light and easy to use. i personally spray a little on my fingertips and dab at my eyebrows to keep them in place. great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like any other setting spray</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected but I don&#x27;t know what I expected either. Anyway, I used this once I went to play badminton with my friends on a bright and sunny day. I sprayed it once or twice so it could help keep my makeup on my face, if not all- day then at least for a considerable amount of time. My makeup lasted the entire game, given that I have sweat a lot. I think it definitely works for me and I&#x27;m going to try using this on another setup and post again next time.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy and if you accidentally use too much your face feels weird for the rest of the day, like you have glue on your face or something. The atomizer in this product doesn&#x27;t make the mist fine enough so sometimes you get uneven coverage or big droplets on your face which is not very nice...All that to say, the product really does work well for me. My makeup is able to hold up all day even through sweat (and I sweat with the best of them).</li>
    <li> Great product as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Keeps the face powder off your cloths</li>
    <li> best setting spray ive ever used, comes in a cute bottle, i dont like that sometimes it makes my eyes burn but other than that it gives me a refreshed look and makes my makeup last all day!</li>
    <li> Great product!  The smell is a little overwhelming but overall I&#x27;m really happy. My makeup stays in place all day and I find myself using less oil blotting sheets throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This product smells really good,but i found after using it for two days already both days my make up wore off after 3 hours.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years! Great product!</li>
    <li> For my semi-oily mixed skin, it made me more oily and greasy. So I gave it to my mom to try on her very oily skin and she likes it a lot.  So I guess it just depends on your skin type.</li>
    <li> I ended up getting the one for sensitive skin, since the supply ran out. It didn&#x27;t stand out to me as the best setting spray ever, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> My skin may be too oily for this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my makeup last ALL DAY, but it does help.</li>
    <li> great when going out and need makeup to hold</li>
    <li> Love this makeup setting spray. Works better than urban decay setting sprays and for half the price! A must have for makeup geeks out there!</li>
    <li> This makeup setting spray helps my makeup staying power.  My makeup lasts much longer and I don&#x27;t like touching up, so this has really made life simpler.</li>
    <li> This product is great for mattifying and extending the wear of make up.  My only complaint is the smell, it has a strong, almost chemical based smell.  Other than that...PERFECT!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Keeps ur make up on for days. Exactly what I was looking for and a great price! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm. My makeup does not budge at all! My only complaint is that it kind of stings when I first apply it, but the sting goes away and I think the only reason it stings for me is because I rely heavily on benzoyl peroxide products for my facewash regiment and i think they might react. But it works so I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
    <li> Holds makeup on fantastically</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, my makeup lasts all day and all night the only downfall is that the spray is a little thick.</li>
    <li> This product works as well as it claims. I use it daily and would not be with out it. It sets your makeup all day and keeps away shine.</li>
    <li> i was really excited to try this. being the makeup junkie that i am, i already own a bunch of other setting sprays, and i can honesty say, this is like no other. if you have ever tried the skindinavia, or urban decay sprays and thought they were &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, i definitely recommend this. the smell is overpowering, but i can get over it because it works so damn well! i was surprised the first time i sprayed it, it seemed to make my face sting.. i looked to the ingredients and saw alcohol. if you have sensitive skin, i would be weary. but let me tell you, my makeup stayed all day! i was surprised to see that it had lasted so long! i have combo/oily skin and my foundation would always fade after about 4-6 hours of wear, but this was a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very humid in the summers where I live, and no matter what I do to my face--powder, Fix+, Evian spray--nothing makes my makeup stay in place or keeps it matte.  I saw this product recommended by a beauty blogger and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, although I&#x27;d never heard of it before and didn&#x27;t know anyone who used/owned it.  I&#x27;m fairly pleased with the results, but think the formula can be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spray it too close to your face--it can leave a splotchy finish.  I hold it about a foot and a half away from my face and spray it about five times in a circular motion.  Then, you have to let it dry; don&#x27;t mess with your makeup after spraying this on your face because it will make your makeup spotty and uneven.  I use a small handheld fan to help it dry faster.  And definitely don&#x27;t get it in your eyes or mouth!  It smells weird/chemical-y and tingles a bit when I put it on sometimes, but not enough to really bother me or put me off using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this on special occasions, not for everyday.  It makes your face feel a bit tight, so I imagine this isn&#x27;t too good for your skin.  But, it does what it claims, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin (we&#x27;re talking that I have enough oil on my face after a few hours that I use up an entire blotting sheet).  Of course, all the oil causes my makeup to slide right off my face - even waterproof makeup.  This product keeps the makeup on my face!  It does have a scent to it, but not too strong.  I have to be careful with strong scents as they trigger migraines for me, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I was soo excited to use this product, i did my research before buying, but i guess that my research wasnt enough. When people say that it has a strong scent, they are not lying, it really does that it lingers on your face. And also if you have sensitive skin i suggest that you go for the sensitive one because this does burn. and the pump doesnt work , it splits or it shoots out all weird. the only reason i gave it one star was because it worked only the first time i used it for that day. but i couldnt deal with the scent and the burning in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;Skin:&lt;br /&gt;fair- light skin tone&lt;br /&gt;dry but oily on my T zone</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist i do wedding makeup often i never used a setting spray before but a fellow makeup artist gave me a bottle to try. At first i liked because it was new to me and it did hold on the makuep. But after using it a while and trying different sprays i realized how much this one stinks. First of all the smell is very overpowering, ive gotten mixed reviews about the smell, some liked it some hated it. also it makes your face look laquered. Your face has a glass like sheen to it after it dries. Most brides i work with want to be matte on their wedding day, i would use this product at the trial then when it came to the day of they would say, I dont want to use the spray because it made me look plastic like. And i heard this phrase more than once, even from my own sister.  Plus you cannot touch up or reapply, the makeup practically peels off your face. Also as it lands on your face it creats wet marks, and i dont spray it that close to the face or that much. to me it also accentuated wrinkles on some people. idk i kust knew there had to be better products out there.  Skindinavia makeup spray is much much better product. And they have diff types for diff skin.</li>
    <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought the product. Works really well for the price. Seller sent the product really fast and was happy with the overall product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> There is a secret to this being the most valuable step in your morning make-up routine.  You don&#x27;t want to use any type of powder with this product (applied either before or after spray) if you are over 30.  If you use this product with powder, it will show off every hint of a wrinkle you may have.  However with that being said, if you don&#x27;t use powder, this product is amazing.  My eyes water from allergies and that usually means raccoon eyes by 10am.  If I use this product, I can go all day and into the evening without re-applying anything (well except lip gloss).  I would give up every piece of make-up before getting rid of this setting spray.  I have tried other brands (both more expensive and cheaper), and I always come back to Model in a bottle.  If you don&#x27;t need to use powder, this product is perfect.  No oily feeling, it only is shiny for a little while and then gives a nice finish on your face.  I do prefer the other bottle style however.  This bottle design stopped working after a week of use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference in making the make up stay on longer.</li>
    <li> Keeps make up put a very long time</li>
    <li> Eh not worth the price smells good though Barley even works, I would say just purchase an elf setting spray.</li>
    <li> Sets the makeup ok. But it doesn&#x27;t stop my oils. Plus it makes me appear shiny.</li>
    <li> Who knew you could life proof your makeup. This stuff is amazing, 24 hours and your makeup would still look totally fresh. It is great for those parties, events, etc. to safeguard your freshness.  It is sweat proof and humidity safe....LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product.  It made my skin feel itchy and sticky.  Also, didn&#x27;t like the smell--very floral and it lingered all day.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off once I got home from work.</li>
    <li> My wife was totally pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> First tried it for a spring wedding. The weather all day was a spring rain that lasted all day long, along with my model in a bottle setting spray.  The makeup artist said it would also keep the individual false lashes on the a couple of days.  My makeup did not smear throughout the day, and the lashes lasted for 3 days.  They would have lasted longer had I not removed them myself. Since then I do not go a day without Model In a Bottle, and have bought additional bottles for friends and family.</li>
    <li> Kept my face Mate and fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It does smell like hairspray, however, so if it bothers you to fee like you&#x27;re spraying hairspray all over your face then you probably wont like this. Helps with the longevity of my makeup. My only complaint is that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t spray evenly out of the nozzle - sometimes instead of a fine mist, I get all of it focused into a single stream at one spot on my face. When that happens the product is dripping off that one spot on my face and messed up my makeup. other than the occasional streamline squirt instead of fine mist, I love it.</li>
    <li> Helps my makeup last throughout the day. Everything stays in place. I prefer the matte finish rather than a dewy finish and I get it with this product.</li>
    <li> I like this but I should of ordered the unscented  the  Scent is strong and it kinds make my face sticky</li>
    <li> Make up stays on even after hanging out in the pool, of course I didn&#x27;t dip my face in, but it works great!</li>
    <li> Love this product one of my absolute favorites. Does what it says it does especially for the price. Love this keeps makeup on all day with no smears.</li>
    <li> I am unable to tell you whether or not this product works because every time i have tried to use this product it has burned so much my eyes water and all my makeup comes off! HURTS SO BAD.  I didn&#x27;t see any other reviews of people complaining so maybe its because I have contacts? I don&#x27;t know, but it hurt SO BAD.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I wanted to love this product but don&#x27;t think it does much of anything for my make up.  I just noticed that it actually makes my face shiny after many hours.  I never had a problem with my makeup staying put so this did nothing for me!</li>
    <li> Great for hot weather, wedding, funerals,  Your makeup stays put and does not run!</li>
    <li> Hairspray works just fine and is much cheaper. Out of the makeup setters I&#x27;ve used, though, this one is my favorite. You have to rinse the cap frequently, though, or the spray is uneven. That&#x27;s the same for all of them, though.</li>
    <li> Ok first off I like it but there are some things I dislike I have dry skin with an oily t zone and used this with my makeup forever foundation as well as my Mac studio sculpt and fit me foundation. To use this you have to be at least a foot away from your face  if you spray to close it will make your makeup look messy and splotchy and do not open your eyes for 20seconds after the spray  also it does contain alcohol and you can feel it if u have a small scratch or something.the smell is strong some people say lt smells like old lady perfume and I somewhat agree. The spray itself does hold up all day and if you go out at night it will stay on so because of that I rated it 4stars because it holds up great but compared to my urban decay all nighter it does not spray as light ud all nighter is more of a mist and your face doesn&#x27;t feel like a mask like model in a bottle I like both but for price I&#x27;ll get model if you can get over the smell</li>
    <li> Yes this product works for a few hours but I find that every time I use it my eyes become irritated and I sneeze alot</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a department store rather then amazon. The number one complaint I have and most people have is that instead of a fine mist coming out when you spray it, it comes out in huge droplets. To combat this problem I bought a fine mist sprayer at walgreens and put the product in that.. now it works great. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying model in a bottle any time soon.</li>
    <li> hey I went swimming, went out in the hot sweaty heat and I look great thanks for the funny girls you had on tv selling it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I call it &amp;#34;hairspray for your face.&amp;#34;  It keeps your makeup looking fabulous.  I live on the west coast so I don&#x27;t have the humidity of the east, but when I travel there, I make sure I have it.  You do have to wait till your mascara is dry or you will have black marks under your eyes!  It leaves a nice matt finish on your face and keeps everything where it should be.  Night and day difference for me when I use it and the days I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a setting spray to decrease shine throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried other sprays I like, but most of them are really expensive. I decided to try this one out and I was not happy with it. It felt like I sprayed hairspray on my face. It felt stiff and starchy. The smell also reminded me of hairspray. I would definitely splurge a little and get a higher quality setting spray. I used the MAKE UP FOR EVER Mist &amp; Fix and have really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> The best setting spray out there!! There are no negatives with this product. I use it everyday and it last about a month and a half. You can spray directly on your face, I like spraying it on my powder brush and then blending it in. Seems like I achieve better results using that method.. I also use bottle in a model Eyebrow sealer, it&#x27;s a must to try!!</li>
    <li> I only use Model In A Bottle setting spray on my shoots/clients.  Best out there and it comes in sensitive formula too if needed.  The smell is amazing, too!    [...]</li>
    <li> I first heard about Model in a Bottle from a makeup guru in YouTube, and after reading reviews online I wanted to see if it was worth spending 13ish bucks. Yes, it is totally worth it! I&#x27;ve always wanted something that sets my makeup so I don&#x27;t have to retouch it throughout the day, and I finally found it! This is my second time I&#x27;ve bought Model in a Bottle, and I will continue to buy it. If you want your makeup to last throughout the day or through a night of fun and dancing, this spray is for you! The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is it feels like it&#x27;s tightening my skin after it dries on my face, but I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;PS. Do not get it in your eyes you will cry haha.</li>
    <li> I live where it&#x27;s hot and humid plus I have natural oily skin and have been trying everything to keep my makeup from melting. When I use this alone it&#x27;s not that great but in conjunction with the NYX matte finish and Urban Decay all nighter, it works.</li>
    <li> I went to Hawaii and needed something to help me battle the humidity and keep my makeup on. This stuff did it! I love Model in a Bottle!  I even turned my family on to this stuff, they love it as much as I do! I recommend it everyone I know!</li>
    <li> It makes your make up look really gross after spraying it. Very sticky! And you can see exactly where you sprayed thus product because it leaves marks, very patchy looking! I had to wash off my make up after spraying this! I gave it another shot spraying farther away but it was still horrible and had to wash my make up off again! I used fixed plus  before and it&#x27;s so refreshing and helps make up stay on so I will be going back to that!</li>
    <li> My skin is very oily and makeup slides off winter, summer, spring or fall.  Model in a Bottle is a must have for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different setting sprays from skindinavia, UrbanDecay, KatVonD etc.. Naturally my skin is very oily and I was looking for a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product that would help my skin last all day throughout my work day and even have flawless makeup walking out of a Club after partying all Night lol this spray is the ONLY thing that is true too what it says it will offer!! My makeup stays flawless ALL DAY will literally no touch ups..Perfect for the girl who likes too party!!!! Your makeup won&#x27;t budge at all THANK YOU</li>
    <li> it came fast and it works great! I love how this product smells and it really dose work! I will be repurchasing this produce!</li>
    <li> I bought this bc I have MiaB for eyebrows and its great.  My phone eyebrows NEVER rub off. The face spray is pretty much the same.  My make up never rubs/wears/sweats off. I have gone to the gym and done an intense workout then gotten compliments in the grocery store right after.  But the bottle itself is terrible. It does not come out like a super fine mist (which is obviously much more desirable) instead its more like hair spritz. Big droplets of product pretty much just smack you on your face and it can mess up your makeup. I&#x27;m thinking about putting it in my Urban Decay bottle since it has a better nozzle. Also I am an oily girl so I like to be very matte. This spray makes you \\&quot;glow\\&quot; after it dries but its not really a big deal. I just go over it with a powder brush and do a light dusting of translucent powder to get the shine off. Also,  it smells like hair spray but there&#x27;s not much u can do about that.  The smell doesn&#x27;t linger with u but it does always much me cough when I spray it.</li>
    <li> The smell is not great and it feels very sticky. It does make my makeup stay on longer than without it tho. Also it is very easy to burn your eyes so the 30 seconds your supposed to keep them closed for is important to remember. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product numerous times and im not sure what i would do if it was ever discontinued. I&#x27;ve tried other makeup sprays before that didn&#x27;t really do the trick. This setting spray in particular has definitely saved me a lot of money since i don&#x27;t have to do frequent touch ups to my makeup anymore. It worked really well for me this whole summer, even on those days when you feel like you should be sweating your make up off in 90 degree heat it stays right in place where it should be! You have to use a fair amount to have everything stay in place (i&#x27;ve tried using less and found it a little less effective). Also, it can have a slight sting but nothing that lasts longer than 20 seconds. I love this product, the price is fair and i will continue to use it time and time again!</li>
    <li> Hated this product! I have oily skin and had heard great things about this setting spray. I was completely disappointed! First of all, the smell is terrible! It smells like an old cologne and the smell doesn&#x27;t go away. Second, it burned. My skin was burning when I applied it! Third, it did not keep oil or shine away. This was a waste of money and I am very disappointed with it. Just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t just a one time thing, I tried it for 5 days. Every time I had the same results.</li>
    <li> It dries your skin so much and the makup looks very hard after. Its like a glue in a way. I dont like how my makeup looked afterward. The bottle remains full</li>
    <li> The product definitely helps my makeup to stay on and keep me matte. I have extremely oily skin and especially during the summer this helped my foundation not to melt off so quickly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is, it kind of stung my skin and I had to keep my eyes shut for a while after I sprayed it on because it would make my eyes water like CRAZY if even a little bit came into contact with my eyeballs. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m not sure about the stinging sensation but it was less than enjoyable and kind of turned me off of this product. I purchased this a while ago and have since started using NYX Matte Finish Setting Spray and prefer it over model in a bottle and is cheaper as well. All in all, model in a bottle serves its purpose but something about it didn&#x27;t react well with my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well on my bridal clients!</li>
    <li> It keeps ur makeup on longer. My skin is super oily and my make up melts and gets greasy. With this product 3 squirting and it&#x27;s set. I work and sweat alot, i know tmI lol, and it looks the same as it did when I first put it on. It smells great ! Worth the price it stings when u first put it on but for me that means the product works and it really does this is an honest review. You should try it out for ur self everyone has a different skin type, and trust me I will repurchase again especially when summer comes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now. If you have sensitive skin, make sure you get sensitive. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but my friend did and it aggravated her skin a little. I can wear this when going on events where I&#x27;m going to be out all night, dancing, or even just a day at work. Spray some on your face and voila! your makeup with stay put.</li>
    <li> love this....holds your make for a long time...use it always after I am done with putting on my make up :)</li>
    <li> Just wow! Best spray ever.  I have long eyelashes and like to use fiber lash mascara which usually smears after 8 hours.  With this spray it lasts at least 16 hours.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t try it sooner.</li>
    <li> This does not accomplish anything that was mentioned on the description. It has a very strong scent that triggers sneezing, so not good for someone with allergy or sensitive to fragrances. I feel like it dry up my dry while at the time makes it feel oily.</li>
    <li> the only reason i give it 4 stars cause it can get messy when putting it on if its not spray the right way and it does take awhile to dry it does work it does leave your making looking the way it did when it was first put it and it does last a very long time when i test it on my hand when i first got it with my eye liner it did not move at all you can rub and rub and it won&#x27;t go any way i also use mac fix plus on top of it and it made it feel even more wearable</li>
    <li> I saw this on a youtube video and I was looking for something like it specially for going out at night because the last thing that I want is my makeup all over my face. This is absolutely perfect! Its not sticky at all and it helps to keep your makeup together ALL NIGHT no joke! Absolutely loved it and will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> I used skindanavia make up spray for months and swore by it...until the weather started getting warmer. I purchased this on a whim and I&#x27;m very pleased. The scent is strong but this stuff lasted for me, even on a hot summer day. I will add that I have pretty regular skin, mostly clear with a blemish or two a month. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this during summer so I can&#x27;t vouch if this product is really good. I use this and I noticed that my make up last  longer. Touch up your make up during the day. One thing I don&#x27;t like about balls problem is that I know is it only last for probably 30 sprays so I have to order this again.</li>
    <li> Love it....and was delivered pretty fast. The packaging was correct and wasn&#x27;t damaged. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked the product but I used it the other day and my makeup looked good after almost 24 hours besides having to blot my oily areas</li>
    <li> The price of this product is comparable to some of the high end primers and setting sprays. Seems to work well as far as keeping makeup set for a long time. Kind of smells and feels like hairspray when it is applied but doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any problems as far as breakouts. My face is extremely sensitive and will breakout very quickly if I accidently spray hairspray or perfume on it, so I was nervous. So far no problems. The spray itself comes out quickly and very wet. Make sure you hold the bottle at arms distance from your face before you spray. Would be better if it was more of a mist.</li>
    <li> This was like spraying hairspray on my face. It burnt, stung my face, had a stickiness to it and not only that but the pump didn&#x27;t come with a straw. The only reason it sprayed was because it was filled to the top. Model in a bottle is awful. It  didn&#x27;t even keep my makeup on all day as it promised. If anything it made my makeup look gross with a very shined appearance. Amazon&#x27;s customer service was great though, they issued me a full refund as the product is non-returnable. This product is a ripoff. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, instead try urban decay all nighter. It&#x27;s amazing stuff and UD stands behind its product.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that I do like this product.  AT FIRST, I WAS SKEPTICAL, BUT I REALIZED THAT MY MAKEUP, ESPECALLY MY MASCARA STAYED PUT ALL DAY. IT ALSO HAS A VERY PLEASANT SMELL.  JUST MAKE SURE TO CLOSE YOUR EYES TIGHT. CLEAN THE NOZZLE FROM TIME TO TIME OR THE SPRAYER BECOMES A NON STEADY STREAM INSTEAD OF THE SPRITZ IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO BE. BY NOW, THEY MAY HAVE EVEN IMPROVED THAT PART OF IT AS I BOUGHT THIS QUITE AWHILE AGO.  HOPE THIS HELPS!!!</li>
    <li> burns a little when you apply but it will go away. got lots of compliments when I used this, everyone was saying my face was glowing. living in texas the summers can be pretty humid and this stuff will save you from reapplying your makeup.</li>
    <li> I ordered model in the bottle a few months ago. The one I got a few months ago was in the glass bottle that is shown. The bottle broke so that&#x27;s why I had to get another one. I was pleasantly surprised that they changed the bottle to a more convenient shape and it is not glass. I love this product because it really does hold your makeup on all night. It truly is like hairspray for your face</li>
    <li> Ive sprayed and sprayed and my makeup STILL comes off! I  wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone looking to try it</li>
    <li> Instead of a fine mist like the old bottle this nozzle splats fat droplets on your face. This ensures the product takes longer to dry and once it does your makeup only stays put where it landed so my nose looked like a map of desert terrain by mid-afternoon and felt gross and tacky. I have purchased this same item three times before and will not be purchasing it again. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I live in Trinidad and I bought this product to help keep my makeup matte because here is really hot and after makeup application you tend to sweat away your makeup. I must say I was not sure if this product will work. But after trying model in a bottle the first morning after getting ready for work, my doubts was put to rest. The product does really keep your make up looking fresh for long. Dont get me wrong you do sweat but your make up does not run. All you need to do is blot up the sweat or little bit of grease that appear and you look all fresh again.</li>
    <li> Model in a bottle actually works at keeping your makeup set for HOURS..without a sticky or tight feeling. Once it dries you don&#x27;t even know it was applied, but will be reminded when you look in a mirror to touch up your face, and will realize there is no need to touch up!!! I prefer to spray Model in a Bottle on my face once all my cosmetics are on except for my mascara, than I wait a few seconds for the product to set than I apply my mascara. A few weeks ago I used the product on my face, went to a party, came home and fell asleep with my make up on and woke up looking as if I just applied my cosmetics. The stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Wanted a setting spray that would resist humidity and long nights. This stuff is amazing!! Buy it....promise you will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> The best setting spray you can have.  Last all day.</li>
    <li> super for keeping makeup in place even in the hot temps in the Middle East</li>
    <li> I have been shown only the setting powder and figured that I would give the setting spray a try. This is a great product! It smells amazing, only a little bit is required, and it dries extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the spray much better than the powder because I don&#x27;t have to wait but a few seconds for the make up to dry before spraying. I have had problems in the past with the setting powder and putting it on too quickly after the make up was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to be water proof, but I haven&#x27;t tested that part of it yet.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, especially in the humidity. Your make-up stays in place until you take it off.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I probably have the most oily skin in america. I am acne prone, I have eczema and this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It works even in extreme humidity. I just love this stuff. I have never found a better primer. I&#x27;m surprised more people don&#x27;t talk about it. I tell everyone about model in a bottle.</li>
    <li> never drips; those that say it does I guarantee held it too close. I hold it about 16 inches which is with your elbow bent slightly.  It completely covers my face I can sweat and you can&#x27;t tell one bit! Beautiful all over matte finish.  I love this product I had such a problem with my makeup lasting through the day.  The smell is a soft sweet smell like perfume that isn&#x27;t noticeable after a couple minutes but I really like the scent.  I will be using this for as long as I wear makeup!</li>
    <li> Stung my face a bit when I sprayed it and my eyes were left burning the rest of the day. :(....might as well use hairspray?</li>
    <li> I used this product when it first came out and loved it. Just tried it out again (I had moved to Arizona and didn&#x27;t really need it anymore because it&#x27;s so dry down here). Seems to be the same product but the pump/spray isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be. The spray coverage is spotty so it doesn&#x27;t feel like a fine mist like it used to be. Better than nothing, but liked it better with the fine mist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the regular setting spray and now the matte, the matte is fabulous!  I spray it before I apply my powder and then another spray to set all of my makeup when I&#x27;m done applying everything and my make-up stays put all day!</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and usually after a couple of hours my face is super oily. This helps me keep my makeup looking matte and fresh for at least 10-12 hours. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause me to breakout and I use about 2-3 sprays to cover my entire face.</li>
    <li> A great setting spray... but it does make my eyes burn for a few seconds (yes, my eyes are closed)</li>
    <li> I hate that once I sprayed it on my face hours later my foundation gravitated into little spot of my face it was so ugly!! I recommend the urbane decay setting sprays over this any day</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!!!!!! Unable to contact seller. No information available. Cannot return item d/t &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; policy. ITEM IS DEFECTIVE! . Missing aerosol pump!!!! Rendering it useless. This is absolute junk &amp; a total waste of $$$. Please DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> This product comes out in squirts not spray. I thought it may be the bottle but I have ordered 3 and it&#x27;s the same thing, it squirts</li>
    <li> Definitely will not purchase this product again. This was the first setting spray I bought and ever used. At first, I thought it worked in that it definitely helped my makeup last longer throughout the day. Despite that though, my face was still getting oily after a couple of hours, especially when the weather was warmer and I was in direct sunlight. The worst part about this product is that it is DEFECTIVE!!! I really wish I thoroughly read the reviews prior to buying because now I&#x27;m realizing other buyers also experience the same thing. The inner straw/tube that is suppose to draw up the liquid to dispense is MISSING! Therefore, after a couple of use and as the liquid gets lower, basically the bottle won&#x27;t dispense anymore thus a complete waste of money! Additionally, the item is considered hazardous therefore Amazon would not allow a return. I&#x27;ve been trying to contact the seller but have no luck in doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed under the product description on this Amazon page is very misleading. The actual ingredients listed on the bottle is: SD Alcohol 40B, Water, Isopentyldiol, Acrylates/Octylacrylamide Coploymer, Fragrance, Aminomethyl Propanol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Biosaccharide Gum-1</li>
    <li> I HATE this stuff. It smells so strongly of old women and burns my eyes every time I use it. It doesn&#x27;t help my makeup to last. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 years!!! It got here in a couple of days and I was happy...</li>
    <li> Kept my make up from melting , even in the Florida humidity</li>
    <li> This setting spray works wonders... if you can get it out the bottle. This is probably my 4th or 5th bottle and every single time, the top gets stuck and the spray comes out in big drops rather than spritz, if it even comes out. Also, I always have a problem with it completely evaporating in the bottle when it is about half way full... But I continue buying them because I have never found a makeup setting spray that works all day like this one does.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly well. I bought it just before a trip to Hawaii. For reference, I&#x27;m from the Pacific Northwest and extreme/humid climates are not what my body is used to. I was a sweaty mess for most of my vacation. Yet this stuff didn&#x27;t let me down once. I spent days hiking and laying in the sun and drinking cocktails and I would look the same coming back to my hotel as I did leaving it. Since then, it&#x27;s been a lifeline for my friends and I during raucous nights out, concerts, and beer festivals. Whenever we&#x27;re getting ready to go somewhere, everyone asks &amp;#34;Do you have more of that model stuff with you?&amp;#34; It&#x27;s really nice to just spray and go without worrying about my makeup for the rest of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s why I almost knocked off a star:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The scent, while pleasant, is *really* strong. If it was just a whiff, it&#x27;d be delightful, but as it is, I just come up coughing. A lot of people, though, say they love it. To each her own in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I was shocked the first time I used it, thinking I might have an allergy or something, because of a mild stinging sensation. It only happened a couple of times, but if your skin is at all sensitive, maybe go for the Sensitive Skin formula (and if it&#x27;s not, don&#x27;t use this directly after exfoliating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Keep your eyes closed for at least 10-15 seconds after spraying! It may burn your eyes if you open them too early. The best way I&#x27;ve learned is to shut your eyes and mouth very tightly, spray, take a few steps away (getting out of the perfume cloud so you can breathe) and wait for about ten seconds. Then you&#x27;re golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, fantastic product that I&#x27;ve never heard a bad thing about from anyone I&#x27;ve lent it to. Makes a great stocking stuffer for your girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I went to a wedding in July and sprayed this on my face.  It was amazing, the makeup stayed in place the whole day and withstood the heat.  The wedding and cocktail hour was outdoors and reception was in doors.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Works well to keep makeup in place.  Love this product.  Wish it were in a bigger bottle so it would last longer.</li>
    <li> Best make-up setting product for even those that use Bare Minerals! If you mascara melts and you continually like a raccoon at the end of the day...buy this product.  If you spend tons of money on make-up every year...buy this product.  If you want to look flawless all day long...buy this product :)</li>
    <li> iF YOU LOVE YOUR MAKEUP TOO LAST ALL DAY YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH mODEL iN A BOTTLE.  sTAYS PUT YET WASHES OFF EASY!  THIS IS MY 2ND PURCHASE</li>
    <li> The spray smells good and it does exactly what its suppose too. I would recommend it to anyone. I love this product</li>
    <li> I would like to give no stars to this company because they either didn&#x27;t send my purchase or it got &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34;. Now what I&#x27;m out of my money because no way I am giving my debit card number or I have to wait 3 weeks for something I needed a week ago ......... Hmmmmm,me watch out for these scam artist all over 13 bucks sheesh ............... That&#x27;s sad</li>
    <li> But I think I found a better option in the all nighter spray by urban decay. This one has a lot of stickyness to it.</li>
    <li> I use this setting makeup spray all the time and I absolutely love the finish it leaves on my face.</li>
    <li> Burn the Hell out of my Face. . N didn&#x27;t keep makeup on longer then usual.. Won&#x27;t buy Again..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that the product worked as indicated.  It has a heavy alcohol ordor.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T REALLY NOTICE  A DIFFERENCE USING IT.</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift purchased through Amazon. I first must say, I am a setting spray FREAK. I am always in search of the perfect spray. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every type on the market and this one was just okay. It does have a VERY strong alcohol smell one spritzed, but ones its dry (two to three seconds later), it has no scent at all. It dries very fast, as explained above, which I love so much. It gives a truly matte look to your makeup and I do drench myself in it. I live in a very humid and hot area and this stuff works okay. I don&#x27;t feel like it lasts longer than four hours or so, but it could just be how oily I am and the weather in my area. I will keep searching for the perfect setting spray, but I do use this still from time to time. It&#x27;s not a bad spray and on par with urban decay&#x27;s sprays(I&#x27;ve tried all three).</li>
    <li> I love this product and have purchased many times. I always put it in a small spray bottle designed for travel. The sprayer on the bottle it comes in spits the product out.</li>
    <li> Model in a Bottle is amazing i recommend it to EVERYONE! It makes your make up last so much longer through out the day!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I bought it to use for my wedding and it held up like a charm. I haven&#x27;t tested it while perspiring heavily or in heavy humidity, however for a casual setting it is a great asset. It&#x27;s relatively easy to wash off too.</li>
    <li> After finishing my make-up, I apply this spray ... My make-up stays on all day ... No sweating or smudging. Seriously cannot live without this product. Best prices found on Amazon. You will pay $20+ at beauty supplies....</li>
    <li> This makeup setting spray does just what it says it does!  I would recommend it for anyone who  works an 8 hour day because your makeup will still look good</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, especially after reading so many rave reviews and videos.  I&#x27;ve always done everything possible to make my makeup last all day- good moisturizer, primer, set everything lightly with powder, blotting sheets, etc.  Nothing worked, so I gave this a try.  But this stuff is just so-so and I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Keep in mind that this will react differently to everyone&#x27;s skin type, and unfortunately for me, it just didn&#x27;t do much.  I have naturally oily skin, but I&#x27;m on a medication right now that makes it extra dry.  It&#x27;s a weird combo of dryness with oil in the t-zone.        The biggest thing I don&#x27;t like is that it sprays out very unevenly.  It comes out as a fine mist in some areas and has bigger \\&quot;chunks\\&quot; of spray in others.  If you don&#x27;t lightly pat out the bigger chunks of spray with your fingers right away, it will dry that way.  I had to learn the hard way the first few times when I looked in the mirror and saw big, shiny blotches on my face from the spray, which were very hard to wipe away without ruining my makeup.  It basically looks like you sprayed gloopy hairspray on your face.  However, if you quickly pat them off when it&#x27;s still wet, you should be fine.  Also, make sure you hold it out at LEAST a foot away from your face, maybe even more.  Sometimes I got too close and that&#x27;s when it looked more gloopy.    As far as making my makeup last, I did notice a SLIGHT difference, but nothing spectacular.  My eye makeup faded like normal, but my face stayed pretty matte throughout the day.  I looked in the mirror after a long, hot, sweaty work day and it looked like I had just powdered.  But as far as blush or bronzer, that faded like usual.    I know this is really long, but I hope it helps someone out!  Just know that everyone is different and it takes some practice when it comes to spraying it on your face.  I still have a little over half of the bottle left and I plan on using it up just to get my money&#x27;s worth, but I don&#x27;t plan on reordering it.  Maybe if they fixed the sprayer.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Really keeps my makeup set and all in one place!</li>
    <li> My go to setting spray! I LOVE it! Prefer it over UD setting spray.</li>
    <li> It really reduces the oil on my face.  As an black woman, we tend to have excessive amount of oil in our skin.  This spray really helps me control the oil from surfacing on my skin without hardening my face like a plastic mannequin.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try for setting my wedding make up and it is AWESOME!!! I did my make up before work at about 8AM and used the model in a bottle spray and It sounds gross but I fell asleep with it on that night and woke up the next morning and it still looked like my make up was just done!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love Model in a Bottle. a little shiny residue though. but overall great product at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> it came all smashed up n looks used...</li>
    <li> great for make-up in the south! Prevents make-up from running down your face in the humid, hot summer</li>
    <li> Works great! Your makeup stays where you put it.... love the fresh smell. I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> The best makeup setting spray! LOVE IT, will buy again!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, use it every day!</li>
    <li> This stuff works well, I have been a user for about 4 years and it never lets me down. I wear a mask at work and sweat and it helps maintiain my &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see ant difference using this product.</li>
    <li> When I received the bottle, the sprayer was defective and didn&#x27;t work. I put the formula into another spray bottle and sprayed my face four times with it. Although it helped with keeping my makeup in place, it did not leave my face looking matte and it did not help my t-zone at all from getting oily. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have oily skin and my makeup is fading by 10 a.m. This product allows me to keep it on most of the day.</li>
    <li> Very nice, and light.  Wish it protected even more.  I think you have to spray a lot of it on.</li>
    <li> This made my face look like plastic and did not spray out evenly from the bottle. It also made my eyes burn from the alcohol in the product if i opened them so soo. After spraying. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would get my face through the hot humid summer, and I found it.  There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve; it&#x27;s easy to spray too much in one place, which gives a drip effect, and it works much better if you wait a bit between applying makeup and Model in a Bottle to let your makeup thoroughly dry.  It takes some self discipline to keep your hands off your face while the MoaB dries, but it pays off.  When I catch sight of myself late in the day, I&#x27;m amazed by how fresh my makeup looks, even after being outdoors, gardening, or doing housework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a strong fragrance, but it quickly dissipates; it feels very cold and wet, and makes skin feel tight, but none of those things is a big deal.  It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st setting spray so nothing to compare it to but here are my first impressions... 1st, the sprayer itself it like rain drops. Its hit and miss. I think a mist sprayer would be better. 2nd, I do notice a sheen on my face...an oilier look. And 3rd, makeup did stay in place longer.</li>
    <li> Nice makeup setter. Not hard to remove, makeup won&#x27;t last all day and doesn&#x27;t smell bad despite the others reviews. Be careful the spray doesn&#x27;t come out evenly! Even a lite pump will cause you to drown! Lol Otherwise it gets the job done but only for 4-6 hours.</li>
    <li> OMG this is just like hair spray/ DO NOT DO NOT let it fall in your eyes IT BURNS!!!/ DOes it work? YES it works but it&#x27;s literally like hairspray...weird :) cool trick</li>
    <li> I never used to use setting sprays to control my shine but that all changed when I watched a tutorial online. My first setting spray was Mac Fix + but I really can&#x27;t justify spending that amount of money. I came across this product and decided to try it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is brilliant and is comparable to Mac Fix + but it&#x27;s cheaper! I use this after I apply my foundation and powder and then again after my entire face is on. My makeup doesn&#x27;t move and I don&#x27;t have any issues with oil during the day. It&#x27;s refreshing to feel the cool mist on my face especially after all my makeup is on.</li>
    <li> This product does work but my spray bottle didnt work . I had to put the liquid in another bootle but it does work. I have a oily face and it works i touched one time for the whole day. I live in Savannah GA it does get hott!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used. Keeps your makeup in place until you wash it off. My hair dresser also does makeup on dead people and uses this to set and make it look so soft. Try it! I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I put this on in the morning, and my makeup doesn&#x27;t budge for 12 hours. I have extremely oily skin (I mean so oily, the US is probably thinking about invading it), but a spray or two of this stuff really does the trick. I sometimes use some blotting paper, but it doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m sweating or oily, the makeup does not move. Only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell. It has a chemical smell, and it kind of lingers. It&#x27;s not too bad, though, and I&#x27;ve learned not to notice it. Completely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I had heard so many great things about this setting spray being so awesome, so I finally bought it and I hate it. It makes my makeup blotched and patchy in just 2-3 hours of having it on!! I&#x27;ve tried so many different ways to make this usuful but nothing worked!:(</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this product works or not because I cannnot wear it on my face for more than 15-20 minutes without becoming nauseous.  It smells that bad!!  When I did have it on it felt very light on my skin.  It&#x27;s a real pity it smells to bad!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Burns eyes,  doesn&#x27;t make it last all day,  spray leaves spots on makeup. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or eyes, but burned every single time I used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this after all the reviews but I&#x27;ll keep looking for something to keep my makeup on all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple weeks and I can&#x27;t tell if I really like it or not. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do a better job than the other finishing sprays that I have from Sephora. I don&#x27;t like the smell of it at all. Don&#x27;t hate it but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
    <li> I used a product like this when I was in college...before I&#x27;d go out at night.  It lasted great.  I was happy to see a product like this still existed.  Although I don&#x27;t think it holds as long as the other one I used did, it does make the make-up last longer than if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried every other finishing spray but I keep coming back.  I LOVE the matte finish.  I do not like the smell but it goes away soon after spraying.  This leaves a very, very nice finish to your makeup.  If it was scent free I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Of course no product will last 16 hours, but this does allow you to stay fresh and matted for a much longer period of time. You still have the shine in your t zone, but it is very manageable. This definitely works better on the eye shadow.  Now that is a 16 hour deal.  The spray nozzle could use some tweaking. There is definitely no fine mist here.  However, I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started to use this product last spring after I read a review in Stule Magaizine.  My bottle is just about empty and I want to get another bottle before this one runs out.  In the past, before using this product my make would last until noon.  Since starting to use this my make up looks as fresh when I come home from work as it does when I leave.  I have also recommended this product to my friends and they love it too!  Definelty worth every penny spent.</li>
    <li> This product, though it arrived well padded, was slightly leaking around the cap, but not enough to constitute a great loss--that being said, I have to say that this is no more than hairspray that has been thinned with rubbing alcohol.  As others have stated, it has a very strong smell, not unlike some other hairsprays, but that disapates over time; the tackiness will also fade, and I have given it two stars rather than one, because it does keep makeup from rubbing off onto your clothing.  But I will save my money next time and buy an inexpensive unscented hairspray to use instead.  I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> So i bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend 30 dollars on the urban decay brand, but when i got it it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. The bottle was 2 ounces when UD brand is 4 oz and the spray contains alcohol, so for someone with sensitive skin it is definitely not a plus. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> I had just recieved this package today and when I had opened the box I could smell that something was opened. The bottle was opened and it had leaked at least half of a bottle. I will never order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I live in PHX.  It gets 115 degrees outside during the summer monsoons.  This sets and KEEPS my makeup FLAWLESSLY.  I&#x27;ve tested it to the max too.  Crying doesn&#x27;t run my mascara or my eyeliner.  Working out or melting in this heat doesn&#x27;t run my foundation.  I litterly can go all day without doing touchups.  They really should call this mircale in a bottle.  I&#x27;ve also slept in my makeup - i know gross...but, there&#x27;s no makeup on my pillow!  haha i thought that was awesome.  also hunny likes that i don&#x27;t get anymore foundation on his t-shirts when he goes to smother me.  everyone&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> I love this setting spray! It&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried some great and expensive setting/matte sprays. The only gripe about this spray is the bottle, it is TERRIBLE! DO NOT spray directly on your face it will run your makeup, either spray on a makeup sponge and dab on face OR switch out the bottle, I poured the liquid into another small spray bottle and that worked AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Already reviewed this somewhere else - so will keep it short!  Love it!  It really works.  And no irritation</li>
    <li> I have an oily face to begin with but after using this product, after a few hours my face was way greasier than it normally is.  If you&#x27;re looking for a makeup setting spray I would go with Urban Decay, it is a bit pricier but well worth it.</li>
    <li> It works great when I use creamy foundation, not so well when using mineral makeup (it cakes) .. It might be just my experience..</li>
    <li> love this stuff !! for the amount u get all u need is 1-2 sprays for ur face and it covers and will last forever. Not a bad price either. Although when u spray it don&#x27;t open ur eyes right away cuz it sorta stings, but after it dries it&#x27;s awesome. And if u get it in ur hair it get sticky. But it lasts pretty much all day for me and I have really oily skin.</li>
    <li> Not a huge difference and very drying on the skin. I broke out in a rash. I should of tried the one for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It has a strong smell, but it is a good perfumy smell, so I do not mind it at all.  This makes my makeup last dramatically longer, I am obsessed with this product.  Would recommend to anyone who does not want to me worrying about their make up every hour.  THE BEST STUFF EVER!!!</li>
    <li> This is a super popular product so I&#x27;ll keep this short. This will keep your makeup in tact in a sweaty after hours club. I have pictures of myself at 6am (that was applied the night before) with makeup in tact thanks to this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I love this! I have tried sooo many primers and setting sprays. This is by far the best. And I have tried high end expensive ones. Buy it!!!!Use it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Absolutely will buy this product again. Got this product right away. And it was just the way it looked on the website</li>
    <li> AH YEAH NOW THIS IS THE 1ST PRODUCT THAT MY MAKEUP DOESNT LOOK RUNNY PLUS A NICE SOFT SCENT IM SURE YOULL SEE ME AGAIN SOON TTFN</li>
    <li> I wasted my money on this product. It&#x27;s too sticky once sprayed on my face and the spray comes out too much or not at all. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s sticky to the touch until it dries, then it shows where the spots are that you missed with the spray. Wish I could return this product.</li>
    <li> Makeup lasts all day with this product</li>
    <li> I love the model in a bottled! It has a first a hairspray type smell but goes away after it dries and does not have you smelling like it. It&#x27;s light weight works food on keeping makeup on and I think helps the make up swet in face for a more natural look.. I had no problems with creasing lines. I am definitely buying again. My skin is soo picky about products on it an i have no problem.</li>
    <li> I have moderately oily skin and was hoping this product would help my makeup last for a photo shoot. I was very disappointed in that after I applied the product my skin felt tight and sticky. When using liquid foundation I find that my skin is shiny and ready for a touch-up within a few hours. I also tried using this product with a mineral foundation and found the same poor performance.</li>
    <li> Model in a Bottle is a great addition to any beauty collection.&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly as advertised. The best makeup fixative I have&lt;br /&gt;ever used.</li>
    <li> I make sure I always have this product at home!</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever! Makes my makeup last all day and night! Love it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm every time.</li>
    <li> My favorite makeup setting spray!!! Lasts over 8 hours!</li>
    <li> I really like this to keep my makeup on.  It does a good job of that.  I do have an oily nose and I dont think that it did anything for keeping the shine down or making it not look oily.</li>
    <li> This stuff will basically iron transfer your makeup onto your face without ironing your face (ouch!)! voil&amp;agrave;!!! You will not sweat it off or rub it off. The original formula smells pretty strong, but good strong - like lavender and flowers! I actually like smelling it on my face during the day. I always remember where I was when I first used it (New Orleans), so the smells takes me back. LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best make-up secret!!  This is the only product I use after make-up application - it lasts ALL day and NIGHT even if you&#x27;re dancing outside in the sun and sweating.  And, by some miracle, it comes off easily.</li>
    <li> Used for my wedding. Make up stayed perfect</li>
    <li> Works great! Used it for my wedding and my makeup stayed on ALL DAY even through sweat and tears. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Ok, So I bought one bottle of this. And it was fantastic, saw alot of people raving about it on youtube. So I gave it a try, and it worked very well. After that bottle was empty, I ordered another bottle at the same place (right here on amazon). This second bottle seemed very different, it stung my skin when I would apply it... and didnt keep my foundation on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all bottles were like my first one, this would be a great product. Not sure what happened with that second bottle, but i&#x27;m moving on to a different setting spray.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, it is excellent! I live on a tropical island, Dominican Republic, and the weather is hot, humid and changing, and I can say that this product using makeup lasts me 12 hours even if I go out to dance! I love it. I also recommend the Model in a Bottle Long Lasting eyebrow sealer, my eyebrows are not erased or shift and equal last 12 hours!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to say how well the spray itself works, because the spray top barely worked at all for the first week and afterwards didn&#x27;t work at all.  The product would spray out in a single gloopy line, a far cry from a fine mist to cover your face.  Now it sprays nothing.  I contacted seller requesting a replacement bottle top or the option to return the item and never received a reply.  After attempting to fill out a return, Amazon has informed me that they do not accept returns on this item because it contains flammable liquid, which makes no sense to me since they shipped it to me despite that fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.  Do NOT buy this.  I assumed if I was unsatisfied I could return it, but that is not the case.  Spend the extra $10 to buy a setting spray that comes in a bottle that is not so cheaply made.</li>
    <li> the product is amazing I super oily skin and this stuff keeps me shine and keeps my make up looking fresh and&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly placed I would recommend to anyone who has super oily skin and wants long lasting results. Only down fall was the packaging it was awful and the bottle leaked out in the envelope it came in which obviously pissed me off because I didn&#x27;t get a full bottle that was paid for but the product its self is fantastic</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this because of all the positive reviews I had read, but after trying it, I am not impressed. I have very oily skin and I was attempting to find a product that would help my makeup last longer, especially my eye makeup, which tends to \\&quot;float\\&quot; off my eyelids and crease when I get oily (which is pretty much immediately). I don&#x27;t think it helped at all with making my makeup last longer, and it smells terrible. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Great product. have tried urban decay products this i find works better. bottle is somewhat heavy but thats just personal preference. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this product a try ( I usually use the Makeup Finishing Spray by Skindinavia ). The spray came out in big, sloppy droplets, not in a neat,even spray. As for the keeping my facial oiliness at bay, I didn&#x27;t see any difference.Hopefully, it will do better for others.</li>
    <li> Very hard on pores of acne prone/sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than a little hairspray</li>
    <li> I love model in a bottle and have been using it for years. It keeps your makeup on forever</li>
    <li> This new packaging is much more convenient!</li>
    <li> It does not spray a fine mist ...drops form on my face sometimes. A bit strong smelling as well but it does work.</li>
    <li> Model in a bottle is a great setting spray. However I prefer the original packaging.  The spray nozzle of the original bottle was more fine and I felt like it sprayed more evenly.</li>
    <li> Contains too much alcohol and does not leave a finished look.</li>
    <li> This setting spray is awesome!!  It smells oh so good!!  I love the way it sets my makeup to a matte finish!!</li>
    <li> I got this because I have oily skin and I wanted something that would help my makeup stay in place. this product does a pretty good job. I used it to set my eyebrows while I went swimming and my eyebrows did stay in place!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 bottles thinking that it was a great product and it would do as promised.  Thinking about returning 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for keeping your makeup perfectly in place for hours.  You can even jump in a pool and your makeup will stay intact!!</li>
    <li> My best friend swears by this setting spray and it works wonderfully for her so I decided to give it a go. I had been using an oil control setting spray by another brand and loved it but it was twice the price of this.&lt;br /&gt;First, I was surprised by the jet stream spray that came out, not a misting, followed up by an intense burning from the alcohol in it until it finally dried. This was no mild burn from say, hair spray, but way more intense. and after half way through the day my face was showing some glow and glisten. I continued using it for a few more days thinking that maybe my skin just needed an adjustment period but then the real problems began. On day two I noticed my neck was super red. On day three there were little bumps similar to hives. Awesome, an allergic reaction had begun!&lt;br /&gt;So I capped the bottle and gave it to my best friend to finish using.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect topper for big performances and special occasions.  It wears for hours even while sweating and dancing.</li>
    <li> waterproofs my makeup for my brides!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this for humid tropical climates cheers from Playa del Carmen&lt;br /&gt;www.StylingTrioRivieraMaya.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrian</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and I just absolutely love this setting spray. I no longer have to re-touch my makeup after a while. It also smells pretty good!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years after seeing it on Oprah.  It keeps your makeup on all day. I don&#x27;t even carry touch up makeup with since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I like that it keeps my makeup fresh for the rest of the day.  It does have alcohol so if you have a pimple or open wound it does sting.  Otherwise it does the work.</li>
    <li> Please purchase this is you oily skin. I can attend my son&#x27;s football games without worrying about my makeup melting off. I can not say enough about this product. It does not burn when applying, it is not sticky, nor is it hard for the product to spray out. Please disregard all of the negative products and try this out. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN.</li>
    <li> Terribly icky feeling substance; similar to the feeling of applying clear glue to your precious brows.  There are far better products out there, belonging to well established make up lines such as Brow Gel by Anastasia Beverly Hills which was only $18, only $4 more than this.</li>
    <li> This spray is a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of the product before it showed up on my recommended list, and ordered it out of curiosity. It will now be a staple in my makeup collection forever. It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use, but not always necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the heat of summer with 90 degree temps and 90% humidity and my makeup stayed in place perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice matte finish without looking fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use it on days I know I&#x27;ll be too busy to remember to use powder or to touch up my makeup. I can go from 6 AM - 11PM without stressing about it once!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t try any other substitutes from any other brand! This is the best product ever!</li>
    <li> Yes I really do like the Model in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years, purchased multiple times.  It works really well.  I do prefer to spray into the air above me and let mist down on my face, though, as sometimes spraying directly at the face can result in leaving larger drops that will make mascara run.</li>
    <li> I have used All Nighter before, but didn&#x27;t like the packaging--I took the bottle of AN on a trip with me and it leaked out completely.  So I thought to try Model in a Bottle at the recommendation of the woman at Sephora.  I have only used it a couple of times and cannot give a really accurate portrayal of how the actual product works.  It does smell nice, but it burns like hell when I sprayed it on my face the same day I waxed my upper lip. Also--the packaging? Really?  The spray nozzle sprays wayyyy too much on one squirt.  Also the spray area is very large, so unlike All Nighter, the nozzle was not meant for several sprays of the different areas of your face.  So you spray MIAB once and because so much came out, you are very hesitant to spray it again, so you don&#x27;t get good coverage all over your face.  I&#x27;m just confused as to why they packaged this bottle like they did.  It makes no sense to use a high pressure, large area sprayer for one&#x27;s face. No sense at all.</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist and always use this when i finish a makeup application it makes makeup stay on longer.it smells very good and gives face a nice finish really like this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product it really does control the oil on my face and keeps the makeup on all day. My only gripe is how it&lt;br /&gt;sprays, not in a fine mist. So I had an empty bottle of my Urban Decay setting spray so I transfer this MIAB into to that and it worked perfect. This mist came out fine and easier to spray all over my face.</li>
    <li> Burned my face and felt terrible</li>
    <li> As a bartender at a busy night club I really wanted something that would make my not run or wear off as my night grew on and I found I love this stuff</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time after reading a review by a makeup artist.  I absolutely LOVE this product.  My makeup lasts all night without worry.  It does sting a little upon application; however, it is well worth it to have great looking makeup all night long. Won&#x27;t go to another wedding or event without wearing this!</li>
    <li> Ugh. I&#x27;m so let down by this product. I did a little research and decided on this brand, I mean Tyra Banks uses it, right? Well, I tried it without powder over my foundation and it was horrible. My foundation was rubbing off in patches. Then I tried it over my powder (over my foundation) and it&#x27;s still wanting to come off in a weird way. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and I just am not happy with it at all. I wanted to quit using powder and start using a setting spray instead. Now I&#x27;m leery to try anything else since this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested, try Double Wear or DW Light foundation by Estee Lauder. It works great and stays put all day. I tried this setting spray for the sole purpose of ditching powder, hoping this would take its place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for 5 days and cannot even use it due to a defective sprayer. Needless to say I am less then impressed,and then to be told I cannot return it because it is a liquid..guess I&#x27;m going right back to Sephora to buy my Urban Decay</li>
    <li> This works really good for me! The smell is a little strong I&#x27;ll admit, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad so it&#x27;s tolerable by far.</li>
    <li> i normally dont do product reviews, but This stuff is liquid gold!!! i have super SUPER oily/acne prone skin and i have tried EVERYTHING. nothing has worked for me up until now. I literally have had to get up and get ready at 6am all week. i put on my makeup, set it with this spray and bam! no shine for a soild 12 hours!! i made sure i had a lot to do those days so i could test the efficiency of the setting spray and man did it deliver.  Do yourself a favor and buy this product!!!!</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 stars I would. It smells like a cheap whore and left my face oily. this will probably trigger a migraine today. Be warned it is considered a hazardous material and can NOT be returned.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin or somewhat of a shine this may not be the best for you. I used it on a wedding client and it worked at keeping her makeup put. However on myself my face seems to become shiny after an hour and just become more shiny throughout the day. When it comes to keeping your makeup in place AMAZING! But makes me look oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating for a few reasons.  Let me start off by saying that I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 on an Urban Decay or Skindinavia setting spray, and also because my friend who&#x27;s a makeup artist recommended it to me.  So I saw the best price was $15 and I figured well ok, if it&#x27;s going to do the same thing as the higher end setting sprays then I might as well go for it.  I was a little hesitant at first about purchasing the original (non-sensitive skin) version but I figured that since it was a setting spray, how bad can it smell? Well low and behold, I get the spray and it smells like a combination of some cheap perfume I smelled in the halls of high school and a toxic chemical plant facility.  It also made my eyes stream to the point of creating a whole new river and my skin break out.  Ok, these things happen.  So I then I thought well, I&#x27;ll print out a return label, write the company a note to let them know of my experience with the product and that I&#x27;d like to exchange it for the sensitive skin version or a refund.  Much to my dismay, Amazon tells me a return would have to be &amp;#34;reviewed&amp;#34; or something by the distributing company because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34;.  I then took matters into my own hands and wrote a nice email to I Heart Beauty &amp; Fashion expressing my concern and if I could send it back for a refund or to exchange for the sensitive skin.  They reply &amp;#34;Thank you for your email. Sorry to hear you had a bad reaction to the item. Since the item has been opened and used, we can offer you a discount on the sensitive item. It would not be sufficient to return the item. Please let me know if that would be okay with you.&amp;#34; Obviously it is not ok with me, because now what am I supposed to do with the original bottle? And no, a discount on the sensitive item won&#x27;t help me because I&#x27;ll still be spending that extra money, hence all the more reason I could have just used the money to purchase myself an Urban Decay setting spray at my local Sephora!  Unfortunately this is the first and last time I will be ordering beauty products on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was fairly impressed with the spray itself, however, the bottle is another story. I knocked the bottle over on my bathroom counter and it broke into a few dozen pieces. Be extra careful.</li>
    <li> Requested for a gift by adult granddaughter.  Makeup artist had used this on her weddintg day and she just loves it.</li>
    <li> came in on time, my daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past so it is exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> It came on time, and it works really good.</li>
    <li> Burns your face and has an acidic smell. Not what I expected but I guess it will hold your makeup for a little longer</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!! It worked for me, my makeup lasted all day just a great as when I put it on!!</li>
    <li> Not only does my make up last all day, through work and the gym, but everyone has been complimenting my make up!💛💛</li>
    <li> My favorite setting spray by far. The only problem is I have to order it online and wait for it.</li>
    <li> this kills fix+  for every time. i LOVE model in a bottle best thing ever cant say anything else you need to tray it</li>
    <li> This works ok kind of sticky feeling  when first applied I was expecting a much better product with the name attached to it .</li>
    <li> Purchased this spray after working in a makeup boutique and we would spray all our makeovers and this really does seal the makeup. Never had anyone break out from it either. I do however dislike the new bottle they switched it to. The spray comes out quite quickly so make sure to spray from a distance.</li>
    <li> this is the first time buying this product, love the smell of it, not to harsh, works perfectly for setting skin</li>
    <li> This works pretty good. I spray it on after mAkeup is on And it keeps my makeup on all day long. Very easy to use. If u have sensitive skin I would not recommended this version of it.. it has a slight burning after sprayed but goes away once it dries</li>
    <li> I love this product but this is my second bottle and I just noticed now that it has been leaking since I ordered it!  My closet shelf was all sticky under it and quite a bit of the product is gone!  Wish I had noticed it sooner, but I was still on the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan for years and this product definitely works! I can tell if I&#x27;ve forgotten to spray it on.</li>
    <li> I have read so many reviews on this make up setter so I decided to order both the sensitive and the original spray.  I was so disappointed when I finally got to try it. The mist made my mascara run to my under eye area (annoying).  My makeup did not last longer like this \\&quot;Magic Potion\\&quot; claims, it was no different than any other day.  The only reason I did not give this a 1 star is because I have not used it very many times. Since this item cannot be Returned and I am stuck with 2 bottles of it, I am going to try to start using it more often and if after a while for some \\&quot;MAGICAL\\&quot; reason this starts working and keeping my make up on for long periods of time, I will REVISE this review. For now.. it is what it is.. this sucks!</li>
    <li> My makeup stayed put through an extremely sweaty spin class -- barely had to touch it up afterwards! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> My daughter used it before her sorority formal and her make-up stayed set through the whole night, in the rain.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot to get make-up off, so best for special occasions.</li>
    <li> i love how this product makes my face feel. Makes my face look dewy and flawless.  No shine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much in this spray and I cannot say the word &amp;#34;Perfect&amp;#34; about it! Yes, it helps &amp;#34;Somehow&amp;#34; to set the make up on the face but in the same time the foundation in certain places would be removed easily if you were wearing a Sunglasses for example, Means; it will easily stick on your sunglasses leaving marks on your cheeks and nose (the glasses pressure points) and you&#x27;ll end up having a patchy make-up on your face, which I don&#x27;t experience this problem when I don&#x27;t use this product over my make up. Also be aware ladies; It is not suitable for the &amp;#34;Airbrush Make up Appliers&amp;#34; especially the water base one, you will face the same problem.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of things to help reduce it. I&#x27;ve also tried other make up setting sprays (Elf and Skindinavia). This spray has been has been most effective in significantly reducing my oilness. Didn&#x27;t totally eliminate it but keeps it to a &amp;#34;respectable&amp;#34; level. My make up does actually stay on all day without a need for retouching although I need to do two &amp;#34;layers.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or perhaps a factor of the excessive oiliness of my skin. I gave this 4 stars because what a really want is a spray that not only keeps my makeup in place but that also prevents my foundation from rubbing off on my hands or somebody&#x27;s shirts when I hug them. I haven&#x27;t found anything that does that, including the so-called colorstay makeups that are supposed to do that.</li>
    <li> Sadly, this product has done nothing for me. I have oily skin and this seems to make it much worse which ruins the purpose of a make-up sealer! Within an hour Im more shiny then normal when I use this product. NOT FOR OILY SKIN</li>
    <li> I ordered the spray for sensitive skin but got the regular one instead. It works okay but stings for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> The pump sucks, it sprays tons of product, the product is so strong that you can&#x27;t open your eyes until it dries (the alcohol sting), the spray nozzle gets clogged every single day. The product itself is meh, but the packaging is terrible.</li>
    <li> i used the product a few times. im not sure if it acutally works though, now it just sits in my bathroom collecting dust.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously, and find it to be effective.  Nothing is effective forever; meaning it&#x27;s great for about 8 hours or so.  Beyond that, you may need to touch up makeup.  This price was outstanding enough that I ordered two bottles.  I find the smell of the product neglible; some reviewers comment on disliking the smell, but I barely smell anything, and what I DO smell is pleasant.  This was a great value and I enjoy knowing that my makeup lasts quite well without touch ups for a whole day.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for the bridesmaids for my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  They loved it.  Would buy again.  Recommend for all brides or bridesmaids.</li>
    <li> Easy Gift. My girlfriend loves it and I think it makes her look sexier. Would recommend to all of the ladies.</li>
    <li> Amazing product .. Works really well, makeup stays on accordingly and smells yummy :) very satisfied caution do not pray too close to face as shown on box</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Skindavia and but I prefer this one. I like that it has a stickiness once sprayed almost like you can tell its sealing it all in. The feeling goes away in 20 seconds.  It works and its now a must have in my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> This setting spray works well. I have no creases in my makeup. It keeps my makeup in place. It has a nice smell, but it also has a strong smell of alcohol. I wouldn&#x27;t open my eyes while spraying it, it will sting your eyes. Just fan your face with your eyes close and then you&#x27;ll be good to go once it dries...I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the answer to address my oily skin challenge and I have finally found the answer. I first heard about this product watching YouTube videos. Many of the ladies said this was a staple piece to their make-up regiment. This prompt me to surf the internet to read reviews from the make-up blogs i.e. \\&quot;Makeup Alley and \\&quot;Beautylish\\&quot; and for the most part there seemed to be mostly positive reviews. So, I took the risk and ordered this product for myself. I have used this for the past three days and I am very much happy. I live in hot/humid Florida where it is almost impossible to keep a nice refreshed matte look. In my normal regiment I use an oil-controlling facial cleanser and moisturizer, oil controller, and then an oil controlling primer under my make-up (yes my skin is that oily) and then I usually last for about two hours before my nose starts to look shiny. With the \\&quot;Model in the Bottle\\&quot; matte edition, I can go all day with a matte finish. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> great for setting my make- up for my wedding !!! LOVED it</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this are too strong. When I sprayed this on my face, I can feel parts of my face being irritated because of the strong chemicals. I should&#x27;ve gotten the sensitive formula. Maybe that would&#x27;ve worked better, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible experience.</li>
    <li> I really was looking for something to keep my makeup from sweating off during the day, my hopes were high but I was let down..Within 2 hours my face was very shiny and the makeup was already wearing off. I do have oily skin, but I also use a primer. I guess this may work better if you dont have oily skin. I also never had the results of a matte finish...it was a very very shiny finish for me.</li>
    <li> This holds my make-up pretty well. I do have to say you have to make sure your eyes are closed, hold your breath and roll your lips in. The smell is very strong (like rubbing alcohol). The hold is good though. It does make your face feel stiff, so, you know that you have something on your face for sure. I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this again. Still testing it out.</li>
    <li> HEY LADYS AFTER READING SOOO MANY GREAT REVIEWS I THOUGH THIS PRODUCT WOULD REALLY HELP ME OUT IN KEEPING MY FACE NOT LOOK SO GREASY, UNFORTUNATLY THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME. IT LEFT MY FACE LOOKING REALLY SHINY AND THE MAKEUP DID NOT STAY ON AT ALL. SOME PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE THE SMELL BUT THATS ONE THING I DID LIKE IT SMELLS LIKE JLOS &amp;#34;GLOW&amp;#34; PERFUME. AND YOU SMELL IT ALL DAY LONG THATS THE ONLY GOOD THING OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS A HIT OR MISS PRODUCT IT EIGHTHER HELPS OR DOESNT. TOO BAD.</li>
    <li> IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SHINY OILY SKIN THIS WILL ADD TO THE SHINE I SUGGEST YOU DO THE EYEBROWS AND SHADOWS FIRST SPRAY THIS ON AND WIPE OFF THE EXCESS. THEN FOLLOW WITH THE REST OF YOUR FACE MAKEUP APPLICATION. BEING VERY HOT NOW IN NYC I USED THIS SPRAY I FOUND THAT THE TOP SQUIRTS OUT MORE THAN I NEED SO I WILL BE BUYING MORE SOON. IT DOES HOLD THE EYEBROWS IN PLACE I USE IT WHEN I GO TO THE GYM I SWEAT AND I STILL HAVE BROWS. THAT IS WHERE THE MAGIC TRULY IS. SO JUST BE MINDFUL THAT IS LEAVES A SHEEN LOOK TO THE SKIN. GREAT FOR THOSE WITH DRY SKIN I GUESS. ENJOY</li>
    <li> an actual setting spray that does what it promises. very happy with my purchase highly reccomed for those who don&#x27;t have time for touch ups during their busy day. bottom line I will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I was reading comments about a smell I think that&#x27;s up to preference. I personally like it &amp; don&#x27;t feel like it comes off strong at all, it actually fades after it dries 30. But like I said not everybody likes the same scents so please don&#x27;t let this be a factor into making this purchase. as far as the product itself it holds up.</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty bad but the staying power is worth the smell of inexpensive curly/frizzy hair products.  I smell like I&#x27;ve been in a low-rent beauty parlor or a crowded old-lady party, but the smell dissipates quickly enough for me.</li>
    <li> This is the first makeup setting spray I have purchased and so far, so good! I will be very interested to see how it holds up during the hot summer months. It doesn&#x27;t keep my eye liner/ under eye shadow from running however I don&#x27;t think the product really gets on that part well enough so I am going to try a technique I saw on youtube (basically just applying the spray from your hand with a small brush and OBVIOUSLY not on your water line) I will probably purchase the Urban Decay Allnighter next, just to have a comparison and as previously stated, the true test will come in the summer since all my sweat seems to come out through my face...yuck! Oh! Also, this did not dry my skin what-so-ever! Which was my main concern since I have dry skin during winter. AND the smell is not too strong for me as I saw notated on a few reviews.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! I got my makeup professionally done with this and my makeup lasted THE WHOLE NIGHT OF MY SWEET SIXTEEN! i ordered this and it came in super fast, smells amazing and most importantly does its job so i recommend this for anyone who wants her makeup to last all night. VERY pleased :)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it every day!  Honestly, I&#x27;m not one to write many reviews but I wanted to in this case….&lt;br /&gt;I have uneven skin tone on my face (hyperpigmentation in some areas and vitilgo in other areas) and need to use a bit of makeup to even it out and conceal.  Without the spray, I would end up having to retouch my makeup all day long.  Now that I&#x27;ve added this to my daily routine, I never need to do any touchups -- it even lasts through the evening if I go out after work.  Seriously amazing.  Plus, I live in Atlanta where it gets super humid in the summer, and I rarely need to touch up even on the hottest days.  Also, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with skin irritation with this spray.  It really is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This happen to be my second bottle of MODEL IN A BOTTLE, and I love this stuff....I have very oily skin, and once I put on my full face of make-up, including eyelashes, and lipstick....I spray my face, and I don&#x27;t worry about my make-up......There have been times when I didn&#x27;t feel like washing my face, after partying into the early am, and when I wake-up!!! I still look good...Heck!! My eyebrows that i draw on, are still there.....As long as they continue to make MODEL IN A BOTTLE.....I will buy!! One more thing...I&#x27;m also going on 55, suffer from severe hot flashes, and this stuff, still save my face....LOL I JUST LOVE IT.Sorry my review is so long, but!! It is, what it is!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not worth all the hoopla about this product.</li>
    <li> I will have to be the buzz kill for this product..its just okay  although i only had it for about a month and that will be my second down fall with this product....it is very fragile..i LITERALLY tapped it on a chair by mistake, as i was putting it down and it broke after a month or just a few weeks thats i had..i do not think i would buy this again or recommend it to anyone (maybe if they made it in a plastic bottel, but i doubt because i didn&#x27;t feel like it really did much of anything). just purchased  the urban decay all nighter and i hope its better than this one</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this setting spray. I am constantly on the hunt for products to help control my oily skin throughout the day, and I rely on this for special occasions or going out when I know I need to look my best and won&#x27;t have a chance to touch up my makeup. My best friend got married recently and I made sure she and all us bridesmaids had a couple sprays of this before we walked down the aisle. It was her first time using it and she was very impressed. Even with all our eyes tearing up and watering during the ceremony, this product held up perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the finish, I would not describe it as being completely matte, as I notice a slightly dewy shine afterwards; I do like a perfect powdery matte finish but I do not mind this one, because the finish does not change throughout the day - Meaning, you start the day dewy and it stays looking nice, rather than turning into a greasy mess after a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a strong floral smell at first, but it dissipates quickly and does not linger. I have asked friends to be sure that I don&#x27;t smell like a fruity flower shop, and luckily the smell does not hang around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that it does not come in a plastic travel bottle - I may just pour some in a small spray bottle to take on the airplane when I travel, because I do not want to be caught without it.</li>
    <li> It looked like the item was safely packed, but I guess the screw on the bottle got loose somehow and when I opened the package, everything was soaked in the spray and everything was stuck together and I wasn&#x27;t able to use any of the product since almost all of it leaked out.</li>
    <li> Makeup stays all day and this stuff smells amazing !</li>
    <li> My makeup last much longer..</li>
    <li> Works great when making airbrush foundation. Recommend it, !, ,,,,, ,,,,, ,,,, ,,,, ,,,,, ,,,,, ,,,, ,,,, ,,,, ,,, love it!</li>
    <li> The chin and neck area is my problem areas and the reason for my frustration with makeup transference. I was skeptical about this product, upon use I am very impressed it actually worked!  My makeup was less transferable and it lasted twice as long as normal. The sprayer was not a fine mist ( I sprayed a lot and it didn&#x27;t crystallize or ruin my makeup)  drys quickly, the smell was a little strong but nothing to complain about. I think this product is fantastic, a must have for serious makeup wearers!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Received it so quickly!</li>
    <li> This product came super fast and is amazing! It really sets my makeup so it doesn&#x27;t get oily and has a wonderful matte finish! A must have!</li>
    <li> product cause irritation</li>
    <li> Very disappointed . Received this on time but the makeup spray came with no attachment. The nozzle didn&#x27;t have the plastic tube that let&#x27;s the product spritz out. How am I supposed to use this? I press the nozzle and no product comes out. I was so excited for this to come in but now it&#x27;s useless .</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.it was just a waste of money.nothing special happened,you still sweat off ur make up.I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I really wanted something to set my make up so that it wouldnt rub off on my clothes. I wear white alot and I would like to not  have make up on my collar, as soon as I leave the house. I wish it was something out there. I&#x27;m trying to find what the stars use or the rich. I gave this a try and it just sits there in my cabinet. Nothing I would say you must have.</li>
    <li> Oprah uses this. It&#x27;s great. It keeps my makeup off of my scarves.</li>
    <li> This is my first makeup setting spray that I buy - and use. It does help with the oil and shine on my face ! It makes my face feel a little tight at first but then it&#x27;s fine. Complaint: I don&#x27;t really like the smell of this spray at all :(</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, so the matte effect this product was supposed to give caught my attention. As with most new products, I tested it on my inner forearm, spraying twice. First, the scent was overpowering, same intensity as an eau de parfum. After a few minutes, I checked my arm for the matte effect--it was shiny and slightly sticky. Lastly, after I waited a bit more I saw that the sprayed areas on my skin turned pink--a slight allergic reaction. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use it on my face! I can&#x27;t use this product and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of a TV show called the Good Buy Girls, yes embarrassing to admit.  Today was the first day I tried the product and it happened to be a rainy humid day.  I sell vacation memberships and homes, by noon my make-up is usually half what it was when I applied it. Today however I used Model in A Bottle, it helped my make-up last not only through the rain, humidity, a full day of work and an after work nap... My make-up looks pretty dang good for being on my face for over 13hrs. If i had a date or event going on tonight I wouldn&#x27;t even need to touch up my make-up. I have to say I am very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> The sprayer it comes in doesn&#x27;t mist the product on it SPRAYS it so I transfer the product into a mister and it works perfectly. I can go 14 hours and my make up still looks freshly applied.</li>
    <li> Meh it&#x27;s alright. I heard hair spray works just as well</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! This product truely does what it says. I have very oily skin, and this product does not show that.</li>
    <li> I love this product it kept my makeup in place all day! I will definitely be using this for my wedding day!</li>
    <li> Liked nothing about this product.  Shiny, sticky, unflattering finish.  Ben Nye and/or Makeup Forever are better products by far.  Also NYX for that matter.</li>
    <li> This setting spray is great. Better then Urban Decay</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this. It does keep makeup on but did nothing as far as absorbing any oil, in fact it made it worse.  The smell isnt very pleasant but I would have dealt with it if it had worked like Id hoped. Couldve saved myself some money and bought blotting sheets.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Keeps make-up in place. The only thing is the perfume scent is sooooo strong. I sneeze with every use, and defer from using my normal perfume on days I wear Model in a Bottle to avoid overwhelming scents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a wedding planner, and this was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is a makeup stylist. Sets really well, lasts for a long time. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Model in a Bottle. Oprah was saying she uses this product so I decided to try it. It works well. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. The spray pump didn&#x27;t work though. Prompt shipping. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This I the worst product my face is stiff and shiny after spraying it on.not what I expected after hearing about this product for a long time. Should of read the reviews before purchasing.</li>
    <li> im so so in love with this setting spray it smells great and it actually works pretty well on my skin im going to be re-buying this product for life</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Keeps my makeup on all day and night! The smell is pretty good , doesn&#x27;t bother me much. But I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Love it.  Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product I love it. It holds your makeup for hours. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it runs out fast because its more like a spray not a mist; over all I love it and recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this product because of the reviews I have read in the past so once I did receive it, I was unhappily surprised of how mediocre the product is. I have an oily t-zone and it made my skin look even more oily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a person that has a similar skin type as myself.</li>
    <li> I liked how it arrived on time &amp; they provided with coupons towards my next purchase. It is exactly what I expected it to be like,</li>
    <li> I love this product. Had a problem with the spray but I just use a different sprayer in it. I have polysistic  ovarian disease, so I have to really be on top of plucking my chin hair.  This spray keeps my makeup on covering up and trace of a hair problem!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gr8 product! My wife loves it!</li>
    <li> There is a fragrance to this- I don&#x27;t like it- something kind of floral I think. However, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT otherwise. While I haven&#x27;t tested it to see if it makes anything waterproof, as far as all day make up protection for normal/slightly oily skin, its magnificent. If you wipe your face, some make up will come off- It&#x27;s not super heavy duty or anything. However, its keeps my makeup on for 14+ hours - even if I fall asleep. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight. There is a sensitive skin version though, if you have an issue with finding makeup for irritable skin.</li>
    <li> i would have gave this five stars for only the simple fact that it kind of burns when I put it on my face other than that my makeup stayed on all day I even went to bed with my makeup on(gross I know) and woke up the next day with a face full of makeup as if I just put it on. it really works!    Update****  For some reason after a weeks it just disappears this is the second time it happened the first time I thought maybe it accidentally spilled somehow but now it&#x27;s happened again don&#x27;t think I will be buying anymore</li>
    <li> I have been buying this since seeing it on Oprah&#x27;s favorite things several years ago. There is a reason she loves it and so will you! Your make up looks as good before you go to bed as it did when you put it on in the morning! Love it. I can&#x27;t go a day without this product.</li>
