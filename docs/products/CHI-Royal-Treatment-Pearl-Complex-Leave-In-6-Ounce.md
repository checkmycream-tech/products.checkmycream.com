    <li> Bought this for my wife.I overheard her talking about it and could not find a larger(ounce) size.Thanks to Amazon they had a larger size and I was able to purchase it for her.She was very surprised and did not know it could be purchase with more ounces.She loves it and I will be ordering more from Amazon.</li>
    <li> it is a little costly but my daughter, son, and myself have all different types and textures of hair. hers is curly at the bottom and tangles easy, my sons is super thick and unruley, and mine is just plain frizzy. Ever since i started with this product daughters is nearly tangle free, my sons hair has a smoother appearance and mine looks great. this actually is truthfull when is says WEIGHTLESS formula. you can&#x27;t tell anything is there. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The CHI Royal Treatment Pearl Complex is amazing. It leaves my hair managable and soft. Even when I put too much product in, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or sticky. I highly recommend the product and have done so to all of my friends. Also, when I received my first bottle, it was damaged in shipping and most of the product had leaked out of the container, at no fault by the shipper MyBeautyCenter. I called MyBeautyCenter as soon as I received the product and they immediately offered to ship out another bottle, free of charge and with no shipping fees. They didn&#x27;t even request that I send back the nearly empty bottle for verification. I will definitely be shopping them again and I truly appreciated the superb customer service!!!!</li>

    <li> My hairdresser uses this everytime she cuts and styles my hair. I liked it so I wanted it to use myself. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores but as always could find it on Amazon. I like the way it makes my hair look (shiny) and makes it easier to style. I think this a a good product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday.  Love the smell and love what it does to keep the frizz in control.  Highly recommend.</li>
