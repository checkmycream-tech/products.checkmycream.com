      <li>so I can rub my heel right into the salve and then massage it with my fingers into the skin.</li>
      <li>But the  \\&quot;BLACK SAB\\&quot;  SMELLS GOOD.</li>
      <li>After a long training run, one of my favorite things to do is to rub the salve all over my feet, paying special attention to any hot spots and put on some socks.  </li>

      <li>However, its so greasy you can&#x27;t really put it on and then walk around -</li>
      <li>It feels very deep-penetrating and protective, which I like.</li>
      <li>Very soothing.</li>
      <li>Very soothing salve.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t use it for my feet</li>

      <li>This salve is very greasy and oily which is why it works to well.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful too, unlike a lot of other foot products, at least if you like the smell of peppermint.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well. Rubbed onto my wife&#x27;s feet and it soaks in for good healing and good feeling. Love the natural ingredients. Great scent, too.</li>
    <li> This salve, while strong, has a pleasant odor.  While it does moisturize some, it seems a little too wax based to really improve the state of my heels -- it doesn&#x27;t really soak in like a more lotion-textured product would.  If you like a firmer, more wax based product, this may be for you.  Personally, I will be looking into a more lotion-based alternative.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use it every day and it has helped take the calluses off my feet!  Another quality Watkins product!</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet.  It soothes the dryness.  The black dead skin falls right off.  The skin smells bad. But the  \\&quot;BLACK SAB\\&quot;  SMELLS GOOD.</li>
    <li> Love this foot salve!&lt;br /&gt;I had problems with dry and cracked feet and using this balm every night before going to sleep totally improved the situation! Now they are softer and less prone to becoming dry during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the strong peppermint scent!</li>
    <li> Healing and love the smell</li>
    <li> My heels get super dry and gross, especially in the summer sandal season.  This salve is very greasy and oily which is why it works to well.  Other lotions just seem to soak in and not really improve the dry skin, while this is more effective in my experience.  However, its so greasy you can&#x27;t really put it on and then walk around - I feel like I&#x27;d fall on my butt in no time.  So, I use lotion if I need to just moisturize and I use this before bed with cotton socks.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer for feet! I put quite a bit on sometimes at night, then put socks on and let it sink in overnight. In the morning my feet are super soft.</li>
    <li> J. R. Watkins has excellent products.  So pleased with the salve.  Will continue to order in the future</li>
    <li> finally, something that works!</li>
    <li> Works great! Amazing!This removes callused areas, and smoothes the feet while smelling great. I  would certainly purchsse this agan and again!!!</li>
    <li> Product works fairly well but not as well as petro carbo salve another watkins product.  At least not for me and petro carbo is less expensive.  The per unit cost is more expensive but the canister is much larger and the salve goes farther.</li>
    <li> I am a martial artist and surfer.  My feet are often bare and taking a beating.  This salve has been great at relieving the dry feet i often face from standing hours on a mat&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Loved the smell&lt;br /&gt;Love how fast it works&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found any Watkin products I don&#x27;t love.&lt;br /&gt;My 98 yr. old mother-in-law got me started on Watkins products she swears by the &amp;#34;white linament&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have used much better.</li>
    <li> Very soothing salve.  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It helps to heal and soften feet in preparation for exfoliation.  The peppermint fragrance is fresh and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> My cracked heels are still cracked, but I admit, I do not use pumice every day and also do not apply this salve every night. It takes time to get into the habit of caring for my feet. I like the minty fragrance and the convenience of a wide enough opening so I can rub my heel right into the salve and then massage it with my fingers into the skin.</li>
    <li> Too greasy and doesn&#x27;t really work all that great and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> I love Watkin&#x27;s Products! This was excellent ! My feet looked better almost instantly!</li>
    <li> Goes on non-greasy and has a pleasant scent.  Better than the &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; lotion I have been using.  Also doesn&#x27;t make my feet slippy on the carpet.  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She used it and loved it, and demanded I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a foot salve before, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it compares with others.  I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised by the product.  I rubbed it on my aching feet after a long day of hiking.  My feet are generally rough and tough, and this felt good going on right before bed.  It had a bit of a soothing, relaxing feeling to it.  I put socks on over them, which I usually don&#x27;t do so that was a bit odd.  When I woke up in the morning, my feet had soaked up all the salve and they felt smooth and soft!  I doubt I&#x27;ll make this a regular thing, but if you&#x27;re into foot salves this one works.</li>
    <li> I love peppermint but most of all I love the way my feet began to tingle and it&#x27;s not to oily.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Watkins. This is great for my dry skin. I apply before going to bed. And by morning I am so much better, if not healed all the way. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The Bomb for Dry Feet.  My husband&#x27;s grandmother used this when they sold it door to door. The day she died at 84 her feet where as soft and beautiful as if she were 25.  I always buy it for my daughters in law as well as myself.  It is the best on the market!</li>
    <li> This foot salve is one of the better ones that I&#x27;ve tried. My feet (heels in particular) had gotten so dry and rough, they actually hurt when I walked at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use, following an Epsom salt foot soak and wearing thin socks after applying the salve, I could see and feel a significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking off one star as the tin doesn&#x27;t close as tightly as it should and I would also love to see this with an organic ingredient list available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I&#x27;m happy I found this product. My footsies are happy too.😉</li>
    <li> Delicate minty smell, rich emollient and non greasy foot soothing salve.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product. I love it..</li>
    <li> excellent for dry skin</li>
    <li> J.R. Watkins&#x27; products are great.  Natural ingredients that feel wonderful on the skin.  I use this every night! ! !</li>
    <li> Good feeling for your feet! Makes them soft and warm.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again, it made my feet nice and soft. It just did not last very long</li>
    <li> Great ointment. It smells great and really works!</li>
    <li> Works very, very well. Us here in Arizona have to deal with dry heals and feet almost year round. This is by far one of he best products my wife and I have used. After the first use my heals were noticeably better. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry cracked heels and feet.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for dry and calloused feet.  It also has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My heels have been very scaley and dry this summer. I use a battery operated &#x27;file&#x27; on them, then I slather this stuff on and sleep with socks. My heels are like new the next morning!</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR DRY FEET REALLY MOISTURIZES, MAKES FEET MORE ATTRACTIVE, AND ALSO TO THE TOUCH.. I would definitely recommend the product</li>
    <li> Received on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> Really this cream alleviates tired feet. I recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent product. We love it and will order again.</li>
    <li> Great for disgusting feet to help smooth it and soothe them, or to keep normal feet feeling moisturizer and healthy. Has a nice peppermint smell.</li>
    <li> It mainly worked on soothing my feet after a long day standing on them. Helped with some dryness but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t use it for my feet i use it on my cuticles. Has made my hands look so much better. Since i work in a office and i deal with a lot of papers.</li>
    <li> This salve worked better than any other OTC foot repair salve.....it smells good too!  I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Nice salve. My feet are really really dry and daily application of this salve helped greatly! I will order more</li>
    <li> L ordered for my feet and rough skin and it does work my feet are nice and smooth now it works</li>
    <li> Seems To Be Working Good!! Will Buy More When Needed!!</li>
    <li> Great product, really helps</li>
    <li> Feels great on feet and smells good.</li>
    <li> I am a semi-long distance runner (I&#x27;ve run 2 half marathons) and this is a must have for ANY runner.  After a long training run, one of my favorite things to do is to rub the salve all over my feet, paying special attention to any hot spots and put on some socks.  The peppermint gives it a nice, soothing tingle on your feet that is relaxing after a hard workout (or a long day on your feet!)</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week per package instructions and have noticed NO IMPROVEMENT whatsoever.  Kind of a waste of $, although it smells nice.</li>
    <li> This product has resolved the problem of heels cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;Its the best foot repair product I have found.</li>
    <li> Like many other Watkins products, this one does what it says and doesn&#x27;t disappoint. My hands also feel really smooth if left on overnight after rubbing on my feet. Will definetly purchase again!</li>
    <li> After two overnight application, my callouses are gone!&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance, nonstaining, not greasy and natural safe ingredients.  Was worried that it was too small until I tried it. Will see how&lt;br /&gt;frequently I have to replenish.</li>
    <li> Works really really good over night, night after night after night... you must use it often, but it is GREAT STUFF</li>
    <li> This is THE best stuff!! Works on scaly elbows too!  All natural ingredients-  can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Very greasy and not the best foot cream/lotion that I have used.  Gold Bond is much better and is greaseless.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First bought it in Amish Country...my feet are softer than they have ever been in my whole life!  I work on my feet every day, so had rough patches...those are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find this on Amazon, that way I don&#x27;t have to drive two hours each way to buy more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a small tin, but it will last you a very long time!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my feet so soft! I love to rub this stuff on and cover my feet with socks to sleep. It feels very deep-penetrating and protective, which I like. Seems to heal dryness on the tops of my toes and soles of my feet virtually overnight.</li>
    <li> My favorite foot moisturizer EVER! target doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore glad that Amazo is here for the rescue for less too!!</li>
    <li> Absolute best foot salve I have ever used! Dry cracked heels and feet are no longer a problem.  Very soothing.</li>
    <li> Kept my feet from splitting most of the summer.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products for my feet: exfoliators like sanders, scrubs &amp; soaks or softeners like lotions, creams &amp; balms. This salve is by far the best heel &amp; foot softener ever! It smells wonderful too, unlike a lot of other foot products, at least if you like the smell of peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to rub it into your feet @ night &amp; cover with socks. I’ve found a light coating of lotion over the salve works just as well &amp; it can be applied in the morning after a shower or bath too. If you want softer, prettier feet, then this salve is for you!</li>
