      <li>I love these hair pins!</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>These pins are kind of flimsy...</li>
      <li>They arrived in great time and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for ballet bun!</li>
      <li>Go instead for these Diane pins, and your fine hair for once won&#x27;t spontaneously unravel on your date or at work.</li>
      <li>Without using a hair tie, i just twist my hair up and around as many times as I need into a bun, shove 4 or 5 pins in it, bobby pin the excess, and in about 1 minute have a PERFECT bun that lays flay against my head and lasts the entire day.</li>
      <li>I was a hero because I was able to get them mailed to our door.</li>
      <li>I use these on my kids hair and they stay better than bobby pins.</li>
      <li>Perfect for french twist.</li>
      <li>I love this Hair pins</li>
      <li>These pins are okay...</li>
      <li>Hadn&#x27;t been able to find them for decades since ballet.</li>
      <li>They hold a bun on top of my head.</li>
      <li>I have gone to all the stores that carry this type of product and have not been able to find them until now.  </li>
      <li>And they&#x27;re safe to clip on that won&#x27;t hurt my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>Pins are great for holding long hair in a bun.</li>
      <li>Was so excited to find these on amazon.</li>
      <li>I got these (at this amazing price) 9 months ago, and I still have nearly all of them</li>
      <li>they really hold better then bobby pins</li>
      <li>A quick little squeeze with pliers creates a nice pin for making curtain pleats, and an unmodified version quickly pins up hair in a nicely concealed fashion.</li>
      <li>I always used regular bobby pins but these work so much better!</li>
      <li>The only thing that holds a bun better is a scrunchie!</li>
      <li>The ends are great for not hurting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Though the color (black) pretty soon comes of and it becomes silver.</li>
      <li>These are the hair pins that curly girls love for their up dos--and significantly cheaper than at my local beauty shops.</li>
      <li>Rubber tips and nice and long!</li>
      <li>These pins work great for people with thick, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Arrived super quick...very high quality, sturdy hairpins.</li>
      <li>Easy for clipping on my daughter&#x27;s big bun.  </li>
      <li>Would probably spend more next time and get something a little better.</li>
      <li>And we all know, no one wants to walk around with a scrunchie.</li>
      <li>My entire life I&#x27;ve had long fine hair and have been a huge fan of updo&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Nice and long, and they hold my daughter&#x27;s long hair in a ballet bun very well!</li>
      <li>My hair is very long and strong, yet these works well.</li>
      <li>They are a strong hair pin, great for thick n heavy hair.  </li>
      <li>The item its self was decent though</li>
      <li>Being an African-American woman, I opt for wearing my natural hair in locs, so I need something to really grip and hold my hair in place.  </li>
      <li>Regular bobby pins would be even a waste of time to try, so these are worth it. :)</li>
      <li>I bought them to use in a village to hold light wires in place in a foam base, and they worked great.  </li>
      <li>It works exactly the same as in those video.</li>
      <li>these are amazing but the paint comes off after 1-2 uses, it&#x27;s such a bummer and more annoying when i comb my hair</li>
      <li>Totally my fault as the listing title tells exactly how long they are.  </li>
      <li>other than that, the pins were very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I have super long all-the-way down my back hair and the pins don&#x27;t support the weight well.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how long these were.  </li>

<li> I was surprised at how long these were.  </li>
<li> Finally a hair pin that is long enough to hold your hair in.  </li>
<li> Love how strong they are and how long they are but black paint is peeling off them, that&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
<li> I have l long hair and regular bobby pins just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
<li> because the plastic tip of the hair pins falls off really easily making the hair pin uncomfortable to push into the hair.</li>
<li> If you are poor at estimating size, as I clearly am, you may want to look at what 3 inches really is on a tape measure before you order.</li>
<li> I was looking for these old-fashioned pins for a long time.</li>
<li> They are not as long as I wanted</li>
<li> I have long been looking for pins like these, and you never find them at stores.</li>
<li> a bit wider than what is actually shown, so I have to use other pins to help me create the styles.</li>
<li> I bought these to make high buns or updos for my thick wavy hair.</li>
<li> I can twist my hair into a bun and use 1 single pin to hold it up if I needed to.</li>
<li> The black paint on the pins peels off, and the most annoying part is i&#x27;m finding the specks of black paint everywhere, my cell was was covered in tiny black specks, the type of stretchy paint really sticks to surfaces.</li>
<li> I have quite thick hair (for a white girl), it&#x27;s long enough to almost be waist-length</li>
<li> At school I always have other girls asking how I got my hair like that (and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t use a hair tie) and I will always suggest that they get these.</li>
<li> These pins are like the hulk compared to any other wimpy fiddly pin.</li>
<li> It works on my daughter&#x27;s heavy long hair.  </li>
<li> the issue that I have is that the pins are spaced a little wide...</li>
<li> My hair is naturally curly and very thick.</li>
<li> So I have thick, waist length hair, and my job requires me to have my hair up (for obvious reasons).</li>
<li> but the black color is chipping off and getting all over the place</li>
<li> there are tons of black paint from the pins stuck on it.  </li>
<li> Every time I used them my husband was picking off black specks from my face...</li>
<li> The long pins are hard to find...</li>
<li> I have very long thick hair</li>
<li> If you want your hair to stay put, jam a few of these babies in your &#x27;do and it&#x27;ll sit tight once and for all.</li>
<li> My hair is thick and half way down my butt.</li>
<li> My buns usually end up drooping throughout the day.</li>
<li> I have a very heavy hair and therefore not all Hair Pins suit me.</li>
<li> Old-fashioned hairpins (not bobby pins) are hard to find.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even swim with them or do anything else crazy.</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These pins work great for people with thick, wavy hair. They stay where you put them and don&#x27;t slip out of place.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how long these were.  Totally my fault as the listing title tells exactly how long they are.  If you are poor at estimating size, as I clearly am, you may want to look at what 3 inches really is on a tape measure before you order.</li>
    <li> Very good hair pins. I got it today and already use. I have a very heavy hair and therefore not all Hair Pins suit me. I love this Hair pins</li>
    <li> Awesome! I can keep my hair up all day with only three pins! Strong and perfect size for my hair</li>
    <li> Good temporarily.  The color and the protective ends rubs off after one use.  Being an African-American woman, I opt for wearing my natural hair in locs, so I need something to really grip and hold my hair in place.  These pins do that without bending or losing shape.  Will I buy them again? No.</li>
    <li> Finally a hair pin that is long enough to hold your hair in.  These hair pins are great.  I use them almost every day.  You will not be disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> they really hold better then bobby pins but the black color is chipping off and getting all over the place</li>
    <li> On hair, drapery, or anything you can think of.  A quick little squeeze with pliers creates a nice pin for making curtain pleats, and an unmodified version quickly pins up hair in a nicely concealed fashion. Fair price, as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived super quick...very high quality, sturdy hairpins.</li>
    <li> Perfect for french twist.</li>
    <li> It works on my daughter&#x27;s heavy long hair.  Easy for clipping on my daughter&#x27;s big bun.  And they&#x27;re safe to clip on that won&#x27;t hurt my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> They are a strong hair pin, great for thick n heavy hair.  I bought them to use in a village to hold light wires in place in a foam base, and they worked great.  Two uses, both to satisfaction .</li>
    <li> I got these couple of weeks ago. Love how strong they are and how long they are but black paint is peeling off them, that&#x27;s quite annoying. I don&#x27;t even swim with them or do anything else crazy.</li>
    <li> Pins are great for holding long hair in a bun. I&#x27;ve been looking for pins like this for years as they are similar to what I used as a child. They arrived in great time and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> So I have thick, waist length hair, and my job requires me to have my hair up (for obvious reasons). I got these (at this amazing price) 9 months ago, and I still have nearly all of them and I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without them. Without using a hair tie, i just twist my hair up and around as many times as I need into a bun, shove 4 or 5 pins in it, bobby pin the excess, and in about 1 minute have a PERFECT bun that lays flay against my head and lasts the entire day. At school I always have other girls asking how I got my hair like that (and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t use a hair tie) and I will always suggest that they get these. Might be getting a bulk shipment soon!!!!</li>
    <li> The black paint on the pins peels off, and the most annoying part is i&#x27;m finding the specks of black paint everywhere, my cell was was covered in tiny black specks, the type of stretchy paint really sticks to surfaces. Every time I used them my husband was picking off black specks from my face...ugh attractive.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great ballet pins. They don&#x27;t come out even during wildest jumps.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for ballet bun! I learned about this when I searched online on securing the bun for ballet girl. It works exactly the same as in those video.</li>
    <li> I love these hair pins! My hair is naturally curly and very thick. I can twist my hair into a bun and use 1 single pin to hold it up if I needed to. (Youtube has some great ideas and videos on how to use these)</li>
    <li> They are not as long as I wanted but they work for my pincurls and to hold my hair in whatever style I want.</li>
    <li> Love them! I have l long hair and regular bobby pins just don&#x27;t cut it. Was so excited to find these on amazon. Hadn&#x27;t been able to find them for decades since ballet. My hair is thick and half way down my butt. Three of these pins will hold it up all day</li>
    <li> These are perfect if you like to wear buns. I always used regular bobby pins but these work so much better!</li>
    <li> These are the greatest for chignons. My hair is very long and strong, yet these works well. I have long been looking for pins like these, and you never find them at stores. Thank you for selling these.</li>
    <li> It was opened when i got it. The item its self was decent though and I will definitely use it.</li>
    <li> These are great pins.  Nice and long, and they hold my daughter&#x27;s long hair in a ballet bun very well!</li>
    <li> I bought these to make high buns or updos for my thick wavy hair. they do wonders! the only reason why i gave 4 starts i because the plastic tip of the hair pins falls off really easily making the hair pin uncomfortable to push into the hair.</li>
    <li> these are amazing but the paint comes off after 1-2 uses, it&#x27;s such a bummer and more annoying when i comb my hair there are tons of black paint from the pins stuck on it.  if these were just with no paint they would be the best.</li>
    <li> I use these on my kids hair and they stay better than bobby pins.</li>
    <li> My wife has been searching stores in our area for these pins. I was a hero because I was able to get them mailed to our door.</li>
    <li> My entire life I&#x27;ve had long fine hair and have been a huge fan of updo&#x27;s. These pins are like the hulk compared to any other wimpy fiddly pin. If you want your hair to stay put, jam a few of these babies in your &#x27;do and it&#x27;ll sit tight once and for all. Then use smaller pins for fly-aways or to keep your headband in place, etc. I had about six or so of these Diane 3\\&quot; pins I used for years while always trying to find a paralell supermarket brand that worked halfway as well. The only thing that holds a bun better is a scrunchie! And we all know, no one wants to walk around with a scrunchie. That&#x27;s the hair equivalent of sweatpants. No. Go instead for these Diane pins, and your fine hair for once won&#x27;t spontaneously unravel on your date or at work.</li>
    <li> I have gone to all the stores that carry this type of product and have not been able to find them until now.  I have very long thick hair and this is the only fastener I can use if I want to wear my hair up.</li>
    <li> These pins are kind of flimsy... I have super long all-the-way down my back hair and the pins don&#x27;t support the weight well. My buns usually end up drooping throughout the day. Would probably spend more next time and get something a little better.</li>
    <li> Rubber tips and nice and long! These are the hair pins that curly girls love for their up dos--and significantly cheaper than at my local beauty shops. The long pins are hard to find...but, here they are!</li>
    <li> I have quite thick hair (for a white girl), it&#x27;s long enough to almost be waist-length and I use these to hold my braids in place as well as any type of bun. Regular bobby pins would be even a waste of time to try, so these are worth it. :)</li>
    <li> Old-fashioned hairpins (not bobby pins) are hard to find. I&#x27;m really happy with these. They hold a bun on top of my head.</li>
    <li> Noce quality. The ends are great for not hurting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Though the color (black) pretty soon comes of and it becomes silver.</li>
    <li> I bought these hair pins to create styles like FroHawks and Pompadours. These pins are okay... the issue that I have is that the pins are spaced a little wide... a bit wider than what is actually shown, so I have to use other pins to help me create the styles. other than that, the pins were very sturdy.</li>
    <li> I was looking for these old-fashioned pins for a long time. These are the same my grandmother, used to wear.  You twist them while grabbing hair, and then you hide them in your hairdo.  The style stays and you don&#x27;t show how.  Excellent quality.  Love them!</li>
