### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great addition if you wanna feel like you&#x27;re in a salon while</li>
      <li>Though I am happy.</li>
      <li>These are great for elderly clients or any client that has to sit under a hair dryer for a great length.  </li>
      <li>Great to have my ears protected under the steamer :)</li>
      <li>Covers ears nicely as needed we use  under dryer to prevent ears from becoming too hot does that perfectly we continue to use</li>
      <li>Nice fit.</li>
      <li>so they would fit a liittle more snugly on my ear.</li>
      <li>my  suggestion is to place a santex strip  around your head and then place the ear shield underneath the strip to secure the shield in place.</li>
      <li>Pretty Straight forward, they are priced nicely and do the job.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done by keeping my ears cool, however I wish it was a bit thicker.</li>
      <li>It is good, but not too stable and could fall off easily, little protection.</li>
      <li>Item is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>but they do somewhat help to keep my ears from getting hot.</li>
      <li>They do get hot.</li>
      <li>if someone else is doing your hair - you can just hold them in place - but a little troublesome if you&#x27;re doing your own hair.</li>
      <li>However, I am yet to use the item so I cannot say much about it.</li>
      <li>It may fit a 4 year old but not an adult.</li>
      <li>These are ok, although I thought they would be a little softer (silicone-like)</li>
      <li>It does hold the ear tightly so consequently it could slip and drop easily..</li>
      <li>Would recommend to any woman that has sensitive ears and the  hair dryer burns them.</li>
      <li>The description says soft, the plastic is</li>
      <li>Fit a little bit loose</li>

    <li> These are ok, although I thought they would be a little softer (silicone-like) so they would fit a liittle more snugly on my ear. They are rather rigid and bigger than i would like. I will make them work though. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It is good, but not too stable and could fall off easily, little protection.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended me to get some of these when I use my sit under hair dryer at home. I found these and was a bit disappointed. I thought they would be sturdier and less expensive considering the product. I wa disappointed when one week later, I saw the item for $5 less! It gets the job done by keeping my ears cool, however I wish it was a bit thicker.</li>
    <li> Pretty Straight forward, they are priced nicely and do the job. I bought them to protect my ears from the heat during  drying and they help.</li>
    <li> This product will protect your ears from chemicals or color treatments as long as you can keep them in place. The Ear Shields have a little lip on the inside of the cup, which allows them to hang on your ears but they won&#x27;t \\&quot;cup\\&quot; your ears ... no problem if someone else is doing your hair - you can just hold them in place - but a little troublesome if you&#x27;re doing your own hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these after giving myself a bad burn on one ear with a hot iron.  They work, or at least I haven&#x27;t had a burn since buying them.</li>

    <li> This product protected my ears. Would recommend to any woman that has sensitive ears and the  hair dryer burns them.</li>
    <li> The ear shield do their job. They do get hot. I did receive only one pack of ear shields though it pack of two so beware. Maybe it was me. Though I am happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this ear shield but it was not as I have expected.. It does hold the ear tightly so consequently it could slip and drop easily..</li>
    <li> Covers ears nicely as needed we use  under dryer to prevent ears from becoming too hot does that perfectly we continue to use</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how small they are. It may fit a 4 year old but not an adult. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are plastic not foam but they do somewhat help to keep my ears from getting hot.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable. Sharp edges inside the shields &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Just like the ones in the Dominican hair salons. Go for it girls. Great addition if you wanna feel like you&#x27;re in a salon while your at home under a hooded dryer, doing everything yourself, and saving money!!</li>
    <li> Bought these for showering, never stay on the ears. Sturdy.</li>
    <li> A bit flimsy but does the job my  suggestion is to place a santex strip  around your head and then place the ear shield underneath the strip to secure the shield in place.</li>
    <li> A little bit disappointed keep falling off my eats when I drying my hair. but cover both of my ears.</li>
    <li> Nice fit. elastic material forms well to body shape.</li>
    <li> These are great for elderly clients or any client that has to sit under a hair dryer for a great length.  I also use them to protect the ears from curling iorns.  They are kinda hard to find.</li>
    <li> Fit a little bit loose but they definitely get the job done. Great to have my ears protected under the steamer :)</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described. However, I am yet to use the item so I cannot say much about it. Delivered on time. No complaints.</li>
    <li> They work fine for my ears, however, they are a little small. I thought I ordered medium...but they&#x27;ll do.</li>
