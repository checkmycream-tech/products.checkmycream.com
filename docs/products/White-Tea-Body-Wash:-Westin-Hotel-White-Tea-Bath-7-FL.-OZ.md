<li> Does not last too long but worthed</li>
<li> My only little complaint is that the container is a little too rigid to make it easy to squeeze - especially when your hands are wet.  </li>
<li> Made our skin dry.</li>
<li> Westin also has a leaf soap in this fragrance but they are very small and do not last long.  </li>
<li> does not last long, very thin, I wish it was creamier and that they made perfumes of the same scent.</li>
<li> I brought my little bottles home</li>
<li> Only complaint -bottle has to be squeezed way to hard to release the liquid, should be user friendlier for use in shower.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this body wash but I don&#x27;t use it as much as I&#x27;d like due to the cost.</li>
    <li> I really believe that this scent is straight from the heavens!!  It envelopes you as you enter the Westin lobby and is just intoxicating!!  Soothing to the soul!!</li>
    <li> Purchased after a stay @ a Westin. Hotel was NOT all THAT! But loved the body wash, that I paid $300.00 a night for.  So, when I returned from trip I ordered some on line.</li>
    <li> Refreshing scent,have the defuser too.  Only complaint -bottle has to be squeezed way to hard to release the liquid, should be user friendlier for use in shower.</li>
    <li> When I travel to the westin, I&#x27;m always taken back by the scents of the soaps, body wash, etc.  Such a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a bottle I can use at my home.  I will continue to order more.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> the timeless fragrance always reminds me of our wonderful stay at the Westin in the Cayman Islands.  It is so fresh and sexy.</li>
    <li> Same wonderful wash that is found in the hotel. Love the smell. Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I love all the Westin white tea things</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash I have ever used. Cleans and has a wonderful smell. Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to feel and smell fresh.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent - thanks!</li>
    <li> Stayed at the NYC Westin and Chicago Westin. Fell in love with this scent. Everything smelled so fresh and clean. Thought I could buy it at the spa in the hotel. Only available on-line. Arrived in 2 days! Smells delightful. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells awesome. I first experienced it at a Westin Hotel and has been using it every since.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Westin White Tea Aloe (Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Wash) by my darling boyfriend. I fell in love with the wonderful scent instantly. I was very happy when i found out that i could buy the Westin products from Amazon. I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and body wash last year and was extremely happy with the products that were sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering to make another purchase this year but found out that the price has gone up from $14.00 to $18.95. I think that $19 is a steep price to pay for a 7 ounce bottle. Oh well, I might just grab a bottle as a gift for myself for Christmas :D</li>
    <li> i love this stuff, I get as much as I can evertime I stay at Westin. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I walked into the Westin in Maui and this fragrance filled the air. It was everywhere and every time I wear it I think of this amazing experience.</li>
    <li> I know this is expensive but I just love the smell! It smells so clean &amp; refreshing &amp; makes me excited when I have it in my shower;-)</li>
    <li> feels like I am back in the hotel</li>
    <li> Made our skin dry. Smell is great, you decide.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! This is the best smelling, most relaxing line of body washes and lotions I have ever come across. If not for the price, this would be all I would ever use!!!</li>
    <li> used it in the westin and loved it and had to have some for home</li>
    <li> This product is very light and airy.  It does not leave a strong scent on one&#x27;s body but a very clean scent.  It smells just like the fragrance that is emitted throughout the Westin Hotels throughout the country.  I experienced this aroma in Panama..so delightful.&lt;br /&gt;I love the light refreshing smell.  I also ordered the body lotion that goes with this wash.  It too is very light and not extremely moisturizing but gives one a light scent to compliment the wash. Westin also has a leaf soap in this fragrance but they are very small and do not last long.  I wish they had huge bars of this product for purchase but they do not.  The bars are lovely though and nice for travel.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks to another review I read I was able to find and  purchase a cologne by BVLGARI EAU PARFUMEE  called AU THE&#x27; BLANC refreshing spray cologne that mimics this fragrance.  It too is very light and compliments this wonderful white tea smell.&lt;br /&gt;I got this info from others and was able to find this cologne in that way.  It is not a heavy parfume...light and adds to the body wash fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;You will love all of this purchase.  When I use this product it reminds me of my wonderful Panama vacation.</li>
    <li> This product smells so fresh it is unbelievable.  Got a sample from the Westin Hotel and HAD TO order it on line.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Too pricy for the size of the bottle, plus it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well, so you end up using more than normal and going through it quicker.</li>
    <li> When we went to Hawaii last year, this was one of the Hotel&#x27;s &amp;#34;Bathroom Condiments&amp;#34;. I fell in love with it.  I brought my little bottles home and, when I ran out, I re-ordered them on line. Reasonable price and, I love it!</li>
    <li> Love all the Westin WhiteTea products.  Beautiful Fragrance, Leaves Skin Feeling Soft &amp; Mosterized...</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Have looked for this fragrance FOREVER I feel and smell sweet again! ha  glenda</li>
    <li> I want more items to compliment this, the room atomizer, the body oil, lotion, candles. All of it. Smells so damn good!!!!</li>
    <li> Good！&lt;br /&gt;I like it!&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I like her!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for giving me a small gift!</li>
    <li> I use it as bubble bath, and am extremely satisfied. It&#x27;s pricey, but so worth having that beautiful smell of the Westin Hotel on Ft Lauderdale Beach!!</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of Westin hotels, this product is for you. Does not last too long but worthed</li>
    <li> I first used this and the other bath products when I was at the Westin in Shanghai. It is such a soft, fresh scent  and am so happy I could find it on line.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this and the body lotion and the hand soap and love them all.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived within about 10 days and was just what I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Would love to have a perfume, though!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever stayed at a Westin Hotel, you will fall in love with their products.  The smell is &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s wonderful for the bath or shower.  Please consider it for a gift item because I believe anyone would be happy to receive this as such.</li>
    <li> What else can I say?  One of my favorite smells.  I stayed at the Westin and ever since it has been one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I am giving a five start to this soap because I love this soap scent since I stayed at a Westin hotel before.&lt;br /&gt;Like: scent, not small container&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: does not last long, very thin, I wish it was creamier and that they made perfumes of the same scent.</li>
    <li> I stayed at a Westin hotel late 2011 and fell in love with this fragrance. It&#x27;s clean invigorating without any strange tingly ingredients.</li>
    <li> My package arrived on time and I was very pleased. This is the only hotel item that I actually adore. It smells heavenly and leaves my skin extremely soft. Definitely one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I first tried this bath wash at the Westin in Chicago and fell in love with it. Now I have my own and can use as much as I want.Thank you.</li>
    <li> Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured! I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but pricey. So will only purchase occasionally, found this at a stay in Westin in Virginia Beach.</li>
    <li> After staying at the Dublin Westin hotel, I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about their body wash.  I was able to find it on Amazon and it is everything I remembered.  My only little complaint is that the container is a little too rigid to make it easy to squeeze - especially when your hands are wet.  All in all, I love it!</li>
