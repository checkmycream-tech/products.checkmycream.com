      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of rubbing in my facial sunscreen until it completely disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have combination skin: dry patches on cheeks with oily T-zone, a very sensitive skin that reacts to almost everything</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Paula&#x27;s choice products and love them.  This is very moisturizing but does not feel greasy, which is great.  LOVE that it is free of chemical sunscreens, that it is only a physical sunscreen.  I am very pale with Red Head completion, I found this did leave a slight white cast to my skin, but that is how it is with all physical sunscreens and I&#x27;m just nit-picking.</li>
    <li> I have been using Paula&#x27;s Choice products for years. I think the products are reasonably priced and perform well. They are also fragrance free. If you haven&#x27;t tried them, then I think you&#x27;ll be very pleasantly surprised. I also recommend calling the company and talking with the sales staff at least for the first time. I&#x27;ve found the sales staff very helpful in recommending products for specific skin care needs.</li>
    <li> I have used Paula&#x27;s Choice Recovery Lotion for years and really liked it. Since the lotion has upped its&lt;br /&gt;SPF to 30 it&#x27;s even better.  I love the new creaminess and how it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS BUT TRULY A BIT OILY - USE THE LESS IS MORE ROUTINE AND IT&#x27;S GREAT!</li>
    <li> Great quality lotion and eco friendly. Love you Paula!</li>
    <li> Make sure you know your skin type. I have oily skin and therefore the Balance or resist line works better this line is for really dry skin. Save $10 on your first Paula&#x27;s Choice order here: http://goo.gl/J5uNbc enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> This goes on very well.  I don&#x27;t like the price for the amount of product, however.</li>
    <li> This is expensive moisturizer/sunscreen, but it does not aggravate  my perioral dermatitis at all, so I think it is entirely worth the cost. It goes on smoothly and sinks into my skin nicely with no residue and my make up goes on well over the top. I love it. My skin looks really healthy right now.</li>
    <li> 3 stars for the white cast it leaves behind. I&#x27;m not a fan of rubbing in my facial sunscreen until it completely disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve turned to Japanese brands instead, which are both higher rates in terms of protection and truly invisible no matter how much of it you goop onto your face.</li>
    <li> Very good emollient, moisturizing sunscreen that does not have the super thick chalk like texture of other sunscreens on the market! Make sure to rub it in good because it can leave a thin white cast on darker skin tones. It will disappear though after a few mins. Best for dry to very dry skin or skins that needs extreme moisture after neglect or during dry winter season!

    <li> Having had rosacea all my life (and now ACNE rosacea at 40+, lucky me), I bought this as part of a much-needed skin care overhaul. I was concerned this might be too heavy or add oil, and also that there would be a visible white cast from the zinc oxide in this formula. I needn&#x27;t have worried. This product is extraordinary, and does what it claims. It provides deep moisturization with zero greasiness or heaviness. My skin is exceedingly sensitive, and this lotion calms it, makes it soft, and feels weightless all day long. I use this under light makeup and it causes NO extra shine and becomes invisible as soon as it&#x27;s applied. An extremely effective product which I highly recommend. Alleluia!</li>
    <li> No product will turn back the clock 20 years . I like this product because of the SPF and keeps my skin moisturized without breakouts. There is no fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Leaves my skin feeling silky and protected. It is not greasy like a lot of moisturizers with sunscreen and does not burn around my eyes when applied. Plus the zinc is great for my skin. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I finally found a facial sunblock that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye skin.  I still end up with a little shine under my makeup at the end of the day, but I&#x27;ll take shine over sun damage any day!  Love Paula&#x27;s Choice skin care.</li>
    <li> Love this and most of Paula&#x27;s Choice as they don&#x27;t hurt my eyes!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that works for me. I can&#x27;t use chemical sunblocks because they burn my skin and most physical ones clog my pores. This one is light but moisturizing. It gives off a whitish shine when you first put it on but that goes away after it absorbs. It&#x27;s best for dry skin, might be a little greasy for oily skin. You can get it for $10 cheaper from the PC website by using this link - https://goo.gl/OaekuX</li>
    <li> Hydrates, has no scent, absorbs quickly without leaving oily surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin: dry patches on cheeks with oily T-zone, a very sensitive skin that reacts to almost everything and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Outstanding for Rosacea skin, not one breakout in 2 weeks - a record for mw</li>
    <li> It works well enough for my skin.  I have recently learned that I have an allergy to the sun.  My skin gets very itchy, lots of bumps and irritated.  This calms down the itchy about 50%.  But itching is itching so hey.</li>
    <li> Been using these products for a couple years for rosacea.  I think they are all great!</li>
