      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it, and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Although I do like it and think it&#x27;s better than just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; (3-stars), I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
      <li>I have to say, it really does a great job on my sore muscles after a workout.</li>

      <li>, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m familiar enough with the aroma of frankincense (by itself, i.e., without myrrh, etc.)</li>
      <li>The scent is the classic woody, floral, and balsamic scent that serrata frankincense has.</li>
      <li>This was my first time purchasing frankincense essential oil.</li>
      <li>though I find it kind of subtle, I definitely like the way it adds to the aromatic ambiance of a bedroom.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this brand due to the very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>no regrets!</li>
      <li>I see that EarthWise also offers a Frankincense Essential Oil that unlike this one, is distilled in California.</li>

    <li> It is a small bottle but great size to see if you like it or not. I use mine in my diffuser during the day for positive thinking. This has a pleasant earthy smell to it. I would buy again in a much bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic. I add it to my lotion. It&#x27;s a great anti wrinkle oil. It&#x27;s making a difference on my skin. I&#x27;m very happy with it, and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; (5-stars) but I do &amp;#34;like it (4-stars). Although I was an altar boy way back when (before JFK was president!), and though I&#x27;ve operated businesses that sold essential oils and incense and I&#x27;ve used different brands of frankincense incense, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m familiar enough with the aroma of frankincense (by itself, i.e., without myrrh, etc.) to make a comparison with this product. I see that EarthWise also offers a Frankincense Essential Oil that unlike this one, is distilled in California. This one is distilled in India, and I&#x27;m guessing that they may have different aromas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this in an electric diffuser and I though I find it kind of subtle, I definitely like the way it adds to the aromatic ambiance of a bedroom. I also like the atmosphere I get when I put a few drops on a wrist and rub my wrists together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, one can sample an essential oil before buying. Because I didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to sample any brand of frankincense essential oil before ordering this one, I took a chance. Although I do like it and think it&#x27;s better than just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; (3-stars), I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I received this on time it was sealed with no leaks. I had a sample of Doterra, and thought I would give this a try. It&#x27;s the India sourced frankincense, do it does smell much different. I was having a problem with my knee and I mixed it with a carrier and rubbed it on my knee. My pain stopped within a few minutes. I was surprised, but glad. To me the smell is not pleasant, but is tolerable. I will definitely use this again.</li>
    <li> This product smells delutited.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. It smells like urine.  I&#x27;ve used different brands before and this brand by far is the worst.</li>
    <li> Nice scent even though it says it doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> great buy! no regrets!</li>
    <li> Really potent oil scent.</li>
    <li> I mean , it&#x27;s a great oil to infuse.....I happen to like the price, not too expensive and not too cheap.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT, GREAT SMELL, WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to ease inflammation in my muscles. I have to say, it really does a great job on my sore muscles after a workout. The fragrance is nice as well. The scent is the classic woody, floral, and balsamic scent that serrata frankincense has.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for my mother&#x27;s arthritic knees after talking to an aromatherapist friend of mine. We have been rubbing the oil on her knees and other joints daily and it seems to be relieving pain and decreasing stiffness. The scent is very nice with hints of lemon, citrus and pine. Overall quality and purity is as expected. </li>
    <li> It is working well for my intended purpose. Using it topically on a suspicious looking spot on my face and arm, I saw almost immediate evidence of it working. l feel, in time, the spots will disappear. I used it in my diffuser but the scent quickly dissipated, although I used it generously.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing frankincense essential oil. I decided to try this brand due to the very reasonable price.The oil arrived very well packaged and smells good.I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil that soothes and releases spirituality</li>
    <li> Smell is nice but the bottle leaked badly.</li>
