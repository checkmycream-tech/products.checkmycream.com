      <li>worth it, great deal!!</li>
      <li>Amazing results overnight.</li>
      <li>The mask absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>When I wash it off in the morning my face looks nice and plump.</li>
      <li>The ingredients aren&#x27;t anything impressive, but this is a great last step to your skincare routine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very, very strongly occlusive, so it will seal whatever yummy serums and moisturizers you have on into your skin about as well as if you wrapped your face in plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>I saw this product at Daiso for $1.50 and had no idea if it would be effective, so I pulled up Amazon and thankfully was able to find reviews for it.</li>
      <li>love this mask.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>really love this mask.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>my daughter loves this product and especially loved the personal note and origami,thank you</li>
      <li>I love this it says night time</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting over the top, &amp;#34;No, I swear, didn&#x27;t get Botox&amp;#34; results~just healthy skin from the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and works better than some of the $80 + products I have</li>
      <li>This  really works!!!!  </li>
      <li>this was so cheap, or I&#x27;d probably be more disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin gets irritated easily and needs babying after these treatments.</li>
      <li>and I have noticed a reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I believe that we have found a fun product that can easily be the budget version of Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair!</li>
      <li>also it is super light and it feels really refreshing</li>
      <li>One of the primary ingredients in this sleeping pack is alcohol, which my skin does not appreciate.  </li>
      <li>love it so much better than the stuff from the mall and lasts SO MUCH</li>
      <li>I like this product so much!!!</li>
      <li>It really help to moisture your face!!!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this Daiso HA Sleeping Pack out.</li>
      <li>That said, this product is great and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin that is treated with sometimes aggressive skincare products.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!!!</li>
      <li>I immediately noticed my face was full and hydrated.</li>
      <li>When I wake up, my skin is soft and nicely hydrated.</li>
      <li>I would pay more for a product that accomplished these results.</li>
      <li>Just to clarify, Daiso is not bad.</li>
      <li>This stuff is exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Amazing results after only one night.  </li>
      <li>So, if you don&#x27;t mind some unpleasantness, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>However, if you can&#x27;t $6.00 is completely worth it.</li>
      <li>Wow I love this gel mask.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Love it, especially at this price.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I use a toner &amp; moisturizer first then use this to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it all in.</li>
      <li>You have to be  consistent with using it....</li>
      <li>I wish I discovered Asian beauty products sooner because they seem to be more compatible with my skin.</li>
      <li>For Normal/Combo Skin for the past five years since it does a good job of hydrating me, but this hyaluronic acid &amp;#34;sleeping pack&amp;#34; does just as a good job as the Garnier moisturizer that I use and for a cheaper price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply this nightly after cleansing my skin and toning, and then I rinse it off in the morning, and my skin absolutely glows.</li>
      <li>Usually I won&#x27;t buy anything that doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients clearly listed, but I bought this anyway because of all the great reviews it got here.  </li>
      <li>Alcohol is listed third among the ingredients, and the mask smells strongly of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Excellent when used as a regular moisturizer for sensitive acne prone skin – did not break me out even when left on overnight or all day long.</li>
      <li>fairly decent glowing skin!</li>
      <li>Put a little more on before my makeup and felt like it made my face look smoother and overall better.</li>
      <li>, I put this on before bed to really see what it could do.</li>
      <li>Then, in the morning, before rinsing it off~it felt like a bizarre mix of sticky &amp; gritty.</li>
      <li>I tried it don&#x27;t have to put much on and ir really keeps your skin moisturize</li>
      <li>It dries right away clear.</li>
      <li>Acts like a high end product.</li>
      <li>It is highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny (though the price is so low I was amazed).</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to provide a solid review, but so far so good</li>
      <li>The next morning, my skin was so plump and clear that I knew I had to go back to Daiso to buy more.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t actually tell right now</li>
      <li>Not only that, but the fine lines that were starting to appear on my forehead have all but gone.</li>
      <li>So cheap, and such a big tube!</li>
      <li>It seemed to have a mild affect, in the short time I used it, but not enough to deal with the uncomfy sticky feeling, every morning.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You have to eat collagen (pills, or eating chicken feet lol) to reap the benefits of it.</li>
      <li>To be clear, I got this at one of the Daiso&#x27;s in the Seattle area.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to tell if it making a difference</li>
      <li>Looks &amp; feels natural &amp; my skin does seem clearer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Weekly: Cure Natural Aqua Gel</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what it would be like and was a little hesitant about using it because of its price and the fact that everything on the back package was in Japanese.</li>
      <li>It smoothed on and dried fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>used this mask once on a small area on my face (forehead only) in the hopes that I might be able to tolerate it, but when I washed it off the next morning, the skin on my forehead was dry and very itchy.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any breakout or irritation from this, and i have rosacea so that is a major plus.</li>
      <li>If you want soft glowing skin look no further.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have gotten the gel mask to wear over it, but did not realize one would be useful until a few days after making this order.</li>
      <li>Decent , not real intensive.</li>
      <li>After my usual skincare routine, (cleanse/tone/moisterize) I&#x27;d apply it from my forehead all the way down my neck~making sure to avoid getting it too close to my eyes.</li>

<li> Instead of using it as a mask I use a small amount as my daily moisturizer and my skin has never been softer or happier despite the fact I live in moisture sucking Colorado.&lt;br</li>
<li> The plumping action is so noticeable that you must keep this away from under your eyes because it makes them look a little too plump -</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything online, and the Amazon user who asked for the ingredients on this product page was unanswered until I responded with the list from the back of the bottle.)</li>
<li> Keep this to the dry areas of your face that need some love.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great mask!.&lt;br /&gt;Can tell a difference in my skin already&lt;br /&gt;Priced great too</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to provide a solid review, but so far so good</li>
    <li> Seller was excellent! Arrived sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Product is great. Woke up this morning with no flaky skin on my face. Put a little more on before my makeup and felt like it made my face look smoother and overall better. Will definitely order again and I&#x27;m ordering the collagen mask next time too!</li>
    <li> I like this product so much!!! It really help to moisture your face!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this Daiso HA Sleeping Pack out. For 2 weeks, I used it every night. After my usual skincare routine, (cleanse/tone/moisterize) I&#x27;d apply it from my forehead all the way down my neck~making sure to avoid getting it too close to my eyes. (seriously, follow those instructions about getting too close to your peepers--it burns!!!)&lt;br /&gt;  anyways, I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the feel once it &#x27;soaked in&#x27;. My skin felt a bit dryer, than usual. Then, in the morning, before rinsing it off~it felt like a bizarre mix of sticky &amp; gritty. (difficult to describe) I figured it must be &amp;#34;part of the process&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;  I wasn&#x27;t expecting over the top, &amp;#34;No, I swear, didn&#x27;t get Botox&amp;#34; results~just healthy skin from the Hyaluronic Acid. It seemed to have a mild affect, in the short time I used it, but not enough to deal with the uncomfy sticky feeling, every morning.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried 2 other &amp;#34;Sleeping Waters&amp;#34;, since using the Daiso. Neither are sticky or gritty!&lt;br /&gt;  Just to clarify, Daiso is not bad. it does it&#x27;s job &amp; I did get some benefits from using it: fairly decent glowing skin! So, if you don&#x27;t mind some unpleasantness, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable results especially at this price. I have EXTREMELTY dry skin and this gives me plenty of moisture without any greasy feeling. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and works better than some of the $80 + products I have</li>
    <li> This product does not hydrate as the name suggests. I use it for several nights and saw no difference. My skin seems to only got dryer. I returned it.</li>
    <li> If you want soft glowing skin look no further. Wow I love this gel mask. It dries right away clear. U just wake up in the morning and was it off. I have extremely bad acne prone skin. I was worried about leaving a mask on all night. No worries. I woke up not one blemish just softer skin. This will be in my beauty routine forever now.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and does not make my skin oily! I have used half the bottle with no breakouts. There is a slight alcohol smell, but that is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change in my face</li>
    <li> For the price... This is a remarkable product! Will not break you out even though it is thick and I have noticed a reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles. They literally vanish and I wake up with flawless texture and supple skin every morning. Acts like a high end product.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this are CRAP!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this product and especially loved the personal note and origami,thank you</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin so soft and smooth. A little bit goes a long way, don&#x27;t goop it on. I use a toner &amp; moisturizer first then use this to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it all in. Don&#x27;t forget to scrub it off in the am or you&#x27;ll get to work and wonder why you look waxy!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working. Can&#x27;t actually tell right now but I&#x27;ll keep you with my update when I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Yea, do yourself a favor and get yourself this instead of those $40 creams.</li>
    <li> love it so much better than the stuff from the mall and lasts SO MUCH LONGER i love it</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin looks amazing in morning!</li>
    <li> Amazing results overnight. I immediately noticed my face was full and hydrated. Even having psoriasis and eczema myself.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it, great deal!!</li>
    <li> Use for my hand lotion</li>
    <li> I believe that we have found a fun product that can easily be the budget version of Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair! The mask absorbs nicely. It does a great job ofplumping, moisturizing, and returning a nice glow to your face. Love it. I use it 3 times a week!</li>
    <li> I have used this now three nights in a row. I believe it locks in all of the goodness I put on before it(serums, pore emulsion etc.). When I wash it off in the morning my face looks nice and plump. I haven&#x27;t had any breakout or irritation from this, and i have rosacea so that is a major plus.</li>
    <li> I saw this product at Daiso for $1.50 and had no idea if it would be effective, so I pulled up Amazon and thankfully was able to find reviews for it. This review is my way of paying it forward, so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this mask. I wish I discovered Asian beauty products sooner because they seem to be more compatible with my skin. I have used the Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel-cream For Normal/Combo Skin for the past five years since it does a good job of hydrating me, but this hyaluronic acid &amp;#34;sleeping pack&amp;#34; does just as a good job as the Garnier moisturizer that I use and for a cheaper price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply this nightly after cleansing my skin and toning, and then I rinse it off in the morning, and my skin absolutely glows. The consistency is rather gel-like, but it feels lightweight on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just shows that you do not need to buy highly expensive, luxurious brands for your skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing results after only one night.  I do not even rinse it off in the am.  Soft and less puffy skin.  Worth every penny (though the price is so low I was amazed).</li>
    <li> So cheap, and such a big tube! The ingredients aren&#x27;t anything impressive, but this is a great last step to your skincare routine. It&#x27;s very, very strongly occlusive, so it will seal whatever yummy serums and moisturizers you have on into your skin about as well as if you wrapped your face in plastic wrap. That means, don&#x27;t put it on your nose, you&#x27;ll get breakouts. Keep this to the dry areas of your face that need some love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says sleeping pack, but I use it as my final step both in morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, only get this one, not the collagen one. Hyaluronic acid works! Collagen molecules are much, much too large to penetrate topically, so putting them on in the form of lotion is useless.  You have to eat collagen (pills, or eating chicken feet lol) to reap the benefits of it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough to tell if it making a difference but I like how my face feels and looks when using it. I wish I would have gotten the gel mask to wear over it, but did not realize one would be useful until a few days after making this order.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a HG routine and this moisturizing mask is now my go to. Instead of using it as a mask I use a small amount as my daily moisturizer and my skin has never been softer or happier despite the fact I live in moisture sucking Colorado.&lt;br /&gt;My Routine:&lt;br /&gt;Step One: Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil&lt;br /&gt;Step Two: Trader Joes Nourish All In One Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step Three: Rohto Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion&lt;br /&gt;Step Four: Hyaluronic Acid Sleeping Gel Mask Moisturize Sleeping Pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weekly: Cure Natural Aqua Gel</li>
    <li> For the record, I did not buy this product from Amazon or from anyone online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at my local Daiso for $1.50. I wasn&#x27;t sure what it would be like and was a little hesitant about using it because of its price and the fact that everything on the back package was in Japanese. That said, this product is great and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin that is treated with sometimes aggressive skincare products. My skin gets irritated easily and needs babying after these treatments. Not knowing what it would do and having never tried a \\&quot;sleeping pack\\&quot;, I took a chance and hoped this product wouldn&#x27;t initiate a flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely didn&#x27;t. Instead of using it overnight and waking up to a surprise, I put this on in the morning on my day off to see how my skin would react and how the product would dry. It smoothed on and dried fairly quickly. Hours later, my skin was plump and refined. My makeup looked brighter and clearer. I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acid products that are far more expensive than this and they didn&#x27;t deliver results this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I washed my face that night, I put this on before bed to really see what it could do. The next morning, my skin was so plump and clear that I knew I had to go back to Daiso to buy more. The plumping action is so noticeable that you must keep this away from under your eyes because it makes them look a little too plump - almost swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a Collagen version of this that I am going to buy, too. I hope you can locate a Daiso in your area so you can get it for the Daiso price. However, if you can&#x27;t $6.00 is completely worth it. I would pay more for a product that accomplished these results. It is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!!! This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Excellent when used as a regular moisturizer for sensitive acne prone skin – did not break me out even when left on overnight or all day long. I apply immediately after exfoliating (Cure Aqua Gel) and have not had even the slightest hint of irritation or breakout. And it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Loved receiving this package. It had a beautiful letter and I am also happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I tried it don&#x27;t have to put much on and ir really keeps your skin moisturize</li>
    <li> I love this it says night time but I use it during the day also it is super light and it feels really refreshing</li>
    <li> This stuff is exactly what I wanted! Thanks! Looks &amp; feels natural &amp; my skin does seem clearer. Love it, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> Decent , not real intensive. Use as a base prior to heavier mosturizer. Use as neck /decolatage&#x27; base as well.</li>
    <li> This  really works!!!!  You have to be  consistent with using it....</li>
    <li> To be clear, I got this at one of the Daiso&#x27;s in the Seattle area. Not on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mask. Its wonderful. Once I&#x27;m out of my evening shower, I put on a serum. I let the serum absorb for a few minutes then I put on the Sleeping mask. When I wake up, my skin is soft and nicely hydrated. I dont bother to wash it off like the directions say to.</li>
    <li> Great!!! Works dreams!</li>
    <li> love this stuff, will order more</li>
    <li> I put this on last night and despite the fact that I am currently suffering with stomach flu I have woken up to plump, dewy skin! Not only that, but the fine lines that were starting to appear on my forehead have all but gone. If only I was well enough to go out and show it off!</li>
    <li> Usually I won&#x27;t buy anything that doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients clearly listed, but I bought this anyway because of all the great reviews it got here.  Big mistake!  One of the primary ingredients in this sleeping pack is alcohol, which my skin does not appreciate.  Alcohol is listed third among the ingredients, and the mask smells strongly of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask once on a small area on my face (forehead only) in the hopes that I might be able to tolerate it, but when I washed it off the next morning, the skin on my forehead was dry and very itchy.  I&#x27;ll still use this on my feet or something so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste (maybe overnight while wearing socks since this sleeping pack is so thick), but I won&#x27;t be putting this anywhere near my face again.  Good thing this was so cheap, or I&#x27;d probably be more disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And in case you&#x27;re wondering why I didn&#x27;t research the ingredients before buying... I definitely tried to!  I couldn&#x27;t find anything online, and the Amazon user who asked for the ingredients on this product page was unanswered until I responded with the list from the back of the bottle.)</li>
