<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I had ordered a different brand prior to this, and I like this one much better because it has hardly any scent and it comes in the pump bottle.  Makes it a lot easier to get the correct amount.  I have dry skin and this oil really helps to moisturize it.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily/greasy feel.  It has also lightened some old acne scars I have, not drastically, but they are less noticible.  I will definately reorder!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing oil! For the past two weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day - when I wake up and when I go to bed. I absolutely love the feeling of my face after applying it. Even though it is an oil, when applied it actually absorbs into your skin, leaving it softer and more hydrated. My skin didn&#x27;t feel oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any change to my fine lines. But again, I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks and from prior experience of using other products, I know sometimes it takes a month or two. It also is sunny spring here in the Charlotte, NC area, which isn&#x27;t helping stop my skins aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend trying this product. I received a free sample for my honest opinion and was pretty impressed with its moisturizing ability.</li>
    <li> Does the job skin soft and lovely but a bit pricey....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, small size bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok thanks.&lt;br /&gt;A b</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily facial moisturizer. I was using NOW rosehip oil, but the quality of this is much better and has the deep amber color. I love the pump, you can use only as much as you need. Plus it is the best deal I&#x27;ve found for the money. Will buy again. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I could not see a difference in my skin when using this product.  I had read reviews that it worked on scars didn&#x27;t help</li>
    <li> I had a sample Ole Henrikson Pure Truth Youth Activating Oil - which I totally fell in love with but than I saw the price. Rosehip seed oil is the main ingredient.  It has a light herbal scent and is a very light fast absorbing oil. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like that it is pure and sinks into the skin very well - AND it doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;One little negative is that the pump sometimes sticks a bit and gives more than you want.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, compared to other companies, this is a good buy and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Came at a reasonable time. Smells heavenly. Awesome oil. Used on my creams and lotions, works wonders!! Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> This is a good quality of Rosehip Seed Oil and it works well.  What I like most about it, however, is the bottle.  On the picture, they show a translucent, orangish bottle.  It&#x27;s not.  I realized that the bottle is actually an opaque black bottle with a pump dispenser.  How convenient is that?  The bottle doesn&#x27;t allow light to get in to ruin the oil.  If you keep the oil cool (I do), it should stay good for the entire life of the bottle.  Great seller; received the product quickly.  I will absolutely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> We all have our skin problems that make us self conscious  of our looks and if you are like me always looking for ways to make your skin look and feel better.  After much research into the essential oils I finally decided to try the BEAUTYOILS CO 100% Pure Rosehip Seed Oil Moisturizer  on my face and problem areas like the stretch marks on my belly from having children.  I have noticed that the more I use the Rosehip Seed oil the less I see of the marks or scares where I have put it.  This also makes a wonderful moisturizer for my face and the little marks and scares that are on my face have started to disappear.  Rosehip oil is naturally rich in essential fatty acids, including omega-6 and omega-3, as well as provitamin A, which makes for a healthy glow when used.  A little bit of this oil does go a long way.  I received product for the purpose of an unbiased review.  All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Unlike Argan oil from Josie Maran ( this oil is super great) , this rosehip oil makes me itchey on my face. I bought this as it was cheap but I dont think the quality is good enought. I use this for my hair as I cant put on my face and body directly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and love it.  I do believe I am seeing a reduction in spots and lines and my skin overall looks radiant.  I use it twice a day.  I apply it and let it absorb for a few minutes on a damp face and neck and the apply my moisturizer over it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It seems to keep my eczema under control since I have not been itching whatsoever. I bought it in combination with burts bees rosewater toner which I hear is supposed to be good. I will keep using both and see if they lighten up my blemishes. Hopefully I will see some results soon.</li>
    <li> This is the first bottle of rosehip seed oil I have ever purchased and I really find it very nice and moisturizing..I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to since I have never used it before..but I plan to reorder when I get low on this bottle as I am very happy with the results I am seeing on my face.</li>
    <li> Really helps the healing</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily on my face for two months and am very pleased.  It is absorbed quickly without leaving a greasy feel to my mature skin.  I find it is gentle to the skin beneath my eyes.</li>
    <li> 6 months ago, I found BeautyOil&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t start using it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all rosehip seed oils are created equal and having suffered through past mistakes using ones of lesser quality, I wondered whether BeautyOil&#x27;s quality would be worth the trouble of introducing a new ingredient to my skincare regimen. From the start I noticed BeautyOil&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil was different -- it didn&#x27;t trigger any transitional flare-ups. On my skin, that&#x27;s a good indication of a very legit product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before BeautyOil&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil, my skin turned temperamental after I moved to a new city in a different climate -- I have sensitive, combo skin with dry cheeks and a moody T-zone. A total hassle! I tried other moisturizers/oils ranging from upmarket cosmetics lines (Guerlain) to other natural brands (Dr. Hauschka) -- there were phases when my skin improved, I suppose, but all relatively short-lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was exasperated with temporary results, so I gave this product a go...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 2 weeks, I mixed 25% rosehip oil + 75% moisturizer: the results were impressive as my skin felt noticeably hydrated and nourished for longer -- it absorbed pretty quickly without feeling overwhelmed or greasy. On the 3rd week, my skin slowly but surely began to LOOK better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a tough customer, so I was still skeptical about its long-term performance: would the trend of improvement continue past the first month?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes! Throughout month 2, I incrementally increased the ratio of this oil and my skin absolutely loved it. After maintaining this routine for 6 weeks, my colleagues and friends noticed my skin and randomly commented how it seemed to glow. WTF - seriously? Huzzah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, 6 months later, my skin continues to be super happy using a mix of:&lt;br /&gt;70% BeautyOil Rosehip Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;20% vitamin E oil&lt;br /&gt;10% rosewater toner&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels/is great and the most obvious improvement isthe texture -- it&#x27;s smooth, uniformly balanced and refreshed. Considering how fussy, congested and flaky my forehead and cheeks were prior to this product, my skin is now essentially renewed. I&#x27;m delighted with how it&#x27;s turned out for me and so glad to have made it part of my beauty arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Three more great things:&lt;br /&gt;1) Sunscreen and make-up do not \\&quot;ball up\\&quot; when used with BeautyOil Rosehip Seed Oil -- in the past, I&#x27;ve experienced different ingredients working against each other. Not fun! With this, they all work together very well.&lt;br /&gt;2) It helps to easily blend in concealer applied beneath my eyes with the rest of my face. I don&#x27;t need to bother with foundation or primer.&lt;br /&gt;3) A small amount of the oil goes a long way and I&#x27;ve saved time and money (and cabinet space) since using it.&lt;br /&gt;___________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A+. Positively love it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product thinking its a miracle worker...it isn&#x27;t!  But it is a good moisturizer for people with very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in April and have been in love with it ever since ! I am 19 years old and have suffered from acne, oily skin, and acne scars since I was 13. I tried EVERYTHING in stores, but nothing really ever did the trick. It takes at least two weeks to see a difference but if you use it as a daily routine you can see the results. My acne scars are almost gone and I stopped getting acne. My face is completely clear ! My friends and family wondered what I was doing and my mom is now using this oil as well. It is quite possibly the most amazing product I have ever used. I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore, my skin tone is even and I am not embarrassed about having discoloration or horrible acne scars all over my face. I will keep ordering and re-ordering.</li>
    <li> They followed up to make sure i was happy with their product.  Although ive only used the oil once I am more impressed with their customer service.</li>
    <li> Very convenient dispenser, so zero wasted product. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two months, so I can&#x27;t speak to its scar-fading abilities (maybe six months from now), but it&#x27;s great at helping keep my constantly dry skin a little less flaky than your typical moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Excellent price!  Will purchase rose hip oil from this seller again!!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of different types of oil: argan, vitamin E, jojoba, and this has become my favorite go-to in the morning.  Use it in moderation and it is the perfect moisturizer that you&#x27;ll ever need.  A couple of times I use a little too much, but I don&#x27;t wipe it off.  If I can just let it sit on my skin a little white longer, it just soaks it right in to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also mix it with a little of lemon on my adult acne scar, and it seems to be lightening.</li>
    <li> This summer, I got into two bicycle accidents which left me with, among other things, large scrapes and bruises on my face and legs. After some research, I ordered this rosehip seed oil to help fade and soothe the marks on my face. Within a week, folks commented on how much better the injuries looked, and after a while, I started applying this stuff directly to other wounds on my body, to cuticles, and as a nighttime deep-condition for my lips. This may be too rich for allover facial use, but I recommend it for spot-treating scars and dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a lot of the other oils available on Amazon, BeautyOils is the real deal: 100% cold pressed, in a convenient dispenser bottle (which comes in three sizes). The medium-sized one has lasted me under moderate use, and I bet the larger size is worth the price difference.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. I am finding it to be a great alternative to my night time moisturizer,  sometimes during the day under my foundation that has sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I really really like rosehip seed oil. It has wonderful benefits for your skin. You just got to make sure you get a good quality oil for it to work well to give you all the benefits. I use it for my face &amp; a scar I have from surgery. I am very pleased with my results, and will definitely purchase again. I read the reviews and decided to give BeautyOil.CO a try. And I love it, it&#x27;s fresh &amp; it&#x27;s good quality. BeautyOil.CO also has great customer service and they make sure their customers are satisfied with their products. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this oil. I use this as my nighttime moisturizer and it works awesome!  It makes my skin soft and supple. It also helps regulate my monthly breakouts. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase and will be reordering soon. Leaves my face feeling moisturized but not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> BEAUTYOILS.COM sent me a fresh, rich bottle of Rosehip Seed Oil. The color was gorgeous and I love the subtle, earthy almost tea like scent. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product - my skin feels softer and dry areas are gone. You only need a small amount and it absorbs pretty quickly for an oil.  I would probably prefer a dropper or pump because it is more difficult to get the right amount out of the flip top but you can simply take the top off and get a little better control that way.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience using Rosehip Oil, and I am quite impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the time I spend outside, in the elements, and change of water sources, my skin and hair has taken its toll. I was thrilled to find that this 100% Rosehip Oil brought my dry skin, and hair back to a lustrous dewy shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am a travel blogger/YouTuber, and live in my Class A RV, with my dogs, I am fortunate that I can do beauty treatments while I work (research, typing articles, etc.), and don&#x27;t have to worry about going outside if I don&#x27;t want to, and can leave this wonderful Rosehip Oil in my hair for hours (which I do!), without the worry of someone giving me the strange look like I just crawled-out of a grease pit! hehe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face/neck/hands/d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, I apply 4 drops to my hands, and rub vigorously between my palms to warm the oil up a bit. Then I slick it all over, and watch my body drink it in like water on sand!  It&#x27;s fabulous!  What a difference a few weeks has made in my skin/hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am familiar with BEAUTYOILS.CO, and they never disappoint. Their oils are made from high-quality products, and they are in a league of their own. When I compare similar oils, or beauty products that other companies sell, it is obvious that BEAUTYOILS.CO is the superior brand. The integrity of their oils are impeccable, as well as their customer service. I sure am tickled I was given this opportunity to review their Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest, and unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.</li>
    <li> The product is as described.  Overall, I am pleased with this product.  I have ordered other brands of this oil, and this is a good value.  The bottle is plastic and not glass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and I&#x27;m planning on getting more products like this from them. I&#x27;m hoping it will help with my skin condition. Thank you for your prompt service!</li>
    <li> I will order this again and again as needed!  I make a lot of my own beauty products and a couple of my recipies call for rosehips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost two weeks now.  Other oils have made my skin feel greasy or oily later in the day but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with the rosehip oil.  I do mix it with an spf moisturizer to get those benefits as well.  The smell is a little odd which is the only reason for 4 stars, but it fades quickly and I wouldn&#x27;t stop using it because of this.</li>
    <li> Is making my redness and brown spots disappear.  The odor isn&#x27;t the greatest, but you only need a small amount to cover your whole face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased I bought this, I was looking for a dry oil to give my moisturizer some extra oomph during the winter months and this did the trick. I wash my face in the shower and slather a pump or two on, once I get out I pat my face dry and get dressed. Once I&#x27;m dressed and ready to put on my make up this oil is completely absorbed and my make up goes on smoothly and stays matte and moisturized all day. I has also faded many of my old acne scars, I have only been using it for a month and I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal Rosehip Oil! It is downright fabulous. WAY better than NOW brand. It goes a long way as well. Love that it is a pump bottle. I have definitely noticed a difference in my fine lines. Really gives a great amount of moisture to my skin as well. I sometimes mix with my other face products in the morning and at night to give that extra bit of moisture.</li>
    <li> When I first got it, didn&#x27;t really know how to use. After hearing Dr. Oz tell to add it to your creams or other things you use on your face. I have seen a huge difference. My skin is much tighter and feels super. I use this rose hip oil every day. I add it to my Argan oil.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had really bad acne when I was younger and now have many scars on my cheeks. I take probiotics and daily multi vitamins along with washing my face daily that I was told would help. But once I got this oil the appearance of my scars have diminished considerably. I have only had it for a week and am amazed at the results. The box came perfectly and the oil is great no smell and my skin soaks it up great. I use it twice a day after I wash my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several things on my face including coconut oil, but this oil is light and goes in my skin.  It is not at all greasy.  I use a few drops mixed w/my face cream (as suggested my Dr. Oz) and love it!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Such a glorious oil..!  Applies very nicely &amp; leaves no greasy feel (ok, give it a few minutes). I blend with a few essential oils for added nourishment. I use it for my face &amp; of course there&#x27;s always extra to rub into my hands and nails/cuticles. I&#x27;ve had a few rough spots on my hands ... gone, with regular use. And my nails look fantastic. You won&#x27;t be disappointed ...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get to use most of this.&lt;br /&gt;The entire pump mechanism worked, but haphazardly squirted out either too much or too little oil, which was irritating, however the cap was absolutely worthless, and kept falling off.  Within the first week I had it, my son knocked it over in the drawer it was in and it leaked all over the place.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil to use on my face. I have incredibly dry skin and nothing has worked better than this oil. I have been using it for over 6 months and have seen improvements with my skin. I highly suggest it to people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin, especially in the colder months, and as a licensed Esthetician I am always looking for the best product to hydrate my skin. Lately, the product I&#x27;ve been reaching for the most is BeautyOils.Co 100% pure Rosehip oil. Rosehip Oil has many great benefits for the skin, and I find it hydrates my skin perfectly without leaving any kind of oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;What are the benefits of Rosehip Oil for my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rosehip Oil contains Vitamin A, which is a great natural exfoliant for the skin. It will exfoliate your skin from the inside out reducing the appearance of dark spots, wrinkles, acne, and acne scars. It will also help brighten and improve the overall texture of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains Vitamin C which is a great antioxidant so it will fight free radical damage, reducing the signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil will sink into your pores and hydrate leaving it soft and supple without leaving any oily residue. I also notice that my skin looks more radiant after using this oil.&lt;br /&gt;As another bonus, try using the BeautyOils.Co Rosehip oil on your cuticles to moisturize your nails, or in your hair to smooth flyaways!&lt;br /&gt;The BeautyOils.co Rosehip oil comes in a dark container which protects it from the light, and it has a cap so you don&#x27;t overuse the product. I also don&#x27;t notice much scent to this product at all, it has a light scent but nothing overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the BeautyOils.Co 100% pure Rosehip oil. This has been a wonderful step in my skincare routine. I recently had a Micropeel done on my skin, and it left it scabbed and extra dry, using this oil as a final step in my routine has made my skin heal nicely, and it isn&#x27;t dry feeling at all anymore. I recommend using this oil if you have very dry, dry, or even combination skin. If you have oily skin, it may not be so great for you, but you should still use it on your hair and nails!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased reviewreview</li>
    <li> This was a well priced bottle of Rosehip Oil. It was sent very quickly. The rich orange color and subtle scent let me know it was good quality. I love using it as a natural product in place of creams as a wrinkle reducer/preventative.</li>
    <li> This order arrived promptly and it seems to work really well with my extremely dry skin.  I would recommend this for others with dry skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it fades dark spots on my face.</li>
