      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>this is a great product &amp; it really works.  </li>
      <li>&amp; i notice a difference in my hair; thicker feeling &amp; has better texture, too.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>and that is fabulous compliment to my Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo (FYI - love the tea tree shampoo - spot on Paul Mitchell).</li>
      <li>First, the smell is amazing.</li>
      <li>I live in Virginia, which is a fairly humid state.  </li>
      <li>The Thickening Spray works fine with / withOUT the PM Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo or /Conditioner.</li>
      <li>This product was recommended by my stylist as I have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>going gray and it makes a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner was sealed with scotch tape and the shampoo in a cheap transparent bag as taken from a flea market..</li>
      <li>Glad I did as this is just a high quality product as the shampoo itself and compliments it (as do most conditioners/shampoo combos).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on a clean, damp section of hair for about 5 minutes, for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>The product conditions well without weighing hair down which is important especially on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>After an &#x27;accidential&#x27; discovery of this product I have been a loyal user ever since.  </li>
      <li>A light lasting fragrance of sage and lemon with a clean silky texture, who could ask for more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells wonderful and that was the only reason I purchased to try, and it is the only positive attribute to this conditioner</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need the extra weight on my baby fine hair on top of dealing with humidity.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey, but oh so worth it.</li>
      <li>I discovered this after a transition to more natural products.</li>
      <li>After rinsing with cool water, my hair did not feel very moisturized, and my curls were undefined and had not clumped together</li>
      <li>If you have oily or slightly oily hair, this would probably be a good product for you.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m losing my hair due to PCOS and this product is helping tremendously to hide that and give me more confidence.</li>
      <li>My locks felt so thick and luxurious after just 1 use of this and the more i use, the more results i see.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and hope it will work like it advertised.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>This is very sketchy product presentation for a high price.</li>
      <li>Will be using for quite a while - high recommend for curly girls who miss their volume...</li>
      <li>I have had high expectations for this product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know for sure</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For normal hair like mine, this product doesn&#x27;t work over an extended time.  </li>
      <li>I have thin hair and this does a good job of giving my hair body.</li>
      <li>, again don&#x27;t use a ton of it, just use small drops, works fantastic!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>It does work as far as hair having a thicker appearance.  </li>
      <li>also wanted to note that I had considerable shedding after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE the way paul mitchell lemon sage makes my hair feel twice as thick when i use it.  </li>
      <li>After using the shampoo and condtioner for two months, I realized that my hair had gotten much too dry.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that always gets weighted down when I use conditioners, but is dry and frizzy if I don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>ok so far i cannot go wrong with Paul Mitchell products...</li>
      <li>I only noticed a bit of extra volume for the first week, then it seems like my  hair got used to the product and then went back to its limp self.  </li>
      <li>suppose to be for fine thin hair but left my hair with no body at all</li>

<li> Can be a little drying.  </li>

<li> It looked like had been used before, and I am not sure if what is inside these bottles is the legit product as there were no security caps.  </li>
<li> I have not noticed dramatic difference in my hair thickness and would say that it dried my hair a little.</li>
<li> and it is difficult to condition without it looking greasy afterwards.</li>
<li> I am afraid and concerned about what is inside...</li>
<li> Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner were delivered in really bad presentation:  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner were delivered in really bad presentation:  The conditioner was sealed with scotch tape and the shampoo in a cheap transparent bag as taken from a flea market.. It looked like had been used before, and I am not sure if what is inside these bottles is the legit product as there were no security caps.  Should I use?  I am afraid and concerned about what is inside...This is very sketchy product presentation for a high price.</li>
    <li> suppose to be for fine thin hair but left my hair with no body at all</li>
    <li> I use a different brand shampoo, but I got Paul Mitchell brand for conditioner because previous reviews stated it didn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  I live in Virginia, which is a fairly humid state.  I don&#x27;t need the extra weight on my baby fine hair on top of dealing with humidity.  This makes my hair feel good too.</li>
    <li> Not particularly thickening, but sadly also very drying.</li>
    <li> Picked this up by accident when ordering the shampoo of the same brand and scent.  Glad I did as this is just a high quality product as the shampoo itself and compliments it (as do most conditioners/shampoo combos).  Works on everyone in the family.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Does leave your hair fuller.  Can be a little drying.  I alternate with another shampoo and conditioner but use this, also.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my stylist as I have baby fine hair and it is difficult to condition without it looking greasy afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using this product and although it smells wonderful, it does not condition at all. I have more snarls and tangles in my hair than when I started. Switched to &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; miracle leave-in lite conditioner on the ends and that is fabulous compliment to my Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo (FYI - love the tea tree shampoo - spot on Paul Mitchell).</li>
    <li> After an &#x27;accidential&#x27; discovery of this product I have been a loyal user ever since.  A light lasting fragrance of sage and lemon with a clean silky texture, who could ask for more.  Nothing has even come close for me in comparison.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I really like it. Fast shipping and hope it will work like it advertised. Will purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> The product conditions well without weighing hair down which is important especially on my fine hair. Also, love the smell. I use a different shampoo that contains Biotin but have used the matching shampoo and it worked well too. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> LOVE the way paul mitchell lemon sage makes my hair feel twice as thick when i use it.  going gray and it makes a huge difference.  been a paul mitchell fan for decades and always will.  best quality on the planet.</li>
    <li> this is a great product &amp; it really works.  i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks &amp; i notice a difference in my hair; thicker feeling &amp; has better texture, too.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my hair shining</li>
    <li> This works AWESOME! My hairs smells and feels great and it looks thicker. I&#x27;m losing my hair due to PCOS and this product is helping tremendously to hide that and give me more confidence. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this after a transition to more natural products. First, the smell is amazing. Second, it does wonders for your hair. It is pricey, but oh so worth it.</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly.  I do not like purchasing such small containers of shampoo and conditioner for environmental reasons... these just do not last long</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that always gets weighted down when I use conditioners, but is dry and frizzy if I don&#x27;t.  I have found that this product makes my hair soft and managable, while not weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. I use it after using the Lemon Sage shampoo. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Great scent, great feel, great hair. My locks felt so thick and luxurious after just 1 use of this and the more i use, the more results i see. Wore my hair straight for the first time and was shocked to see how much it had grown. Will be using for quite a while - high recommend for curly girls who miss their volume...</li>
    <li> I only noticed a bit of extra volume for the first week, then it seems like my  hair got used to the product and then went back to its limp self.  I still like the shampoo and conditioner, but will likely keep switching to other products to not allow my hair to get used to one specific formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have had high expectations for this product. I have not noticed dramatic difference in my hair thickness and would say that it dried my hair a little. But than again, I have rather damaged hair to begin with. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> ok so far i cannot go wrong with Paul Mitchell products...conditioner works great, paired with the shampoo amazing results, again don&#x27;t use a ton of it, just use small drops, works fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It does not leave my hair greasy or lifeless.  Other  conditioners increase the amount of time between washings.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this does a good job of giving my hair body.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.  Makes my hair soft and shiny.  I have fine, curly hair.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a coily curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on a clean, damp section of hair for about 5 minutes, for testing purposes. After rinsing with cool water, my hair did not feel very moisturized, and my curls were undefined and had not clumped together whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it&#x27;s thicker consistency, it has no slip and is not a conditioner for detangling. That was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and that was the only reason I purchased to try, and it is the only positive attribute to this conditioner that I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to note that I had considerable shedding after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t finish it and would not repurchase. I will give it away.</li>
    <li> Just a little goes a long way - I usually shy away from conditioners - they normally make my hair too soft and unmanageable, but this product doesn&#x27;t do that - give body and shine instead!</li>
    <li> It does work as far as hair having a thicker appearance.  I don&#x27;t feel that my hair is &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34;, though.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know for sure but I think it&#x27;s a product I might not use every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> The Thickening Spray works fine with / withOUT the PM Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo or /Conditioner. I already had a Spray and thought the shampoo/conditioner would help but not much difference. I will order the P.M. SPRAY again but probably not the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> If you have oily or slightly oily hair, this would probably be a good product for you.  After using the shampoo and condtioner for two months, I realized that my hair had gotten much too dry.  I then started using a different conditioner, one meant for dry hair, but realized I was defeating the purpose of obtaining volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For normal hair like mine, this product doesn&#x27;t work over an extended time.  The volumizing benefits are not outweighed by the dryness and dullness that results from regular usage.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use the shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair clean and smelling good.</li>
