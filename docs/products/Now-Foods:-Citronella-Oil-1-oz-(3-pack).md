      <li>It&#x27;s a true smelling citronella oil.</li>
      <li>Not bad, Noseeums love me, but I don&#x27;t love them, scars from their bites last for months and their bites itch for days.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality oils, I&#x27;ve purchased several different oils from the &#x27;Now&#x27; brand</li>
      <li>Like I said, I don&#x27;t like the smell of citronella, but it helps a lot to cut it with lavender and grapefruit (which are less effective at repelling mosquitoes but much better</li>
      <li>I feel good about it because I don&#x27;t have to spray my kids down with deet.  </li>
      <li>It took a while to air out the house after receiving this package leaking, but the product itself is exactly what I hoped for.</li>
      <li>I was taken aback a bit at first, but then my scent memory took over</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>- just doesn&#x27;t do much to ward off mosquitoes like I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
      <li>I think the candles just aren&#x27;t big enough to really be effective.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product to ward off mosquitoes as she is highly allergic to them.</li>
      <li>We live in Houston where the mosquitos flourish in the summer.</li>
      <li>Bought these to use in a natural mosquito spray recipe for the babies.  </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons to 1/2 gallon straight white vinegar.</li>
      <li>Previous reviews were correct, this is the real deal, so pure</li>
      <li>I recently took a hike with several people and of all of us only me and my niece, whom I also sprayed carefully, walked out of the woods tick free.</li>
      <li>Far cheaper than whole foods or other retailers.</li>
      <li>I can actually smell this from the outside of the bottle, which I normally can&#x27;t with other EO&#x27;s.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Using this for many purposes and spray aplication</li>
    <li> I love to use this oil and to make an insect repellent.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best essential oil I&#x27;ve bought. It&#x27;s very strong smelling and quite effective at keeping bugs away. I plan on buying more once this runs out.</li>
    <li> Use this to make a bug spray mix. Previous reviews were correct, this is the real deal, so pure and you can tell. I love the smell, but have never smelled pure citronella. Not bad, Noseeums love me, but I don&#x27;t love them, scars from their bites last for months and their bites itch for days.</li>
    <li> Really strong citronella scent. Bought these to use in a natural mosquito spray recipe for the babies.  Got it brewing and will update the results when skeeter season comes around...lol.  Now Foods has some really good products.</li>
    <li> Wanted this as a spray.  Added to distilled water in purse size spray.  Great.</li>
    <li> wonderful addition to the organic bug repellents we mix</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a true smelling citronella oil. I use it in a combo spray for Mosquitos and while it does keep them away for a few minutes , it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would like. Not sure what else to use it for.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, works well, great price, very strong</li>
    <li> It took a while to air out the house after receiving this package leaking, but the product itself is exactly what I hoped for.</li>
    <li> Used it to make candles for back patio to keep mosquitoes away. I think the candles just aren&#x27;t big enough to really be effective. Every now and then I get a smell of the scent and it smells nice - just doesn&#x27;t do much to ward off mosquitoes like I&#x27;d hoped. Again, it might be the candle size, not really the effectiveness (or not) of the oil.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep feral cats out of my garden. 3 tablespoons to 1/2 gallon straight white vinegar. Smell Keep them AWAY! Not harmful to insects</li>
    <li> Great smell. Made great candles, but haven&#x27;t used them yet to see if they work on mosquitos.</li>
    <li> Love this product, works as a natural insect repellent.</li>
    <li> Like to add a little water then spritz on for bug relief.  Smells better than deet to me</li>
    <li> I use this to add to my horses fly spray and it seems to help.</li>
    <li> 40 drops in 1/4 cup of water makes a great mosquito repellant for the exterior doors on your house. We live in Houston where the mosquitos flourish in the summer. I mix this up and spray all the exterior doors and frames to help repel mosquitos. The smell is strong but pleasant at first and dissipates after several hours.</li>
    <li> Best smelling citronella oil I&#x27;ve found as I loathe the smell. Very effective in my mosquito spray. Knock off deep woods dog spray formula: in a four ounce bottle add 2.5 tsp of citronella oil, 1/2 tsp of peppermint, 1/3 tsp of cedar, 1/4 teaspoon of lemongrass, and 1/8 tsp of geranium. Top off with water. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For backyard use, I&#x27;ll use an 8 oz bottle and 2 tsp of citronella, 2 tsp lavender, 1 tsp grapefruit, 1/2 tsp peppermint, 1/2 tsp lemongrass--and countless other variations. Like I said, I don&#x27;t like the smell of citronella, but it helps a lot to cut it with lavender and grapefruit (which are less effective at repelling mosquitoes but much better smelling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the weaker backyard version, I make sure to rub the spray around to make sure I coat every inch. At dusk, determined mosquitoes will any unsprayed areas. I recently took a hike with several people and of all of us only me and my niece, whom I also sprayed carefully, walked out of the woods tick free. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Used to make bug spray!</li>
    <li> The bugs absolutely HATE this stuff.  I feel good about it because I don&#x27;t have to spray my kids down with deet.  yay</li>
    <li> This Citronella Oil lasts *forever* and makes using bug spray better.  I mix it in a spray bottle with water (and sometimes a little Now Foods peppermint oil to deter spiders too).  I shake it up, spray it on, and don&#x27;t worry about bugs in the summer.  Mosquitos love me, but when I use this they stay away.  I put it on cotton balls to place around my patio also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citronella oil is great for more than insect repellant, too.  It has antibacterial, antidepressant, antiseptic, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, deodorant, diaphoretic, diuretic, febrifuge, fungicidal, stomachic, stimulant, tonic and vermifuge qualities, making it a summertime staple.  My skin feels (and smells) great even during the hottest summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does NOT cause photosensitivity (citrus oils can/do, but citronella is a grass not a citrus fruit).  This means I can use it during the summer without risking being sunburned *because of the oil.*  It is NOT a sunblock, so don&#x27;t misread this part of my review...I&#x27;m just saying it doesn&#x27;t cause additional sensitivity to the sun!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citronella is a great pick-me-up, and my friends and family love using this.</li>
    <li> Once again, Pinterest failed me. Making your own candles isn’t all rainbows, sunshine, and Instagram filtered photos. It’s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I took on this project because I was unhappy with commercially available citronella candles. They’re expensive and rarely disclose the amount of natural citronella (if any!) that is used in them. Based on reviews, I purchased Now Foods citronella oil and I was thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because I was a candle making rookie, I read a lot of blogs and instructions trying to determine the perfect amount of citronella to put in my candles. Let me save you the effort by telling you to just shrug and wing it. Nobody seems to agree. I put ½ an ounce (half of a bottle) into 1lb of wax. This made them VERY strong, but I was going for the overkill effect. The candles don’t even need to be lit to smell them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of scent, I like it. I was taken aback a bit at first, but then my scent memory took over and I remembered citronella smelling like this when I was a kid. I think we’ve been conditioned to associate citronella with an artificial, sweet citrus smell.  It’s a bit musky, but it sure beats the smell of bug spray.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality oils, I&#x27;ve purchased several different oils from the &#x27;Now&#x27; brand and they were all good quality.  The citronella I mixed with witch hazel and distled water and made an insect repellent.</li>
    <li> Smells good but did nothing for mosquitoes which was the purpose of buying it. If anything they liked me more if not the same.</li>
    <li> This is good quality EO. Great price! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to ward off mosquitoes as she is highly allergic to them. unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work.  also, the aroma is not consistent from bottle to bottle.</li>
    <li> I used to have a mosquito repellant from WELEDA (Citronin) but they discontinued it a few years ago, so I decided to make it myself. Just ad  20% of citronela + 20 % of Neem oils to a quantity of almond oil(call it 100% ) and it&#x27;s just perfect. To have in a &amp;#34;sprayable&amp;#34; fashion just drop the quantities to 6% (or a bit more) of the oils and supersede the almond oil with a grain alcohol + water solution. It works fine for me!!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for anyone who likes to make their own homemade stuff.  A good find for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great price and does what we want it to do.</li>
    <li> Scented very heavily. I can actually smell this from the outside of the bottle, which I normally can&#x27;t with other EO&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but the candles I made with it do seem to help with mosquitos.</li>
    <li> Love it! Used this mixed with water to make floating candle citronella mason jar idea that I saw on Pinterest and it worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Good price for three vials of essential oil. Far cheaper than whole foods or other retailers. Shipping was free on amazon prime. The product was securely delivered and was strong smelling and fresh upon arrival. The oil made excellent candles and natural bug spray.</li>
    <li> Going to make flea repellant spray for this summer.</li>
    <li> Now Foods brand of essential oils are excellent.  I use them in a variety of ways.  Making healing salve or even just using an oil for a headache.  Citronella I use in my bug repellent.</li>
    <li> Made home made bug spray works Great!</li>
    <li> Used this for a homemade bug off. Works GREAT!</li>
