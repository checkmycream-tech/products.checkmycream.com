### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and it works wonderful.  </li>
      <li>and it was the best thing I have ever done to help my breakouts.</li>
      <li>Plus these things are so delicious</li>
      <li>good price, didn&#x27;t get chance to use it yet.</li>
      <li>, all are good but none have made my hair grow at a substantial rate.  </li>
      <li>Probably heard it from some teenager on YouTube who was born with gorgeous hair...</li>
      <li>Honestly I prayed to GOD it would work.  </li>
      <li>My hair growth has not increased, and I have taken the silicea for two months, maybe it takes longer than that to be effective.  </li>
      <li>it had it&#x27;s own zip</li>
      <li>They dissolve under your tongue quickly, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>Will gladly buy again.</li>
      <li>To help with her hair growth and to better quality of her nails.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read in so many sources of sooooo many great benefits this provides, especially for people dealing with osteoporosis.</li>
      <li>I received my bottle of this \\&quot;wonder drug\\&quot; on Friday, this is Monday, and I am already seeing great improvement on my face, arms and the pimples, and red spots are almost all gone!  </li>
      <li>So nice to see a product live up to its claims.</li>
      <li>So, I have tried many multivitamins, biotin supplements, diatomaceous earth, msm, coconut and castor oil treaments (and many many other things)</li>
      <li>so I always run out really quick.</li>
      <li>have had clear healthy skin now for well over a year.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so grateful for this best kept secret.</li>
      <li>These seem to be working,  The pain cleared up right away</li>
      <li>My hair&#x27;s strength was restored after months and months of thinning and hair loss which really took a toll on my self esteem since my hair has ALWAYS been think, full and voluminous.</li>
      <li>It was the size of a large grape and hurt like hell!</li>
      <li>bought this only for my hair in the hopes to encourage more rapid hair growth.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much neutral on this.&lt;br /&gt;May</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I took 6 tabs the first day I bought them, let it dissolve under my tongue so it can shoot straight to my bloodstream and after 2 days of taking this</li>
      <li>Creams, ointments and perscription pills were either to strong and cause irritation or lasted only temporary.  </li>
      <li>This product also makes your hair grow fast.  </li>
      <li>My whole family takes them.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results, though.  </li>
      <li>We some some changes but not too much.  </li>
      <li>This product really sped up the healing process.</li>
      <li>Received product fast.</li>
      <li>have helped t speed up recovery but no way to tell...was very well priced.</li>
      <li>it started with a monstrous zit that took up residence on about 1/3 of the real estate of my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect any overnight changes, but DAMN this acted fast.</li>
      <li>If he begins to scoot his rear end across the carpet, I give him a pill twice a day for a few days as well as putting a warm washcloth that has been soaked in Epsom Salt and water on his rear end for about 10 minutes 3 times a day.  </li>
      <li>My new crop growing in (2 inches in a month!)</li>
      <li>I began taking Hylands silicea mainly to encourage hair growth.  </li>
      <li>I have had problems with skin issues most of my life, such as, acne, boils, red splotches.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the try at this product to help with my medical problems, would probably try it again in the future.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t really tell a difference, and I do not see a bit of improvement in my peeling, soft nails.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m taken aback by how strong my lower back has responded in a LONG time.</li>
      <li>So far, both of these have worked for him.  </li>
      <li>We got it at a recommendation by our homeopath for our 3 year old.  </li>
      <li>Recommended in a natural pet care book.</li>
      <li>I got these for a stye that I developed on my lower eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I can really feel my body repairing from my bones to my nails and finally my hair.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I have damaged my scalp for 15+ years by bleaching at 30 and 40 volume, and I am going chemical free and growing out my natural hair while cutting out the damaged mess.  </li>
      <li>On my 3rd round I went to that bathroom and sure enough it burst.  </li>
      <li>but there exists far cheaper ways to get silica into a human body.  </li>
      <li>nails were not brittle and I very rarely get zits or other &amp;#34;eruptions&amp;#34; (I just vomited in my mouth a little bit)...</li>
      <li>Hopefully no more expensive vet visits and most important, no more discomfort for my little Gizzie!  :-)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got these for a stye that I developed on my lower eyelid.  I get styes from time to time and this one was particularly painful.  These seem to be working,  The pain cleared up right away and the stye has gone down considerably in size.  I am hoping it will be totally gone soon.</li>
    <li> Received product fast. Item is as described. Will gladly buy again.</li>
    <li> We got it at a recommendation by our homeopath for our 3 year old.  To help with her hair growth and to better quality of her nails.  We some some changes but not too much.  Probably gave it to her for 3 weeks or so.  Perhaps I should have given it a longer run.</li>
    <li> I finally understand the &amp;#34;Skin eruptions, brittle hair and nails.&amp;#34; in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, no.... These pills are not for people who have those conditions and want to FIX them...oh nooooo.....  it&#x27;s for people who DON&#x27;T have them to acquire skin eruptions, brittle hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this only for my hair in the hopes to encourage more rapid hair growth.  Probably heard it from some teenager on YouTube who was born with gorgeous hair... but whatever, I thought... what could it hurt??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails were not brittle and I very rarely get zits or other &amp;#34;eruptions&amp;#34; (I just vomited in my mouth a little bit)... that is until I was about 3/4 of the way through this bottle.  All of a sudden &amp;#34;eruption&amp;#34; became an understatement.... it started with a monstrous zit that took up residence on about 1/3 of the real estate of my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came I thought, &amp;#34;huh... been on this Silicea stuff for weeks now...  it&#x27;s supposed to prevent eruptions....  maybe it&#x27;s just a fluke.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got a another zit on my cheek.... then.... and the last straw before the pills hit the garbage was a MASSIVE zit in my underarm area that appeared the day before my Florida vacation and lasted almost the entire time I was away.  It. Was. Massive.  No, seriously, I&#x27;m fairly certain it had it&#x27;s own zip code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately threw out what remained of those horrendous problem-causing pills.  Which, by the way, didn&#x27;t speed up my hair growth one dang bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I sit here typing this review I have a Bermuda Triangle of 3 whiteheads on my face.  Apparently nearly 2 weeks after throwing them out, these horrible things are still in my system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this a -5 stars, I would.  Save yourself!!!</li>
    <li> This product aided the healing of a skin issue that caused an eruption and bled constantly, used in combination with an ointment I could tell it helped speed up the healing process and healed it fully within a week. I still occasionally take this product to prevent reoccurrence of the skin problem.... have had clear healthy skin now for well over a year.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading about it on another website.  I have had problems with skin issues most of my life, such as, acne, boils, red splotches.  I received my bottle of this \\&quot;wonder drug\\&quot; on Friday, this is Monday, and I am already seeing great improvement on my face, arms and the pimples, and red spots are almost all gone!  The pills are so tiny, and dissolve so quickly, it&#x27;s hardly like taking medicine at all!  I will be buying another bottle to start giving this to my son who is having acne issues.  I would suggest this to anyone who has any skin ailments.</li>
    <li> Also recommend this to friends</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect any overnight changes, but DAMN this acted fast. I&#x27;ll admit, I took 6 tabs the first day I bought them, let it dissolve under my tongue so it can shoot straight to my bloodstream and after 2 days of taking this, I felt the immediate results in my nails. It&#x27;s the strongest it has felt in YEARS. I took the tabs down a bit and weaned it down to 4 tabs a day, 2 in the beginning of my day and 2 at the end of my day. It&#x27;s now been a month of taking this and I&#x27;m taken aback by how strong my lower back has responded in a LONG time. I can really feel my body repairing from my bones to my nails and finally my hair. My hair&#x27;s strength was restored after months and months of thinning and hair loss which really took a toll on my self esteem since my hair has ALWAYS been think, full and voluminous. My new crop growing in (2 inches in a month!) thick as it&#x27;s supposed to all over again. I&#x27;m so grateful for this best kept secret. I&#x27;ve read in so many sources of sooooo many great benefits this provides, especially for people dealing with osteoporosis. AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping this around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See: [...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 1 year.  I had boils and pimples that would erupt on my chin area on a constant bases. When I went to my naturalpathic doctor he told me to try it and it was the best thing I have ever done to help my breakouts. Creams, ointments and perscription pills were either to strong and cause irritation or lasted only temporary.  My nails use to be soft and brittle, now they are hard and long.  This product also makes your hair grow fast.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> good price, didn&#x27;t get chance to use it yet.</li>
    <li> Pretty much neutral on this.&lt;br /&gt;May have helped t speed up recovery but no way to tell...was very well priced.</li>
    <li> I have a Shih Tzu that suffers anal gland infections and I have had him in and out of the vet&#x27;s office on numerous occasions for this problem.  I started looking online and found that Holistic Vet&#x27;s recommend Silica 6x tablets for anal gland issues so gave it a try and it works wonderful.  If he begins to scoot his rear end across the carpet, I give him a pill twice a day for a few days as well as putting a warm washcloth that has been soaked in Epsom Salt and water on his rear end for about 10 minutes 3 times a day.  So far, both of these have worked for him.  Hopefully no more expensive vet visits and most important, no more discomfort for my little Gizzie!  :-)</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my dog.  Recommended in a natural pet care book.</li>
    <li> I began taking Hylands silicea mainly to encourage hair growth.  It is supposed to have the added benefit of improving skin, which it might have done a bit, I can&#x27;t really tell a difference, and I do not see a bit of improvement in my peeling, soft nails.  My hair growth has not increased, and I have taken the silicea for two months, maybe it takes longer than that to be effective.  To be fair, I have damaged my scalp for 15+ years by bleaching at 30 and 40 volume, and I am going chemical free and growing out my natural hair while cutting out the damaged mess.  It&#x27;s a process.  So, I have tried many multivitamins, biotin supplements, diatomaceous earth, msm, coconut and castor oil treaments (and many many other things), all are good but none have made my hair grow at a substantial rate.  I will keep taking this supplement until I finish it, because its homeopathic and I&#x27;m just finishing the bottle.  I won&#x27;t buy it again, because I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement that would justify the cost. If you do like the product, are looking for a broader benefit range, try Hylands bioplasma, it contains the silicea as well as other cell salts. I do use the bioplasma after working out or sweating a lot outside, and it improves recovery time.</li>
    <li> These tablets help strengthen my nails. My whole family takes them.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the try at this product to help with my medical problems, would probably try it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I hate to just give this 3 stars but there exists far cheaper ways to get silica into a human body.  Plus these things are so delicious, I can&#x27;t stop eating them like candy so I always run out really quick.</li>
    <li> Helps my hair grow faster and helps some with problem nails that split and peel.</li>
    <li> This product really sped up the healing process. So nice to see a product live up to its claims. Will definitely purchase Hyland&#x27;s - Silicea 6x again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel any significant difference, but needless to say, it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible taste. I will continue to use it, maybe it is doing something, but i got it for a specific reason to help me with. With the other treatments aside from the product, i cannot give it positive or a negative influence on it.</li>
    <li> They dissolve under your tongue quickly, so that&#x27;s good.  They were packaged well and delivered on time.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results, though.  Maybe it&#x27;s too soon.</li>
    <li> I have suffered on and off since I was about 15 with bartholin cysts(blocked bartholin gland)  If you are a woman and if you have ever had one of these they can be extremely painful.  I went to the dr. On several occasions when it would rear it&#x27;s ugliness and just suffered through it .  The cyst I got last week was by far THE WORST ever.  It was the size of a large grape and hurt like hell! I read some reviews and decided what the hell! Ordered Hyland&#x27;s 6x on tuesday on it was here thursday.  I had read on a homeopathic website to take 4 every 15 minutes or so until the cyst burst.  Honestly I prayed to GOD it would work.  On my 3rd round I went to that bathroom and sure enough it burst.  The painful pressure is gone and it seems as though it is draining quite a bit.  Thank GOD I found this!  The next alternative was getting it lanced!  The thought of it makes me cringe!</li>
