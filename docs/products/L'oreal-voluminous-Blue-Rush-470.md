      <li>I loved the color though!</li>
      <li>This mascara looks beautiful and I absolutely love it!!</li>
      <li>but I really liked the color a lot!</li>
      <li>That said, the color is gorgeous.</li>
      <li>So kind of a wast of money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always going out to try to find something nice.</li>
      <li>I love this product and color.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>It is a good mascara and the  colors are right out there.</li>
      <li>When I first opened this product, I thought it was too light and too bright in color.</li>
      <li>desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush and the top of the bottle don&#x27;t do a great job of clearing away extra fibers, so application can be clumpy.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily without a lot of clumping or spider lashes, and is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I purchased it for the blue color to enhance my blue eyes and  was  very pleased to see that it was an excellent mascara as well.</li>
      <li>I love it for the fun touch of color on my lashes.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t look messy or clump together.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a bright blue mascara, then this is for you.</li>
      <li>I love the color of the l&#x27;oreal mascara and fast shipping</li>
      <li>Cool.  </li>
      <li>love the blue rush.. will purchase more if still available.</li>
      <li>wasnt really happy with the blue there wasn&#x27;t much color to it</li>
      <li>The color is very pretty, but the applicator leaves a lot to be</li>
      <li>On my lower lashes I first  very lightly  brush it  closer to my  eye and also very lightly add the  brown or black..</li>
      <li>I work on the sales floor of a major home improvement store and my mascara looks as good when I get home as it did when I left in the morning .</li>
      <li>Love this blue mascara and brand!</li>
      <li>Overall, I was pleased.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, a good product that gives a very fresh look to tired eyes.</li>
      <li>I am layering it over a blue black just at the tips of my lashes, and it is beautiful.</li>
      <li>I will not be sending it back and actually enjoy using it every day.  </li>
      <li>I have dark hair, dark eyelashes and this mascara is still super bright.</li>
      <li>i am hoping that loreal will continue to carry this product as one of there main products.</li>
      <li>Thank you -- next time I need more, I&#x27;ll definitely order it from you.</li>
      <li>Super neat blue.</li>
      <li>loved this product,have used blue mascara in the past, and couldn&#x27;t find any until an ad came on my pc for this product.</li>
      <li>Did dry out somewhat quickly</li>
      <li>This is bright blue, so if you want something navy or subtle, you won&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>But was worried it was old and maybe harm my lashes.</li>
      <li>I wish it were more subtle.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own it would be  very dramatic and maybe not dark enough.</li>
      <li>I only wish it was not a limited edition.</li>

<li> It is so pretty, I&#x27;m not sure why cosmetic companies offer such a variety of eye and lip colors but only sell blue mascara  in a limited edition.</li>
<li> I see by the other reviews that there are many others besides me, that have a difficult time finding blue mascara .</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it dries out very quickly and becomes too thick to apply.</li>
<li> put the color  part on the back of my upper lashes and  then  put  brown or  black on the  front</li>
<li> It was a bit too dry and flaky for me.  </li>
<li> The only drawback is that at the end of the day, the lashes are so stiff and dry, they feel like broom needles...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not navy or dark at all.</li>
<li> If you are looking for subtle blue, then it&#x27;s not.</li>
<li> Used it a few times.</li>
<li> I will be very sad when I run out and can&#x27;t find it any longer</li>
<li> Did not care for this at all, because it had a terrible smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the color of the l&#x27;oreal mascara and fast shipping</li>
    <li> It performs as you would expect L&#x27;Oreal!  The color is blue but not neon.  I wear on my lower lashes &amp; use a smokey charcoal or blue shadow under lower eye lid (like a liner).</li>
    <li> wasnt really happy with the blue there wasn&#x27;t much color to it</li>
    <li> I love it...Do not stop selling this item please!!</li>
    <li> I have dark hair, dark eyelashes and this mascara is still super bright. If you are looking for a bright blue mascara, then this is for you. If you are looking for subtle blue, then it&#x27;s not. I wish it were more subtle.</li>

    <li> It is a good mascara and the  colors are right out there. I purchased it for the blue color to enhance my blue eyes and  was  very pleased to see that it was an excellent mascara as well. It didn&#x27;t clump and made my lashes look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the color  part on the back of my upper lashes and  then  put  brown or  black on the  front so it softens the color and still makes my eyes pop. On my lower lashes I first  very lightly  brush it  closer to my  eye and also very lightly add the  brown or black..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it&#x27;s own it would be  very dramatic and maybe not dark enough.</li>
    <li> Love this blue mascara and brand! Will by again!</li>
    <li> When I first opened this product, I thought it was too light and too bright in color. After applying it for a month, I see that as the color dries on the lashes, it tends to darken. Whew! I will not be sending it back and actually enjoy using it every day.  The only drawback is that at the end of the day, the lashes are so stiff and dry, they feel like broom needles... Otherwise, a good product that gives a very fresh look to tired eyes.</li>
    <li> Super neat blue. I always want blue on my eyes whether it be a mascara or a liquid eyeliner. I&#x27;m always going out to try to find something nice. This mascara does me justice. It&#x27;s not navy or dark at all.</li>
    <li> loved this product,have used blue mascara in the past, and couldn&#x27;t find any until an ad came on my pc for this product. i am hoping that loreal will continue to carry this product as one of there main products. love the blue rush.. will purchase more if still available.</li>
    <li> On time, as described. Did dry out somewhat quickly but I really liked the color a lot! Overall, I was pleased.</li>
    <li> Cool.  Different for a change</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I wear it every day and get compliments every day. I work on the sales floor of a major home improvement store and my mascara looks as good when I get home as it did when I left in the morning . I only wish it was not a limited edition. I will be very sad when I run out and can&#x27;t find it any longer</li>
    <li> It was a bit too dry and flaky for me.  I loved the color though!</li>
    <li> Did not care for this at all, because it had a terrible smell. Used it a few times. Smell does go away. But was worried it was old and maybe harm my lashes. So kind of a wast of money.</li>
    <li> This mascara looks beautiful and I absolutely love it!! The color is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t look messy or clump together.</li>
