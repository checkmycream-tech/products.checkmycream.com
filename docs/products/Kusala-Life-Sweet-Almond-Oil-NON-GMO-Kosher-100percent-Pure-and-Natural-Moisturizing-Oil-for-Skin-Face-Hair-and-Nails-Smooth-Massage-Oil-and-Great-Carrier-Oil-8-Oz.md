      <li>Its amazing oil</li>
      <li>I was therefore very pleased when I found this product, which contains nothing but sweet almond oil and Vitamin E (which is great for acne and scar removal).</li>
      <li>So I made my own with this almond oil, adding about 30 drops of lavender and 15 drops of rosemary and put it in my container that has a pump on it.</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance and feel.  </li>

      <li>I just bought two more bottles to share with friends and family..</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>, is that it produces a lovely, almost shimmer-like sheen on my skin.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m ordering more and will continue to use this product for my business.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to trying more products from Kusala Life.</li>
      <li>Outstanding.</li>
      <li>More time will tell.</li>
      <li>I do not find it has made my skin more oily at all, in fact on the contrary.</li>
      <li>You can find so many uses for this oil</li>
      <li>Love the oil, I use it as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It sure seems that way though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My kids love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love the oil for my skin.</li>
      <li>Been using another, and love the addition of the v.</li>
      <li>I bought this particularly for my fingernails, however, have found it great for my hands and face.  </li>
      <li>After doing some research, I found out that jojoba oil is better targeted for people with oily skin, while almond oil is best for people with dry skin.</li>
      <li>is that vitamin A and D are important for healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This oil has worked wonders and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, and looking healthy.</li>
      <li>I also use it as a makeup remover and moisturizer and love the smooth powdery feeling it leaves.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>It is very mild and nourishing.</li>
      <li>Good oil, I am completely satisfied with results, makes my skin so soft,</li>
      <li>Good oil for a decent price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s real easy to tell how much hair is falling out because this thing catches everything.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about the quality and the great customer service from the company who makes it.</li>
      <li>Kusala delivered precisely on time.  </li>
      <li>Silky smooth, don&#x27;t even need conditioner.</li>
      <li>She justified this because she&#x27;s a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; model, and it&#x27;s what they do.</li>
      <li>Works comfortably on face and body.  </li>
      <li>She justified this because she&#x27;s a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; model, and it&#x27;s what they do.</li>
      <li>nice oil, no scent, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I started looking for an alternative to my my most recent oil -- baby oil (which surprisingly still contains petroleum,) when I heard about almond oil.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, there are too many variables at work right now to tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely helps prevent acne :)!!</li>
      <li>So a great product that I plan to use for a very long time.</li>
      <li>Great for the winter dry spots on your skin.</li>
      <li>It is gentle, smells great and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>And my wife finds this whole thing hilarious.</li>
      <li>Nice natural moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Tried</li>
      <li>I like this brand of sweet almond oil for my hair.</li>
      <li>Many thanks for the item and the suggestions on how to apply, use, and create with the product.</li>
      <li>I have used the sweet almond oil for my hair and face.</li>
      <li>And my wife finds this whole thing hilarious.</li>
      <li>Not bad for 66+ yrs.</li>
      <li>Great recipes for other uses too.  </li>
      <li>And I have found that if I put makeup on in the morning I still feel clean and fresh by dinner with no need to touch anything up.</li>
      <li>The oil stays on your skin even after a quick rinse.</li>
      <li>Arrives quickly</li>
      <li>But to my delight, It was so light and absorbed quickly right into my skin leaving no residue.</li>
      <li>The smooth, rich, well absorbing oil is unscented...</li>
      <li>And I love that it is all natural ingredients!  </li>
      <li>I Highly Recommend It!!!</li>

    <li> Its amazing oil it works great for me .. Thanks Lisa</li>
    <li> This is not sticky!  Long-lasting and feels very nice.  Works comfortably on face and body.  Glad I ordered it.  It will be a staple for my home.</li>
    <li> I like this brand of sweet almond oil for my hair. I also tried it on my eyelashes and eyebrows, just be careful and use the appropriate applicators. It is very mild and nourishing. I had no skin reactions. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great oil. Bought it to use as an ingredient to add to a natural beauty remedy for longer thicker eyelashes and eyebrows . Found out this is a great product just by itself for use to soften the delicate lines around the eyes .</li>
    <li> i was impressed with the time it took to receive my package and i will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> This is a carefully made Almond Oil. Outstanding. Can&#x27;t say enough about the quality and the great customer service from the company who makes it.</li>
    <li> Great product, I am pregnant and I use the oil for my belly, my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 55 and I&#x27;m losing my hair. My forehead is up to about a four-and-a-half-head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the normal \\&quot;getting-old\\&quot; hair loss I guess, but it still freaks me out a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I have been searching on Google every day for products to at least slow it down. Meanwhile, my daughter, who is in cosmetology school, is telling me all of these cancer related horror stories about chemicals in beauty products and hair products, and how the beauty product industry is only \\&quot;self-regulated.\\&quot; I think we know what that means...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got from all of this research is that vitamin A and D are important for healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it turns out that Almond Oil has BOTH of these. Plus it&#x27;s natural. Plus it&#x27;s not greasy. Plus it supposedly doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give this Kusala stuff a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair tends to get greasy on its own fairly quickly, I decided to apply it to my scalp only, or at least try. So I put a few drops on my fingertips, then I rub it into my scalp. I&#x27;m avoiding my hair for now because I&#x27;m afraid it will look oily. Chicks don&#x27;t dig guys with oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, no smell. And I don&#x27;t feel or look any different, but think it might work. Maybe because I&#x27;m actually doing something about it. I will apply this almond oil after each time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also come back in about a month and update this review. I&#x27;ll let you know about my hair loss rate. If I&#x27;m losing more hair, Kusala Life will get a ONE-star review from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, though, it gets FIVE for giving me hope and making me feel so good for finding something that is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/7/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every day, occasionally every other day for a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little time to get my technique down because I only wanted to apply it to my scalp and not my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it SEEMS like I&#x27;m losing less hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wash my hair, which is 2 to 2 1/2 inches long, I put this little plastic strainer thingie in the drain to catch all of the hair so I don&#x27;t clog my drain. It&#x27;s real easy to tell how much hair is falling out because this thing catches everything. So it SEEMS like there is less than usual. A lot less. But it&#x27;s kinda hard to tell because I wash it so often and the trend so gradual that I can&#x27;t really HONESTLY say that my balding trend is slowing down. It sure seems that way though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing. I just saved a hair-washings worth of hair. I&#x27;m going to do it again in 30 days and then update this review. I&#x27;ll include pictures or a video if I can figure out how to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair DEFINITELY looks better though. I&#x27;ve had two waitresses comment about it. WHO DOES THAT? In fact, my wife gave me \\&quot;the look\\&quot; after the last waitress incident. LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/3/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last two weeks there has been absolutely no hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife laughs and says that it&#x27;s because hair doesn&#x27;t fall out during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;d like to add to this review that from time to time, I overdo the almond oil and my hair does look a little oily. But there is a sweet spot amount that, after putting it on, will leave my hair not-oily looking, but a little bit shiny. Can you picture that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use still less, my hair doesn&#x27;t even look shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a couple of times I tried putting a lot on my scalp AND hair before bed to let it \\&quot;soak\\&quot; in overnight. But I must have used too much because my wife complained about the pillowcase being oily. I stopped that practice for domestic tranquility reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/30/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read a comment from \\&quot;bayridgeguy\\&quot; below asking if this stuff is still working. The first thing I thought was, \\&quot;people actually read these things?\\&quot; But the answer is, \\&quot;I think so.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, there are too many variables at work right now to tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example I started a raw food diet (the veggie version, not the meat version). I&#x27;ve read that it helps with hair health. So, it would be hard to say that my hair actually \\&quot;un-thinning\\&quot; itself was due to the almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that by March it FELT like it was getting thicker. By April, the woman who cuts my hair commented on my thin spot filling in. But here&#x27;s the thing, at the end of March I started the Raw thing, and perhaps that could be what she noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I did was go back to the overnight soak method, but only once a week. The reason I did that was because my stepdaughter (not the hairdresser, that&#x27;s my daughter), who is a model-actress wannabe (waitress) went to a high end hair place and spent about $200 on hair products. She justified this because she&#x27;s a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; model, and it&#x27;s what they do. Anyway, one of the products is an oil treatment that she puts on before bed once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I figured that since people who use their hair professionally do it, I would do it too. But instead of the chemical laden treatment, I stayed with this almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife? She humors me and makes me wear a shower cap thing, which isn&#x27;t very sexy, doesn&#x27;t stay on overnight, and has made me the official \\&quot;linen laundry\\&quot; person of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I believe this stuff does work, and I won&#x27;t stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, and you won&#x27;t believe me, my grey hair is almost gone now. It has little to do with the almond oil and more to do with raw foods, I&#x27;m sure. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve read anyway. But there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look younger now (in my mind). And my wife finds this whole thing hilarious. So as an added benefit, I make my wife laugh.actually \\&quot;un-thinning\\&quot; itself was due to the almond oil.    The fact is that by March it FELT like it was getting thicker.

    <li> good for both hair and body massage! Smell is light and just perfect! There is instructions coming together with the product about how i can use it in different ways! just awesome!</li>
    <li> Works great have tried many products and this works the best. Great recipes for other uses too.  Great price. Arrives quickly</li>
    <li> So far I like everything about it. More time will tell. Hope my skin will be like Jackie Kennedy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still waiting for the Almond facial soaps.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an almond smell, but the product seemed unscented at first. I used it in my hair and on my skin, then realized I was walking around smelling like fish. I never applied it again. There must be fish oil in it. I don&#x27;t even feel like sending it back since sending a bottle of leaky oil with a fishy odor is more than I can handle.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. /Rick</li>
    <li> Good oil for a decent price what else can I say. My mother says that that&#x27;s what she wanted so I bought it for her</li>
    <li> It works good for making bath bombs.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use an almond and so far I can tell the difference on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this particularly for my fingernails, however, have found it great for my hands and face.  I have used it on my scalp for a massage and it feels great!  I just bought two more bottles to share with friends and family..</li>
    <li> Good oil, I am completely satisfied with results, makes my skin so soft,</li>
    <li> I have problems with dry skin, and whenever I get out of a shower my skin feels very tight. This dry environment also promotes acne because my sebum wants to work on overdrive… Wanting to use a natural moisturizer for my face, I first tried jojoba oil, but that only seemed to dry my skin out even more. After doing some research, I found out that jojoba oil is better targeted for people with oily skin, while almond oil is best for people with dry skin. I was therefore very pleased when I found this product, which contains nothing but sweet almond oil and Vitamin E (which is great for acne and scar removal). Since I&#x27;ve started using it my face no longer feels dry after a shower, I just apply a small amount of this at the end of the shower (or when I get out). Then I rinse a little, and pat dry with a towel. The oil stays on your skin even after a quick rinse. This oil has worked wonders and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, and looking healthy. I&#x27;ve never had any product like this before. Very happy!</li>
    <li> i love this! Makes my skin so soft and i feel like im glowing! Definitely helps prevent acne :)!! Get this</li>
    <li> nice oil, no scent, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Kusala delivered precisely on time.  Very pleased with their service and the oil.  Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Many thanks for the item and the suggestions on how to apply, use, and create with the product. It is clearly a universal oil product with much potential.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Love the oil for my skin. May try the other tips that were emailed to me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My kids love this product.  No greasy mess. Absorbs into skin very fast.</li>
    <li> I waited several months of using this to post a review. First of all, I&#x27;m 44 years old and had extremely oily skin in my teens/20&#x27;s/30&#x27;s. Maybe now I&#x27;m grateful for it because I&#x27;m told I look 15+ years younger than I am but growing up it was brutal because my face was always shiny. I didn&#x27;t do the right things to combat it: I used astringents and other things that dry the skin and that likely made my skin produce more oil. When I would get facials done,  estheticians were always amazed how much oil I had. Anyway, I had been using another brand of oil in the shower to run over the areas I shaved to keep my skin soft. It was very expensive (from aromatherapy experts). I looked at the ingredients: almond oil, lavender and rosemary. So I made my own with this almond oil, adding about 30 drops of lavender and 15 drops of rosemary and put it in my container that has a pump on it. Now I use this stuff all over my body as I&#x27;m finishing my shower and because some said it can be used to wash your face, I gave that a whirl. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t really wash off but it does dry and leaves your skin so soft. I find my makeup if I use any goes on much smoother. I even put a few drops of this oil on my finger and use it to smooth and shape my eyebrows. You can find so many uses for this oil but I like my concoction and I will keep using it. I do wash my face first with my proactive face wash which helps exfoliate, then use this as sort of a first step moisturizer. I do not find it has made my skin more oily at all, in fact on the contrary. And I have found that if I put makeup on in the morning I still feel clean and fresh by dinner with no need to touch anything up. So a great product that I plan to use for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Lovely light oil; very little fragrance.  I apply after a shower when my skin is still slightly damp; seems to take a while for it to soak in  --  that is: it is not immediate.  I have noticed that my dry calves (they had that cracked skin mosaic look)  are noticeable better looking.  Not bad for 66+ yrs.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as part of my moisturizing products for my face.  It is gentle, smells great and keeps my skin soft.  I also use almond oil in my ear before going to the doctor to get wax cleaned out of my ears.</li>
    <li> We received our order of Kusala life the day amazon promised. our whole family enjoys using kusala oil. We like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. I applied it on my psoriasis and I have noticed a difference. My 14 year old son uses it for his acne and my wife uses it to make her face soft and radiant. with the way the top  is designed, the oil is not wasted and should last a while. when we do run out we will definitely be ordering more and we also like the fact that it is not greasy and it is odorless.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. Its really lite and absorbs quickly in to the skin. I just started using it. I am trying for my hair too. Will re post the review again if it works for my hair too. For skin it is working great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any bad odor and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. Great for the winter dry spots on your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice natural moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Tried this oil for my hair as well as for my body and its no less than the expensive chemical moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I put this in my hair at night and wash it out in the morning. Silky smooth, don&#x27;t even need conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t mess my pillow up either.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the company. The first time I ordered the oil, the bottle had leaked and had been returned to the seller, i.e. I never received it and after multiple emails to the company I finally got them to send me another order. Anyways, I ordered 2 bottles but got only one in the mail and kusala life refused to send me the other bottle.  That being said, the oil itself is great, however I will not order from this seller again and will go with another brand.</li>
    <li> It is not only a great moisturizer, but it&#x27;s also good for the skin and massage. My loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for using in my homemade lotions and creams!</li>
    <li> Just received my second bottle and really like this product.  5-star rating with no oily residue and really helps my old sun dried skin.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific moisturizer.  I started using oils some time ago to treat my dry skin because lotions dont stay very long.  And who has time to put on lotion all day? I&#x27;ve tried countess oils but they&#x27;re messy and greasy and really don&#x27;t stay very long either.  I started looking for an alternative to my my most recent oil -- baby oil (which surprisingly still contains petroleum,) when I heard about almond oil.  I really found a treasure in Kusala Life.  This stuff is just wonderful.  I only need to use it once a day, my skin stays soft and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy, and I really like that it&#x27;s all natural. Another benefit I didn&#x27;t expect, and it&#x27;s not in the product description so I hope the marketing people read this, is that it produces a lovely, almost shimmer-like sheen on my skin.  So now I just carry it around with me.  Maybe they&#x27;ll start making purse size containers!</li>
    <li> I ordered Kusala Life Sweet almond oil a several months ago and held off writing a review so I could experiment with it and see how it worked over time.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with the results, especially on my skin. The smooth, rich, well absorbing oil is unscented...A Giant plus for me. Looking forward to trying more products from Kusala Life. I Highly Recommend It!!!</li>
    <li> I was afraid Sweet Almond Oil by Kusala Life would be oily and stain my clothes. But to my delight, It was so light and absorbed quickly right into my skin leaving no residue. Just left soft and moist skin. Easy to use and I like the way it dispenses out of the bottle. There is no odor. And I love that it is all natural ingredients!  I have never used anything like it before. I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using this product everyday and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Been using another, and love the addition of the v.E - not as &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; as others.  Little squeeze spout is better than pouring (or dumping) too much.  I like the idea of using no-chemical ingredient oils that my skin recognizes as beneficial.  This leaves my skin smooth, soft and - wait! is that a glow??!!  Hope it works on my dark circles - I&#x27;m keeping my soft, smooth fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I have used the sweet almond oil for my hair and face. I used it at night on my hair as recommended and was very pleased with the result. I also use it as a makeup remover and moisturizer and love the smooth powdery feeling it leaves. It has replaced several skin and hair products that have chemicals with names I cannot pronounce.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use.</li>
    <li> As described. Love it!</li>
    <li> Looks perfect for my skin specially to my face, Im happy start using this Almond Oil😄</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and feel.  Purchased for sensual massages and it was perfect!</li>
    <li> Transaction was great. I can&#x27;t wait to use this hair for my hair</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil. I use this oil with added Helichrysum for a moisturizer. My face and skin are looking so much better and a huge change from dry to supple skin. Loving essential oils.</li>
    <li> Was really glad to find a wonderful moisturizer that does not contain coconut, as I have a severe allergy to this. What was a wonderful surprise is this product is like a spa in a bottle. I have used the oil as a hot oil treatment for my hair and scalp, a wonderful warm water foot soak, and to use as a bath soak for my skin. My only problem with this is now I don&#x27;t know which way I thought the product was the best, as I loved them all. Oh well, guess I will have to just keep experimenting. This product is wonderful, have been recommending to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Love the oil, I use it as a moisturizer. You have to put it on several minutes before you apply your makeup to give it time to soak in your skin because it is oily.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived promptly.  I have been using it for a few days now for my face and it leaves my skin very soft and i tried it on my hair, it made a huge improvement on my dried, color treated hair.  Awesome</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect!  I have a massage and bodywork business, the order came in and it was not packaged properly and came damaged. The owner of this business actually was apologetic and sent me a bottle personally.  I used the product and it is absolutely fabulous!! So, I&#x27;m ordering more and will continue to use this product for my business. I just ordered 3 bottles!! Perfect for my clients skin. As for my own personal use.&lt;br /&gt;The oil actually penetrates into the skin leaving the skin supple and non greasy. Thank you Lisa!!!</li>
