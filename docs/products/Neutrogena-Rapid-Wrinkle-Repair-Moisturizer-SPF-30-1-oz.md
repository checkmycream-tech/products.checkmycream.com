<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well no irritation</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, it does seem to keep the wrinkles at bay.  I do not notice a significant change in wrinkles.  One thing that I have noticed with the day cream is that it reddens may face more than the night cream.  Because it&#x27;s just a morturizer with wrinkle repair and I didn&#x27;t see a big change or repair after a month, I think I would stick with night cream from Neutrogena and use a different day cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it was rated  number 1 in clinical trials done by Good Housekeeping.  I trust their clinical trials, and noticed that when the results were printed a great many consumers bought this moisturizer too.  It is an excellent product, and it has significantly reduced small lines and wrinkles, especially around my mouth.  I continue to use it and really have seen lasting good results!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has made a wonderful daily moisturizer--Rapid Wrinkle Repair.  It&#x27;s SPF30 makes it perfect for daily use, summer and winter.  My skin is very dry so I use 4 pumps of the product to cover my face and neck.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and I think it has kept my skin looking great for about 3 years.  I have used many other products, several of which were far more expensive.  None has done the job Rapid Wrinkle Repair does.</li>
    <li> I have seen a more even complexion and possibly even slightly less fine lines after about 1.5 weeks of consistent use.  The scent was very nice, and also fairly light.  I also did not have any burning or sensitivity that some warned of, but admittedly, my skin is used to Alpha-hydroxy acid creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and especially at this price.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying the night cream to match.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my face feel and think it is really helping -  the SPF 30 is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is not as expensive as other products claiming to do the same thing as this does.</li>
    <li> I like the Neutrogena anti-wrinkle cream better.  I guess it personal preference but this doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
    <li> I have used different products with similar prices but this is the best I have tried so far.  After one month you will see positive changes. I have used it for 6 months by now.  People have told me I look younger.  Try it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Does not repair anything. I prefer Anew 7 Days, way better.</li>
    <li> great item fast service ..very pleased</li>
    <li> It works some, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve wrinkles as its claim.  Was hoping for better results.  Will finish the repair in hope for better results.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I use it as a preventive treatment against wrinkles (I&#x27;m not quite 30 years old). It seems to have slightly silicon base that makes it very smooth to put on and is lighter to wear than other lotions. What pleasantly surprised me was the smell which is not too makeup-y but a rather a nice lotion smell for in addition to all the other things it&#x27;s doing.</li>
    <li> Just like my other two reviews for the Neutragena Rapid Wrinkle Repair products this one burned for the first few weeks I used it and made all my skin peel off.  According to the directions and reviews this is normal.  Thus far I have not seen a big difference except I have clearer skin.  We&#x27;ll see how it does long term.  Jury is still out on this product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> This product worked well with my other skin care products. That I change up monthly. It also didn&#x27;t interfere with my make-up application.  Non-make-up days it worked as well. Was not greasy or heavy. Good choice and affordable.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer with a non-greasy feel. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in wrinkles, but it feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long, but I definitely noticed firmer skin in the first days. I would recommend it. Pleasant smell too.</li>
    <li> I am 47 and I have always looked much younger than my age so I assumed that I would continue to look younger because my mother always looked at least 10 years younger than she really was. In any case, my age started to show on my face and especially my neck - I was horrified but never trusted any of these products.  I decided to try this product I liked the idea that it said \\&quot;rapid\\&quot; and that it was Neutrogena and also the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;In less than two weeks using this on an off my lizard neck disappeared. It is 100% true. I have never seen anything like it I am a believer -  it&#x27;s real it works. My forehead lines have not gone away but seeing how quickly it worked on my neck - I am truly amazed.&lt;br /&gt;Go Neutrogena you really hit it out of the park on this one.</li>
    <li> It is amazing! I get compliments on my skin so often. I stopped using it for a while and my skin did NOT look good....back using it. :)</li>
    <li> love it. would recommend.</li>
    <li> 1/21/2014: A couple of days after receiving this in the mail from Amazon &amp; BHNY, I was in Target and saw this product on the shelf. I happened to notice the Expiration date on the right side of the Target Product was August 2015. When I got back home I looked at the Expiration Date on the right side of the product I had just recd from Amazon &amp; BHNY and it is 16 MONTHS OLDER than the product I just saw in Target. The expiration date on the Amazon/BHNY product is 4/2014 (just a couple months short of the expiration date) So the product I just recd was sitting around for 16 months before Amazon/BHNY sent it to me. The Amazon box also had a Purple \\&quot;New\\&quot; on it and the Target product no longer has \\&quot;New\\&quot; on their boxes because it is no longer considered a new product at this point. 16 months old and only 2 months away from expiration is a big deal for a COSMETIC product. Amazon &amp; BHNY both you dropped the ball on this one!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  At first, I thought it was a little thick...then, after using it for a few&lt;br /&gt;days, people have been commenting on how great my skin looks!  And I&#x27;m 63 and live in the Southwest&lt;br /&gt;where the weather is very dry.  I like the ingredients...It contains all the good stuff for wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;and dry skin.  I bought this product at my local CVS, but, for sure, I will buy through Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is even eligible for free shipping! :-)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer, so much that it&#x27;s replaced my Oil of Olay.  After almost a week, I can definitely tell the difference: my minor crow&#x27;s feet and lip lines are filled in, make-up glides on, and it takes off a few years--always a good thing!  The SPF 30 is a plus as well.  Seriously, this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I use both night and day cream and it was definitely worth the buy. I will buy it again. The results are quick to show. :)</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of wrinkle creams, lotions, all of it. I have a wasteland of useless products stacked up on my nightstand table.  I saw an ad for Netrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, had heard good things about it, the article I read mentioned that the main ingredient in this product actually made it work.  For the price (which isn&#x27;t bad compared to some others I have bought) I bought it and tried it.  So its been about a week and I do see a minor difference in my skin. I only use it at night as I think my skin is still adjusting to the active ingredient in the product.  By far this is the best wrinkle cream I have used, and I would recommend anyone that is still looking for a good one to give this one a try.</li>
    <li> my skin is way too sensitive to use this product; i may be alergic to retinol.  my entire face sweels up and my skin gets dry and rough after a few days of using this product.</li>
    <li> Having a combination skin of a little bit at the oily side, this stuff is perfect! It smells good, it DID brighten my skin tone, and my wrinkles are not too visible. If you have a bit dry skin, then you probably don&#x27;t want this as it&#x27;s not a heavy moisturizer. After I use a toner, I only use this product before I apply my foundation. Great to have SPF 30 protection too so I can skip my sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve since bought the eye cream and the night cream. My skin looks great. What I like the most of this product is that since using it (2 weeks), that \\&quot;hangy turkey neck thing\\&quot; is hardly visable!!! The day cream is not greasy and my makeup glides right over it. Another plus is that it has a sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 1 year now and it has diminished wrinkles around my mouth &amp; around the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 but I&#x27;m not pleased with the pump. When it gets low, I have to remove the pump and pound the rest out.</li>
    <li> this is so great on skin over 50 without the product feeling over greasy or heavy on the skin. i plan on buying this again!!</li>
    <li> MY WIFE SAYS SHE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  AFTER 2 WEEKS SHE SAYS SHE CAN NOTICE A DIFFERENCE  ON HER NECK. SHE IS VERY PLEASED WITH IT.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best drugstore moisturizer on the market right now and one of the only products that actually delivers what it advertises. Yes, it does diminish wrinkles in a very short period of time. You will notice results within a week. This is now the only moisturizer I will use since it actually cured my pustular rosacea, too. The one drawback: there is only ONE OUNCE in each bottle, making this a very expensive and short-lived product. :o(</li>
    <li> This is advertised as wrinkle repair, however it says it&#x27;s a sunscreen under &amp;#34;use&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s fine, and may even be helping wrinkles a bit, but I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it had I known it wasn&#x27;t an overnight cream.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products.</li>
    <li> amazing! I use it doves basic ivory bar soap on my face combination is awesome. I look 77! sure I&#x27;m 49, but when you&#x27;re playing with high end beauty products, you need to buy higher to repair what you just fixed.&lt;br /&gt;it worked great!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Does nothing accept make your face burn and break out.</li>
    <li> Use it every day in conjunction with bel essence cream and skin looks soft and smooth-real wrinkle repair that works when used in conjunction with each other</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after a month, but it did go on nice.</li>
    <li> I have noticed ZERO change after months of use. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a year and it does work - wrinkles are slightly less noticeable (49 year old with fair skin), however I was hoping for something more dramatic</li>
    <li> My absolute go to moisturizer! Near immediate results! Improves the overall look of my skin, as well as the 11&#x27;s (between the brows) and my under eye skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in the morning a d use a night cream at night. One part that is disappointing is that it doesn&#x27;t help with my uneven tone (redness).  Other than that, I am over the moon about This product.</li>
    <li> This product was so recommended by a friend.  Not using many facial products, I decided to give it a try.  Had a difficult time finding the product at that time. But, found Amazon to have it.  Arrived very quickly and I have been using ever since. It is wonderful and amazing it does work.  Use only a pearl size amount and dab at areas you would like to see go \\&quot;away\\&quot;...I have recommended to others and they too are amazed!</li>
    <li> Been using for years and it does what they way.</li>
    <li> Best thing is that it combines wrinkle repair with SPF 30, meaning that you can wear it during the day. But after a week, any improvement in wrinkles is subtle.</li>
    <li> A friend saw the product I was using and how expensive it was and turned me onto this product. It doesn&#x27;t have all of the things I am looking for in an anti-aging product, but for the price it&#x27;s a good tag team with another product that can dial down redness or spots or whatever your skin issues are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 3 pack at a more affordable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Neutrogena fan for years.  I&#x27;ve seen the reviews on this product and decided to try it.  I like it, it&#x27;s inexpensive and it seems to work fine.  I have to get over not using my expensive stuff from France, as this stuff gives me the same results without the fancy packaging.</li>
    <li> As a senior I don&#x27;t expect a huge difference in my skin from any products. The wrinkles are not going away, and the sagging will stay. This product did what I hoped it would do, my skin looks healthy, and not as lifeless and dull as it did.I hope they don&#x27;t change this product too \\&quot;new and improved \\&quot;,as it is never as good after they tweak it. Hope it stays the same for a long time.I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> As a sunscreen, it did a fine job.  The reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is it caused flaking on my face and breakouts.  It&#x27;s rare, but some products will cause this.  I&#x27;d put it on, wait for it to dry, then put on my concealer and tinted moisturizer.  My face immediately looked flaky and after two days of trying to make it work, I started to break out.  I use the concealer and moisturizer every day, so I know they weren&#x27;t the problem.  I&#x27;m over 40 and have dry skin-fyi.</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer because I liked that it has SPF 30 as opposed to 15, and because it received good reviews.  The first time I used it I noticed it tingled a bit, and that was actually kind of nice.  It made me feel like it was doing something.  After that, my skin burned when I applied it, and after three days of using, my skin is red, splotchy, flakey, and very sensitive.  Sensitive to the point that the heat from my blow drier stings my face.  I would call my skin normal, for what its worth, and have never had problems with other skin care products.  I realize three days probably isn&#x27;t enough to notice a difference in wrinkles (though some reviews claim otherwise), but I didn&#x27;t notice anything.  I&#x27;m 30 and don&#x27;t really have &#x27;wrinkles&#x27;, but more fine lines on my forehead.  They are the same as before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it smells awesome.  Really fresh.  Its not greasy and it absorbs well.  And I like the bottle.</li>
    <li> this face cream is great.  Goes on smoothly and the scent is minimal.  I have noticed some softening of the lines on my face.  So far so good!  Great product</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a nice scent and make my skin soft.  Hasn&#x27;t reduce my forehead wrinkles as quickly as I&#x27;d hoped for( have been using it 2-3 weeks) but I will continue to use it as it seems to improve the overall appearance of my skin</li>
    <li> This is the BEST wrinkle cream I&#x27;ve ever bought. My frown lines are gone, my skin is smooth and it worked fast!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> It works for me.  Results will vary, I&#x27;m sure.  I mostly use facial/hair products from Japan/Korea and Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I repeat bought this .. very, very often I try a product once and I move onto something else.  This one I bought and I&#x27;m sticking with it.  Now to be honest, I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or anything.  So I don&#x27;t want to recommend this if you have deep wrinkles and need a serious serious corrector, then this MIGHT be right.  I&#x27;m just not 100% sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What  I can say is this: this feels very nice when it goes on.  The SPF built-in was the key for me.  It absorbs well, and leaves your face with a nice youthful sheen.  I can put on one or two layers without it caking up on my face.</li>
    <li> just okay - that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> Have used this product for some time and it does everything it says and more! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally skeptical of new wrinkle repair products, but I purchased this one on a whim, love it&#x27;s SPF 30 factor, and the fact that it&#x27;s a moisturizer too. It definitely HAS reduced my wrinkles, and my skin looks glowingly healthy! Great, affordable, useful product!</li>
    <li> the quick brown fox jumped over the nine lazy dogs..The quality of the product&lt;br /&gt;of this product  is primo.  annoying</li>
    <li> Not sure if this actually works. I&#x27;m not seeing any visible change in the crows-feet at the corners of my eyes or in the lines on my forehead (which is why I ordered the product in the first place). Granted, it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks. The thing I don&#x27;t care for the most is that it&#x27;s thick and leaves my face feeling heavy instead of light and dewy.  I plan to continue using it until the bottle is empty, just to give it a fair try. &amp;#34;Rapid&amp;#34; should not be in the name of this item and TV claims to see visible results in 1 week???? Not for me.</li>
    <li> I am super bummed!  After reading all the positive reviews, I was very excited to try this.  I am barely starting to get crows feet.  I bought this from Target 3 weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve used it every day.  It&#x27;s a little itchy and kind of burns so I thought good, transformative things were happening but alas, my wrinkles look no different.</li>
    <li> just average i guess .</li>
    <li> I saw visible signs of wrinkles around my eyes looking much, much better after a week of using this. I am NOT expecting it to totally do away with wrinkles and thankfully I don&#x27;t have a lot but what I had I wanted to get rid of and this seems to be working for me. Everyone is different, though, as you know. I had always bought very expensive creams and lotions until I tried this and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else after getting this and loving it so much! Good luck and I hope this and the Rain Rainbath Shower Gel works as great for you as they did for me!!</li>
    <li> I have tried every wrinkle cream out there, this one really DID show results in a week! It softened my wrinkles noticeably, smells great, feels great!!  Seriously... you need to try this!!</li>
    <li> The product is light and works well on fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful -- the SPF seems to wear off in a&lt;br /&gt;few hours, and the retinol will make you more sensitive&lt;br /&gt;to the sun.  Wear a hat and stay in the shade while using&lt;br /&gt;the product...otherwise it is rapid wrinkle production!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  Works fast and great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE NEUTROGENA RAPID WRINKLE REPAIR MORNING WITH SPF 30, AND THE NIGHT CREAM.I HAVE TRIED MANY EXPENSIVE SKIN CARE PRODUCTS AND FINALLY CAN STOP TRYING NEW PRODUCTS. DERMATOLOGISTS RECOMMEND NEUTROGENA FOR CUSTOMERS WHO CAN NOT AFFORD THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE 4X MORE EXPENSIVE AND DO NOT DELIVER. THIS PRODUCT HAS OUTPERFORMED  EVERYTHING ELSE I HAVE TRIED. AND I CAN ALWAYS TRUST AMAZON TO GIVE ME THE BEST PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;I AM 67 AND LOOK 45. THANKS NEUTROGENA AND AMAZON.</li>
    <li> This product has all the ingredients that I was looking for.  The lotion goes on smooth, and is not greasy.  It will take some time before I notice any wrinkle reducing benefits.  I got it more for the SPF and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;It would be perfect if an tightening effect would be added.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is the SPF30.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in the morning and evening after I wash my face.  WHen I first started using it, I noticed it smoothed my face and it made it really soft.  After about 5 days, I could see fine lines diminishing. They did not TOTALLY disappear, I knew where they were and what size they were.  But I asked a good friend if she could see the fine lines around my mouth, and she looked for a few seconds and couldnt see anything.  I will definitely be purchasing this again. I have wrinkles around my eyes, and a few around my mouth.  It is really making a difference, and my makeup is a breeze to put on-</li>
    <li> Perhaps I used too much but this product makes my skin break out.  I keep using because of the sunscreen, but I am not seeing a major difference in wrinkles.  Anyway, it is not a horrible lotion but based on reviews I was really hoping it would help with my wrinkles and my neck.  I am 41.  Take care of your skin ladies!!</li>
    <li> The first question might be, \\&quot;Why is a 72 year old man reviewing this product?\\&quot; And the answer is because if it even makes a dent in my canyons and creases then it has lived up to its name. And people, it lived up to its name. I&#x27;ve used it now for only four days and the results are clear and palpable. Palpable in the sense that what I could previously feel is now reduced to a mild slope rather than a suicide cliff. Frankly, I approach this sort of thing with the same skepticism I might if someone told me that drinking embalming fluid would reverse the hands of time and I&#x27;d be young, young, young. What Neutrogena, already a respected name in cosmetics more modestly says if you use this as we suggest, you&#x27;ll have smoother skin. And they have no difficult regimen to follow. Just make sure your skin is freshly washed and dried. After that, put enough fluid, abount the size of a pearl, in your palm and work it into your face? How difficult is that? It isn&#x27;t. (I go for a bit about the size of an 8-10 millimeter pearl which covers as much as needs to be cover and wastes nothing.) That&#x27;s it. If you wear makeup, give it a moment to sink in and you&#x27;re good for at least 24 hours, maybe longer. Just recently I&#x27;ve had some surgery on my leg and any number of people have commented that whatever the Doctor did has had great results as I look rested, even a bit younger. One woman even wanted to touch my face to, I suppose, make sure I wasn&#x27;t wearing a court plaster. I wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;More good news, not only does it work, but it&#x27;s attractively priced. One ounce may seem like not too much but when you&#x27;ll doling it out in minuscule amounts, the asking price seems a bargain particularly if one weighs in the happy results.&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s why a 72 year old man has tried it. Guys, if it works for me and you&#x27;re younger, and you probably are, then it will work for you. As for the ladies, I should expect you to find yourselves rolling on the floor, tears of gratitude rolling down your unwrinkled face.&lt;br /&gt;So try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> In the past, I used prescription strength Retinol (as it was prescribed because I&#x27;ve had skin cancer) and since finding this cream I have been using it now for about one month.  I can see a difference in the amount of fine lines around my eyes and the smile lines around my mouth.  I also notice a difference in the texture of my skin; it&#x27;s much smoother looking. I really like this product and would recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to those who have left one star or negative comments about it not working or causing some sort of adverse reaction, I&#x27;m not quite sure what they&#x27;re talking about unless they&#x27;re highly allergic to Retinol, or hyper-sensitive in which case I would stop using it. One person even said it deepened wrinkles? lol ummm okay... I seriously doubt that (please....) but for anyone using a product with \\&quot;Retinol\\&quot; you should know it is going to make the top layer of your skin sluff off, it&#x27;s the nature of the product and in doing so the cream in turn will give your skin a smoother look.  Yes you might notice some dry skin maybe some slight redness (which both are TEMPORARY) but in the mean time this again is the nature of the product and means it&#x27;s working.  For those of you who stick with it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see results.  It&#x27;s not going to look like you&#x27;ve received a face lift but it will smooth out the texture of your skin and smooth out SMALL lines around eyes etc.. If you&#x27;re looking for more, I suggest going to a dermatologist for cosmetic adjustments because clearly you&#x27;re expectations of a face cream are way too high and you&#x27;ll fare better with plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> The package came promptly and arrived packaged nicely.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it yet, but, I am using the same product in the night repair.  I enjoy all the Neutrogena products as they seem to be gentle on the skin.  I have very sensitive skin so their products seem to work for me.  Also, the price is great!</li>
    <li> All this product did was dry up my skin thereby pronouncing the wrinkles that I was trying to reduce.  What a hipe!  If your skin is dry and sensitive,&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy this product. Besides drying up my skin, a rash appeared a few minutes after use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for &amp;#34;repairing wrinkles&amp;#34; but was very hydrating</li>
    <li> I believe it protected my skin, however I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;wrinkle repair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Although as a middle aged male I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. this&lt;br /&gt;Is one of the first skin products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this to be great as far as wrinkle repair goes, but as a topical exfolient with 30 SPF, it works pretty well, Recommended.</li>
    <li> from what i understand you&#x27;re not supposed to be exposed to the sun when you use Retinol and yet this product contains an SPF which told me its ok to wear in the sun-i didn&#x27;t know this when i bought it so i put it on with the SPF 30 and took a walk for half an hour and then noticed when i got back i had a big red blotch on my face as though my face was burned-which it was-i then learned you should NOT USE RETINOL in the sun-why, oh why, do they put an SPF in a product when they should know you shouldn&#x27;t be wearing this in the sun. I immediately stopped using it!</li>
    <li> Helps to fill in fine lines and light wrinkles pretty quickly. I noticed a difference after the first week and it seems like the longer I use it the better I like it. It&#x27;s a gradual but quick change. It&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t pay much attention for a few days to a week then all of the sudden one day I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;wow, that&#x27;s much better&amp;#34;! Arrived quickly. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 10 days ago. I can&#x27;t believe the difference&lt;br /&gt;in my skin. The fine lines around my eyes and also the little \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under them have&lt;br /&gt;diminished. My skin feels and looks wonderful.  I love the fact that it also has a 30&lt;br /&gt;SPF in it and it goes on easily. I use it on my neck and chest as well. It leaves a nice&lt;br /&gt;glow to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;  (another little secret I have been doing at night..instead of using a moisturizer I have&lt;br /&gt;been using extra virgin olive oil....you will be amazed at the results )</li>
    <li> Have used this before. Great price.</li>
    <li> This new product has excellent reviews so I was very excited to give it a try. Have been using five days with no noticeable improvement. I am 62 with pretty good skin but need a little help. So far nothing.</li>
    <li> I used three bottles of this in hopes of noticing somewhat of a difference in the fine lines that seem to be sneaking onto my face. After using once a day (as directed by my dermatologist), I saw a VERY minor change but am not sure it was from this product; I honestly think it was from my increased water intake. I love Neutrogena products but don&#x27;t think I will buy this again. For those who want to try it, however, I do have very sensitive skin and had no problems with this when it came to breakouts or skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This makes my face burn.  My skin just may be to sensitive but it&#x27;s very drying as well.  Not sure I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this only where the wrinkles are the worse.  There was a marked difference in the wrinkles on my chin.  The wrinkles above my mouth aren&#x27;t as deep and the lines on my forehead aren&#x27;t quite as noticable.  The lines from the nose to the corners of my mouth it didn&#x27;t touch.  The wrinkles between my eyebrows aren&#x27;t quite as deep.  Overall, it&#x27;s not bad but doesn&#x27;t do what it claims either.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until something else comes along that&#x27;s better and within reason.  I tried to use this all over my face but it irritated my skin in some places like above the eye but below the eyebrow.  Had to use something else there.</li>
    <li> This very good. It took few days to see a difference but by&lt;br /&gt;the end of the week....it had done an awesome job.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my&lt;br /&gt;skin just keeps looking better. It&#x27;s not magic,  but&lt;br /&gt;it is close.</li>
    <li> This is my go to moisturizer, I use it everyday.  And I love getting it from amazon so I don&#x27;t have to go hunt for a sale on it.</li>
    <li> It seems to clog my pores, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my wrinkles… bah!&lt;br /&gt;It says in the instructions that it will burn or tingle a bit and that&#x27;s how you know its working, and since it does that maybe it&#x27;s working, but it&#x27;s not very rapid.</li>
    <li> Works wonders it is a great product. Neutrogena makes a great product. It is a proven problem solver for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I am turning 30 this year and start to have dry skin and fine lines. When I was younger I had really oily skin and acne problem so I never bothered with moisturiser. Now my face feels dry in the morning and after shower. About six weeks ago I start to use this along with Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle eyecream and together they diminishes fine lines on my face. It also brightens up my skin so I have a glowy look, My skins feels supple and youthful again! I am so glad I found this and will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am battling perimenopause, and my skin is the target. Over night I seemed to have noticed wrinkles that I didn&#x27;t have the day before.  In addition, the hot flashes and profuse sweating was tearing up the delicate skin under my eyes.  So, I decided to give this a try out of desperation, and to my surprise, there is a difference in the wrinkles and bags under my eyes, after using this product for one week.  Needless to say, I purchased my second bottle tonight.  I will never run out of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it on my chest after so much sun damage I&#x27;ve done. I use it along with a glycolic peel. Been working great. Keep in mind it takes 28 days to completely renew your skin so be patient!</li>
    <li> I have been having wrinkles around my eyes for a long time and I can tell that after using this for more than 1 week, the wrinkles actually lessens. Great product, will be ordering more when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37and have been using SPF 15 or better since I was 18 years old.  I&#x27;ve got really good skin but time eventually starts creeping up on you.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now now and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker but it definitely helps!  I&#x27;m mistaken for a 20 something regularly (haha!). I&#x27;ll give this some credit, but also being good about using sunscreen every day for 18 years :)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a really moisturizing lotion so if you have dry skin you may want to combine it with a moisturizer.  I have normal to oily skin that tends to be sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no problems with this.  I use it with a spf 50 cream in the morning and at night I use a night cream in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine it with a weekly exfoliator (I use the neutrogena hand held one you use every other day) and you&#x27;ll have a great combo (otherwise you may wind up with a few spots that are dry and flaky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy (and not overly perfumed IMO).</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!!  I have mild adult break outs and when I do not use this product my face breaks out more. I can tell a huge difference in my skin when I do not apply this before bed.  I am addicted to it!</li>
    <li> My mom loves it. She said it leaves her skin moist without being oily. Great product !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid wrinkle cream user, and this one is very effective in a short time!</li>
    <li> It did nothing!!!  IT did not work!! What else can I say. I would not buy it again. And thats about all I can say. The headline is that it does do not one thing it was advertised too do.  Neutrogena Rapid wrinkle Repair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone will find this review helpful or not because of my age.  I have always enjoyed trying new items in makeup and aging has not changed this.  I grew up in the age when you did not leave home with a bare face.  if you guessed the 50&#x27;s then your right.  The 50&#x27;s were followed by the 60&#x27;s (of course) when no one wore makeup or curled or colored their hair.  To each his own.  I am 72.&lt;br /&gt;I am a widow and I use makeup or fight wrinkles only for my own pleasure.  I do not care if anyone else notices or not, as long as I am comfortable with the face looking back at me in the mirror.  I have tried several products for wrinkles and this one seems to be one of the best.  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t want anyone to picture me running around with smooth and rosy skin at my age.  I suppose a face lift would warrant 5 stars in my case.&lt;br /&gt;When I use this, the skin is a bit smoother and the wrinkles are there, but not deep.  I sleep on my stomach, so deep wrinkles could go to the bone. I feel better about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, people do sometimes tell me I don&#x27;t look my age.  But most young people say that to old people because they don&#x27;t want to hurt your feelings by pointing out that you look like you sleep face down on chicken wire.  I take it with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;I will wrap up by saying that I will use this again and I will also try new products.  Because it&#x27;s fun and we seniors have to get our kicks where we can.</li>
    <li> I did not think it would get better than Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Intensive Deep Wrinkle Moisture, both day and night.  Well this newer regine greatly surpasses the aforementioned.  The texture is perfect, striking a good balance of not too emolient or not too water based lightness.  I did not believe it to be possible as retinol appears farther down the ingredient list than the Ageless Intensive&#x27;s.  Well, this has far superior results than the AI and that&#x27;s quite a feat in itself.  You can go to Sephora or a department store and pay well over $100 for a retinol product that doesn&#x27;t come close to these results.  It&#x27;s gets you about as close to instant gratification as possible as these newer products work very fast. No more waiting 4-6 weeks for visible results.  Three days/nights and it becomes noticeable (skin texture improvement, wrinkle reduction and skin brightening).  Get yourself to the 28 day point and you have entirely new skin.  The kind you&#x27;ve been looking for all these years.  You know, that perfect anti-aging in a bottle you&#x27;ve wasted money on many, many times and over again yet still not being satisfied which lends you start all over once more!  If I had to try and come up with something to rattle them at Neutrogena, I&#x27;d ask them why they did not use their better SPF system of \\&quot;Helioplex\\&quot;, which filters more of the UVA rays.  They are the more aging rays as opposed to UVB, which are the burning rays.  The SPF Factor is higher though in this new system; from SPF 20 to SPF 30.  I&#x27;ll take it, along with a 6 month supply so I never find myself in a running out position!  Remember, Retinol breaks down the \\&quot;glue\\&quot; which holds the dead skin cells together so they shed much more rapidly allowing the push/manufacture of newer/younger cells better developed with less mutation.  As we age, that process slows considerably, leaving one with dull and wrinkled skin which has lost much of it&#x27;s density.  Retinol also increses skins ability to regrow fibroblsts which are responsible for the increased production of collagen and elastin.  These are naturally occuring fibers which keep the skin draped tightly across the face&#x27;s skeleton/bone structure, leaving you with tightened, more dense skin.  For 20 bucks at Walmart per bottle, this is a steal.  We get the opportunity to use a quality driven skin care line that only the rare 1% so called rich people where money is no object get to use and enjoy.  I love, love, love it, but not as much as I love my new found skin for using it!</li>
    <li> I read this is the best wrinkle cream out there. So far I notice a dimming of my age spots and a glow to my skin.  I&#x27;ll re-order this cream.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t much different from its other products.  You get older, you look older. That&#x27;s the price for hanging around; but not bad considering the alternative, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I would like to know is why the Amazon product page says: \\&quot;Use on children under 6 months of age only the advice of a physician.\\&quot;  I know this country is fanatical about yough, but somebody with Neutrogena, Amazon, or maybe both. has their head up their....</li>
    <li> I use the night cream as well as this but have found nothing special in either.  I&#x27;ll continue to use them until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I read amazing reviews about this product, unfortunately it did not work for me. It dried and stained my skin!!! I also had an allergic reaction to it and little bumps appeared on my neck and chest. Maybe my skin is too sensitive? I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> Creamy, slightly heavy, but absorbs.  Would prefer unscented but the scent is not bad.  This is a good moisturizer for people who hate the way they feel on their skin.</li>
    <li> I consider myself a \\&quot;wrinkle cream-aholic\\&quot; after turning 40 and for 8 years now have been trying out every budget friendly product for anti aging. Neutrogena has always been on the top of my list for great skin care and they have a winner with this cream. The biggest problem we face in the battle with wrinkles is time, and it ain&#x27;t on our side ladies! :-( \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot; is the key word here and you do notice a difference within a week. It also has SPF which is major and smells unbelievably lite and clean-not perfumey &amp; soaks in rapidly as well with no greasy feel what so ever! I do think they need to change the TV Ad, when Diane Lane says \\&quot;watch them disappear\\&quot; cause they won&#x27;t...but are very much diminished. (As long as you use it everyday).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 months. It FEELS very nice,but it should do more tha moisturize.It should actually cause some irritation to the skin.This indicates that it actually is working as an exfoliant. Tretinoin creams will do the job but it should be .1 percent to be effective. You can also take vitamin C pills crush them and dissolve in hot water,filter the mix thru a cofee filter to remove the expedients and coatings. Any slight irritation indicates that exfoliation is taking place.No that does not mean that applying anyhing that iritates the skin is fit to be a wrinkle reducer,however wrinkle reducers do actually kill top layers of skin cells and there should be peeling.I&#x27;d guess that peopole like the nice packaging ,the brand,and must be giving this a high rating based on hope.It is really great feeling as a moisturizer-but quite poor at wrinkle reduction</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product!  I had been using Olay Pro X, and decided to give this a try as I&#x27;ve always liked neutrogena products and the packaging of this is preferable to the olay-smaller container at a similiar per ounce price and still has spf 30.&lt;br /&gt;I think it works just as well as the olay pro x, if not better.  It feels less greasy when applied.  It does have a scent which I could do without, but that would not stop me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> To the point...I am 36 yrs old, t-zone oily, breakout sometimes, inflammation on cheeks, and crows feet. I could never stick to any so called anti-aging products because they are all mostly fluff and did nothing to me but empty my pocket book. It is nice to have a trusted name brand at a very reasonable price that works in just days. I paid only $16 for the Day and the Night at Walgreens since they had it on sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff...&lt;br /&gt;Calms inflammed skin&lt;br /&gt;Very well absorbed&lt;br /&gt;Fresh spring-like fragrance (I LOVE!)&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a glow&lt;br /&gt;Does make the lines and skin softer after using for a few days&lt;br /&gt;SPF 30 does the job&lt;br /&gt;Feels great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has replaced my Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock SPF 100 as my daily sunblock since it is a lot lighter on my face and does SO MUCH more!</li>
    <li> Didnt see any  improvement</li>
    <li> Every time you use this, there is this small glop that I guess is the dried remains from the last use, and it also just feels greasy on, so there are other products, both by Neutrogena and not (like Bel Essence, though that lacks SPF, sadly) that go on and feel better on.</li>
    <li> This product does the job and cost less than many other similar products.  Use consistently as directed for results.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product online.  It&#x27;s the reason I decided to try it.  My opinion is slightly different from the majority.&lt;br /&gt;  Although everyone said the product had a pleasant scent, I&#x27;d have to disagree.  I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it pleasant.  It was a bit overwhelming.  It wasn&#x27;t a super smell but it had a slight old lady perfume mixed with hospital shampoo too. However, I had been using a product with no scent so any scent would be too much.  I&#x27;m getting used to the smell and barely notice it anymore.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;  Results: I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as spectacular as everyone said either.  It is however one of THE BEST smoothing lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.  This product takes the place of a lotion and a serum.  I wouldn&#x27;t call this product thick either.  In fact the consistency is very much a thin lotion or serum but becomes slightly sticky when rubbed on the skin.  But the funny part is after it feels hard to rub in there is no sticky feeling left...only the feeling of smooth skin.  It works instantly for that.  I was skeptical of some of those posts but after the almost 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;m still getting the same super smooth effect.  The best part about this product is that even after you wash it off (I use a different night cream), my face still feels as smooth as when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the over all appearance of my skin, there may be an initial glow but i haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in anything.  Nothing has been smoothed or minimized.  If anything it took a few days for my face to adjust to the product (slight breakout) but all seems fine now.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to someone with sensitive skin.  I have extremely sensitive skin and a majority of products irritate my skin (even products for sensitive skin) This product did not bother or irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product and hope it helps with some of the fine lines but if the smoothness continues to remain constant I most likely will stick with this because overall I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! Love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> I think this does a nice job moisturizing.</li>
    <li> notice a difference in fine lines</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product...forehead wrinkles have diminished, my skin looks healthier, clearer, and brighter, and other facial wrinkles are better.  I use more than directed - I have not had any adverse reactions at all.  I tend to dab some on a few times during the day.  It makes my skin soft and healthy looking...and younger!!!  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s.  What more could I ask for...a great skin product at a great price...with a sunscreen to boot...I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Saw this product line featured n InStyle mag&#x27;s Best Beauty Buys.I wanted,and got,improvement in nose to mouth lines.I used it each morning making sure to massage it in an upward motion to each line.Although I did not see results in a week as advertised,I did in 10 days.Both lines are softer in look and less crease- y.&lt;br /&gt; Product in a ceramic type bottle with a pump that does not clog.Consistency like lotion,does not leave any white blotches.Can apply make up on top.I am going to order this and also their night time product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. For the price and the hype, I expected better results but really couldn&#x27;t see much difference after a couple of weeks use. It really isn&#x27;t enough on its own; need a good moisturizer over it. I had hoped during the summer months not to need more than this one product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and see no difference. It hasn&#x27;t reduced any wrinkles at all and it dries my skin out</li>
    <li> I recommend this product pretty wholeheartedly for women who have aging skin.  I am in my mid 50s and like most women, have tried many many products that claim to help with wrinkles and elasticity.  When good housekeeping came out with their anti aging product recommendations a couple of years ago, I was excited to try some of the top scorers (tested with real women and results read by special machines that could determine things like wrinkle depth, etc).  I tried L&#x27;Oreal revitalift deep set wrinkle repair for at least a 6 month steady use.  I also tried the no 7 one, can&#x27;t remember the name now for at least 6 months (different time period).  Both of these rated on the top of the lists of the gh reports and when I was using one, I used it once a day for a long time, experimenting with either day or night application.  I would say that those helped me ever ever so slightly, barely noticeable and kind of disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then saw this neutrogena product and decided to give it a shot.  I&#x27;m into about my 4th week of using it and the results are more noticeable than those other products.  I cannot say it works miracles...most lines are still visible.  I will say a few fine lines are just about GONE and that deep wrinkles are definitely less pronounced than before.  They won&#x27;t go away, I know, but if you are honest about just how bad they are when you begin using the product, there is a good chance you will see a change for the better in time.  It seems that it also slightly improves sagging in my lower face, around the mouth and jawline.  It also reduces visibility of pores but that could be partially due to using apricot facial scrub lightly once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a tip that has made a difference to me. When I started with it, I used it at night after washing my face.  Didn&#x27;t see much improvement that way.  Now I use it in the morning after showering and it definitely works.  I think because it stays on my face longer...all day instead offor like 8 hours at night.  Kind of bummed because once summer hits and I am in the sun a lot I may have to stop using it in the daytime.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup but have used this under my tinted moisturizer and it works well.  It sometimes leaves a sheen on my face that I tone down by lightly blotting with a towel.  If your face has some wrinkles, give it a try. It has helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update, in september of 2013.  Well, yes, it was good.  But eventually, improvement stopped and it&#x27;s back to the drawing board, hahaha.</li>
    <li> I have a few lines on my face. They&#x27;re not deep and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. To try to get rid of the lines, I tried this product. It&#x27;s okay but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. If you&#x27;re looking at this, you probably have a few lines, too. I recommend using Oil of Olay in the morning and evening. About an hour before you go to bed, use the Oil of Olay and cover it with a thin layer of vaseline. I know it sounds weird, but it helps to hold the moisture in and works a lot better than this product.  Lines start to decrease in a couple weeks and it costs a lot less than this product does.</li>
    <li> Too perfumey, and it really irritated my eyes.  Don&#x27;t know if it works because I can&#x27;t continue using it.  Putting it around my eyes drives them crazy. The scent they put in it lingers too long.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair about one (1) week but it is amazing.      I used it mostly on the area above my lips and it has worked like a charm.  Most of the lines were deep like smokers upper lip - I was not a smoker - but suddenly I was getting one across the area, as well as vertically -  it was just dreadful.  I saw this on TV and did not believe it would work that fast but decided Neutrogena has a good name and Diane Lane, who was advertising it,  looked terrific.   So I ordered it.  I have shown the area to my hair stylist who really can&#x27;t believe the success.  I am going to use more of it on my one cheek that has more wrinkles than the other one to see how it works there but I am going to order more and make certain I NEVER run out.      When I smile, I have no wrinkles on that lip area and,  you can be sure, I am smiling a lot!     More later. . .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, nothing miraculous &amp; no dramatic erasing of wrinkles. But just good, solid product.</li>
    <li> I saw the great reviews for this product and said \\&quot;what the heck, let&#x27;s give it a try. It&#x27;s only $20.00\\&quot; After two days using it, I looked on the mirror and I thought I was seeing, or rather, not seeing things! My crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes were fading. On the 4th day, my big frown line on my forehead is gone. I don&#x27;t know what to say or think! It&#x27;s just unbelievable. I have been on Renova but it takes too long to work. I was seriously thinking about buying Chanel Sublimage for $372. This little bottle does the trick. I don&#x27;t know how much it will help with my parenthesis around my mouth. Only time will tell, but what I&#x27;ve seen so far, it&#x27;s amazing. I am 51 years old.</li>
    <li> Same as the night cream, it&#x27;s a fantastic product that I use during the day and I recommend it to everyone also.&lt;br /&gt;And since it has SPF 30 it protects your skin from the sun.</li>
    <li> This skin cream really works! I reccomend using an organic based cream for under the eyes if you are looking to get rid of dark circles and this neutrogena cream for the rest of the face/neck... i noticed results after about 2 weeks id say</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product.  I use it twice per day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it. It&#x27;s my daily sunscreen with benefits. It has really made a difference in my skin. Fading sun spots, less obvious wrinkles.</li>
    <li> has not done the expected announce results.</li>
    <li> Dried my face out... :/</li>
    <li> Fast shipping....product as described....good price.  This product is a wonderful breakthrough for people who cannot afford Clinique or Este Lauder.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light facial lotion.  If you have sensitive skin it will burn the first few times you use it, but it&#x27;s tolerable.  As far as \\&quot;wrinkle repair\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle, nothing is and I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.  If you don&#x27;t expect a dramatic difference in your appearance you won&#x27;t be disappointed, it&#x27;s just a nice light lotion.</li>
    <li> I am 50 and have tried many products for wrinkles and skin texture improvement. I like retinol because it actually does help over time, but have been a little disappointed with results in past with different products. I have to say I noticed an improvement immediately with this product and after a week my skin looked brighter, clearer, just better. I noticed fine lines were less visible. This is in just a week! I really like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this because I kept bugging him about getting rid of wrinkles.  He told me that this was a good product and less harsh than others. He said these type products work by turning your skin cells over more rapidly (that&#x27;s what the retinol does) and the hydraulic acid helps your skin retain more moisture, so your skin plumps up.  That&#x27;s how they work, and this is one of the best products out there (I&#x27;ve tried a number of others).  I&#x27;ve had great results from this BUT - my dermatologist told me I need to include in my routine a good cleansing product, one that will get rid of all the dead cells (since the skin cells are turning over more rapidly).  When I added a mask/cleanser/cleansing brush (I&#x27;ve used a variety and they all helped my skin), I saw better results, I guess because I was clearing away debris from the new skin.  My face was brighter and my skin was softer (in texture) and firmer. He also told me that the Nutrogena would work well to encourage skin turnover, but in order for you to get younger healthy skin to reappear, you need to have the building blocks available to build new skin - vitamins, fatty acids, amino acids, etc.  Back to my research.  I found [[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]] which is all natural, and is made of plant oils that contain most of the building blocks for skin.  I started using this with the Nutrogena and my variety of cleansers, and THAT&#x27;S when I saw amazing results.  And permanent results.  My skin is completely different.  The caverns on my forehead are gone, with only slight lines that I can easily cover up with make up, no crow&#x27;s feet, my upper lip wrinkles almost completely gone, the dark spots on my skin are faded to barely noticeable, again, good makeup and you don&#x27;t see them. My skin is softer than my daughter&#x27;s and much brighter and firmer.  To sum up - Nutrogena is always in my medicine cabinet, I usedifferent cleansers (jury is still out on which works the best), and I use the Bel Essence every day morning and night.  You won&#x27;t start to see serious results for at least a month (per the doc, skin regenerates every 28 days), but after 6 months of this routine, I have never looked better.  Super happy.</li>
    <li> I love the SPF30, it feels good on and makes my skin look good.  I&#x27;m 63 years old and I use it almost every day and am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I am a 62-yr old ex-worshipper of the sun and paying the price now. Three years ago I developed some kind of rash on my arms and around the same time my lips began to peel and crack. They would be fine for a few days then break out for several days and it would go away. Then it stayed...and stayed...and I was miserable and embarrassed! I have no clue what was happening, but after trying many things, I couldn&#x27;t find any relief for my lips. I was constantly applying lip creams which would help for a minute or less. Then, I developed deep lines like those of a smoker. Finally I tried Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and the relief was instant! My lips have not been dry or cracked ever since! They look great! I tried this product because the website &amp;#34;Consumer Research&amp;#34; said 100% of testers had results in a couple of days. Three days later and I am so jazzed with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE SUNNERS: What they told you about sun damage is true...and it only worsens as you age even if you NEVER go in the sun again.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in fine lines and wrinkles but it didn&#x27;t make me 25 again.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle as directed and never saw improvement.  it works just as good as any over the counter cheap brank</li>
    <li> Love this product that leaves my skin soft and moist but never icky or sticky.  It plumps out wrinkles and makes my skin look fresh and firm. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I saw a difference after only 4 days. I&#x27;m 45 but always get taken for my mid 20&#x27;s. The fine lines &amp; crows feet are very diminished. And best of all there&#x27;s no parabens! Here&#x27;s hoping when I turn 50 that I&#x27;ll get taken for 30!</li>
    <li> Great product, I see the results, if it makes your skin &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; skip a day in between</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months and I think my skin looks better.It had a good review in Ladies Home Journal</li>
    <li> The product was packaged in original box but the pump was broken.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer daily for two months, and I have noticed a decrease in wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. I&#x27;m 34, so the wrinkles aren&#x27;t deep or pronounced, but they have started to appear, and I want to combat them FAST! I haven&#x27;t had much success with other wrinkle creams, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this one. My wrinkles are less visible, and I&#x27;m less self-conscious about them as a result! The moisturizer is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave my already oily face feeling greasy or weighed down. On days when I don&#x27;t want a full face of makeup, I mix one pump of this moisturizer with a dab of my foundation for sheer, lightweight coverage and SPF protection. I plan to buy this again and hope to see a greater reduction in wrinkles over time.</li>
    <li> After i read all the reviews on this product I purchased it. Most of the reviews said that it will show good results in about 2 weeks but it was not true. I have been using it for about 6 weeks but so far nothing at all. I don&#x27;t know if any of those reviews I had read about this product was accurate.?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and expect and accept signs of aging. I earned those wrinkles and think of them as signs of a life well lived. After a long and stressful winter however, I took a good look in the mirror and was taken aback by what I saw. Deep cheek creases and wrinkles where they hadn&#x27;t been before had aged my face by at least 10 years -- seemingly overnight. It was scary! Through the years I&#x27;d tried various products off and on, but never had a regimen and was happy using a tinted moisturizer and letting nature take its course. It was time to be more proactive, so I tried Rapid Wrinkle Repair and am amazed by the results. The face in the mirror now looks like the gently aging soul I remembered. The creases are gone (or at least not noticeable) and my skin looks well cared for. There has been no burning or flaking and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. Thank you, Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a couple weeks and I have not noticed much difference.  Everything I read about this product says to use it for a month or more in order to notice changes.  I will do so!  I am enjoying it now as a moisturizer with the 30 spf that I want.  It is not overly greasy.  My face feels moisturized hours after applying it.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it.  However, this one arrived with the top broken and the spring loose.  Unable to use.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and love it. Non greasy and not heavy like any other sun screen products. Whether it will have a long term effect on my skin issue is yet to be seen. I like the scent of this product as well ..as it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this product it smooths out your skin and evens out skin discoloration I will continue this product. A++++++++</li>
    <li> Been using this a year now. Really helps with my skin tone. I am not that old, so I don&#x27;t know if it helps with wrinkles in the long term,since anything that hydrates your skin will help with wrinkles, and anything that has any SPF will keep you from getting more wrinkles. Smells nice, helps my make up go on smoothly and smooths out rough patches that peal or  get discolored due to acid peals and other alpha-hydroxy products. Not a miracle product, but makes enough difference to be in my daily line usage.</li>
    <li> Noticeable wrinkle reduction after a couple weeks of use</li>
    <li> This product was as good as any hand lotion you could by. I was not impressed. There was no change in the wrinkles after a month.</li>
    <li> Goes well under makeup. Did NOT see any rapid changes or long term changes. Just makes skin feel nice.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now, and do notice a wrinkle decrease and my skin is softer.  I&#x27;m not looking for miracles, just decent results and this delivers.</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona and I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and my skin felt old and dry...I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before and was hoping it would clean and soften my skin..I&#x27;ve used it 3x so far and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin. Its so soft and fresh feeling. .I use a night cream after and I&#x27;m so impressed. ..i don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too but I can&#x27;t imagine another product could do even better because I&#x27;m telling you my face feels and looks great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use at night, then realized it has SPF so switched for day use. It works really well, have seen a difference in skin texture. I&#x27;m 38 and don&#x27;t have wrinkles... yet, but I use this product to avoid any. It feels really nice on skin, and it has improved my skin.</li>
    <li> I have always trusted Neutrogena! Goes on nice and feels great! As far as diminishing fine lines? I did not notice that at all, but very smooth and light.</li>
    <li> I was using Avon products prior to using this and what a difference it has made!  It&#x27;s like day and night! I was using the Exlirs, day cream, night cream, eye cream, serums - you name it and nothing works a well as Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair! I use all three products and that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> Wrinkles haven&#x27;t changed, but I like the SPF 30 in the product and it&#x27;s a light cream that absorbs quickly.  I live in an environment that is very tough on my skin and am outdoors a lot in the sun and wind.  Was hoping for more out of this product, but most of these products are HOPE in a jar so didn&#x27;t have huge expectations.</li>
    <li> This product serves as a wrinkle prevention and moisturizer. I use it everytime I wash my face and I do agree i Have seen some results. Skin looks more radiant and fresh.</li>
    <li> its sunscreen, not a wrinkle repair</li>
    <li> This product advertises visible difference in one week.  I have tried for eight weeks now and although there may be some difference it is not noticeable to me.  I do like the product and the feel on your face.  Just don&#x27;t expect too much of a difference in skin texture - luckily mine is not too bad to begin with!</li>
    <li> Really dint see a difference. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and coupled with their other products I am pleased with the result.  I used this to replace a much more expensive line of products.</li>
    <li> Love Neutrogena products.  Been using this product for years, and love the fact that the moisturizer has retinol and SPF 30 all in one formula!</li>
    <li> This works so well!  I am happy to recommend this!  Smells nice, but smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  My face seems smoother.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago and only used it one time. After reading all of the reviews, I&#x27;m going to take a before and after picture of my face and neck. I have NEVER written a review, so I hope this goes well. I will post both pics in 2 weeks:) I have to give it a 3 star rating because I haven&#x27;t tried it long enough YET. P.S. I hope to make it a 5 star!</li>
    <li> The primary point of a moisturizer is to moisturize. This product is not very good at that and to me that makes it essentially useless. I&#x27;m not sure if its been helping with wrinkles or not, but I prefer to use only 1 product that multi-tasks effectively, and this one doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Love this for the 30 spf not too sure about the wrinkle repair claims!</li>
    <li> I used alpha hydrox for years and switched to this product. I love it, it makes my skin feel much softer</li>
    <li> If you read the bottle itself, it says, PURPOSE: sunscreen, USES: helps prevent sunburn.  In fact, read the rest of the bottle, there&#x27;s not a word about wrinkles or skin texture, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for 4 weeks, haven&#x27;t seen any changes at all.  It helps with acne, because it dries skin so much that pimples have no other choice but to die.  The only way I am able to use it is by adding several drops of grapeseed extract to prevent intense dryness, and I have oily skin. No improvement in texture, no reduction in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This burned my skin upon the very first application (which took weeks to heal, btw). I can&#x27;t entirely blame the product (the reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1), as I have very sensitive skin. Better suited for someone with very non sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> The seller was great. I got it on time and in excellent condition. It has really made an huge difference on my face. I have had family and friends ask me if I&#x27;ve had Botox or plastic surgery. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It works well as a moisturizer but I don&#x27;t see much in wrinkle repair after using it every night for 2 bottles.?</li>
    <li> careful using it , it will dry your skin. I f you use too much it will burn, but does what it promises. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I really like this wrinkle repair lotion.  I bought the night lotion and eye lotions as well and they are all fantastic.  I never have the greasy feeling when I am wearing it, and it applies well under make up.  The results are apparent right away.  As mentioned on the bottle, it does make your face tingle.  I could see this as a potential problem for those with sensitive skin.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Goes on without leaving white residue</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought I was buying, I thought I was buying something else. But I do like it, and it does make my skin feels soft. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s decreased lines around my eyes, because I don&#x27;t have that many. I will update with continued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 34yr old man that&#x27;s desperately trying NOT to look any older. My forehead wrinkles have been getting worse and worse over the years and these are the only real wrinkles I&#x27;ve had on my face. They are pretty deep. I&#x27;m always commented that I look much younger (in my 20s) except for these wrinkles so I decided to give this stuff a shot and I&#x27;m GLAD I did. After only 3 days the wrinkles are MUCH less deep than they used to be and took them back about 5 years... Literally 5 years removed from these wrinkles in 3 days. I&#x27;m on my 5th day now and my forehead looks like it did when I was 18. I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This requires a little more work than what&#x27;s on the label though. First of all I give my head and face a thorough scrub to agitate the skin while I&#x27;m showering. After shower I dry my face completely. You don&#x27;t want your skin to be wet ALL ALL because then it won&#x27;t absorb the product properly. After it&#x27;s completely dry I apply the cream (1 pump) and rub it in pretty intensely to make sure my skin absorbs it. Then I go to bed and let it do its magic. The next morning I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed. This stuff makes your skin seem to grow more. In the morning when I&#x27;m shaving with a razor (not electric, actual physical razor) I shave over my wrinkles. This may sound crazy, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt but it does remove some excess skin that has been seemingly growing since I started using this stuff. The end result is very smooth clean skin with wrinkles that are barely visible anymore! I highly recommend using the razor to remove this extra skin.. It just gets fluffier and shaves off without harm. No bleeding, no pain. Just a little sensitive for about an hour after but it goes away and then you&#x27;re left with a beautiful face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope everybody enjoys this stuff as much as I do. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> PID WRINKLE REPAIR IS A TRUE AND GREAT NAME FOR THIS PRODUCT. I LOVE IT AND YES, I RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The first two days of using this product, my skin was stinging and I could feel the product working.  My eyes were even bloodshot from how much it affected me.  But after a couple of days I don&#x27;t feel it anymore, which I hope is normal because I want to know it is working but I don&#x27;t want to walk around with stinging skin and bloodshot eyes either.  I have used it for over a week now, and I don&#x27;t see any major mind-blowing results yet.  I&#x27;m hoping this product will work for me.  If it works and I see results, I&#x27;ll obviously purchase it again; if not I wanted to try the \\&quot;deep wrinkle\\&quot; line from Neutrogena as well, so I may go that route.  From the reputation this product has, it is a good deal for the price.  A little goes a long way, so I anticipate this product lasting for quite awhile.  It may be worth it to buy the other products that go with this one to get maximum results.  So far this is all that I&#x27;m using (with moisturizer, sunscreen, and RoC eye serum) from this line.</li>
    <li> I like this product and will order again.  I have used several much more expensive products, and I don&#x27;t think the more expensive is any better than the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair.  Matter of fact, I have better results with the Neutrogena products.  I am 53 years old, and will order this product again, and will recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a while now....noticed a difference in a week! (...and it really made me feel good!) Awesome price! Superfast shipping ~ Secure packaging! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve trusted Nuetrogena for years with my skin care products. The only product on the market that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin break out with acne. So naturally as I&#x27;m getting older I turned to them for wrinkle repair. I&#x27;ve been using this product relentlessly for the last couple months hoping it would do what it promised. Nope. If anything it made my wrinkles WORSE. MORE VISIBLE. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the most awful expire nice I&#x27;ve ever had with amazon I researched for weeks to find a wig, close to my own style since I&#x27;m losing my hair ...I am literally crying this is a full cap wig ..one you can see the cap .... you can see the weft in between ...I just can&#x27;t belive that such bad product and straight out lieing about description is allowed on amazon .....I&#x27;m so dis appointed now I don&#x27;t know what to do ..Do Not Buy this wig the whole discription is a lie again Do not buy this this is not lace front and it&#x27;s really short .....it&#x27;s horrible I feel completely stupid and now I don&#x27;t have anything to cover what I&#x27;m going through .....thanks so much for lieing about your crappy prouduct....I want my money back now</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, my only one complaint I have is that it really did not last very long, you only get an ounce which is not very much.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and I have to say it&#x27;s one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve purchased.  Amazon has a great price too.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I really like this stuff.  Of course, I am not expecting miracles, but it is a very nice moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, and it melts right into your skin.  My skin does feel softer, and even though the wrinkles are still there, I think I see a little bit of improvement........after all, at my senior age......I will welcome any improvement I can get.</li>
    <li> Make sure you patch test this before you use it on your face!!! I had a horrible allergic reaction to this cream and my face swelled up like a puffer fish.  No joke I had to go to the ER bc my face swelled up so bad I could barely see. I had used it like a moisturizer putting it on at night after washing my face. I wish I could give a higher review for this product as it had helped so many people but for me it was awful.  If you are going to try this just test it first in case you have a reaction like I did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and think it might be working - in any event, it does make the skin softer.</li>
    <li> So I bought this after seeing the commercials about the fast results. Now this stuff has a WONDERFUL smell, I love it just for the smell. I have been using it a couple weeks now and I have noticed a slight difference in the fine lines under my eyes especially after staying up late finishing a paper then getting up a couple hours later for work. I add this to my forehead, by my eyes, and around my mouth, and it only takes one pump, so I think it will last. I also like that it has an SPF that will be great for summer...I will be buying another bottle when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> This product works well. After 6 months, reduced the wrinkles that were forming. I use just a little bit each morning on my face.</li>
    <li> I dont need much - I am moist (oily) but as far as wrinkle improvement? I saw nothing.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion as directed. smells nice, goes on light and is a nice lotion. But, I didnt notice a big difference in wrinkles</li>
    <li> This range is fantastic! I work as a maternity nurse (24 hours, 5 days a week) and am currently with twins of 4 weeks. I had been using this product for a week and when I should have looked like I had been up all week with infant twins, I actually looked like I had been on a beach holiday!!!&lt;br /&gt;A. May. Zing!</li>
    <li> I am giving this a 2 star because the jury is still out.  My neck where I use this is still the same--no changes that I can detect (been using for about 3 weeks).  If I were to judge on &amp;#34;rapid&amp;#34; then it would be a negative (-1) but I think I will see where I am when I empty this one bottle since I don&#x27;t believe that any product will magically and &amp;#34;rapidly&amp;#34; repair my wrinkles as quickly as I would like them to do.  I will take pictures as I go to verify--things maybe happening and I can&#x27;t tell.  Would I buy it again--today the answer would be no--but if over time I see an improvement then &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; depending on the results.</li>
    <li> I read an excellent review in one of the fashion magazines and decided to give it a try.  I think its fine - but would love a larger size bottle, it only lasts for about a month with once a day usage. I like that it has a pump dispenser and you can lock the pump for travel.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;Works great !!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to reduce fine lines on my forehead. I like e fact that the product goes on very nicely and it does not burn or flake your skin.  It does reduce e appearance but I feel that was after a few uses. To me rapid should be instanteous.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent sun protection and an evening out of skin tone make this a must in my make-up collection.  One squirt from the little bottle and an equal amount of skin lotion, mixed, serve me perfectly.  If I use this product alone, it has a tendency to irritate my skin which is fine and thin.  I use one bottle of this product about every two months.  It is a product well suited to older as well as younger women.</li>
    <li> I have used for several weeks, and I can see some small difference. I hope to see more differnce over a longer time.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this a couple of times, but my face felt hot and started flaking, even after  tried applying it every 2 or 3 days, people even asked me why my face was so red, so I cannot use it</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! I use this every day and it has made SUCH a difference in my skin tone. The first few days, I applied it to my whole face, including around my eyes and eye-lids, my mistake - my eyelids had a bit of irritation, so I stopped applying it to my eye-area, but I the rest of my face is completely un-irritated. And the SPF is such a great bonus since it is such a light formula that doesn&#x27;t make my makeup feel cakey! I highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Made my skin too dry and uncomfortable. And, it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Great for your face.  Skin really glows. Super service from Amazon</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!  It has softened the lines under my eyes and completely made my smile lines disappear!  It did take about a week or so before I began to notice a difference and it does make my skin red after application for a few minutes as I have sensitive skin.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad and a little goes a long way.  The spf is a bonus and the price is affordable.  I will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Not greasy at all, can&#x27;t even tell I have it on. And the seller shipped FAST as well as solving a shipping issue pronto, with no drama whatsoever. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again esp. From this seller</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have a few minor wrinkles near my eyes and around my lips.  Neutrogena brand has been around a long time and have used some of their other products from tine-to-time with great results.  I used this particular product for 2 weeks, using it in the Morning and again at Bedtime.  Never saw one iota of change.  Sadly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!! Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for wrinkles, it really works.</li>
    <li> I am in my 80&#x27;s and I could tell a difference after about 2 weeks.  Good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any result from this product; it&#x27;s basically just another moisturizer with the &amp;#34;hype &amp;#34; of erasing wrinkles.</li>
    <li> As a sleep deprived mother of a 2 month old and a 3 year old who also suffers from a genetic history of Slavic decent (tendency towards bags and dark circles) I had a great need to freshen up the area around my eyes before returning to work from maternity leave. The first time I put it on I noticed an improvement right away. Was kind of leery after reading some of the impassioned negative reviews but decided to try it because of the positive ones. I experienced mild burning when applying it but noticed it was worse when I applied too much and rubbed it in hard. Seriously you don&#x27;t need much and just let it soak in to the top layer of skin where it is supposed to do its thing. I use it after a gentle cleaner and before a calming moisturizer (I have sensitive skin). It is not magic. I do not think it will completely eliminate heavy bags or long standing wrinkles but I believe it can help reduce them from my experiences and if it is going to work you will probably know right off the bat.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girl...she is silky smooth so product works great!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products and none of them live up to their promises.  I thought I would give this a try.  What a pleasant surprise to find this product actually works.  It goes on smooth and within a couple of days I noticed a big difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.  I love this product and will continue to buy it.  I&#x27;ve tried creams that cost 10 times more than this and don&#x27;t work as well.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I just started using this 3 weeks ago and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I look for moisturizers and foundations that are healthy and offer some radiance.  I&#x27;m 62 and doing my best to keep a soft look to my complexion without spending a stupid amount of money on a pipe dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hydrates all day, and looks kind of glow-y - without looking greasy or like an obvious attempt to be \\&quot;radiant.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m satisfied that it&#x27;s a natural look but WAY better than natural would be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if it really repairs wrinkles.  My skin LOOKS smoother.  Now that may be the light reflecting quality of the product, but I won&#x27;t complain either way.  I rated it 4 because I want to see what I think of it in another month or two.  Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far - but I don&#x27;t spend department store prices, so I don&#x27;t claim to know if this is the best there is.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, though.</li>
    <li> Lite to the touch, and the face.  I see a difference in moisture, and less lines.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!!  Does not smell at all like sunscreen, so no problem using everyday.  Have had great results, likely because I really use it daily because it is light, absorbs quickly and still has sunscreen.  A mix that is so hard to find in any price range of daily moisturizers.  A bottle last about 1.5 months from my experience.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to point out gently to one of the nice reviewers that the ingredient she mentions is, in fact, &amp;#34;hyaluronic&amp;#34;acid...not &amp;#34;hydraulic&amp;#34; acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurs to me that the former ingredient will be kinder to my skin....</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the reviews which made it sound fab, but it made my skin blotchy and now it stings when I use my regular moisturiser.  When I had a facial the beautician said it probably contains retinol which is harsh on sensitive skin.  So I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to buy this in bulk great price the product was what i ordered. It came really fast and in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again from them</li>
    <li> I know they say rapid, but it wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call dramatic.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and can see the difference, but I&#x27;m not sure I did after just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this was worth the wait.  It&#x27;s been kind to my skin, which has balked at retinol before.  I&#x27;ve also adversely responded to Neutrogena products with SPF ingredients, but not a hitch with this--even around my eyes.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT MOISTURIZER I USE IT DAILY I LOVE HOW MOISTURIZER MY SKIN I AM 44 JUST TO LET YOU KNOW</li>
    <li> After the first use, I noticed slight redness in my skin and it was a little tingly.  Stupid me, I thought great, it&#x27;s working!  The 2nd day,  woke up with seriously red, burned skin that is peeling horribly. I stopped using it, but 2 days later my skin still seems to be getting worse.  My skin is very red and burned (way worse than a sunburn) and my skin is so tight around my mouth that it actually hurts to open my mouth to eat!  I have never had a reaction to anything before.  Right now I cannot put anything on my face without it being painful.  I just slathered my face with Neosporin, hoping for some relief.  If this doesn&#x27;t improve in a day or two, I&#x27;m going to have to see a doctor.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for day use. Have used it for years. keeps the wrinkles smooth and less noticeable. Very light and nourishing.</li>
    <li> Well, one of these days I will accept the fact that the only &amp;#34;wrinkle repair&amp;#34; out there has the letters M.D. after his/her name.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy cheap moisturizer and age gracefully.  None of these claims are real.</li>
    <li> When I first used it I was expecting a little tingling or something like retinol usually does but had no issues with it.  My skin does seem firmer but haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction of wrinkles.  It seems to leave a film too but it&#x27;s probably from the sunscreen.  Not noticeable once make up is applied.  Probably will try something else once this product is done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a month and have not seen positive results.  However, it is a light, easy-to-apply moisturizer with a light fragrance, so I will continue to use it.  I just wish there was more content in the bottle.  It goes quickly, even though I use &amp;#34;the size of a pearl&amp;#34; as directed.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is deceiving....even when empty, it feels like it&#x27;s full.  It&#x27;s not transparent, so there is no way to tell when you are running low or when it&#x27;s empty.  My advice is, if you like this product, keep a spare on hand.</li>
    <li> very disappointing--damaging to my face.  giving it one star was overly generous.  I have always trusted Neutrogena but this product is useless.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Does not live up to its name OR its commercial. Started using it every morning in Sept 2013. . . not one single line/wrinkle has even so much as dumished, much less disappear. Very disappointed!!!!  :( Don&#x27;t spend your money on this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x60;t think the products does much for my wrinkles.  I have used it since May 2014, all ordered from Amazon.  I have given it plenty of time to work and am not satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 1 month and notice a big difference with the fine lines around my mouth and eyes! I do recommend this product</li>
    <li> Doesnt seem to work at all.</li>
    <li> not very impresswd at all</li>
    <li> it kind of thick and laves white marks on my face if I don&#x27;t look close enough or rub it in enough.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as well as I expected.  Neutrogena makes excellent products, but I feel slightly disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I look any younger or refreshed, but this serum/cream smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling clogged or greasy. Must try it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for about 4 weeks &amp; have not noticed a reduction in the wrinkles under my eyes. Im 30 years old &amp; just started getting them. Also I think due to the sunscreen it has a little sting in my sensitive under eye area.</li>
    <li> This was a great price came within the two days as I have come to expect with Amazon. I shopped locally for this product and once more I could not beat the price from Amazon. As for the service, as always Amazon Prime is the best!</li>
    <li> As a mid 30&#x27;s guy, that works in corporate america and gets little sleep, workout a lot, and loves to hit the beach during the summer; so my face has started to get some lines/wrinkles under my eyes and bridge (or crown).  So I decided to try a wrinkle repair lotion.  Based on the reviews I decided to try this and WOW was I impressed with the results.  After two weeks, the lines on my forward head and even the wrinkle on my bridge as well as lines around my eyes have slowly been erased!!  This stuff is AMAZING.  Now, one thing is very important to remember, if your using this during the day and your physically active or sweat a lot and use a towel to wipe off your face, it will irritate your skin and burn (learned the hard way from working out and doing cardio in the gym), so make sure to remove the solution if your going to be physically active or plan to sweat a lot.  Also, make sure to have realistic expectations: 1.) its not going to remove wrinkles over night, it will take a few weeks to see some significant results and 2.) the results will vary, if the wrinkles are really deep, it will more than likely reduce them but not permanently remove them.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. My face was improved in that my skin felt smoother but I can&#x27;t use it every day .if i do certain areas of my face dry &amp; flake. They do say that&#x27;s supposed to happen but I wonder why only 1 area does that over &amp; over. I&#x27;ve found that for me, if I use for 2 days then use a gentle moisturizer for 2 days I can clear up the area. So, not sure it&#x27;s worth it, at least for me, others may not have my problems. Would I buy it again.....NO!</li>
    <li> I have severe acne and am now in my 40&#x27;s. This new beauty regime that I&#x27;ve discovered has cleared my skin, and really improved the quality of my skin&#x27;s tone and texture! I use Olay cleanser, this moisturizer, and pure salicylic acid every few weeks with a fan brush to keep my acne at bay and rejuvenate my skin! I can honestly say this is the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself, but now my husband uses it. I started using it and within three days, my face was flaky and I had a rash. Not so good. My husband uses it, however, and loves it. So, I guess maybe spot test your skin before using it all over your face. :P</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for about 6 months and so far it is one of the best skin care products I have used.  I use this every morning before I leave for the day since it has SPF protection and at Night I use the night time version of the product.  I will update the review in 50 years and let you know what my skin looks like.</li>
    <li> I use this product in the morning and works well reducing the notice of wrinkles. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the Neutrogena wrinkle products and the very economical prices. I have paid high prices and been disappointed several times, but not anymore. I hope that these products will work as well for others as they do for me. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 2 or 3 years and I do get real good results with Neutrogena and lots of compliments on how good my skin  looks for a 70 years of age..</li>
    <li> I REALLY DO LIKE THIS PRODUCT. THE SMELL AND FEEL IS GREAT! THE ONLY THING I DISLIKE IS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO APPLY IT MANY TIMES A DAY. I WEAR MAKEUP ALL DAY EVERYDAY AND SO THAT&#x27;S NOT POSSIBLE. I ONLY HAVE FOREHEAD WRINKLES AND CROWS FEET WHEN I SMILE A BUNCH OR LIFT MY EYEBROWS (AT THE AGE OF 26). THIS PRODUCT IS TO LIGHTEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE WRINKLES FOR A FEW HOURS WHILE WEARING MY MAKEUP. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OLDER PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF WRINKLES THINKING THIS WILL GET RID OF YOUR WRINKLES OR EVEN LIGHTEN THEM UP. THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO START AT A YOUNG AGE APPLYING WRINKLE CREAMS SO YOU WONT GET AS MANY WRINKLES WHEN YOU DO GET OLDER.</li>
    <li> I USE IT EVERY EVE. IT HAS IMPROVED THE LOOK OF MY SKIN. MY SKIN LOOKS FRESHER AND VERY SOFT AND CLEAR.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day &amp; I love it. It works well under makeup &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking ghost white</li>
    <li> Have sued it for several months. Whether it&#x27;s better than any other wrinkle cream, I&#x27;m not sure, but it leaves my skin soft, is not greasy, and works well even under make-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair line for about two years.  The (day) Wrinkle Repair is an excellent product, and it works for me.  The SPF 30 does protect one&#x27;s skin from day to day normal exposures to sunlight. I am in my late sixties and am very happy with the results this product offers. I recommend you use the day and the night creams for a full treatment. Neutrogena is a well respected company with products that suit most everyone&#x27;s needs and skin types.  The Rapid Wrinkle Repair line is another outstanding product from this well known company.</li>
    <li> I used this once and now I have a terrible rash all over my face. If you have sensitive skin (at all, because mine really isn&#x27;t) don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it is great.  It goes on smoothly and blends in easily.  I also like their night product.</li>
    <li> Another overpriced, does nothing product. The cream feels good, but that&#x27;s about it. What&#x27;s up with these horrible perfume fragrances? We&#x27;re trying to get rid of wrinkles, not smell like a cheap you know what... Stop with this!!!!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, does not irritate my skin and it does deliver on decreasing lines, wrinkles and it brightens the skin as well.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me.  It was a waste of money.  Maybe at my age I should not expect much, but I have only a few wrinkles that are not very deep, so I wanted to give it a try.  I am 75 so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be so vain.</li>
    <li> When you use it for the first few times, it may appear that it is giving your skin a new life. But that is where your story ends. After a week, or so, you look darkened, reddened with whatever wrinkles you have looking actually going worse. You may think, there are some 200+ people on Amazon giving it a five star... there must be something in there. But this where you go wrong. The more you use; more breakouts, more scorched your skin would look -a devastation that would be there for all to see. And, in my case, after using it for seven weeks, I was told at work whether I was on a ransacking path for my face that earlier looked bright, fair and healthy. I&#x27;m 45, and I regret using this junk.</li>
    <li> Caused a breakout on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my moisturizer of choice! I&#x27;ve also included the night formula.  I was in retail skincare for years (Lancome, E.Lauder, Arden) and this product is just as good as the higher-end  moisturizers--finally.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it daily...moisturizers my face plus has 30 SPF to protect from the sun. Great product!</li>
    <li> This does make a difference in lessening my wrinkles.  It does a better job with the fine lines than with the deeper lines.  But, it says this in the description of the product.  All in all, it is a good product, and I will continue it&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> No great shakes with this product and there wasn&#x27;t very much of it in the bottle.  Usually my face creams last longer; not sure what happened here. Product didn&#x27;t create any miracles.  Like other products better like aveno</li>
    <li> I read good reviews about this product helping reduce wrinkles, but after one application I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get past the smell.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it has a very unpleasant odor that was present all day. I am not willing to continue with this product because of this issue.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and is a brand I follow due to its low cost and high efficacy.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This product really goes  on smooth and silky and feels really good.  I really like the SPF in it so I don&#x27;t have to use an additional sunscreen.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Is really helping with the wrinkles around my eyes. Only takes a small amount so will last for a long time</li>
    <li> Smells bad.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and brand new, as expected!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it everyday.  Most days don&#x27;t apply any makeup over it.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this product as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks now. At first it caused my skin to burn and turn red for a few minutes after application. I did some research and it sounds like that is normal for retinol creams so I stuck with it. After a couple of weeks my skin adjusted and I no longer feel any discomfort with this. I also use the eye cream and I can see it starting to work on my finer lines.</li>
    <li> It is early to judge .</li>
    <li> It burns the delicate skin around My eyes. There is a pretty strong fragrance. I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a better product</li>
    <li> Used this for a weeks with no results. All it did was make my skin extremely flaky. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> It feels very smooth, moisturizes my skin. doesnt smell good. i like the bottle it comes in. after first week of using everyday,  my skin peeled a little and i felt a  strong sting when applying it. after a few days the pain went away and my skin is nice and smooth. now i just use it mainly for sunscreen and moisturizer before going out or prior to applying my makeup. didnt take away wrinkles though. but was not expecting results being that im always raising my eyebrows. hehe!</li>
    <li> I tried this out based on reviews. Nothing impressive for improving wrinkles, but does work well as facial sunblock. :/</li>
    <li> this item ok i would reorder this itemagain</li>
    <li> Have tried lots of products and this is my go to!  The ONLY one that truly wrinkle reduces, even outs skin tone and hydrates as well. I ignored my skin for a long time and now using it morning and night my face neck and chest look literally a decade younger.  Will never be without it.</li>
    <li> LOVELOVELOVE!  OLD skin, wrinkles, great stuff!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do.  You will notice a difference in the texture of your skin almost immediately.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pleased. This works.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS USE THE NEUTROGENA PRODUCTS. GOOD Quality,</li>
    <li> I recieved the bottle broken so am having to use it without the pump part working. I think this is a problem with whoever sent it. the lotion itself seems fine.</li>
    <li> Nothing has happened yet. There isn&#x27;t even that tight feeling. It&#x27;s just sunscreen. I have plenty of that already.</li>
    <li> Not sure this is exactly as advertised in all the magazines but certainly is what was advertised in the Amazon description and while I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger in 10 days, I didn&#x27;t really expect that to be the case. My skin is very sun damaged so nothing will &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it but this product makes my face soft and supple which is a nice change from the leathery feeling I am used to. I think, over time, it might do a lot more but even in the short time I&#x27;ve used it I can say I will be reordering soon!</li>
    <li> This is the best! It actually works!</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Dose not work.  Waste of $.</li>
    <li> I am 53 and this is my first bottle of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair but it will not be my last. I noticed a difference right away and will continue to use it. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Nice but not very creamy.  Hope it works though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 50+ y.o. nurse and tend to be skeptical about over the counter anti-aging skin products. On occasion when I&#x27;ve given in to my vanity and bought one, I usually have to discontinue it because they give me pimples. The last one I used from Sephora&#x27;s Philosophy, Help Me, didn&#x27;t break me out, but didn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;help\\&quot; either.&lt;br /&gt;Another nurse talked about this product and how much she wanted to try it, but it&#x27;s been sold out at our local pharmacies. When I saw how cheap it was on Amazon, my vanity justified the cost and it came really fast. (Thank you Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now on my face and the back of my hands. I have to say it does seem to be reducing the fine wrinkles. I don&#x27;t really know what \\&quot;brightening my skin&#x27;s tone\\&quot; means...but if it means lightening age spots, ummm not yet.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with redness or irritation. Most impressive, it has not caused me to break out! Now this is a lotion I can be happy with. And at this price, I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> We had seen this product advertised on TV and they said you would notice a big difference in one week. It has been much longer than that and there is no difference whatsoever.There is also not much product in the container, even though it feels heavy.</li>
    <li> I ordered the daytime serum instead of the night version by accident.  I have used the night time version of this with no issues, but this type with sunscreen irritates my skin badly - it burns and turns red.  Neutrogena sunscreen irritates my face, so I am figuring it is the sunscreen causing it.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most sun products, when it gets in my eyes it is like a red hot poker. But not with this stuff. It has a great texture and seems to be lacking the ingredient that blinds me.</li>
    <li> I been using this cream for less than a month.  But I like the texture and I can see a slight difference in my eyes. The small wrinkles around my eyes have decreased. I like the fact that it has spf 30 and retinol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for the last 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed to report Neutrogena&#x27;s website claims of &amp;#34;so effective, every single woman had noticeable results in just 1 week&amp;#34;, does not hold true for me.  This product has not done anything to &amp;#34;fade the look of stubborn deep wrinkles&amp;#34;, which was my goal, and is what their website claims it will do.</li>
    <li> It has delicate odor ,it  smooths the skin and it is absorbed fast .No shiny or oily residue on skin .I am young and I have fair skin and  moderately oily on nose area . I have tried many products such as : L&#x27;Oreal , RoC  and Olay but Neutrogena meets my skin needs .I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I really liked the reviews on this item so thought I would try it. As much as I hoped it would do as promised....after three weeks I see no difference. Fine lines are still visible and disappointed I have seen absolutely no results.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well that I use it all the time for sun block protection in Southern California weather.</li>
    <li> This seems like it is working like advertised.  I have just run out and need more.  Unless my eyes are fooling me It works!</li>
    <li> I used to get a new moisturizer with SPF every month until I found this.  It&#x27;s perfect.  It soaks in nicely, does not irritate my sensitive skin, and plumps up the fine lines.  I have been using it for over a year now.  My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Years ago, my mothers advised me to use retinol for wrinkles.  She was right!  This is the best over-the counter retinol product I&#x27;ve tried, and I especially noticed an improvement in the neck area.  I&#x27;ve only used the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, SPF 30 for a few weeks, and I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;m going to purchase the serum, next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked. On my 2nd bottle now and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever give it up. It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my skin tone and wrinkles. I&#x27;m thinking of adding the night cream to my regime.</li>
    <li> The product seems like it works well, but the fragrance is so overwhelming that it made my eyes water constantly. The hypoallergenic Neutrogena product is much better.</li>
    <li> Love it. The product is simply amazing. It helps in wrinkle reduction and has an SPF. What more can one ask for. Price wise, I think they can do a little better but then product quality speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;m about to turn 40 and live in a sunny climate so it&#x27;s important to me to take great care of my skin. However, I have extremely sensitive skin so finding a great moisturizer has always been a challenge. This summer I was noticing more lines around my eyes, and sun spots on my forehead and nose. After using this product for just a week I noticed my skin was brighter and healthier looking, and it seemed to reduce the sun spots a bit. The SPF 30 is a fantastic feature and I apply generously on my face, neck and chest area before applying my makeup (sometimes also to the backs of my hands). I&#x27;ve recently starting using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair EYE cream at bedtime and in the morning, in addition to the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair NIGHT cream. Using all 3 products together I do see a difference in my skin and love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My wrinkles are not as deep as they were before using. Will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use the prescription strength retinol without serious breakouts, so I tried this product.  I&#x27;m so glad I did, it&#x27;s gentle enough for every night and very effective.  It has reduced the appearance of the lines on my neck and upper lip.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results and the price.</li>
    <li> I did notice a bit of difference when using this in regards to some complexion but nothing for my lines at all. I read good reviews so was really hoping for a slight difference with those but didn&#x27;t get it</li>
    <li> The product matches the description.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin over the past month. I use this as a daily moisturizer and it works great. Be careful around the eyes, though.</li>
    <li> A gift for my sister - she loves it!</li>
    <li> great product.  Used for a long time.  Purchase from Amazon due to price.</li>
    <li> disliked the dispenser- ,After a few use It  would clog and very difficult to use.  Secondly, I discolored three sweaters on the cuff before realizing it was the fault of the product and not our laundry service, THE RESULTS WERE GOOD- NO PROBLEM THERE</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for my husband.  he puts it on at night and it smells good and his face looks so shiny and dewy.  Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> What I like about this product is that it has UVA and UVB protection, against aging and burning rays from the poisonous sun (spf 30), plus it also contains retinol !&lt;br /&gt;I apply every morning and every night.  I am 53 years old, and have almost flawless skin.  I have never worn foundation.  I am fair skinned, blonde hair blue eyes, and have no brown spots, discoloration at all. My parents would not allow me to sunbathe when I was a kid,&lt;br /&gt;and I am reaping those benefits now.  I have worn sunscreen my entire life, 365 days per year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products before and have not been disappointed with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase this since everyone thinks you got to pay more to get the good stuff right?&lt;br /&gt;Not really, this product starts working the 1st time you put it on and it feels and looks to do what it claims!</li>
    <li> I really like the Neutrogena products because they are usually lightweight and not as oily as other brands.  This particular product I was less pleased with simply because it is oilier than the other Neutorgena daily moisturizing products with SPF that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I was sold on the ROC products, but this seems to do a better job. Of course, don&#x27;t expect a serious change in a couple of weeks - been using it for 2 or 3 mos. now and can definitely tell a difference, especially around my mouth and laugh line areas. I&#x27;ve been using it only at night under a night lifting cream extended down to my neck and can see an overall improvement on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This must be made for younger people.  Not enough moisture for mature skin!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lotion.  Olay Reginerist works better for me.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hopes were to high but I didn&#x27;t see a lot of improvement in the wrinkles I have. It did make my skin soft &amp; didn&#x27;t have any problems with break outs or anything. Not sure I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it was awful. It made my skin itchy, flaky and red. I gave it a 2nd try a couple of days later, with the same bad results after using my regular moisturizer &amp;#34;Oil of Olay&amp;#34; that I love - so my skin would recover.  I had to throw it away since it&#x27;s shelf life EXPIRED 12/13 which I feel is a short time since I only ordered it in August. There is no way I would ever use it again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, but didn&#x27;t realize it would have such a perfume-type scent.  Being extremely sensitive to smell, as are several of my friends, I try to get products that have little or no added scent.  This product seems like it would be great, otherwise, so I&#x27;ll give it to a friend to use.  I do love the idea of the SPF 30 and the retinol.</li>
    <li> It has a really nice scent and goes on my face really nicely, however after just a couple of days of using this I started breaking out. I have really sensitive skin to begin with, and it gets very dry in the winter. But I do not break out much anymore and after I used this it was like I was back in the 7th grade again. Again, really liked the scent but this is not for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it works to reduce wrinkles or not but I don&#x27;t recommend this lotion if you have oily/combination skin.  I have combination skin and this lotion makes my t-zone oily and greasy in a few hours.  It feels dry when you put it on but it somehow releases oil and makes my skin look very shiny.</li>
    <li> Great product, my skin loves it</li>
    <li> This contains a dangerous ingredient, acrylates. Acrylates were names allergen of the year in 2012 because it is a sensitizer (meaning that once you reach a certain exposure level you will become allergic to it)! Yet, these company&#x27;s continue to use it. I had all the skin peel off my hands and a horrible rash that felt like hundreds of mosquito bites on top of an acid burn! Not not use this or any other product that contain acrylates in any form!</li>
    <li> I am 59 years old and live in the dry southwest so daily use of good body and face moisturizers are important.  I have tried a number of different facial moisturizers starting in my early 40&#x27;s - most promising to make me look years younger.  None of them do including this product.  I have seen no visible difference after using this for about 6 months - the last couple both morning and night.  I am not, nor have ever been, a smoker nor tanner and have taken otherwise good care of myself so I&#x27;m OK with how my skin looks - slight crows feet and wrinkles under the eyes and on forehead - but I&#x27;m always willing to try something new.  I do like the smooth, non-greasy texture of the lotion, the higher SPF, the opaque bottle to protect ingredients from light and the locking cap to keep out the air, plus the ingredients Retinol Sa and Hyaluronic Acid which seem to be universally acknowledged by the experts to be beneficial to the skin so I am continuing to use it trusting in the long term benefits.  The size and weight of the bottle is deceiving as it is only 1 ounce and I ran out of my first bottle much quicker than I expected.  I like this product enough to sign up for the subscription service so I don&#x27;t run out again and with the additional savings I feel it is a extra good value.</li>
    <li> Dont doupt to use this product , its really helpfull to make your skin healthy, brighter, and younger look.highly recomended .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet (I&#x27;m in my early 30s), but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to start early. So I can&#x27;t say if that aspect of the lotion works. I like the light texture of this lotion, not thick at all, absorbs quickly. My skin always looks better after using a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t really see much improvement of my skin though. It&#x27;s just a nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product and whenever I can get a good price I go for it.  It is not greasy (which I hate), it absorbs immediately and easily (which I love) - plus it provides the 30 SPF that my dermatologist requires.  It provides the same benefit and outcome as products twice plus the price, so for me it is good value.</li>
    <li> Feels so nice.  Glides onto my skin smoothly.  Delicate scent.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t smell or feel like a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works good</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to women 40+, it makes your skin look younger and moisturizes all day.  I&#x27;m outside most of the day and this product keeps my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff especially for the price. My husband stole my bottle. I did however like the results better from ROC</li>
    <li> I use it everyday; Neutrogena, is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I was afraid it would make me break out, instead it did the opposite. I Had two pretty large blemishes when I started using it and in 24 hours they had shrunk down to nothing which has never happened with any acne product i&#x27;ve tried before. I bought it for the retinol and decided on the one with sunscreen since every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried I have hated and thrown away. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found a sunscreen I can use and the retinol part of it is a bonus my skin has never looked this good just bought my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Use it everyday and can really see a differences.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I did see results within 10 days. A visible difference if I stop using it. For my skin, it works.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a week before I noticed that my skin started peeling and I ended up with a lot of redness and blotchy skin. I actually ended up with a rash around my mouth, notice and under my eyes. I would never use retinol around my eyes, since I use it daily for acne, but this stuff was worse than the retinol cream my own dermatologist gives me. My regular cream never gave me a rash before, so I was astonished it happened at all. Like I said, I would NEVER use retinol around my eyes, but I didn&#x27;t realize at first that this product even HAD retinol in it, until I noticed dry, peeling skin and a rash around my eyes. It actually made my wrinkles around my eyes and mouth WORSE!! Augh!!! Never again!!</li>
    <li> I love the night cream...it moisturizes well and I love the smell.  It has a light scent, very fresh right before bed.  I want to say it works well on wrinkles but I truly cannot tell.&lt;br /&gt;However, the day cream I do not like at all.  The pro is the scent...it does not have that spf lotion smell like most moisturizes with the spf.  The con...it does not moisturize; it leaves my face very dry during the day.  I find no point in even using a the product; It feels like I am putting a scented water on my face.  I will continue using the night cream, but I will need to find a new day cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Skin is very smooth and it does help the wrinkles. The best part is how soft it makes your face and adds radiance!</li>
    <li> Thanks to both of my parents I have great skin. Some fine lines around my eyes...nothing to complain too much about.&lt;br /&gt;I related 100percent to their claim of if a product doesn&#x27;t work fast it ends up in pile of products that only produce empty promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair is in the heap of empty promises.  I wanted this to work...</li>
    <li> Love this product! Need the sunscreen benefit without the heaviness.</li>
    <li> Like the product. Skin feels nice. Difficult to tell if it is reducing my wrinkles but I feel better. Will order again</li>
    <li> Only been using for a week as of 8/30 but I love this !!! I really thjnk it is already improving the look of my skin</li>
    <li> Love it was selling Mary Kay, this is a great product, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Maybe needed more time with this but wouldn&#x27;t mind buying it again.</li>
    <li> Discontinued item and my pet peeve is sellers take advantage of that fact....</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale at CVS and the night cream is so strong smelling that I had to wash it off in order to sleep. Disappointing and unexpected in a Neutrogena product. I tossed it.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or dry. It is not thick nor sticky and it seems to be working for me. I have only used it for 4 days but I have already noticed a differece (in my forehead \\&quot;worry\\&quot; lines- they seem to be getting less noticeable). The price is great too! And it was shipped fast so I am super happy! I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old African American female with carmel colored skin.  I bought this product at my local drug store and have been using now for about two weeks.  I had about three set of wrinkles under my eyes, laugh lines around my mouth and one line above my forehead that was from eye brow to eye brow.  I can truly say this really works.  The lines under my eyes are shorter and it appears that I can only see two lines now instead of three, the line on my forehead is barely noticeable and the laugh lines are about 50% gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear foundation; however, I wear concealer, eye liner and mascara.  I apply the repair cream before I leave for work and at night after I wash my face.  Because my face requires a little more moisture, I apply the repair cream in the evening with olive and shea oil body butter (this product is rather light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier.  This is now my staple.  If this product can make this much of a difference in two weeks, I cannot imagine what it will do if I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - August 30, 2012 - I have now been using this product for a couple of months and I must say it is AMAZING!  The line on my forehead is gone.  The lines under my eyes are now down to one and half.  My laugh lines are just about gone!  One other thing I noticed is the dark circles under my eyes are diminishing as well.  This is something I have lived with my entire life!  I became aware of the reduction when I started using less concealer each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I had taken before and after pictures to show you how great this product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO, if you have had wrinkles or lines for awhile, it will take a while to work.  My recommendation is don&#x27;t give up.  I thought it was not working on the laugh lines around my mouth but they are diminishing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT product!  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I was impressed with some of the reviews. However, it did nothing for me but make my face extremely oily, especially first thing in the morning. It seemed like it didn&#x27;t soak into my skin. I feel like I gave this product a fair try but after a couple of months of use I saw no changes except very oily skin. This may work for some but it sure didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since it was released to the public.  At 81 years old most people take me to be younger because my skin is smooth, not wrinkle free but neither are the wrinkles the first thing you see.  My forehead is smooth and free of wrinkles, as are the eyes.  I retain creases around the nose area as they are very deep and my cheeks have sunk a bit - the fat went south.  I credit Neutrogena for keeping me looking as good as I do and plan to continue using daily.&lt;br /&gt;  J.!</li>
    <li> I got this product with high hopes. I had two problems. The first is that  where I used it had a very bad burning sensation after two uses (in two days) and I was unable to continue treatment. It was just too painful. For days afterword, every time I put moisturizing cream on my face, it would burn and my face would turn red like I had sunburn. The second problem I had was just after two uses I noticed that I had acquired many more fine lines than I had had two days previously. The fine lines I had before using this product were deeper and more defined. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have you this once and have already noticed a difference in my skin. I have been struggling to use Retin A cream for the last 6 months. I have somewhat oily skin but for some reason I couldn&#x27;t stop flaking and peeling each time I used it. As the same time, I didn&#x27;t want to give up on the anti-aging properties of Retinoids/Retinols so I thought I would give this a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very light and thin and feels velvety against your skin. Ladies who have an issue with shine, will not have to worry about this making you shinier or glossy looking like so many other moisturizers with spf. I did go ahead and use a little more mineral spf that I typically use just because I am on the cautious side. But for those wont want to simplify your routine, this stuff is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way my skin felt after using it. It feels very soft and my skin seems to already have a better texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this as a I go!</li>
    <li> Magic! Wish it had a higher spf.  I started using this. I really like it. I am seeing a softening of my fine lines, and was so happy to see it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.  I live in a sunny area so I wish it had a higher spf so I purchased their 70spf liquid to use in addition</li>
    <li> It was okay, but did not see any noticeable improvement in skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this because if it&#x27;s high ratings in good housekeeping magazine and I love it! My face is so smooth even my makeup goes on better. I&#x27;ve had 2 people ask me why I look younger. No joke!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the Rapid Wrinkle Repair products, both the night and the day creams, having fallen for the T.V. ads, but neither moisturizes enough by itself. I like the fact that the day cream has a high SPF ingredient but I have to put my regular moisturizer on top of it. I like the Neutrogena Ageless Intensive products better.</li>
    <li> This may be a great product in the end but I would rather not have my face feels like it is burning off. Horrible experience.  I&#x27;ll keep my crows feet!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time as a moisturizer under my make-up foundation.  I like it because it is non-greasy and provides a 30 SPF sunscreen. In addition it has received high ratings for it&#x27;s ability to repair wrinkles.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I did get a slight burning in the begining, so I started putting it on every other day, the burning stopped and the peeling stopped, I noticed with in a week my fine lines looked a lot better, I just looked well rested, which I have insomnia! So it was nice to at least I look rested!! I will be 47 this Sept., I have been told I don&#x27;t look a day over 30! Which is very nice to hear.. :) I think some has to do with your genes, my mom looks youthful too. But this stuff really helps with my wrinkles! And at a great price it&#x27;s woeth a try! It doesn&#x27;t have to cost a lot for something to work, I think we think you have to spend a fortune for something to work, in this case no you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot to have it work and actually see results!</li>
    <li> received in good shape</li>
    <li> Really like this product, to early to see much difference!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Be sure to thoroughly massage it into your skin, not just lightly rub it onto the surface. Otherwise you are likely to be disappointed in the results.  If you discipline yourself to use it every morning and every evening before you go to bed, you&#x27;ll see slow but steady improvement in your wrinkles and fine lines.  Give it a few months to make a difference!</li>
    <li> Really works and Neutrogena products are #1 with me and my face. It&#x27;s all that I use.</li>
    <li> Best anti-wrinkle cream in the world! You can get it at Wal-Mart too, but Amazon has the lower price. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to reduce the look of their wrinkles. I saw a visible difference, especially in my neck region, within just one week of use. I keep a steady supply of it on hand!</li>
    <li> I have always been a huge fan of Neutrogena products, and the Rapid Wrinkle Repair did not disappoint.  May I also recommend that you try the Neutrogena Wet Skin and Ultra Sheer sunscreen products.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> This works really well!</li>
    <li> It works. I have the photos to prove it.  It improved the fine lines on my forehead in 2 weeks.  It does not clear the deep ones - don&#x27;t be fooled by false promises - but it defintely made a difference. I suggest taking a picture at the beginning and then 2 weeks later, 2 weeks after that and so on.&lt;br /&gt;this price is also THE CHEAPEST anywhere. Walgreens wants twice as much. Even cheaper than walmart.</li>
    <li> Bought this on the off-chance it might make a difference in the appearance of the wrinkles on my face.  I have used it faithfully every day, and believe I am beginning to see more life to my complexion, and maybe even some improvement as far as the wrinkles are concerned.  Whatever, I AM pleased with this purchase and will purchase more then this runs out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this cream works, but it makes me feel as though it does.  It&#x27;s does not apply very smoothly, but it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.  Hoping it keeps the wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> I am only 28, but I believe that prevention is key.  I was starting to get (very) fine lines around my eyes and in my forehead, and after using this for a few weeks, they are gone.  I will probably use this product forever.  This is my day lotion, and my night lotion is Neutrogena anti-wrinkle anti-blemish and Murad complete reform.  I will say that if you don&#x27;t use something with retinol already, you may want to start out using this lotion on a weekend (and every other day) until your skin is acclimated to the retinol.  It did make my face red for the first day, but I expected that--it means it&#x27;s working!!!  My only complaint about the product is that the bottle is heavily weighted, so it is impossible to tell when you are running low on product until it is gone.</li>
    <li> I had to be careful not to use this everyday because my sking would peel.  Other than that, my skin looked and felt smoother but, didn&#x27;t see a change in the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I am a 51 year old woman that admittedly, have been lax about my skin care.  Recently, I began developing deep wrinkles (lines that can be seen when my face is &#x27;at rest&#x27;.) and began doing some research and seek recommendations on affordable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first morning I used this, I was shocked.  The lines on my forehead were visably reduced... to the degree, I stared in the mirror and exclaimed, &amp;#34;No way!&amp;#34;  Please do not think this is a miracle product.  But it did reduce the appearance of my deeper lines.  The following day, I used my &#x27;old&#x27; product just to see if this was my imagination.  It wasn&#x27;t.  I threw my old product in the trash (it was almost gone anyway), cleaned my face and applied the Rapid Wrinkle Repair.  YES! My forehead plumped slightly and the deeper wrinkles appeared lighter.  I have been using it daily and I am very pleased.  I still have wrinkles but overall, this product smooths them out and evens my skin tone out visibly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and works well under my foundation.  For a inexpensive brand - nothing has worked this well for me.  I would be willing to pay a lot more for something that actually makes my skin look better - but for 15.00, I don&#x27;t have to pay more.  With the money I am saving on my daily moisturizer, I can (and do!) &#x27;splurge&#x27; on a higher-end under eye cream and glycolic pads to supplement my full skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I love this formula, however, it seemed like I ran out of it much sooner than I normally do (I bought this before at another retail store and therefore was able to compare.)  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this again unless the price was cut in half, because that&#x27;s all I felt I got in this bottle, half.</li>
    <li> Is a great SPF 30, Thank you</li>
    <li> Definitely hope in a jar!  This didn&#x27;t work at all after several weeks.  It has an awful chemical odor also.</li>
    <li> My husband made the comment - your face looks so good.  I am a user now for life!</li>
    <li> No changes and not very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and continually surprise people because they think I&#x27;m early 20s.  I&#x27;ve used retinoid creams since I was 22.  Over the years I tried a lot of other retinoid creams at a variety of price ranges, but I always kept coming back to my go-to product. Nothing worked better.  Until Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I started working out more regularly and lost about 10lbs. I noticed super fine lines around my eyes and mouth and loose facial skin that I had never seen before. I was very disappointed. On one hand I was thinner, but on the other I looked older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was determined that if I could find something to improve, or at least prevent anything from getting worse, I&#x27;d be willing to spend just about whatever it took.  After doing some research and crossing off all the other previous products I had tried, this was my first stop. (I figured I&#x27;d start on the low pricing end.) I didn&#x27;t have high hopes. For 8 years I had dabbled with a lot of other &#x27;Miracle&#x27; products - including most of those sold at home parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG I HAD NO IDEA!  I&#x27;ve used the product for about a week now. The first thing I noticed was that my skin felt tighter (all day and night) and smoother.  I was already accustomed to smooth skin, and this was smoother.  Some products make your skin feel tighter, but it&#x27;s temporary. This stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, within the past few days, I noticed my super fine lines were less noticeable. When I took a closer look at my eye and mouth area, I realized that my skin had tightened to the point that it was no longer drooping. I had no idea it was drooping in the first place! It had happened so gradually that only when it reversed, did I see what had happened. I&#x27;m seriously in a state of shock as I type this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I&#x27;m a photographer so I stare at people&#x27;s faces zoomed in to 100% and get paid to remove blemishes. So, I think I saw the signs on my face before the average person would. But from that same photographer perspective, it&#x27;s like my skin reversed itself about 10 years. Again, this is skin that was accustomed to anti-aging moisturizers already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it worked so well, that my only concern is that there might be some long-term adverse side effects. Normally when something seems too good to be true, it is. I&#x27;m praying that&#x27;s not the case. In the meantime, I feel like I gained another 10 years of youth.

    <li> Repeat purchase,  continues to work as described.</li>
    <li> Last winter I concluded I&#x27;d inherited my grandmother&#x27;s wrinkles in addition to her sunny disposition. Yet it seemed a little premature so I decided to see what could be done about it. Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair pushed back the clock at least five years. A bottle doesn&#x27;t last long, but I suspect I&#x27;ll be a regular purchaser.</li>
    <li> I love neutrogena product and this is so much cheaper to buy it from amazon than to buy it in the store I save so much with my prime membership.  I buy a lot from amazon because of my prime membership.  I have been using this a long time and I really do like it.</li>
    <li> Used this on old skin , helped clear spots</li>
    <li> Burns my skin and sad that I cannot return it.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again and again. It is clearly exfoliating my skin without my having to use anything with sand or nutshells in it or any of those barbarous  gloves!</li>
    <li> Second bottle of this product....really see a difference in the fine wrinkle lines on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Works as well for me as prescription creams at a qt. of the cost.</li>
    <li> Burned my face. Got a red rash after only using it twice. Rash seems to be getting worse even with discontinuing use of the product. Wish I had never purchased it.</li>
    <li> Like the lotion but I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Used by my wife and she likes it.</li>
    <li> It states on the bottle it&#x27;s nothing more than a sun screen not a wrinkle repair.  Not sure why that is.  It does moisturize very nicely.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this before...can&#x27;t say if it reduced wrinkles but I&#x27;m going to keep using it. All neutrogena products are awesome!</li>
    <li> Not really noticing much difference, and this is not a cheap product. May be worth a try for some folks. Can be very drying, tho. Use regular skin lotion as well, is my suggestion.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth especially considering the 30spf.  Makes your face feel really soft.  Do I think that it will make you look you look years younger, probably no more or less than any other cream and definitely not \\&quot;rapid\\&quot;.  I will continue to use it if not just for the 30spf</li>
    <li> This stuff works probably equally as well as super expensive products I have been using. I was trying to find a drug store equivalent for less money and this is it - great for getting rid of those little fine lines that might start popping up and moisturizes well (I have dry skin).</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and the night time tone repair two weeks ago.  I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, and I haven&#x27;t gotten them.  I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles for 53 but I do have a few.  My skin is supple but i can see no progress with this lotion.  I did have a bad experience with it however the first week.  I used it in my under eye area and it pulled the skin so tight that it accentuated the wrinkles that i do have there tenfold.  This makes me a little leary to try the eye cream now.  After a week of over moisturizing that area it&#x27;s finally getting back to where it was.  It&#x27;s a nice lotion but like the old saying if itsounds  too good to be true....</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product ---- use before bed and right after a shower and you will see a major difference.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions and you will get results .... don&#x27;t skip days or nights and don&#x27;t skimp when you use it . massage gently . don&#x27;t stretch your skin .. massage into the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Use a primer over it and under makeup and you will have smoother healthier looking skin. ALSO DRINK LOTS OF WATER AND THAT WILL HELP YOUR SKIN TO LOOK ITS BEST!</li>
    <li> One of the better anti-wrinkle products.  Great service.  And this product is much more reasonably priced than many that don&#x27;t perform any better.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.. it has a perfect SPF level for daytime wear and smells nice. I was surprised it came in a glass bottle and disappointed when I ran out. I wish there was a bigger size!</li>
    <li> Since it is almost over with the Winter time , I am in process of refreshing my skin after the heat seaon that dry out my skin to much , this product is great, I can see result in 2 days of usage, I don;t have any wrinkles but have some fine lines on my forehead and really dry skin , what this product do it releasing the death already cells from the skin , that why some of the users noticed the ( peeling effect) what is GOOD sign , this mean it is working and penetrating your old skin losing the cells , if you keep using the skin will refresh itself to the new layer , it is like with the peeling but gentle without harsh chemicals , this product include also acid that plump the skin , I feel little tingling on my face all day as it is the plumping effect , it make the skin looks little pinkish but a healthy color not burned radish , if your skin is still young ( after 25 ) use every 3-4 days if you need it only if over 40 then you can use it more often , it depend of the condition of your skin surface and the build up of the death skin cells ( that are the main wrinkle formation causes rather than the age ) .&lt;br /&gt;For example I don;t use anything in the summer time sine New York can have a lot of humid and my skin looking always nice in summer not even need any creams at all beside some screens against the sun but winter is different and after the long months of putting the all hydration creams with the chemicals it starting to build up until it start to peel not matter how much I care, it is like the change of the fur in spring by the animals I believe our skin do the same refreshing itself slowly after the dark months of winter .  And remember, wrinkles have nothing to do with age , it have to do with the mimic of your face and the condition you living in and how you care , as you noticed people in tropical areas have much better looking skin at later ages since the skin is always hydrated by the humid from the air .  But going back to our wonder product , yes it working , smoothing the skin and I love it ! and at the end I would add something funny, when I look on my right fingers they looking so different from my left fingers , they look more bright and the papillary lines are minder visible .. that are the finger I apply the cream on my face .. do I need more prof ? it tell a lotorking , smoothing the skin and I love it ! and at the end I would add something funny, when I look on my right fingers they looking so different from my left fingers , they look more bright and the papillary lines are minder visible .. that are the finger I apply the cream on my face .. do I need more prof ? it tell a lot</li>
    <li> I most definitely did not like this product. It left my face feeling gritty even after washing my face the next day it still felt gritty. I have used a whole tube faithfully and didn&#x27;t see 1 bit of wrinkle repair, or any difference at all.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I use and would not change for the world.  Recommend this to everyone. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT IS SUPPOSE TO DO. AFTER 1 WEEK 2 TIMES A DAY SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE..NOT SURE IF I WILL CONTINUE</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like it says the best product is ageless continuous hydration eye cream by Neutrogena bring it back</li>
    <li> For years, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s SPF 30 anti-wrinkle cream, but as I hit my mid-fifties, I decided that it was time for something stronger.  Because most people think I&#x27;m much younger than I am, I decided to stick with Neutrogena and its results.  The Rapid Wrinkle Repair is an awesome product -- no burning or redness with a strong Retinol percentage that contributes to rapid skin renewal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I didn&#x27;t see results as dramatic as some reviewers -- and that may have been because I was already using a Retinol product -- the Rapid Wrinkle Repair did improve the look of my skin, lessening fine lines and making it look overall more healthy.  You have to keep using this product, however, since your skin will look dull and lines will reappear over time.  This product works by hastening rejuvenation (and protecting your skin from damaging UV rays) of skin cells.  Basically, you have newer skin cells near the surface than you do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who have never used a Retinol product may experience temporary breakouts or sensitive skin at first, but those symptoms generally disappear after a week or so and never return -- unless you stop using the product for a while.  The price is right, too, especially for something that works this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> i usually love their products but I feel like that this is making my skin more wrinkled !  I have sensitive skin so maybe it&#x27;s just too harsh for me.</li>
    <li> Have used this for many years.  Works ok.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s all the buzz?  I&#x27;ve consistently used this product for 2 months.  It did nothing but break out my face.  When will I ever learn?</li>
    <li> this product made my under eyes and the corner of my eyes red and very irritated. I then started to peel. it was horrible.  I saw no results just severe skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older woman but don&#x27;t have bad wrinkle problems yet.  This product seems to work pretty well for me as far as the fine lines near the eyes and I also like the sunscreen factor.  Also seems to be fading some sun spots over the time I have used.  I am on my second bottle.  Overall I like and would recommend but don&#x27;t think it would work as well for deeper wrinkles.</li>
    <li> great reviews from others - hope it works for me too!</li>
    <li> A great way to hydrate my wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
    <li> Softened skin, but not a big help too my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> WORKS!!!!  Plus the SPF is high and doesn&#x27;t make your face whiteish like others.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year.  I really like it.  I&#x27;m 60 and people tell me that I look like I&#x27;m 35.  I really only have a few tiny wrinkles.  I use both the night and day products and they are doing their job. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Well folks, the wrinkles are still there but will continue to use this cream and hope a miracle takes place!!! I use the Neutrogena Rapid Tone repair too and I am still waiting for that to kick in - LOL!!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. I&#x27;m 29 and noticing more fine lines around my eyes and mouth. Also have a few deep wrinkles between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;After using it consistently for about a month, the lines around my eyes and mouth have improved. My skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t do much for the Chasm of Disapproval between my eyebrows, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much there.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used it, I did notice a bit of tingly/ warmth, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. Its a bit heavy on my skin, but I feel like that with any product containing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m quite happy and will ordering more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Neutrogena products and I have had dermatologist who recommend the product.  It does a nice job on the fine lines and minimizes the rest.  I use this with Alina, a vitamin C product, and have noticed a significant change.  I use the Neutrogena in the morning and the Alina at bedtime.  .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nor last long</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months now. I purchased it prior to our vacation in Florida where we enjoyed the beach and sun everyday.  Being in my mid sixties, yes I have wrinkles. I have always used department store beauty products so my skin is nice for my age, however I still desire to take good care of it. While looking for a vitamin C product, I came across this. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase it. Focusing on my wrinkles first, then applying to my entire face, I am very pleased with this product!  It was the only sunscreen I used on my face while on vacation. It was perfect!  I have noticed that my wrinkles have softened. Compared to all of the layering of serums and other products on my face, now I am only using a Vitamin C serum and this product twice a day.  The results are lovely......my husband even noticed!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> As I approach the final year of my first half century (yes I turn 50 this year!!) I noticed wrinkles and lines that weren&#x27;t there before.  Where is that young sixteen year old that lives in my head?  It is such a shock to look in the mirror and see someone else staring back at me.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product advertised and thought I try it about two years ago as I prepared to graduate with my Bachelor&#x27;s.  After about a week I noticed fresher looking skin despite the stress of finishing up school.  I look at the photos taken at graduation ceremonies and don&#x27;t notice lines, only see fresh looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a while and turned to another expensive product.  It simply didn&#x27;t work as well as this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The built in SPF makes protection application easy, just a few drops in the morning and off I go.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light, which I appreciate.  The price is fantastic and Amazon delivers right to my door.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle repair w/ SPF 30 for over a year.  It is easy to apply, prevents sunburn &amp; additional wrinkles.  It didn&#x27;t erase the ones I have.</li>
    <li> Ha.  No such  thing as wrinkle repair.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing and sun protection is a bonus</li>
    <li> does not diminish wrinkles yet alone take them away. normally i love all neutogena products if they do what they say they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> i never really saw a difference and i used it every day until it was gone</li>
    <li> Although hype for wrinkle creams in general are mostly just that, I do find improvement in my facial skin.  No one has mentioned it to me that they see it, too, but if and when they do I would be able to give a more comprehensive  evaluation.  I am 81 and I will accept any improvement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40, fair-skinned, and beginning to get some creases under my eyes.  I bought this hoping it would erase some of the finer wrinkles.  Instead, it made them much, much more noticable and even gave me new wrinkles.  As others have stated here, it caused my skin to lose elasticity and seemingly \\&quot;bunch up\\&quot; under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give it a month or so before I gave a review to honestly know how well this product works. I think my skin looks better then ever! And my mother complimented me the other day and asked what makeup or skin care I was using because my skin looked so good to her lately. I havent changed anything other than using this new product.</li>
    <li> Only just started to use it, cannot wait to see results</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT THIS BECAUSE SAW IT ON TV AND THE REVIEW WAS OK. I HAVE USED IT FOR OVER A WEEK, SEEMS LIKE ITS WORKING. MY SKIN LOOKS AND FEELS GREAT.I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.BUT THIS HASN;T HURT MY FACE AT ALL.I WILL BUY MORE.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rather dry on my face after a short time, and I have seen no difference at all in any wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I received this about 10 days ago and I am very pleased.  It works on the wrinkles and has a sunscreen.  A sunscreen in this day and age is a must.  The moisturizer I had been using has been discontinued, Olay Definity, but it was a blessing is disquise.  This is a much more superior product and I am very pleased with the results.  I will now look to buy the complete line.</li>
    <li> Been using it over 3 months with the Vitamin C serum and there is no difference whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Great product! Does what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but after one week my \\&quot;furrowed brow\\&quot; lines, my crow&#x27;s feet, and my laugh lines were greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Now these wrinkles are barely detectable. I use it *every day*and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;This works better than wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve used that cost upwards of $100.00. I love it!</li>
    <li> The product seems to do as advertised, but it has a bad smell to it (the same nasty scent as many Neutrogena lotions....to me it smells too masculine and its nauseating). For that reason alone I had to stop using it because of allergy headaches. I wish Neutrogena would create unscented products for those allergic to scents, because I really love their skincare products :(</li>
    <li> I purchased the Night, Daytime w/SPF, and the eye treatment...all three of the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair products.  I used it exactly as directed on the packaging.  I noticed some improvement in wrinkles and minor sagging at the jawline in about a week, so I planned to continue use.  However, these products have been very drying to my skin, causing peeling and flaking and some minor irritation.[[ASIN:B004D2C57M Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30, 1 Fl. Oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I emailed neutrogena.com for assistance as I wanted to know if they suggested using one of their moisturizers on top of this product.  Zero help.  They said to call the 800 number and talk to a specialist.  I called and the \\&quot;specialist\\&quot; kept referring to the wrong product and after 15+ minutes of corralling her back to the correct product, she clearly was no help whatsoever.  This was a colossal waste of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed back on the same reply to tell them I got zero help and they said they would forward it to their \\&quot;Consumer Care Center\\&quot;.  Here is what I got back:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for your interest in Neutrogena Corporation.  We appreciate the time you have taken to contact us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Corporation safe and effective when used  according to directions on the package label.  However, if you have any health concerns we recommend you speak to your healthcare professional, as they are familiar with  your personal medical history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Latasha C.&lt;br /&gt;Consumer Care Center\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this shameful.  Nobody in their team of specialists can answer this simple question?  WOW.  Nevermind they say \\&quot;Neutrogena Corporation safe and effective\\&quot;.  They don&#x27;t even refer to the product either!  I&#x27;m so disappointed in Neutrogena, I&#x27;m going to switch to either L&#x27;Oreal or Olay.  I never considered the fact that their product causing my skin to dry out was actually a health problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also be preparing these three products for a return.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is great, and I love that it&#x27;s 30 spf over the often 15 in many products I&#x27;ve purchased. However, it&#x27;s the packaging that leaves a bit to be desired. Because the bottle is so heavy, it&#x27;s difficult to tell how much is left. Also, it&#x27;s so much added weight in your bag. It seems like a silly complaint, and I guess it is, but when with my back I try to pack as light and practically as I can. The product itself is great though.</li>
    <li> Another one that goes where all the other wrinkle products have gone.</li>
    <li> Like so many others, I had to give this a try due to the claims on the packaging. I tried the full product line for 2 months, absolutely NO results. Much like when a shoe breaks in, once those creases are in the material they&#x27;re there for good. Same thing with your face. Don&#x27;t bother with any of these products. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very strong perfume odor! Beware if you are sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old and have used this product on my face for the past 3 years...I love it...I personally think that I haven&#x27;t gotten any more wrinkles than I already had, because of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair.  The wrinkles I had, have become a lot softer.  Above all the product it&#x27;s not greasy...</li>
    <li> Have you seen the comercials? You know the ones with the prestige container of cream gone and the question is asked if your wrinkles disappeared with the product? Pretty bold claim! Well I did see it an decided to try since I trust neutrogena products. I was first impressed with the smell. I actually enjoy the smell going onto my skin. It also has a great feel. I could easily be persuaded by scent and texture to buy a product and keep buying it(my two weaknesses (feel and smell). I am writing this only because I also think this product actually dilivers on its claim to soften/reduce wrinkles. I won&#x27;t waste my time writing a review if it is only ok and smells nice and feels nice. I want this product to be around a long time so I am encouraging others to try it and buy it here on Amazon. WM and Trgt are $5ish more still worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;My stats: 49yo, fair skin, (used to have)deep wrinkles between the brows and on the bridge of my nose. Age spots, rarely get pimples but have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this very long but it feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using  and his skin it looking great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 of these and have not noticed much, if any, of a change. Maybe my wrinkles are what was called B.E.R. at the manufacturing company I worked at, which stood for Beyond Economical Repair, when we were disposing of old equipment that wasn&#x27;t worth fixing or couldn&#x27;t be..  I may try another, but was hoping for better.</li>
    <li> Leaves our skin smooth but does absolutely nothing for wrinkles....I&#x27;m going back to applying virgin coconut oil to my face and doing face exercises, it got me better results than any cream!</li>
    <li> Pros:  Light, quickly absorbed, has SPF 30, makes skin feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  No visible wrinkle reduction after one month use, but then I don&#x27;t have a lot to begin with :-).  Doesn&#x27;t help with fading some dark spots either.&lt;br /&gt;In general I have been using it daily for a month and think it&#x27;s a good moisturizer even though it&#x27;s no miracle.  Will keep using it until I find a better one.</li>
    <li> I notice the lines on my head are less promenant. Also, its lightweight on the face and provides SPF 30. This is great for everyday use. I would definetly recomment it. BUY IT but dont expect botox results. :)</li>
    <li> I am 41 and this produce made my wrinkles 10x worse.  I barely had any wrinkles before using this product.  It is totally bogus.  I am more than angry.  what a nightmare.  I had almost taken pics of before and after, and should have, because what a terrible change. Thanks Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I have learned over the years to trust Neutrogena. I like this product very much and use it daily along with the Rapid Tone Repair.</li>
    <li> wow, this stuff really tightens my face and helps clear it up. I also use a retinol product and this boosts it&#x27;s skin clearing power. I use it every other day to avoid drying my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t think much about it but took a good look today and realized it has made a good difference!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I sure wouldn&#x27;t have called it Rapid Wrinkle Repair</li>
    <li> Works good for my skin. Good price for what it is</li>
    <li> I find Neutrogena to be a dependable brand, but if it really did get rid of deep wrinkles one could not afford to buy it, because it would be magic!.  I will just be happy softening the fine wrinkles (don&#x27;t know what I would look like if I didn&#x27;t use it).</li>
    <li> I broke out after just two days!</li>
    <li> This really helped to reduce the appearance of wrinkles under my eyes in only one week.  An unexpected benefit was that it actually reduced the puffiness and bags under my eyes by 50%!  You only need to use a tiny bit, so this should last for about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it every single night and wake up with my skin feeling so soft and smooth. It truly is a great product. I would definitely repurchase this one.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t understand what this is supposed to do.  It burns my skin as if I got a sunburn.  I hate using it because I hate the look of flaky skin.  I don&#x27;t understand the great reviews.  Am I using it wrong???????  Maybe in the summer time it would be better but I need moisture in the colder winters and spring.</li>
    <li> I have been using for 8 weeks now, and have seen absolutely no difference whatsoever! Still looking for something that works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of these types of products, and I&#x27;m very happy to have found this product.  The entire line is light, absorbs quickly, has a pleasant light fragrance, and is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do wish Neutrogena would PLEASE change the packaging to more closely resemble the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum product in this line.  The packaging for this product and the Night repair has these flaws:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The small pump bottle is heavy for its size, so taking it on a trip could be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The bottle is totally opaque so there is no earthly way to tell how much is left.  The entire bottle is covered in silver paint, so you cannot see inside.  The bottom of the bottle is painted, as the entire side.  If they left a strip unpainted on the side, you could see the quantity in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum product is in a very different container - it also has a pump top, but it is attached to a tube rather like a small toothpaste tube - a much, MUCH better system! The tube is very lightweight, and as it flattens you can see how much you&#x27;ve used, and it also holds 1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is almost impossible for me, with my later middle aged eyes, to tell the difference between the SPF 30 product and the Night product! There needs to be something that makes it easy to tell-a different color top, a different color ink on the label, something! I have to put on my glasses every single night and every single morning to make sure I am using the right product. Gad, that is frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do try this entire line, however.  Neutrogena has hit another out of the ballpark!</li>
    <li> It would probably work better if I were in my 20&#x27;s</li>
    <li> great companion product to the night repair.  I wear daily and it has made a definite change in improving skin tone and fine lines.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see a difference bought for wrinkles it did not help</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and am happy with it.  Too early to see any noticeable effect on crow&#x27;s feet or any other wrinkle...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of retinol products but most leave your face red or chapped around the eyes, nose, lips.  My derm mentioned Neutrogena products as her favorite so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  VERY pleased.  Light and not irritating (I am fair - blonde hair, green eyes....most products are too harsh.)  I&#x27;ve noticed less fine lines and even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they would make this product in a bigger size.  It&#x27;s not cheap either - but if it gets the results it claims, I&#x27;m willing to pay the price.  This one does - try it!</li>
    <li> I have been trying several different wrinkle reducing moisturizers and really wanted one with SPF.  After going through quite a few and even some quite expensive ones, I have been using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, SPF 30.  I have been very pleased with the results of my skin.  I have only been using it for approx two weeks, but, I have noticed a nice glow to my skin.  Not sure yet about the wrinkle reducing factor - I don&#x27;t really have deep wrinkles, but, do want to see the lines around my eyes, mouth and forehead diminished.  Time will tell if this product reduces the fine lines.  However, as far as a youthful glow, it has accomplished that in a short peroid of time and makes me want to continue the use of the product in hopes of continued long-term results.</li>
    <li> This is so fantastic.  I have very sensitive skin &amp; no problem.  Soaks in quickly, need very little.  Makeup just glides over your face.</li>
    <li> This is very good.  I like the feel and texture of the lotion.  it is not too thick.  . .</li>
    <li> Go to Amazon and there is the very product I was looking for.  Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know what results I will see, but it is a pleasant product.  Goes on smoothly and feels good.</li>
    <li> I actually have the night, day, and serum. It&#x27;s only ok.  But in terms of it working on reducing the appearance of fine lines, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m 38 with fine smile lines and lines on my forehead.  I&#x27;ve taken before pictures back in December, and nothing has changed.  I&#x27;m still using the same bottles now, so it lasts some time.  I&#x27;ll probably just use the rest of the product but will not re-buy.  I would rate it 2 stars for working on fine lines, but 3 stars for seemingly to hydrate my skin.</li>
    <li> Dried my face out. For the price, I was really hoping I would love the product. It did help with my forehead being so oily in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  Have tried some other daily moisturizers and feel as if I&#x27;m covered in grease.  This goes on smoothly and  absorbs quickly.  Don&#x27;t know if it works better than other moisturizers but have used it for years and love it.  Can use close to eye area with no burning.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, SPF 30, 1 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; a difference.. but i do feel a difference</li>
    <li> This is now my go-to moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly and has all the SPF I could ask for. Plus it has curbed my break outs significantly.</li>
    <li> This works well for me but will cause a burning sensation with some other products so I have to be careful.</li>
    <li> This product comes highly rated from recommended from Paula Begoun who wrote the book Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me.  Ms. Begoun has a website as well:  paulaschoice.  She bases her recommendations on ingredients and effectiveness of the products.  For me, this was the right choice for my aging skin that sometimes get dry patches.  Like any skin care product, it must be used according to the directions and long term to produce results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all.  I&#x27;m 35 years old with light skin and fine laugh lines.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok... Just like any other lying wrinkle repair...</li>
    <li> I used this product for a few weeks for some deep expression lines on my forehead. I&#x27;m only 29 so I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but the few I do have are very noticeable. This product did absolutely nothing positive for my skin. If anything my skin looked worse. I was hoping with all the good reviews it had that I had found something to work but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Nothing to do cartwheels about. I saw no improvements in my skin. I actually developed acne.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep sticking to Wexler or Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Keeps my 45 year old skin soft and younger looking-- got rid of flakiness and roughness.  Other retinol products were too harsh for my skin, causing it to peel and become irritated and red.</li>
    <li> I used Obagi in the past but found it cost prohibitive. Now I use only Neutrogena products. At night I wash with&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser with my MIA I, then I apply Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night. Before I go to bed I use Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration, Night.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning rinse and wash my face gently. I only use the Mia at night.&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30, for daytime use. Sometimes I use the toner before applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a prescription for Tentinon (retinol) cream then you would use this at night mixing it with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have tried others and keep coming back to his one. It goes on without a greasy feel or after-feel. Most lotions of this nature do not soak into my skin...just sets on top.</li>
    <li> My go-to moisturizer.  Price better than at local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This is not a face lift, but does help with the fine lines around the eyes and mouth.  Feels very good.</li>
    <li> Hoping it does what it is supposed to do!!</li>
    <li> Great product after using for a month. I can see the different on my skin. I will buy this again</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT I&#x27;VE TRIED THAT SEEMS TO WORK, AND I&#x27;VE TRIED ALOT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> I have the same comment about the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, Night time as the SPF 30.Please read that review.</li>
    <li> I would straight up tell anyone if this product didn&#x27;t work. I can 100% back it up. I will be 27 in a matter of months and have noticed the on-set of fine lines under my eyes. I will say this: after a month of using this, people ask me what high school I attend! I swear by this stuff. It may not work for some, but EVERYONE should at least try it!</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this at store(s). Non greasy and helps plump up skin that is combo oily/dry.&lt;br /&gt; I use this with  the eye rapid wrinkle repair as well every day. I love the container- (glass type) so I can get every drop out.</li>
    <li> Have seen some improvement in 2 weeks but not potent enough. Nose is still red and dark slots under eyes. Only 22, figured they would be at least half gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 55 years old, have oily skin, and still get pimples! I have extremely deep and long smile and forehead lines, and I&#x27;ve tried soooooooooo many anti-wrinkle products over the past five years. My smile and forehead lines might be even worse if I didn&#x27;t use something, but none of those creams, lotions, serums, etc. have gotten rid of nor diminished those lines at all, so I have a drawer full of these partially used tubes, tubs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few months, I&#x27;ve read the ratings and reviews for the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair product line and contemplated purchasing them. I finally did buy both the day and night moisturizers and received them yesterday afternoon. I used the night moisturizer both last night and tonight, and the day cream this morning. The feel of these products is wonderful and only a pearl-sized amount is needed per application! Unlike every other product I&#x27;ve tried, there is no oily or sticky feeling to my face when I put either moisturizer on nor for hours after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the lines have not yet diminished, so I&#x27;ll come back after another five days to amend my review regarding the actual \\&quot;wrinkle repair\\&quot; aspect.</li>
    <li> Great for day or night wear.  It is gentle and does not cause pore blockage or feel greasy on face.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m not one to buy all this wrinkle cream. But I was looking for some online, without high expectations. I read the reviews and they were good. So I ordered and I SWEAR this stuff really does diminish small lines! I&#x27;m so impressed that when I ran out I kind of panicked and reordered quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> Been using two months and see no difference.</li>
    <li> This is a good brand and works.  Do not put too close to eye area or your eyes will water.  My bottle&#x27;s pump does not work.</li>
    <li> received this for christmas. top of bottle was off, spring was missing, was glued to packing and could not be removed without tearing up the package it came in. i am a good amazon customer and never complain unless the product is stolen or very damaged and this bottle of neutrogena is extremely damaged.</li>
    <li> Great price!  I use this product regularly and love it!</li>
    <li> This product is ok I suppose, but only because I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t make my face red and blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;I used it faithfully daily, and in conjunction with the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System - which I only used as initially suggested (3 times per week).  My skin was flaky around the nose and eyes (really weird), but just kept using it for one month just to see.&lt;br /&gt;After I stopped using the microdermabrasion system, my skin stopped acting &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; however I continued using the Repair daily.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know.  I really haven&#x27;t seen much of an improvement so it is nothing to brag about that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a commercial recently about &amp;#34;the face cream graveyard&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s where this one will end up as I continue on with my search.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything out there to hydrate my skin and most of them stay on top for hours, but this sinks in &amp; hydrates quickly! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 years &amp; will continue as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I love this I use it everyday</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Quick delivery. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I am so so so happy to find this product... My face is really grateful because my apparence is better since I use it...</li>
    <li> I gave  stars because it is too soon to see results.  So far I like it.  Fast ship.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is definitely a product that I love! It works great on my skin combined with my Retinol-X Anti-Aging Gel Cleanser :)</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  My skin glows with this and all fine lines have disappeared!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything to reduce the wrinkles. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> What a bargain....for me, this cream blows away my previous  high end department store cream.&lt;br /&gt;I will positively be reordering .</li>
    <li> This is a multiple repeat buy.  Daily use has helped reduce fine lines throughout my face,</li>
    <li> My wrinkles are probably too far gone(forehead). Was hoping to see less of them after using this,but saw no difference</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying I am 63 years old.  I have heavy laugh lines from my nose down &amp; I have a big line between my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle.  I have always looked a bit younger than I am, but since hitting 60, things have changed making me look closer to my age.  This product helps tiny, fine lines, but I have proof!  I have a few growths. One on my collar bone &amp; one near my ear (skin colored, so not really seen, but I feel them).  In addition to using this product every morning all over my face &amp; neck, I put it on the 2 growths.  One disappeared totally after 10 days.  The other is much smaller after 1 month.  I figure if it can do that, it MUST be working on my wrinkles!  I am about to buy my 2nd bottle &amp; will see how it continues to help.</li>
    <li> tip always has a little dry clump - feels wasteful. needs an airtight cap.  Works great tho.</li>
    <li> A very good product.  Smooths almost immediately and is not oily or greasy at all.  Neutrogena has the right idea about skin care products and I feel safe in buying anything from them.  This one is a real winner!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all of the positive reviews, however I ended up hating it.  After a week of use both morning and night my skin felt burned.  At first I thought I was getting hot flashes (I&#x27;m 48) but realized it was the serum.  My face was red and dry, and it honestly looked like I had a bad sunburn.  It burned when I tried to moisturize - the only product that didn&#x27;t hurt was Aquaphor. That&#x27;s what I use if I have a sunburn!  Strange coincidence?  Anyway, my skin looked worse after a week of use.  People kept asking me if I was tired.  I threw the product away.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my scan smooth and I do notice a difference in my skin when I use this product.  I have used many other wrinkle creams from cheap to expensive and keep coming back to Neutrogena.  I use their day and night repair creams.</li>
    <li> I see this working over time. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> works well, face is a lot smoother</li>
    <li> fragrance free, smooth application, can be used under makeup</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. It works for my dry skin. It makes my skin look moisturizes throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the reviews seem positive.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me. My skin hurts after using it for a week. I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon and don&#x27;t think I can return the open package which includes the night time Rapid Wrinkle repair.  My skin feels tight. It was peeling off but looks like there are more wrinkles than before I use these products. I&#x27;ve always used Neutrogena toner and cleanser and like them. This is the first time I use a Neutrogena anti-aging product and feel very disappointed.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel moisturized, but did not do anything so far for fine lines. After a few weeks of using also it my skin around my eyes started burning when touched to washed or apply this product. Not worth the price. Regular cheap moisturizers do just as good.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough good things about this product!!!  been using it only 5 days and already notice a improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;m 36 and have fine lines by my eyes and now they are smoothed out and my overall face has improved.  VERY HAPPY</li>
    <li> This is great - no need to spend a fortune to get a product that works!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It is my main moisturizer.  Face feels great when you put it on.  Definitely recommend it and got some for my mom.</li>
    <li> She was skeptical didn&#x27;t want me to order it for her. I did its seems to be doing the job. She&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any lessening of lines, but there is a definite change in the complexion. I have always had freckles and I have noticed in the past couple years they have grown and darkened. I noticed an almost immediate lightening of them. My face looks so much clearer! The bottle has to weigh more than the actual contents, though, because it was gone really fast! I probably got 14 applications out of it, using three pumps on my face and two on my neck (only did on the neck maybe five times). I liked it enough to feel like I NEED more!</li>
    <li> I bought this with a skeptical attitude, but I might be proven wrong.  I have been using this product for two weeks and have noticed a positive difference.</li>
    <li> Another one for the wrinkle cream graveyard! This stuff is worthless. I used it every night for two months. Wrinkles haven&#x27;t diminished at all. And it smells bad. Very disappointed, will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out. I really like Neutrogena products but this really irritated my eyes. It burnt my skin, not to the point of rash but to the point of tenderness for a day after using it two nights in a row.</li>
    <li> This does what it promises.  My only gripe is that it clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because Consumer Reports rated it better than all the other products out there.  My Mary Kay was just getting way too expensive so I gave this a try.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on smooth &amp; clean and leaves my skin glowing. It has built in SPF 30 for extra protection and I&#x27;ve tested that part &amp; it works!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and light</li>
    <li> Love this for the day time.  Just enough moisture; feels great going on.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it before, however when I recvd it the item had been opened. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> First off, I have dark Mediterranean skin.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to apply to my eye area. After using it twice it has left me feeling burned, reddened, swollen, and now my skin is peeling/flaking off around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I also applied this to my forehead without incident.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine that I am allergic to this in one area but not the other.&lt;br /&gt;There are no return options for this product!&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This product to me is simply &#x27;meh&#x27;.  It smells nice, makes my skin feel soft, but don&#x27;t feel it does anything super &#x27;fancy&#x27; to my skin - in other words, doesn&#x27;t seem to be any difference with it after using it for several weeks.  It DID however, dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> sorry, it really hasn&#x27;t been enough time</li>
    <li> This is the best non-designer daily moisturizer on the market.  It is creamy but not heavy on the skin and absorbs quickly.  It does help diminish the appearance of my fine lines as advertised.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t rid wrinkles at all from what I can tell.  Like the lotion however as a moisturizer.  No miracles in this little bottle.</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the reviews already posted and read them before purchase.  This product goes on great and I feel instantly makes my skin look better.  I have only been  using it a week so I can&#x27;t comment on long term wrinkle repair but love it so far.  My make up goes on great and I feel like I am using less.  Has a very smoothing effect.  I will keep buying and hope for more improvements as time goes on.  Incredible find for the price!</li>
    <li> the product arrived very promptly.  As for the product itself, I used it as directed and noticed no difference.  Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> this is the best I have ever used. Roc has now been replaced. My 55 year old skin loves it and I had no drying or trouble with using it every day.</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream and it does make my skin look and feel much better.  I also think it is a bargain from this seller!</li>
    <li> Dried my skin out terribly.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this in the sun I get sunburned. Perhaps the anti-wrinkle is working but without the SPF working, what good is this?</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena Rapid wrinkle repair regularly and decided to check prices on line before running to the store to get a bottle. The price was the same and the shipping was free!  I ordered 3 bottles and  had them in my hand in 3 days without having to leave the house.I was thrilled with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be a waste of money.  It burned my eyes and it did nothing for my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The product advertising says it reduces wrinkles in as little as a week.  Maybe this is just wishful thinking, but it looks like it&#x27;s working to me.  I have been so disappointed spending huge amounts of money on skin products, and am happy there is something out there that works and is affordable.</li>
    <li> I like the night time better, but this is for day and it has SPF protection.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and gets compliments all the time how young she looks. So, of course it makes me look good as well cause i purchased it for her. lol</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the night repair but I like the SPF 30, I don&#x27;t have to use another sunscreen....</li>
    <li> This is really good night cream!  I would highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> this product does not do as advertised.  I have used other creams/treatments (a little more expensive) but they work.  this product irritated my skin and after using it along with the Toner Repair Moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin tone.  I will go back to my other treatments (obagi) which have worked for me.</li>
    <li> I love the Neutrogena brand of skin care products.  All things considered, they are worth the money.  Thankfully, my skin is holding up rather well for my age (57).  It wasn&#x27;t until the past year or two that I really started using any products at all on my face.  I started with Neutrogena and will stick with it.</li>
    <li> Love all neutrogena product</li>
    <li> I broke out in a rash all over my face, it felt like a burn, obviously not for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Darn, still have wrinkles....</li>
    <li> This product feels nice and I use it at nighttime for its anti-wrinkle benefits. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am hoping to see some improvements in my wrinkles soon!</li>
    <li> Like the product BUT  too much waist it&#x27;s a glass container and a lot of product wasted because you cant get it all out of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my suggestion put in a jar not pump</li>
    <li> I just got this product about 3 days ago and within 1 day of using it I saw results.  3 days later - even more.  I&#x27;ve tried others that worked, but not as effectively as this one.  I also like the fact it contains a sunscreen so I don&#x27;t have to apply 2 products.  I also notice that the Neutrogena Age Shield Face SPF 110 sunscreen also has a very nice wrinkle reducing effect and it isn&#x27;t even advertised as a feature of the product.  I am wondering if those who are giving this product less than stellar reviews are either not giving it time to do its thing or are expecting 20 years reduction in age from this.  While totally unrelated to this product I discovered that getting regular exercise, eating a balanced healthy diet and maintaining a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; body weight is one of the best things one can do to improve one&#x27;s youthful look and vitality.  I went on an exercise program and have slowly worked my way up to 4 miles of walking 3-4 times per week.  With little effort or dieting I lost 20 pounds.  My legs never looked better.  People I haven&#x27;t seen in a long time are telling me I look like I did 20 years ago.  I feel so much more energetic and on top of things also.  Your skin is a reflection of your overall health.  Don&#x27;t expect to sit on the couch all day eating donuts and expect to look like a fashion model just by using a face cream.</li>
    <li> Like it so far, haven&#x27;t noticed any difference but it feels and smells good.</li>
    <li> Great price and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about wrinkle repair but good sunblock with no eye irritation.  Can be a little hard to smooth but I can also use Bare Essential right on top without drying. The brush smooths it for a nicer finish.</li>
    <li> Just received this a day ago so I am  not sure how effective it will be  I am hopeful  and I have been pleased with other Neutrogena products</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturazer plus, lightweight, leaves my dry skin feeling very nice. Cant&#x27; beat the price!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I typically use Aveeno.  Aveeno wasn&#x27;t really making my face feel moisturized anymore and in the Winter my face can get really dry.  I have been using this for about 6 months now and really like it.  I use it in the morning and sometimes at night if my face is extra dry.  It dries quickly, goes on smoothly and has a really light smell that fades quickly.  My skin feels really smooth and not oily.  I can&#x27;t really comment on the scars/wrinkle factor because I&#x27;m using this more for my dry skin, but like I said it feels smoother and soft.  I also like that it has SPF 30 as most moisturizers do 15.  I&#x27;m taking 1 star off because if I wasn&#x27;t subscribing and saving through amazon and paying $14/bottle the price tag of $20 is a little high being that it barely lasts me a month.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a few months ago, because I was desperately looking for a wrinkle cream (at a reasonable price) to get rid of my one line in my forehead (sounds pathetic I know). I&#x27;m in my 20s and started paying more attention to my face. I recently noticed a line in my forehead that I was not familiar with and it kinda bugged me. Actually, no. It REALLY bugged me!!! I did my research on Amazon and came across this wrinkle cream. Good reviews at a pretty good price. Great! I ordered it. Here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin… almost see-through. And sensitive! The first week of using this cream, I broke out. Red bumps all over my face (and my skin was peeling all over. I heard this is a side effect if you have never used products with retinol). I usually have an allergic reaction to almost everything, so it didn&#x27;t bother me. I decided to stick it out and continue using the product. About two weeks later, the red bumps disappeared and I noticed my skin was getting smoother. Great! I subtracted two stars because of the following: I used a lot of the cream, because I wanted to make sure it works. I used one bottle in just one month. I have been using this for 4 months, so I have been through 4 bottles. In those 4 months, yes, my skin has gotten a lot smoother and softer, BUT……. that frickin&#x27; wrinkle in my forehead!!! The whole reason why I bought this produce, is still there!!! The lotion did not diminish the wrinkle or get rid of it. So unfortunately, I will continue my search for the perfect wrinkle cream!</li>
    <li> This cream had excellent reviews, so I bought it but it is not for me. I have never had sensitive skin or any reactions to face creams, the first night I tried it I felt like my face was burning off. I tried it again a few days later with the same result , and with only two uses it seems to have destroyed my poor skin. My skin is dry and flaking off everywhere with a few red patches. I will have to try another brand.</li>
    <li> I am 33, sensitive skin, prone to breakouts. Not only did this product not irritate my skin, it as improved its overall texture and clarity. I am the youngest of the women in my circle of friends, but easily looked the oldest. Over the past few years I was developing deep wrinkles in my forehead, the dreaded \\&quot;11\\&quot; between my eyes, and fine lines around my eyes from squinting. I&#x27;ve never been very good about keeping up a skin care routine, and definitely never long enough to see results. The 3rd day of using this, I thought the deep wrinkles looked like they were relaxing, but I ignored it thinking it was probably just wishful thinking and didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up. Now, day 10, it is like looking at my face 10 years ago. The difference is undeniable. I regret not taking close up before and after photos. When I relax my face, there are no signs of wrinkles, only when I scrunch or squint do they reappear. My skin feels really soft, no greasy feel from the product. I know that everyone responds differently to products but I really hope that you get the same results I did. I stop and look when I pass a mirror (sounds vein, I know) but I have been hiding from the mirror for so long!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if anything looks any different but the wife hasn,t complained</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products, but this bottle is way Too Heavy; it&#x27;s like a metal or glass - can&#x27;t really tell. It doesn&#x27;t travel well because of the weight and if you drop it on tile - the tile may chip. I won&#x27;t order again; going back to Neutrogena Healthy Skin with Alpha Hydroxy - works the same for me and less expensive.</li>
    <li> After putting this on, unless you barely put any one at all, you can gently rub the area where you put it on and it will rub off like in particles of rubber. When I wash my face it comes off in bits. And it feels like I have a layer of plastic on my face. Anything ending with the letters one in the ingredients, don&#x27;t use it. This is the problem. Ingredients ending in those letters are intended to coat the skin in a way they think is to keep in moisture but... they also keep in dirt and cause break outs too. Please read on google and so many will say so. I do not like this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to be good product , wish , it could used as firming product, it has smal amount of cream in it, have to buy it again</li>
    <li> Not really effective... I wouldn&#x27;t repeat this order.</li>
    <li> From a number of products I tried over the years, this one stands out. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it does work and you WILL see results.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for 2 weeks and am now hooked for life. The neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair has gotten rid of about 75% of my sun spots on my face and chest and has shown dramatic results of the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. this is a must try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I absolutely love this moisturizer!  My skin does look smoother and brighter with this on. Non greasy and spf30. Perfect for the lazy man like me.</li>
    <li> the odor of this product is so offensive that I can&#x27;t even imagine what is being covered up.....if you are even a little odor sensitive don&#x27;t buy it...I will be returning mine immediately</li>
    <li> This product seemed okay for a general lotion. I used it until it was gone and certainly didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin. It was a bit expensive for general facial cream.</li>
    <li> Burns slightly, after a month I can see no discernible difference. The wrinkles are here to stay without some more serious solutions!</li>
    <li> I had never used any of their products. But Olay, Mary Kay, Clinique were not wowing me. I decided with this purchase I would do half my face the old way and half with these new products to see if I could tell a difference. I can. I am starting to see those fewer fine lines that everyone promises. I added the crazy Monistat Powder Chafing Gel as primer - also had never used a primer - and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Quick to put on at night.  I top it with additional lotion.  I&#x27;m happy with it.  I use tons of Neutrogena products.  It&#x27;s a dependable brand.</li>
    <li> Doesn,t work for me? Am on my second bottle and have just as many wrinkles as I had when I began using it a month ago.  Will continue to use it until I run out..but not after that.</li>
    <li> I cannot say I have noticed any difference in my skin. The lines around my eyes have not decreased. It did make me break out on my forehead and I am 62. This product did not do anything rapidly as far as wrinkles. It was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The scent of this lotion is great, but it stings my skin a bit. It might be an ingredient that&#x27;s part of the spf.</li>
    <li> I use it a few times a week since I have sensitive skin...but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this! It seems to be more a sunscreen so as a result it is sticky and not effective. Used the whole bottle and saw 0 results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time and now my husband has started to use it.  We both like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs completely and protects against the sun.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> easily absorbed by the skin.  better than most other ointments although there is no real before and after differences that can be measured via photos.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It actually works. Even after a week, I saw&lt;br /&gt;improvement in the fine lines on my face. I would recommend it&lt;br /&gt;to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have pruchased some of the most expensive products in the skin care line. Not one of the products I bought gave me the results that Neutrogena did. My skin look so soft, my makeup goes on so smooth, this is a winner.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband and his skin is smoother in just couple of days using! Too bad I didn&#x27;t take pics before to compare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products and was eager to try this. It goes on smoothly with no redness or burning, and I like the convenience of the pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it gives you a nice tingle, you know it is working I also use the night repair and the serum, along with my  neutrogena microbrasion kit.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really see a difference, but I like the cream in general.</li>
    <li> Most moisturizers are SPF 20 or less....I tried another well-known, well-advertised brand and broke out!  Reminder to me: Stick to Neutrogena products!</li>
    <li> I really wish i was one of the many people who liked this product...Ive used it for a month now and It doesnt do anything save your money and buy something better!!!</li>
    <li> Very good wrinkle repair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using this for 6 days, once per day in the morning, and the results are remarkable.  I have large pores that are almost completely unnoticeable and my skin is smoother and evened out.  My skin tends to be oily as well and I have noticed that it&#x27;s not nearly as oily as it was prior to using this product.  I highly recommend Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a couple of years now and I like it</li>
    <li> Many friends have noticed a difference in the month I&#x27;ve been using it.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.  Will reorder when bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I definately see an improvement. I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would. I am 60 yrs. old and I&#x27;m not going down without a fight. I have tried MANY products promising to reduce wrinkles. The first week of use I noticed some redness and flakiness on my chin, forehead and around my mouth. I exfoliated and continued using the product. The redness and flakiness went away after about 3 weeks of use. I have to admit I think there is a diference in the fine lines around my mouth and chin. My daughter even commented &amp;#34;Mom what have you been using your face looks so smooth&amp;#34;. I am going to order another bottle and hope that it gets better and better.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and went thru many of the reviews on here and everyone who said it smells strongly is right!  I got an instant headache from it. My review is based on just the products smell at this point. I&#x27;ll will update in the next month to see how it&#x27;s working. At this point it better work good because I&#x27;d hate to have to deal with this stink for nothing.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this product…my expectations for its use was based on the marketing language used to describe the product…I purchased the product because of the product description.  While it is now part of my normal skin care protocol, the merchandising language was different than the language on the side of the bottle.  The discrepancy is disturbing in that the use still is what I expected, but the marketing language implied more.  (Please see the comment for the Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer SPF 30)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> Product arrived in three pieces due to broken dispenser.</li>
    <li> wow, this is a fine lines eraser in no second!!! i love this product, it made me finally give up olay products. I can see a huge difference on my face, before and after!!!!</li>
    <li> I had been buying this at Wal-Mart for $17.99 and was happy to have found it on Amazon at a $3-$4 dollar cost reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product because it contains retinol and an SPF of 30.  When I used Retin-A cream I had to be sure to use sun screen.  This combines the two and is a very effective wrinkle reducer of fine lines while moisturizing.  I wear it under my makeup for all the above reasons. At first some of my skin sluffed off which is a very good thing because it shows it is working.  This goes away after 2-3 weeks. You only apply it once a day and it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Product works and arrived on time. Would order again.</li>
    <li> This is a day cream that I purchased because it was less expensive than another brand I normally wear, not because I believed that this was a miracle cure in a jar that would erase my wrinkles making me look 25 again.  Believe me, I don&#x27;t believe any product can do that, so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes in the claims I could watch my wrinkles &amp;#34;just disappear&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when, that didn&#x27;t happen.  What did happen, however, was that this product dried my skin terribly which I had read happened to others.  I am not new to using retinol, I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and yes, at first they dried my skin a little albeit temporary.  Using this, however, my skin remained dry, so if you buy this, beware, and get a good moisturizer in case it dries your skin also.  I am  disappointed with this, not because of false hope of looking younger, but rather the name &amp;#34;Neutrogena&amp;#34; in hopes it would be a good product, not the drying garbage it turned out to be.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...it really works!</li>
    <li> Feels good, but no improvement of facial wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I like this product so much that I order two at a time so I don&#x27;t run out.  I love the way my skin feels when I use this product and it  seems to work well as far as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Seems to the job and in not greasy !</li>
    <li> I had used this product sparely around my eyes for fine lines for 4 days and I had to stop using because it dried my skin out.  I ended up putting Vitamin E oil under my eyes to bring back the moisture in my skin.  I will use this product only on smile lines or on my forehead.  For me it was too strong for the delicate skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I like this face lotion .  It goes on easily and does have an SPF ingredient.  It gives my complexion a nice feel and lasts all day.  I am not sure if it helped to smooth out any wrinkles but it does have good ingredients and did not cause any adverse reactions.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I see any effect regarding wrinkles. But then, nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried has turned back time. Does any moisturizer do anything but keep skin from drying out? If not, you might as well buy a store brand moisturizer for a few bucks. The one thing I want to mention is the scent. It&#x27;s that pungent smell you&#x27;re hit with at a gift store that sells [[ASIN:B000TVJ6XW Yankee Candles]]. Sweet and musky and spicy all at once. It&#x27;s not bad, but it does give me the urge to go Christmas shopping.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> where is the rapid response?  don&#x27;t see any difference what so ever, but is an ok moisturizer for night time use.</li>
    <li> Smells really bad like stale perfume. It is not meant to smell like that I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, as all skin is unique:  I am 61 have normal skin (not too dry, not too oily) and have a fair complexion.  This works for me -- sinks into the skin flawlessly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and definitely plumps up the wrinkles.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference...didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product! Softens your wrinkles and smoothens your face.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but not in one week.</li>
    <li> It smells great but do not see any visible improvement in wrinkles.....sorry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena retinol products for many years. If you give it at least 8 weeks to start seeing results, you will not only notice fewer fine lines, you will see age spots fade and scars smooth out. Any redness that you experience initially will dissipate after a week or so. At least that was my experience. This product costs much less than many others on the market. It has an equal or greater percentage of retinol than many products that cost much more.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot. I know that some people can be sensitive to retinol but I personally have not had any issues. It&#x27;s very hydrating and works well under make-up. I love that it has an SPF of 30 because 15 just isn&#x27;t enough!! As far as anti-aging goes, I don&#x27;t have a ton of fine lines (only 31 years old) but the few that I do have, seem to be a bit less noticeable. I would definitely recommend this product to people as well as re-order!!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  I have noticed a boost in my skin, even though I am very old.  I am delighted to be able to purchase Neutrogena at Amazon and I know I can reorder at any time!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> First of all, the frangrance in this is awful. I don&#x27;t trust anyting that has a percentage of fragrance, it takes up space along with all the other fillers and preservatives. This product irritated my skin especially under my eyes. My sister and I bought a package that had two and we both agreed, it&#x27;s a waste of money. If you want retinol, buy the REAL product. It is costly but lasts for months. This lasted me less than two weeks and I used a dollup on each side of my face everyday.  My sister said she used it in her hands so not to waste it.&lt;br /&gt;For the money it&#x27;s way worth to buy medical grade for your face and neck. It is more money but makes a huge difference. Drug store products have a lot less in the package than it seems. If something is really good and really works, I will but it no matter what it costs. This product and the huge competitor has been a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a daily morning and evening.  Great product. Although it doesn&#x27;t do miracles and I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s again. And I&#x27;m still a short brunette and not a tall blonde but then again hey, I go with what G-d has gifted me.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used with success for several years.  With a SPF value of 30, I can spend time in the sun for short periods of time without worry of sun damage to my face.  I often receive compliments on my young-looking face as I am a great-grandmother!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this 2 days in the morning and night, and my upper eyes are so puffy.  In addition to that, I work out in the mornings and when sweat mixes with this it stings so badly!  It is a good moisturizer and I want to give it an honest try, so I think I will use it on the spots that I have wrinkles and stay away from the eye area completely.  In addition, I will only use it in the morning after my shower.  This is my first time of using an anti-wrinkle moisturizer.  Can anyone relate to this?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell any difference between before I started using Rapid Wrinkle repair and after using it for a month.  But I guess it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I am 42 yrs old and was starting to get deep wrinkles. This stuff works like a charm. I love it. My deep frown wrinkles are disappearing. This is with in a week of use. I would recommend this to any one who has wrinkles that they want gone. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and do not have any problems.  I would recommend this product for anyone at any age</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a week now and can really see a difference.  My fine lines are almost gone.  It also smells nice.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, absorbs well into skin and leaves the skin feeling smoothed and refreshed as per my wife. I can second that it leaves the skin soft with no perfume smell.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve used this as directed for the past weeks since purchase ... so far, I can&#x27;t not say &amp;#34;rapid&amp;#34; anything!</li>
    <li> I noticed a different on day 3, my skin was glowing and felt so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My husband even noticed!  That&#x27;s big!</li>
    <li> UPDATING FROM ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I had originally given this product a 2 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after I purchased this product I began using a different cleanser.  While I liked the cleanser my products stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;After figuring it out to be the new cleanser, I am finding Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair is working quite nice.  I put this on after washing with my other cleanser and my face drank it in and the wrinkles lessened quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for another product to buy and switching to my other cleanser has saved me some money.  And letting a good product finally work on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for several weeks and am still waiting for some kind of results.&lt;br /&gt;I feel I have wasted  my money.  Even the little, surface lines are still there, let alone the more noticeable ones.&lt;br /&gt;I read many reviews before I bought this and it kept having raves.  Now I am wondering what were these people actually using?  Not this because it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
    <li> So far my favorite facial sunscreen. Does seem to improve skin tone also. Does not cause breakouts like most creams I try.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I feel like it does a good job of protecting your face and neck from sun exposure and keeps the wrinkles at bay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months every day and to be honest I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements. I don&#x27;t have very deep wrinkles yet, but it didn&#x27;t affect small mimic wrinkles on my forehead. To be objective, it didn&#x27;t do any harm, too :) Also, the product has nice light texture, it&#x27;s smells good, and it&#x27;s easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily. I just wish it really helped to fight the early wrinkles as was promised.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I discovered it.  It goes on and absorbs quite well.  It has SPF 30 in it.  So I don&#x27;t need an additional sunscreen unless I am going to be at the pool or the beach.</li>
</ol>
