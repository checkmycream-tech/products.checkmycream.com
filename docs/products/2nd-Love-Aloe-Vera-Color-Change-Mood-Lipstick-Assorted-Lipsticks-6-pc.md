      <li>loved the shades but each lipstick came out of it&#x27;s tube..</li>
      <li>It feels really good on your lips</li>
      <li>i get a good 5 hrs.</li>
      <li>i have given this to all my nieces and they loved it.</li>
      <li>The orangy one is very nice with most of my clothing and looks good with my complexion.</li>
      <li>This is the first lipstick I&#x27;ve ever owned that suits my skin tone perfectly.</li>
      <li>if purchasing It&#x27;s nice to have a stock, but I decided to give a couple away.</li>
      <li>They said they felt nice on</li>
      <li>Nice colors</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this lipstick!</li>
      <li>I explained it to the, and they love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lasting power is excellent</li>
      <li>But it is more of a tint.</li>
      <li>Its inexpensive and lasts more than some lipsticks in the stores.</li>
      <li>Love love love love</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Been using magic lipstick since high school, it&#x27;s great, and cheap way for a stain lipstick!</li>
      <li>But decided to try other colors for a change and I am very happy I did it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so if you are looking for a gift for girls above 13, then this is good!</li>
      <li>every thing is just fine</li>
      <li>I just received these fabulous mood lipsticks about a week ago.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to give as much color as the ones I used to have, but these are probably better than most</li>
      <li>regular lip stick never stay on my lips good</li>
      <li>Like any good mood lipstick, they are moisturizing and the hot-pink tint will stay on your lips for several hours.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, colors are pretty.</li>
      <li>Pretty good, but much too soft.  </li>
      <li>“Great product I recommend&amp;#34; if looking for a PINK stain you will be very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>These were a fun gift to give on Xmas.</li>
      <li>Broke two of them right away.  </li>
      <li>I am extremely happy with every one of them and they look so natural and lasts for a long time .  </li>
      <li>The lipstick glides on well, does not dry the lips, and I love pinks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s was funny.</li>
      <li>but i liked the pink</li>
      <li>I love these except all the colors were pink</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for anyone.</li>
      <li>Really is more of a lip gloss with a little tint, that a lip stain.</li>
      <li>It does change color of lips to light pink which I like otherwise.</li>
      <li>This is not a reaction that I have ever had to a beauty product, and I think it may have been some sort of allergic reaction, but I&#x27;d be interested to know if the lipstick had a similar affect on anyone else.</li>
      <li>The color stays very well, yes, but unless you like hot pink lipstick (which I don&#x27;t), this product is not for you.</li>
      <li>The color will especially cling to any dry areas, so prep your lips first.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I discovered when these lipsticks arrived that they&#x27;re all the same color when you put them on. The color stays very well, yes, but unless you like hot pink lipstick (which I don&#x27;t), this product is not for you. Also, wearing the lipstick gave me a migraine. This is not a reaction that I have ever had to a beauty product, and I think it may have been some sort of allergic reaction, but I&#x27;d be interested to know if the lipstick had a similar affect on anyone else.</li>
    <li> Received product on time. Goes on smooth, colors are pretty. Shades of pink and red.</li>
    <li> This is the first lipstick I&#x27;ve ever owned that suits my skin tone perfectly. It feels really good on your lips and you don&#x27;t need to reapply all that often. I use the pink so I don&#x27;t get weird looks from people when applying but they all give you the same lip shade depending on your body temperature.</li>
    <li> “Great product I recommend&amp;#34; if looking for a PINK stain you will be very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Also the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> All broken inside push up case</li>
    <li> Been using magic lipstick since high school, it&#x27;s great, and cheap way for a stain lipstick! Love love love love</li>
    <li> These were a fun gift to give on Xmas. Imagine the shock and look of WTF when they opened their blue green and yellow lipsticks. It&#x27;s was funny. I explained it to the, and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They are all a deep pink ish leaning towards a red. They said they felt nice on and after we ate dinner I looked at both women I gave this to and there lips were still tinted.</li>
    <li> I just received these fabulous mood lipsticks about a week ago.  I remembered them from when I was a teenager.  By chance I wanted to see if I could purchase them on Amazon and I did to my surprise.  I am extremely happy with every one of them and they look so natural and lasts for a long time .  I highly recommend them for anyone.</li>
    <li> Good product because &amp;#34;it stays on!&amp;#34;  It also moisturizes!  Even though it changes color on your lips, there is a wide variety of shades.</li>
    <li> They just didn&#x27;t glide on as well &amp; the color didn&#x27;t seem to do well or last as long as other I have had.</li>
    <li> The lasting power is excellent i get a good 5 hrs. But it is more of a tint. The lipstick glides on well, does not dry the lips, and I love pinks, the drawback is that they all color pink. I was hoping to get different shades or at least a coral tint. But it was the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if purchasing It&#x27;s nice to have a stock, but I decided to give a couple away. Its inexpensive and lasts more than some lipsticks in the stores.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I may have an allergic reaction to this product. I have tingling of my lips and swelling of my face. It does change color of lips to light pink which I like otherwise.</li>
    <li> i have given this to all my nieces and they loved it. so if you are looking for a gift for girls above 13, then this is good!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lipstick! Stays on for hours!</li>
    <li> My mom loves them. Like any good mood lipstick, they are moisturizing and the hot-pink tint will stay on your lips for several hours. Each color was about the same shade after applied. The color will especially cling to any dry areas, so prep your lips first.</li>
    <li> I used to buy only the green color. But decided to try other colors for a change and I am very happy I did it.&lt;br /&gt;The mod marcher lipsticks are hard to find in PR</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years regular lip stick never stay on my lips good but this does!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is what I wanted for a long time.  Each one changes to another color.  They also work well as a lip balm to</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but much too soft.  Broke two of them right away.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to give as much color as the ones I used to have, but these are probably better than most I have tried lately.  The orangy one is very nice with most of my clothing and looks good with my complexion. It comes out a soft peachy pink color.</li>
    <li> all day wear lipstick</li>
    <li> Really is more of a lip gloss with a little tint, that a lip stain.</li>
    <li> Yes it works well.  Nice colors</li>
    <li> every thing is just fine</li>
    <li> I love these except all the colors were pink they didn&#x27;t change color but i liked the pink so i didn&#x27;t mind its like a dark pink and stays on all day i love it it makes my eyes pop</li>
    <li> I am about to return this crap it just make your lips red....no matter what color you use it just makes them red. I am return this crap today!</li>
    <li> loved the shades but each lipstick came out of it&#x27;s tube..i had never had this happen,not with every single lipstick in the pack,the tubes simply fell apart</li>
