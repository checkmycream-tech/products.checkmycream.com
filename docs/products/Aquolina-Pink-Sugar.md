### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am in love with it!!!!</li>
      <li>and kept telling me I smelled wonderful.</li>
      <li>My favourite, however, is smelling this on your clothes and blankets after the day is over and that wonderful smell, like marshmallows that it leaves on your skin when you wake up in the morning.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of perfume...they cause me to get horrible migraines.  This perfume, however, is different.  It is light enough that it does not over power me, yet it leaves a fresh, candy like scent.  I almost bought some of the jessica simpson scents until I read the reviews about Pink Sugar.  I am so glad I changed my mind.  I am addicted to this perfume now!</li>
    <li> I read the review for Pink Sugar when I way typing my bad review for  Dessert&#x27;s Cupcake that I bought but have not used since (for all the reasons stated).  I purchased a bottle of this, and when it came, I instantly understood what everybody was raving about.  The only way I can describe it is that it smells like  the Candyland game (if it had such a scent).  My 10 year old loves it as well, so I had to buy another bottle. On her, it smells like lollipops, but on me it smells like creme brulee.  When I am at work, the comment I most often hear is \\&quot;ummm something sure smells good.\\&quot;  But no one really knows it is me because it is not overpowering, but more of a breeze of sweetness.  In other words, you will love it.</li>
    <li> I can see why so many women like this fragrance. I tried it at Sephora and was pleasantly surprised. I have to say it doesn&#x27;t really smells like cotton candy to me, more like vanilla creme brulee. However, I&#x27;m not complaining-I&#x27;m definately getting some for myself. Very sensual.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume! It smells like cotton candy, I would highly reccomend it to anyone who likes sweet smells. I actually think that it is my new favorite. I will be ordering another bottle as soon as mine starts to get low. It would be very hard for anyone to not like the way this perfume smells</li>
    <li> I love super sweet smells, so I was sure I would really like this, judging by other people&#x27;s reviews. I am glad I tested it before I ordered it, because it smelt just like I had rubbed robotussin cough syrup on my wrists. It was so medicinal. Try before you buy.</li>
    <li> Pink Sugar is the definition of Aromatherapy. I sprayed some of this today at Sephora and that was all she wrote. It smells soooo good and sweet and fresh and happy. I promise you that after I sprayed this I was in an uplifted mood for the rest of the evening because the scent kept wafting up to my nose and each time I inhaled, I inhaled joy. I sprayed it at 6:00 and six hours later I still smell it on me and my clothes. It&#x27;s cotton candy, caramel, vanilla, and very light, fresh florals. I have to honestly say this is now officially my very favorite perfume. It smells divine and totally makes my spirit happy. I just purchased the 3.4. oz and Body Mousse and can&#x27;t wait to get it. I absolutely adore this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This will be from here on out my signature scent. It smells so yummy. I sprayed it in my hair, and when I walked past my boyfriend he said \\&quot;What smells so good?...something smells sweet, like cotton candy.\\&quot;  The name really does say it all. When you first put it on, it smells like pure sugar. A lot of reviews I read, people said they picked up other notes, but I&#x27;m with my boyfriend in thinking it smells just like cotton candy. And you know guys love the smell of sweets, so this will definetely be an attention grabber. And it&#x27;s not strong at all, like a lot of vanilla scents are these days. It&#x27;s light and airy, and I kept sniffing my hair all day long. And it smells the same all day long. It doesn&#x27;t change and get pungent or musty smelling. It smells the same as it does when you first put it on. Definetely the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Men have literally stopped me on the street to tell me how good I smell when I wear this.  I think that speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  It smells just like cotton candy and candied apples at a local carnival.  I was at an ice cream store the other day and i couldnt tell if the candy smell i was smelling was me or the store!!!!!  Also, i work the front desk at a hotel and the other day a guest came up to the front desk and asked what that smell was she was smelling.  She said it smelled like cotton candy and belgium waffeles!!!!  I have read alot of reviews on this cologne that say its a girly scent.  I dont think cotton candy, peanuts, candied apples, sugar, (these are the notes in this cologne) are predisposed to the female gender.  I am a guy, not gay, and i love wearing this stuff.  I dont like the frilly bottle or the name of the scent though.  I guess that is because this scent isnt marketed to guys.  I dont care though, i think its awesome.  Whenever someone asks what i am wearing i tell them its a new cologne for guys called Candyman  LOL!!!!!</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started to use perfume, I have searched for the finest one which is long- lasting and has great smell. I like Chanel perfume because it last very long but its smell is too strong and classical so I just use it while having parties. So I keep searching by trying many types (perfume, eau de toilette, eau de parfume) and many brand names (including many best selling ones in Amazon) but I was usually dissapointed. I thought there is no perfume that is the \\&quot;finest\\&quot; until I&#x27;ve tried Pink Sugar. I have seen Pink Sugar staying in the best selling list of Amazon for a long time but I always ignored it because I thought eau de toilette does not last long. However, I have seen the previews and decided to tried it once. When I received Pink Sugar a month ago, I immediately addicted to this one. It smells like Cotton Candy- very nice and sweet. I tried it on my wrists before going to bed and it lasted until the next morning. Then I wear it to go to school. My proffessors ask when they enter the class: \\&quot;what smells like candy in here?\\&quot; (I always sit in the front row). Then I got a lot compliments at work. I have a part- time job at a restaurant and a strong smell of food usually sticks on me. However, once I&#x27;ve got back from work and my friend asked me what perfume I use that smells so sweet. At that time, I was really surprised because Pink Sugar still lasts. I buy products in Amazon quite a long time and this is the first time I write a preview because I can guarantee that this product won&#x27;t dissapoint you. Now I don&#x27;t switch back and forth many other perfumes any more because I have found my most favorite one: Pink Sugar.</li>
    <li> I wear Pink Sugar on an everyday basis I layer it on with Shower Gel and Deodorant Spray and it smells delicious, somedays ill just sprits perfume or deodorant others ill just shower but im sure to always be wearing it! i wear it with gummy bear chapstick and I find it totally irresistible! Its become my signature scent, it smells like cinammon cookies, marshmallows, vanilla, donuts, cotton candy and cherry lollipops. Guys love this stuff and girls want it, all my friends say it smells amazing and constantly ask me what perfume it is. I always tell them its warm vanilla sugar from bath and body works , just because the fragrances are very different with people&#x27;s skin and they will never know its pink sugar, i absolutely adore this scent, it sticks on you forever after using it for a while..its cozy and delicious. I bought deodorant, shower gel and perfume in medium size but halfway through the using before it was over, just for meausure, i ordered a bigger 3. OZ perfume another deodorant spray, shower gel and body gel, they are fabolous as well. and  and when i don&#x27;t wear it you can find me in eucalyptus spearmint from bath and body works aroma therapy, or hypnotic poison by dior, both scents are YUM and addictive. Sometimes i&#x27;m a bit skeptical about switching perfumes because i would love for pink sugar to stay on me forever. Aquolina should come out with a pink sugar body powder and a pink sugar hair refreshener, I was so excited because all of the reviews i saw here and when i spritzed it on literally people wanted to chew my wrist off and hug me all day long, its an amazing powerful fragrance! Its super affordable and I buy these products everytime i can , often. My guy friends say its the sexiest smell ever, ill be stopped at the mall or in restaurant or at parties and people ask me what im wearing? Ill be like Esacada Summer or Gucci Rush or Warm Vanilla Sugar or Amor Amor, whatever rolls of my tongue just never ever Pink Sugar ;) People will envy your scent,although my brother says it smells like cookies and cookies make him think of grandmother and its sickly sweet , he&#x27;s the first person to dissagree. My classmates love it in the morning and its also perfect for a night out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. I think it&#x27;s the Carrie Bradshaw of perfumes because it&#x27;s unique, stylish, fun and sexy. It was recommended to me on my Amazon store, and after reading so many good reviews of it I decided to purchase a sample size to try for myself.  All I can say is, WOW!  It took some getting used to, because it smelled so good and yet i couldn&#x27;t quite pinpoint what it was.  At first it was almost a licorice/candy scent, then more of a powdery, floral as the day went on.  I can also detect a hint of strawberry.  This scent lasts but it is not that strong, which is perfect for me because I am a student.  I think a woman of any age can wear this scent.  it is very feminine, and it really does make you feel good when you wear it.  It is definitely the ultimate GIRLY scent though, so if that isn&#x27;t your thing then i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume based on reviews and the fact that I like girly sweet scents but when i got the perfume I was disappointed. I tried it out at the local sephora store and sprayed some on the sample paper and it smelled fine...i must have gotten the wrong bottle (i&#x27;m looking at the bottle i got and it says Pink Sugar on it but there is a picture of a chilli pepper) or something because mine had a hint of licorice smell...i absolutely hate the smell and taste of licorice. I&#x27;m looking at the picture of the Pink Sugar here and I see there is no picture of chilli pepper...is there a difference? I&#x27;m returning mine.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t buy a lot of perfumes since i find what i like and stick to it. Over time using the same scent is like a calling card and a wonderful spark to ones memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad that people are giving a fragrance a bad review since it&#x27;s a completey opinion based purchase. A person&#x27;s sense of smell is unique and i feel you shouldn&#x27;t bash something because you personally think the smell is not appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love this frangrance I understand that it will NOT smell the same on everyone. People forget that perfume smells different once it mixes with the natural oils in your skin it also has a lot to do with flux in body&#x27;s temperture and even hormonal levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recomendation is go to a beauty store, don&#x27;t take the smell right out of the bottle as what it will smell like once on your skin and don&#x27;t go perfume shoping without the knowledge and if you&#x27;ve smell a hundred scents in one day everything will smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scent says a lot about a person, choose one that fits your mood, you&#x27;ll be surprised how uplifting it is to your spirits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this scent is fun, inviting and adds a hint of mystery about you... it&#x27;s sexy without being slutty..it&#x27;s like the good girl&#x27;s scent who has another side you may not see :)</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I rarely purchase a perfume without sampling it first in person. I kept hearing about how popular this fragrance was and I searched for it in all of the high-end department stores, but couldn&#x27;t find it. So I thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll order it. I just received it today and it&#x27;s excellent! I love it. It&#x27;s sweet, but not to the point where it&#x27;s sickening. There&#x27;s something hidden underneath that I can&#x27;t quite explain. It&#x27;s very warm, inviting and let me tell you, it lasts! I sprayed it once on my wrist and even after showering, I can still smell it. I understand why everyone is raving about it! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> went looking for a new scent today found one bought it i hate it now wish i had gotten another bottle of pink sugar it is perfect for every thing and not overpowering</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Pink Sugar. I like floral gourmondes, so I finally got a sample. When I first sprayed this on, I thought it smelled nice. Then after 10 minutes it took a sudden U-turn for the worst. It turned into pure, burnt cotton candy on my skin. I hate everything about cotton candy (the taste &amp; smell) so sadly Pink Sugar is a no go. I envy those whose chemistry brings out the best in Pink Sugar.</li>
    <li> This perfume is unlike no other, smells like a mixture of cotton candy and sugar cookies. Whenever I wear it, I get tons of compliments on it; most of the men in the office ask if there are cookies baking somewhere ;) It has a very distinctive scent and once you have smelled this, you immediately recognize it anywhere else. My all time favorite, hands down!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love - everyone in our house loves this scent.  My husband gave it to me for my birthday and it is an instant favorite.  The price is great, too!  One thing that we love is that it is appropriate for both me and my daughter, age 10.  It is sweet, but I don&#x27;t think it is childish smelling.   &lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing is to spray it on my pajamas and on my pillow -sweet dreams, indeed!</li>
    <li> After years of searching I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect perfume. Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it&#x27;s so light and &#x60;warm&#x27; with a base of sensual vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No this isn&#x27;t a cheesy ad, it really happened!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel.  Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do I have anything negative to say? Well, yes actually. Aquolina needs to make Pink Sugar available to the U.K. - Postage and packing costs a fortune!!!</li>
    <li> Has been my \\&quot;Signature\\&quot; Fragrance for over 3 years now.This Sugary-Sweet,Fluffy As A Marshmallow Soft fragrance is light enough to wear in the office, is non-offensive and does not over-power. AVAILABLE SOON IN A NEW, Portable, \\&quot;TAKE-WITH-YOU-EVERYWHERE\\&quot; SOLID COMPACT FORM!( What An ADORABLE Little Compact!) Check Sephora.com for product availability!</li>
    <li> I have the Eau de Toilette and the Deodorant Spray, and love them both. This fragrance is perfect. Not too heavy, not too light, it&#x27;s just beautiful. It does not get any girlier than this!</li>
    <li> The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it might be ok for someone very young.  I heard such great things about this and picked up a bottle only to be grossed out by the cotton candy smell.  It smells like a carnival, but I must say it is aptly named.  I gave the bottle to an 11-year old girl who liked it.</li>
    <li> One morning on my way to work, I was listening to Wild 95.5. They were going on and on about this cologne called \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot;. Kevin, Virginia and Jason were raving and I could almost smell the fragrance the way they were describing it.  The discussion went on forever.  A lot of listeners started calling in.  I have always been a Chanel girl, but I must say that this is different in a very good way.  It makes me feel good about myself. I put it on my hair and one of my male co-worker&#x27;s, older man smells my hair everyday and tells me the same thing. God, you smell so good.  You should also watch how much you put on, because it can be strong.  I always put warm vanilla body cream from bath &amp; body under all of my perfumes and I always love the smell. It is not sticky, so I don&#x27;t know why some people are giving it bad reviews, but then again, if you are putting some kind of chocolate, then go figure lady? Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different, so it may smell different on everyone.  Just go to the Sephora counter and tell them to give you a sample and see if you like it and then purchase.  I smelled it that first day and bought it and I am in love with it!!!! LP-WPB, Florida:)I hope I was able to help clarify some concerns. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a perfume I liked before, I think they pretty much all smell like old ladies.  Now this one on the other hand smells REALLY good, lasts all day, and isn&#x27;t too much.  It&#x27;s such a unique smell for a perfume.  I get complements wherever I go and have never heard one bad thing about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;my boyfriend really loves it too!!</li>
    <li> For those of you who have seen this product &amp; wondered what it smells like...Cotton Candy. State fair pink cotton candy. That won&#x27;t come off your skin. It&#x27;s a novel thing, but to me it&#x27;s definately a teenage girly scent. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t order it &amp; recieved a sample from Sephora instead of taking the chance I was thinking of taking.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for two reasons.  1.  It&#x27;s the top selling perfume from Sephora.  2.  Lots of good reviews of how delicious it smells (vanilla and toasty marshmallows).  I was dissapointed.  Okay, It doesn&#x27;t make you want to run from the hills, but it&#x27;s sickeningly sweet.  I agree with whoever said \\&quot;cheap cotton candy\\&quot;.  Buy this perfume if you like smelling like a state fair.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora and I tried it out one morning. It definitely last a long time like all the other reviewers have said. When my husband came home from work at night he hugged me and then said, \\&quot;You smell like marshmallows.\\&quot; I asked him if that was good or bad. I could mean I smell good or it could mean I smell like a fatty who ate a whole bag of marshmallows. He said he wasn&#x27;t sure if it was good that a perfume smells like actual candy but he loves it when I wear this scent. I still have not decided whether it&#x27;s good or bad that I smell like a bag of marshmallows.</li>
    <li> If you like Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Dessert line, you&#x27;ll love this. It is even better than Dessert because it really lasts! The smell is sweet and girly, but sexy. Worth every penny. I love catching a scent of it every once in a while thoughout the day.     And, while Dessert&#x27;s \\&quot;love potions\\&quot; do not have staying power and go on sticky, this is a real perfume. It lasts a good long while and it dries without a hint of that stickiness.     In addition to the perfume, I&#x27;ve also bought the body mousse and the deodorant.  The body mousse is light and fluffy and imparts a wonderful scent all day long.      Today at work several people stopped by my desk after I&#x27;d done a \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; spray of the perfume and commented how great it smelled!  I&#x27;d never gotten compliments like that at work before!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this new perfume as it was recommended by those who enjoy the new Dessert line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed.  The smell is great, a bit like cotton candy with some floral tones.  It lasts a really long time and is not at all sticky.  I keep getting so many compliments on it and I just got it for Christmas two days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes of all time. It lasts throughout the day and most \\&quot;candy\\&quot; fragrances dont. Instead of just smelling like cotton candy, this perfume is so much more complex and boy is it sexy.Its appropriate for all ages. Young girls, teenagers, mothers and even grandmothers! My grandmother loves this scent so much on me that she wants a bottle for herself!</li>
    <li> This perfum smells so great. It has a sweet, spicy smell to it that has everybody wondering what I&#x27;m wearing. I especially love pairing it with Prada body lotion. There&#x27;s something about this combination that makes me smell sooooo nice.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying that the only 2 perfumes that have ever lasted on me have been michael and glow. I went to sephora with a girlfriend today and we were in there for about 20-30 mins. At first I tried Curious by britney spears. After about 15 mins you couldn&#x27;t even smell it on me anymore. I had smelled a ton of perfumes but was intrigued by pink sugar merely by the name (pink is one of my favorite colors and my boyfriend calls me sugar). I sprayed it and LOVED it! We continued to shop and I kept catching whiffs of it. I saw my boyfriend later and he loved it too. Its now 10 hours later and I can still smell it on my skin and still catch whiffs. I&#x27;m in love! I&#x27;m going to buy it this week!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered some products from Sephora and a sample of Pink Sugar came with it. As soon as I tried it on, i fell in love!! I usually wear body sprays from Bath and Body Works but they wear off quick, but not Pink Sugar! It lasts all day and I get so many compliments. Its not a strong scent but it stays on. My brother in law asked what I wanted for xmas and got me the gift set! It is the best smelling perfume!!! yummy!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume after my mom told me about a sample she got of it and I hadn&#x27;t even smelt it yet, it just sounded good. I&#x27;m usually allergic to perfume, and can only wear body sprays which don&#x27;t last long, so I was taking a risk getting this. I absolutely love it! No allergies or headaches, and it trully lasts! The smell reminds me of a fair or carnival, a mixture of cotton candy and carmel, with a lot of great scents mixed in! My husband is also sensitive to most perfumes, and he really likes this one. It&#x27;s really the best scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled in a perfume. I don&#x27;t think anyone can go wrong with this perfume!</li>
    <li> I get stopped on the street by strangers asking what scent I am wearing. I have many different perfumes I wear everyday (about 24)but this one is my favorite. It is more food than floral(men like that better anyway- my hubby loves this one) and is light for everyday wear. I also like Lolitta Lempika and Herve Leger, they are along the same family of scent. You won&#x27;t regret buying this for everyday!!!</li>
    <li> I first smelled PINK SUGAR when I was browsing my sister in laws&#x27; body sprays and perfumes&#x27; she keeps in her bathroom, seeing the cute bottle with fushia swirls tempted me to take a sniff (being I have always wanted to find a perfume I could actually wear, and not give me a headache)...wow!! I loved it!! &lt;br /&gt;Pure perfection!  I, seriously, have never smelled anything better...I had to try to locate it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went to my local Sephora store and sprayed it all over me...suprisingly it lasted all day!  It&#x27;s so sweet and light, just long lasting... and marshmellowy or cotton candy like with gentle hints of vanilla and spice.  I love all vanilla scents, and this is the best one!  The only perfume I can wear.  Better smelling than any Victoria Secret or bath and body works Body Spray!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want to get Chocolovers too....love those candy scents!</li>
    <li> After reading tons of great reviews and receiving a sample lotion from a friend, I decided to buy this at Nordstrom. Oh I love this scent so very much. &lt;br /&gt;The aroma is sort of sweet like cotton candy and at times I can sense hints of caramel. I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t last long on me and I actually have to refresh several times throughout the day, but I think that&#x27;s just me as I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s strong on others. &lt;br /&gt;This perfume is so worth it for the price. I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on it too. I love the way it makes me feel - girly and sweet, like a princess. DEFINITELY WILL buy again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the first reviewer.  The dessert beauty line tends to fade and is quite sticky (except for the body shimmers.. but those fade easily too). This scent really lasts, is not sticky, and smells sweeter than the dessert beauty line.  It smells like cotton candy, and marshmellow, and crepe, and butter, and donuts.. all those sweet treats that make your mouth water and it brings back good childhood memories.  Love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> This perfume is so powerful, that I only wear it at night while out on the town. Guys go CRAZY! I have been pulled at and grabbed at while wearing this. My co-worker&#x27;s stated I smell like cotton-candy, and I feel that it is too sweet (and valuable) to wear everyday at work. One of my gay co-workers (I&#x27;m a girl; he&#x27;s a guy) almost jumped over a counter to get to me the first time he smelled it. It will definitely cause a \\&quot;physical\\&quot; reaction by those who smell it on you. I am so absoutely jealous over this scent, that I have told no females what it is; I want it all to myself. And if Aquolina ever discontinues it, I really need to know in advance so I can stock up 3 bottles worth and get a head start on the grieving process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those of you who just want to know what it SMELLS like: I&#x27;d say the notes I smell are Cotton-Candy, Sugar, Wood, and Musk. It&#x27;s warm, spicy, and innocently sexy. You WILL get results! I don&#x27;t know why others say it lasts long, though. It doesn&#x27;t last on me, or else it&#x27;s just that it blends so well on me that I just seem to \\&quot;sink\\&quot; into it. Recommend it for the cute, confident, sexy chick who knows she is just that!</li>
    <li> Ive never ordered a perfume based on reviews alone, but this seemed just like something I would like, and I did! To me it smells like a powdered cotton candy when you first apply it. Hours later you can still smell it, but the scent improves with time. If you like sweet powdery scents, youll like this one! And if you dont, then send the rest of the bottle to me.</li>
    <li> My husband brought home a tiny sample bottle of this perfume and from the moment I took out the stopper and smelled it I was hooked! It&#x27;s been many years since I got excited over ANY perfume, but I absolutely love the wonderful fragrance (aroma really) of this one! It reminds me of cotton candy, of gorgeous roses, of warm cinamon rolls, of a hundred wonderful and enticing smells we encounter at happy times throughout childhood and our adult life. Smelling it brings back delightful memories. I hate to go through a day without it&#x27;s beautiful fragrance wafting up to me here and there throughout the day. I&#x27;m definitely addicted!</li>
    <li> I know you don&#x27;t need another review saying how great this perfume is and you are probably out now ,running to buy Pink Sugar(if you hadn&#x27;t already).It really is a nice perfume.It&#x27;s as if a pink cloud of sweets and candies covers me everytime i wear it.  It&#x27;s very musky,smells kinda masmellow-y and lasts F-O-R E-V-E-R!I can smell a hint of lemon freshness when i first apply it.  I sprayed on my jacket once and when i wore my jacket again-2 weeks later-i could still smell Pink Sugar.  Even a guy friend of mine liked it when i \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; sprayed him.  Its smell varies.Some times it smells more like candy others more powdery or sharp.I wouldn&#x27;t say that Pink Sugar is my signature scent,but it&#x27;s definately like no other perfume.I wore it this morning at 8 and its scent keeps wafting up to my nose!One day i wore this to go to school and when my teacher entered the class,she said:\\&quot;something smells like caramel in here!And waffles and candy!\\&quot;and she just kept sniffing and sniffing!Yeah,it was me!I love this perfume so much,that i bought two 3.4 oz.bottles and i&#x27;ve almost used up my first one.Great,comforting and not stickingly sweet scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d gotten a sample of this from a local Sephora&#x27;s cos I LOVE sweet scents like this. Smells great in the bottle, but NOT on me. A few months later, decided to give it another shot. Got another sample. Same thing. Smells SOOOO delicious when I put my nose to the bottle as well as on the little sampler paper stick thing. However, when I put it on me, it smelled like burnt rubber. I&#x27;m givin&#x27; it three stars cos I don&#x27;t wanna give it a totally horrible review just cos it doesn&#x27;t work with MY body chemistry. I&#x27;ve been wearing Body Fantasies Cotton Candy collection which on me, smells much better as evidenced by the many compliments I receive as well as my own happy, l&#x27;il nose.</li>
    <li> I soooooooo love this perfume.  One whiff and you are immediately hooked.  As described by previous reviewers, it has a vanilla base but it seems to smell like cotton candy to me.  One thing, however, is that the smell does not seem to last long on me.  In fact, it only seems to last about an hour. I highly recommend this product but would caution the buyer that several refreshers are needed. But then again, for the price, who really cares?  Perhaps I will email Aquolina and inquire for a parfum.</li>
    <li> I really smell the peach in this, and thats why I love it. I love how its mixed in with the powdery florals. Its not heavy, its sexy without trying too hard and there is something old fashioned about it but it has a modern twist. I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> I love the way this perfume makes me smell. People compliment me on this scent all the time. I&#x27;ve had people think I smelled like chocolate chip cookies, vanilla cupcakes, cotton candy etc.It&#x27;s not too overpowering which I love.Even if I spray a lot on before I leave the house it never is overwhelming and it seems to last for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> which is a good thing in my field.  People say I smell warm and yummy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FYI do not wear out in the wilderness or you will attract bees.</li>
    <li> After hearing all the rattle about this perfume, I decided to try it out myself. I&#x27;m a true lover for Vanilla scents, so I was pretty hyped about trying this esscence out. After putting it on myself, I found that it was very sweet, but nonetheless nice. However, It was quite strong, and took quite some time before settling out. The Caramel really helped to enhance the sweet strong scent. Now having said that, I did get compliments on it. People were saying that it smelt really good, which I do agree with.</li>
    <li> I have one word to describe this perfume:  YUM!</li>
    <li> A LITTLE OF THIS STUFF GOES A LONNNNG WAY. LONG LASTING.. ID COMPARE THE SCENT TO JESSICA SIMPSONS COTTONCANDY+ SOMETHING FLOWERY MIXED IN..SMELLS GOOD IS  JUST SUPER STRONG</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate favorite. I have never had so many compliments and people asking what it is and where I got it. I simply love it.</li>
    <li> I wear this perfume almost every day and get many compliments on it.  It is a little over-sweet at first but quickly changes to a much softer sweet smell. It is feminine and makes me feel good when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I got a small sample of this when I ordered from Sephora, it smells like a Silky Cotton Candy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me think a bouncy blonde in a short skirt would wear this, it smells very sexy and cute at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lasts for quite a while too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in the body lotion based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation that the scent of the lotion lingers longer than the other products in the line. This is a fun, playful scent which smells like the sweetness of cotton candy. I would not recommend the body lotion for it moisutizing properties but rather more for a smell good lotion which has long lasting staying power. This makes for a good spring &amp; summertime scent.</li>
    <li> I had wanted to smell this for a long time after reading so many positive reviews. I finally got the chance to try it and was so disappointed! It smelled like licorice, but in a bad way. The smell made me cough every time I smelled it. I had sprayed it on my arm and throughout the day, I kept smelling to see if it changed but the licorce scent stayed all day. I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t buy this before I smelled it. I would advise you to smell before you buy.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent, but I must caution others that, depending on what they use for a body wash, this scent can get stinky when it mixes with what is already on your body.  Use a body wash that does not leave a scent and you should be ok.  Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so what smells heavenly on one person can smell like Raid bug spray on someone else. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried this after using the Aquolina Chocolovers Body Souffle.  I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t soften my skin as much as the Chocolovers.  My skin smells sweet and it&#x27;s soft, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.  I don&#x27;t like the results enough to justify paying the $30 for the 8.5 oz tub.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting to like this perfume.  I generally don&#x27;t like things that smell like food, and the stuff I like tends to be the stuff that everyone else hates (and vice versa).  So, given the wild popularity of Pink Sugar, and the fact that it&#x27;s touted as the ultimate sweet, sugary fragrance, I figured I&#x27;d hate it.  But then I tried it, and much to my surprise, I loved it.  The scent is a very hard one for me to describe- the best adjective I can come up with is pink.  It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like cotton candy or cake to me (I don&#x27;t really care for those scents), more sweet, with some depth.  I&#x27;ve found that this fragrance lasts a long time on me, and I love smelling it.  This was a surprising winner.</li>
    <li> I just got a chance to sample this with my latest Sephora order and I am highly impressed with the scent. Its a very sweet, light, whimsical scent. It first smells of cotton candy (on me) and then you can smell a slight floral scent as it starts blending in the skin. It is a GREAT scent for those who love a very feminine scent, or those who cannot handle super strong, bowl you over perfume. I put on a bit earlier today and it has lastes ALL day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definately a scent I plan to purchase on a regular basis. I recommend it to anyone, from young girls, to older girls who want something light and fun for their scent \\&quot;repertoire\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile back when I visited Sephora for the first time. I really liked the smell of it, but was awfully wasteful of it (I basically showered myself in it). One day while browsing on amazon, I came across it up for sale and read some of the reviews. I found out it was a real hit with the guys. Needless to say, I went back to Sephora and bought 2 bottles of it. Shortly after, my boyfriend was telling me how great I smelled. My advice? Buy this product and don&#x27;t be wasteful with it. Enjoy it for as long as you can and others will enjoy it too!</li>
    <li> This perfume is the ULTIMATE in girly. I sampled it at a local Sephora, and it lasted all day. That&#x27;s when I decided to go back and buy it.    It lasts especially long in the hair or on clothes; when sprayed on my pajamas, I woke up in the morning with the smell of roasted marshmallows filling my nose.    This perfume also has a good array of notes. When first sprayed, it smells like a donut, almost. Then, later on in the day, it shifts to graham cracker, then to marshmallow.    I love it! I strongly suggest it to anyone, although it will seem especially fitting to anyone who is fun-loving or especially girly.</li>
    <li> I purchased Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Taste perfume, and it smells great when you first apply it.  But, it leaves a sticky residue and the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  I just purchased Pink Sugar and I&#x27;m hooked!  It smells even better than the Dessert line and the scent lasts a very long time.  I sprayed it on at lunch time, and I still smelled it when I woke up the next morning.  If you&#x27;re willing to spend $45 on a 1.7 oz of the Dessert fragrance, than it&#x27;s definitely worth it to spend $5 more on a bottle of Pink Sugar that&#x27;s 3.4 oz!  I definitely have a new favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> If you like caramel or cotton candy, then you&#x27;ll love this. It&#x27;s great! It lasts a really long time if you put enough on initially. There&#x27;s nothing to lose with this one!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews on this perfume, I expected it to be very light and girly. &lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on it was almost overhelming in it&#x27;s licorice and musk aromas. It did quickly fade to a more wearable level with a subtle sweetness. The scent did last all day. My husband is a big fan of black licorice (lucky for me!) and kept telling me I smelled wonderful. He found the vanilla and musk to be very sexy. I will buy it again but it is heavier than I expected. Men reacted more positively than women, but isn&#x27;t that why most of us wear perfume, to be attractive to the opposite sex?!</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a friend a week ago for the first time &amp; I wanted to literally chew her wrist off it smelled so yummy. I have to have this perfume!! I am so glad she told me the name &amp; didn&#x27;t keep it a secret! LOL  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason Jessica Simpson&#x27;s line is sticky is because it has sugar in it...ugh!!! I gave a sample to my sister and she didn&#x27;t like it either. Nice smell but who needs sticky?  I also get headaches from perfumes and I like florals like Lulu which doesn&#x27;t give me headaches but Pink Sugar will be a nice change from the regular and this scent is absolutely intriguing and beautiful - yummy, pleasing and whimsical as well as sexy. I sure hope it smells as good on me as it did on my friend!!  Personally I didn&#x27;t think it smelled like black licorice or musky as some other reviewers have said..but that&#x27;s just me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to get it from my Christmas list - and if I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m gonna get it first thing!!</li>
    <li> I work at a hotel, so often when I walk into a room if it smells really nice I will take a peek in their bathroom in the hope that they will have a bottle of perfume to associate with the nice smell.  It was just such a time that I happened across Pink Sugar.  When I saw how beautiful the bottle was I had to have it.  I soon realized that no stores anywhere near me carried the Aquolina line so I ordered it off Sephora.com.  I find that the initial spray is quite strong and carries a musky scent that I don&#x27;t really like.  When it dries down however it starts to smell really good, like a creamy Vanilla smell and a slight hint of a bergamot smell.  My favourite, however, is smelling this on your clothes and blankets after the day is over and that wonderful smell, like marshmallows that it leaves on your skin when you wake up in the morning.  I love Pink Sugar, I really do, but I just wish the initial smell wasn&#x27;t so strong and musky and that they had left out the patchouli because I can really smell it when I first spray it and smell my wrist.  I think the price is great (I got a huge 3.4oz bottle for $70CDN)and the packaging is gorgeous.  All my friends are copying me now because they love it so much.  I suggest buying the 1oz bottle to try it out if you&#x27;re not sure because it&#x27;s only $25US.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like any of the \\&quot;gourmand\\&quot; scents, you might not like Pink Sugar. Some people have wondered about the ingredients, or scents used to make this unique product. You can read the description, but you MUST smell it to see why it&#x27;s been on Sephora&#x27;s &#x27;Best Sellers&#x27; list since they started carrying it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The perfume notes are as followed: &lt;br /&gt;Bergamot, Sicilian Orange, Raspberry, Fig Leaves, Lily of the Valley, Licorice, Strawberry, Red Fruits, Cotton Candy, Barbe-a-Papa (French for \\&quot;Papa&#x27;s beard\\&quot; but it actually means &#x27;candy floss&#x27;, or &#x27;cotton candy&#x27;), Vanilla, Caramel, Musk, Wood, and Powder (barely perceptable powdery note).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even though it does smell very marshmallowy (yum), there is no marshmallow in it. Marshmallows as we know them are a spongy confection formerly made from the root of the marshmallow but now it&#x27;s made from corn syrup, sugar, etc. It might be the barbe-a-papa/cotton candy, vanilla and caramel that gives it that lovely marshmallowy smell. &lt;br /&gt;The licorice note itself is not very strong. It&#x27;s the bergamot - the primary ingredient in Earl Grey tea - that smells a bit like licorice, so that&#x27;s most likely what you&#x27;re smelling, as the licorice smell is very faint. &lt;br /&gt;The perfume has a lovely \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; scent, also known as the &#x27;bottom&#x27; or &#x27;base&#x27; notes, of musk, vanilla, and caramel with a little bit of powder and cotton candy. Bottom, or base notes are what you have left once the &#x27;top&#x27; (first) notes and the &#x27;middle&#x27; notes (after the top notes fade and the bottom notes begin, approx. 20-30 minutes after scent is applied) have evaporated.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pepper on the bottle, according to the makers of Pink Sugar, Aquolina, symbolizes the \\&quot;special spicy, appetizing and sensual quality that has contributed to the success and recognizability of all the products in the line\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it since it came to the U.S. and could not stop sniffing myself and the bottle for the longest time. I own everything available in the line (layer, layer, layer for longevity!). It&#x27;s so luscious, it&#x27;s almost edible. It is the best of the \\&quot;gourmand\\&quot; scents in my opinion.</li>
    <li> i went to sephora and i saw this and i thought, how cute and girly! and when i sprayed it on, i was in heaven. it smells like cotton candy, but in a great and kinda sexy way - not a cotton candy cheap body spray smell. the bottle is pretty and decently sized too!! it stays on forever too. it&#x27;s highly recommended for girly girls and ppl who like sweet smelling stuff. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful scent.  As girly as the scent is, it smells distinctively like a high-quality perfume, and not a store-brand, sickly-sweet body splash.  You won&#x27;t smell like food with this on lol.  You won&#x27;t walk around smelling simply of cotton candy. You will, however, still smell like the notes in Pink Sugar&#x27;s formula - a great combination of sugars and spices!  This is my favorite EDT (and my husband loves it!).</li>
    <li> I looooove this perfume, its not nearly as strong as all those other \\&quot;candy-scented-products\\&quot; that are really popular right now, but it still manages to have a distinct smell, that&#x27;s like a fresh vinalla cake mixed with a bunch a fresh flowers, that will last ALL DAY. I mean this perfume lasted me through math, science,history, gym class and still when i got to lunch my guy friends said they were just watering at the mouth I smelled so good.The smell is fantastic and the price for the small size is beyong beliefits so good- $25  and one spray lasts all day!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this scent! I received a sample from Sephora and immediatly had to order the entire line. I&#x27;m 31 and have never come across a scent I thought I could wear for the rest of my life but this is it! It is quite a sweet smell but it&#x27;s a nice warm smell. I guess because it does smell like baked goods (waffles sprinkled with powdered sugar at first). It really does last all day. I love it! I hope they continue making it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> i bought this at sephora on the advice of another reviewer. it definitely delivers! beautiful smell that lasts all day long.&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is the real deal in sugar sweet, miles ahead of the jessica simpson line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth every penny&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I discovered Pink Sugar through a sample from Sephora. Based on the name and cotton candy reviews, I had expected a frivolous, inconsequential summer scent. Those expectations were dead wrong. Paired with my chemistry, I found Pink Sugar to be a complex marriage of warm sweet citrus, non-cloying floral and powdery vanilla spice. I don&#x27;t seem to be reminded of candy or pastries, but this is definitely a comfort scent. It is lovely solo, but my favorite aspect of Pink Sugar is the ease with which it blends with other scents. It doesn&#x27;t fundamentally distort them. Rather, it warms and lightens them. If I use it with a light floral, it warms it. If I use it with a floral oriental or woody oriental, my favorite scents, it softens and contemporizes it. Even perfumes that are not my favorites smell better paired with Pink Sugar. I have never encountered another perfume product like this one. Perhaps a perfume mixing adventure will not appeal to others, but this product has expanded my scent repertoire. My purchases include the eau de toilette, powder, body gel and deodorant - and I do that depth of buying only with a scent I love. Kudos, Aquolina!</li>
    <li> I just got my bottle of Pink Sugar in the mail today! &lt;br /&gt;Now bear in mind, I own many bottles of spendy perfume from Chanel, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, Lancome, DKNY and more that I would gladly DUMP down the toilet if it meant getting more Pink Sugar! This is how much I LOVE this stuff!!! If anyone wants to get rid of theirs, email me and we can do some trading!  &lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot wear strong,heavy perfumes...but ladies this is it! IT smells,sweet,fresh,yet innocent &amp; sexy...I LOVE IT! It is not too much and it lasts all day! My son even said he wished he was a girl so he could wear it LOL! Everyone compliments me everywhere I go with this on! Now i dont know if i would describe it as marshmellowy..but it definately smells sweet &amp; edible,but not like cheap drugstore smells...you wont be disappointed...this smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Pink Sugar is a deliciously great smelling prefume...It really smells like fresh cotton candy and i bought cause it smelled like fresh goodies!..Although it is a lovely perfume i don&#x27;t find it strong enough for my taste. If you like strong perfumes go with a fragrance like Lolita Lempicka or Angel...hope that helps</li>
    <li> It really is a nice light scent. I love the smell, and yes it does smell exactly like cotton candy...I was in a room full of people and everyone was talking about how something smelled like cotton candy. It does have a secondary scent of lemons, but you will notice it just smells sweet. It really is a nice product and is a bargain, I have had more expensive perfume that went sour after an hour on me, this does not change.</li>
    <li> I love this Pink Sugar Perfume! It lasts all day and isn&#x27;t so potient and strong like other perfumes.I smell clean,sweet,and sexy, yet classy. It also compliments the V.S. vanilla lace lotion I use after showering. This scent is quite original and does not smell cheap. The bottle is very cute.It is made in Italy and the ingredients are high quality. My boyfriend loves this scent on me! The sales person at Nordstrom said that this perfume was flying off the shelves....(I really was hoping this was going to be my found treasure...)Aquolina even offers a creamy perfume solid...which is a little perfume compact perfect for putting in your purse.I highly recommend this esp. to the good girly girls (and the bad ones too);) [...]</li>
    <li> one of My \\&quot;boys\\&quot; bought this for Me (perfumed sugar bath) and well I hated it, the smell was nice in the box... but once in the tub I could barely smell it, and I used 2 cubes!!!  it did not leave the scent on My skin at all, Im very disappointed, tho I did like the smell so I may buy the actual perfume and hope for better results. ****Updated Aug 29th 2006***** I did buy the perfume and its just ok, doesnt last very long and has a odd but good scent.  I might buy again, not sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goddess Electra</li>
    <li> I agree that it smells like Cotton Candy but I do not think its the best scent out there. My husband thinks it smells like Vanilla and hates Vanilla, so this is NOT one of his favorites. It is a light smell and kinda girly so if thats what your looking for, than this is for you!</li>
    <li> I hated it!I was so ecxited to smell this at ULTA because I read so many good reviews.I was very disappointed.It smelled like licorice and it was very strong.Nothing about this smells sugary,sweet or appealing.Don&#x27;t waste your money.And if you want to disregard my review at least smell it for yourself.</li>
