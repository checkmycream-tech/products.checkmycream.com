      <li>Nice comb.</li>

      <li>This comb looks nice.</li>
      <li>It kind of looks like a doll comb.</li>
      <li>I received this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased product evaluation, however all thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured, amazing quality 10/10 !!</li>
      <li>Great styling comb, stays fairly clean</li>
      <li>Teeth were filed very smoothly.</li>
      <li>product page makes a lot of interesting claims, and like I said, I can&#x27;t vouch for most of them.</li>
      <li>What I love the most about this comb is the fact that it does not pull out my hair when combing it.</li>
      <li>Does not eliminate static (which was the reason I purchased it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>It does feel very nice with my very curly hair.  </li>

      <li>I needed a comb that wasn&#x27;t one of those cheap plastic pocket combs.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product on my hair.</li>
      <li>An overall great quality comb.</li>
      <li>Been using this comb everyday for months now and it is awesome.</li>
      <li>Nice quality and arrived fast</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure how accurate the claims are under the description, but it is definitely a pretty comb.</li>
      <li>but when i need to its super easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
      <li>No experience with wet hair, but the comb itself is beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Wood looks much greener than pictured here, but otherwise it&#x27;s an incredibly classy comb that works great with my curly hair.</li>
      <li>; good enough endorsement for me.</li>
      <li>nice looking comb, but if you are looking for it due to static, then I would not spend this amount of money on a comb.</li>
      <li>My younger sister has fine and occasionally static prone hair, so we figured we&#x27;d give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
      <li>with my boyfriend, this is a nice comb for his hair and it also relaxes him as he gets headaches from not getting enough rest.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is way better than the cheap plastic combs I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;*sample</li>
      <li>Worth the money and way better than regular  plastic combs.</li>
      <li>The teeth are pretty well spaced too.</li>
      <li>I have very fine long hair.</li>
      <li>Overall very very nice - round and smooth and</li>
      <li>Also unlike another commentator, I actually do smell the wooden part and it smells really good.</li>
      <li>Glides through my beard perfectly even though my beard is thick and long.</li>
      <li>However it does help to calm down static prone hair.</li>
      <li>Thought it would be fine in my back pocket</li>
      <li>it came in the mail in a nice little box.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a real horn comb</li>
      <li>This is a well made comb and it is very durable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking online for telltale signs, and it seems like this one is real.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think it is real sandalwood.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a VERY good-looking comb that bridges the gap between the plastic wide-tooth shower comb</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>So she brushed her hair as usual with her paddle brush, and then used the comb towards the top to help tame the fly aways.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now, I can&#x27;t really compare with other sandal wood, so I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s supposed to be a stronger smell, but I have to say I was happy with that.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to dry it properly, as the coating can sometimes have gaps where the horn and wood meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I immediately heard a crack, so I stopped wiggling it as to not break my new purchase.</li>
      <li>And last, my concern was whether it was real ox horn.</li>
      <li>It also looked classy.</li>
      <li>Will probably last for years, as long as you clean it regularly to keep the tines from wearing out.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t particularly bad or strong, but it is noticeable and therefore worth noting.</li>

<li> It isn&#x27;t particularly bad or strong, but it is noticeable and therefore worth noting.</li>
<li> It really doesn&#x27;t pull on it, and I think I&#x27;m losing less than I was with the wide toothed plastic comb I&#x27;ve used for ages.  </li>
<li> Wide Tooth Comb Natural Green Sandal Wood Comb &amp; Black Ox Horn Comb&amp;#34;, but mine looks exactly like this one.</li>
<li> Should last him a long time.</li>
<li> Unlike a few of the commentators, I haven&#x27;t smelled anything bad with this comb, but if you do, then it&#x27;s a good sign</li>
<li> Also, since I took the comb out of the box, smell is barely there - and real sandalwood retains it&#x27;s smell for years.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention that the wooden part is dyed a weird green (which, too, started fading already).</li>
<li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
<li> It is hard to believe but it actually makes my wife&#x27;s hair softer and calmer too.</li>
<li> Out of the package, it DOES have a slight odd smell, which may bother some people.  </li>
<li> Now, someone else wrote that it was painted green, not sure about that, but mine is definitely not painted green!  </li>
<li> I bought this comb a little less than two months ago and just today two teeth broke off while it was being used and now this comb is unusable.  </li>
<li> The only draw back is that when you comb wet hair and the combs gets wet it smells quite bad.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using and the little teasing comb that I keep with my beauty products.</li>
<li> My hair is getting thin and this does not snag or pull out what little is left.</li>
<li> Heavy and not flimsy.</li>
<li> I know how sandalwood smells, owing a few items already, and this is not it.</li>
<li> It creates no static.</li>
<li> There is absolutely no static.</li>
<li> I think people who complain about the smell are either crazy or reviewing a different product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really small!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s very hard (which plastic would not be).  </li>
<li> Unlike my poor abused plastic comb, this one doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to lift up with it.  </li>
<li> Has a slight horn smell but not anything unpleasant.</li>
<li> It has a smell of synthetic glue +fake sandalwood smell.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m confused and would like an explanation!</li>
<li> Silly me.  </li>
<li> I opened it and was disappointed.</li>
<li> However, it smells awful.  </li>

    <li> This brush is amazing, the weight is perfect. It creates no static.</li>
    <li> Helps reduce frizz in my lightweight flyaway hair.</li>
    <li> I think people who complain about the smell are either crazy or reviewing a different product. Mine has a pleasant scent, but nothing overwhelming. It&#x27;s a VERY good-looking comb that bridges the gap between the plastic wide-tooth shower comb I&#x27;ve been using and the little teasing comb that I keep with my beauty products. Hoping this can replace both!</li>
    <li> I bought this comb a little less than two months ago and just today two teeth broke off while it was being used and now this comb is unusable.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wood looks much greener than pictured here, but otherwise it&#x27;s an incredibly classy comb that works great with my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this for his beard</li>
    <li> This was a gift. I asked. she said &amp;#34;it&#x27;s great&amp;#34; good enough endorsement for me.</li>
    <li> Broke after a couple of days and leaves my hair kind of staticky.</li>
    <li> the package is legit and the comb is awesome</li>
    <li> Nice quality and arrived fast</li>
    <li> I must say , my son loves this comb and to tell you the truth so do I .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy another one so that I don&#x27;t have to steal my son&#x27;s anymore .</li>
    <li> I am a man. I needed a comb that wasn&#x27;t one of those cheap plastic pocket combs. I bought this thinking it looked well made. It also looked classy. it came in the mail in a nice little box. I opened it and was disappointed. It&#x27;s really small! It kind of looks like a doll comb. The teeth are pretty well spaced too. Not really what I was looking for. It does look nice, however. I wanted to see how well made it was, so I wiggled the buffalo horn teeth while holding the wood handle. I immediately heard a crack, so I stopped wiggling it as to not break my new purchase. This comb looks nice. That&#x27;s it. Give it to your daughter to use on her doll.</li>
    <li> It is made as it is pictured, which is great.  However, it smells awful.  It has a smell of synthetic glue +fake sandalwood smell.  I really don&#x27;t think it is real sandalwood.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this comb everyday for months now and it is awesome. Dropped it multiple times and never broke or cracked. Worth the money and way better than regular  plastic combs.</li>
    <li> it is a great product,</li>
    <li> This brush does the job and helps reduce tangle hair pulling! Glad u was able to try out this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how accurate the claims are under the description, but it is definitely a pretty comb. My younger sister has fine and occasionally static prone hair, so we figured we&#x27;d give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind it is definitely not something you&#x27;ll want to use on tangled hair. It&#x27;s probably more of a finishing comb. So she brushed her hair as usual with her paddle brush, and then used the comb towards the top to help tame the fly aways.&lt;br /&gt;The product page makes a lot of interesting claims, and like I said, I can&#x27;t vouch for most of them. However it does help to calm down static prone hair. I received this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased product evaluation, however all thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> No experience with wet hair, but the comb itself is beautiful.  The wooden handle is finished very nicely and the black comb is fitted in perfectly.  The workmanship is amazing.  It is a pleasure just to hold it in hand.  It does feel very nice with my very curly hair.  My hair is getting thin and this does not snag or pull out what little is left. The packaging was just as nice to look at, but very exotic because I know nothing of Chinese calligraphy.</li>
    <li> This comb is great if you have staticy hair, as I do.  Unlike my poor abused plastic comb, this one doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to lift up with it.  It&#x27;s sturdily built, with close-set tines/teeth, which I prefer.  Will probably last for years, as long as you clean it regularly to keep the tines from wearing out.  It has a shiny coating, so you can run water over it despite the wood.  Just make sure to dry it properly, as the coating can sometimes have gaps where the horn and wood meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  Out of the package, it DOES have a slight odd smell, which may bother some people.  It isn&#x27;t particularly bad or strong, but it is noticeable and therefore worth noting.</li>
    <li> Unlike a few of the commentators, I haven&#x27;t smelled anything bad with this comb, but if you do, then it&#x27;s a good sign it&#x27;s a real horn comb (hoping I haven&#x27;t gotten tricked and sent a plastic one!). Also unlike another commentator, I actually do smell the wooden part and it smells really good. Now, I can&#x27;t really compare with other sandal wood, so I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s supposed to be a stronger smell, but I have to say I was happy with that.  Now, someone else wrote that it was painted green, not sure about that, but mine is definitely not painted green!  And last, my concern was whether it was real ox horn. I&#x27;ve been looking online for telltale signs, and it seems like this one is real. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and I can&#x27;t see any grains, but it&#x27;s very hard (which plastic would not be).  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product on my hair. It really doesn&#x27;t pull on it, and I think I&#x27;m losing less than I was with the wide toothed plastic comb I&#x27;ve used for ages.  ***UPDATE***, I&#x27;ve just noticed that my official purchase was on this comb: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LD0JGAG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 &amp;#34;Karsd Hair Combs Handmade Comb Wide Tooth Comb Natural Green Sandal Wood Comb &amp; Black Ox Horn Comb&amp;#34;, but mine looks exactly like this one. There is no logo on it, no company name to tell the difference.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m confused and would like an explanation!</li>
    <li> Its a very good sturdy comb. Heavy and not flimsy. It doesnt snag or break my hair. I have very fine long hair. Its the best comb I ever had. There is absolutely no static.</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe but it actually makes my wife&#x27;s hair softer and calmer too. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the scalp at all. The only draw back is that when you comb wet hair and the combs gets wet it smells quite bad. I guess buffalo horns are stinky ha ha.</li>
    <li> An overall great quality comb. While watching t.v. with my boyfriend, this is a nice comb for his hair and it also relaxes him as he gets headaches from not getting enough rest. This is a well made comb and it is very durable. It comes in a beautiful box which looks presentable when sending this as a gift. Father&#x27;s Day is coming up and this would be a beautiful and affordable gift for your father. What I love the most about this comb is the fact that it does not pull out my hair when combing it. It helps to untangle my hair without adding the frustration of losing my hair. Overall, this is way better than the cheap plastic combs I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;*sample given for reviewing and testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Does not eliminate static (which was the reason I purchased it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong odor on the comb, that I have gotten used to now, but was thrown off by at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion...nice looking comb, but if you are looking for it due to static, then I would not spend this amount of money on a comb.</li>
    <li> Bought this comb for my son, he likes it. Should last him a long time.</li>
    <li> Great wood handle. Has a slight horn smell but not anything unpleasant. Teeth were filed very smoothly. Nice comb.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured, amazing quality 10/10 !!</li>
    <li> Overall very very nice - round and smooth and the horn comb is perfectly fitted to wooden handle.&lt;br /&gt;But in NO WAY this is a sandalwood handle - I know how sandalwood smells, owing a few items already, and this is not it. Also, since I took the comb out of the box, smell is barely there - and real sandalwood retains it&#x27;s smell for years.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention that the wooden part is dyed a weird green (which, too, started fading already).</li>
    <li> Silly me.  Thought it would be fine in my back pocket but not.....snaggletooth.</li>
    <li> This brush is study and well made. I toss it in my pocket, cup holder of my truck, backpack for class, literally everywhere I go! If and when the day comes and this brush needs to be put to rest I will gladly build a small ship and burn it on the open water like the small viking combing man brush that it is.</li>
    <li> Great comb. No tangles.</li>
