      <li>This product has a nice texture and feel.  </li>
      <li>the effect, conditioning-wise, is all that much more significant than a really good conditioner, but it was pleasant to use nevertheless.  </li>
      <li>I love Fekkai products, and when I saw this hair mask had a rose scent</li>
      <li>And wow, my colored locks came out great!</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price I have seen on these items so far with Target being the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I needed more conditioning and moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>What she noted most though, was the lack of fading of her hair between her hair colorings.</li>
      <li>OK to use sparingly - work in, concentrating on ends and lengths.  </li>
      <li>I love Fekkai products.</li>
      <li>love love LOVE this conditioning mask.</li>

      <li>This conditioner smells wonderful, and the scent stays in your hair for several hours afterward, even if you just use a teensy bit like I do.  </li>
      <li>Of course, that is her problem, not mine. :)</li>
      <li>have been using Fekkai products now for about six months and love them more than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried on the market.  </li>
      <li>More like something you would pack in a carry-on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It rinses out well with no buildup, but I did sort of expect a bit more conditioning.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and moisturized, and smelling great.</li>
      <li>the Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask sound like what you may be looking for? :)  </li>
      <li>It is very mild, and I could not smell it on my hair afterwards, unless I really took a good sniff.</li>
      <li>I have tried other masks and this one ranks among the best.</li>
      <li>In short: A nice mild fragrance and the results are consistent with an excellent conditioner product with color protection.  </li>
      <li>It just seems to work best by focusing on the ends of your hair, and not so much on the roots (which is pretty much true for most masks, unless you really like greasy</li>
      <li>Fekkai&#x27;s rose scented Color Care Mask is infused with the oil of pure Grapeseed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy and easy to spread throughout your hair.  </li>
      <li>Another huge plus is that this does not pull the color out of my hair like some conditioners do.</li>
      <li>After rinsing the mask out of my hair, my hair is smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The texture feels like a smooth creme brulee, you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s teensy and fit in the palm of my hand.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of the mask, it is fresh and flowery.</li>
      <li>For an intense conditioning experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
      <li>This gives my hair body and causes it to look sleek and smooth and hold it&#x27;s shape after a blowout.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, both ways left my hair smelling great</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>It smells very nice and rinsed out cleanly, and my hair felt absolutely amazing after it dried.</li>
      <li>First of all, it smells fantastic!</li>
      <li>As long as you&#x27;re just looking for the color care benefits, you will be happy with it, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just apply to clean damp hair, wait 3-5 minutes, rinse.</li>
      <li>By the way, you have to kind of hunt for the directions, which can eventually be found under the double-layer label on the bottom of the jar (peel back the top</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean and I don&#x27;t have the build up</li>
      <li>It rinses clean and smells heavenly.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Nothing special in application . . .</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally blended shades of grey and this product worked perfectly on it!</li>
      <li>Because of the volume of my hair, I use a fair size dollop along with a big tooth comb in the shower to comb it through.  </li>
      <li>When I was done, my hair felt nice and soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a creamy thick conditioner which is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My hair was super smooth, incredibly shiny, and had very few tangles.  </li>
      <li>Obviously, for many, this is not the most cost-effective way to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another super Fekkai offering.</li>
      <li>However, it also seemed to volumize which for most people is a perk but for me, I definitely do not need any more volume</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally care for scented things but this product have a delicious scent, I would love it as a perfume, just lovely.&lt;br /&gt;The product is creamy and a soft pink color to it.</li>

      <li>Right now I can say that it&#x27;s not stripping my color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used various shampoos and conditioners and they all have left my hair looking beautiful.  </li>
      <li>The product seems effective at deeply conditioning your hair more than just a regular conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Yes, they do cost more than the regular drugstore products but they are worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not a thick rich mask.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this product ... which surprised me.</li>
      <li>I am hoping, that after several uses, it will brighten it a bit more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received a sample of items to try out. I am a hair junkie and have tried multiple brands. I have used exclusively salon quality products for the last 25 years. This mask is a nice mask for color treated hair. It is not the best that I have encountered but it is up there. The main problem that I have is that I feel there is a residue left in my hair. It gave me shine, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it made it any softer then my normal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also sensitive to smells and didn&#x27;t care for this fragrance. It was too overwhelming for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Like all Fekkai products, this one smells delicious.  It&#x27;s got a lush. fruity scent.  In terms of performance, this mask does provide soft, manageable hair.  I put this mask on in the shower, and then leave it on while I shower the rest of my body, shave, etc.  When I was done, my hair felt nice and soft and shiny.  I&#x27;m not sure the effect, conditioning-wise, is all that much more significant than a really good conditioner, but it was pleasant to use nevertheless.  This mask is meant to preserve color, and the jury&#x27;s still out on how well it does that.  I think it&#x27;s going to take a couple of months of use to make a real judgement there.  Right now I can say that it&#x27;s not stripping my color.  Be advised that this is a very small container.  While a little bit goes further than you think, be advised you&#x27;re getting a small pot.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally a dark/medium brown, and because I&#x27;m a glutton for punishment, I color it to a copper red. The coloring process of course leaves my hair dry, and since red dye is notorious for fading, I&#x27;m always in the market for a good conditioner that will restore my hair&#x27;s moisture and help maintain the red until it&#x27;s time to color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. The 1.69 oz container is tiny, but I had to use very little to get good coverage on my hair (which is fine and falls to the bottom of my shoulder blades). It smells very nice and rinsed out cleanly, and my hair felt absolutely amazing after it dried. It was soft and shiny and very manageable. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to judge whether or not it&#x27;s helping my red color stay put, but honestly, I&#x27;d use it just as a deep conditioner without the color maintenance properties.</li>
    <li> This Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask is marketed as a conditioner for color treated hair.  I color treat my much gray hair to a blend of dark brown with some of the gray. . . so I gave it a try.  In short: A nice mild fragrance and the results are consistent with an excellent conditioner product with color protection.  So far (a couple of uses), no deterioration in my color treatment - no strange yellowing or bluing of my gray - and no fading of my brown treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a faithful fan of Fekkai hair products and this appears to be up to their standards.  I&#x27;m using a small 1.69 oz jar in cr&amp;egrave;me form, but not much product is required - just a dab (over-conditioning can reduce volume).  The fragrance is feminine flowery (and I&#x27;m male) but mild and didn&#x27;t seem to linger so I&#x27;m good with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special in application . . . just apply to clean damp hair, wait 3-5 minutes, rinse. A tip is provided advising to wrap in a warm towel while waiting (rather than the towel wrap, I&#x27;ve found a shower cap while in the warm shower works well). OK to use sparingly - work in, concentrating on ends and lengths.  By the way, you have to kind of hunt for the directions, which can eventually be found under the double-layer label on the bottom of the jar (peel back the top label).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another super Fekkai offering. I received this jar in connection with a product evaluation program, but am a regular Fekkai purchaser at Amazon - the only hair line that I buy.</li>
    <li> While the Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask worked well to soften my hair, it did nothing for keeping it from feeling dried out. My hair gets very dry and brittle when colored and so I need an extra strength hydrating conditioner for it. I thought this might be the mask for me. Sadly, I have not seen any results with it helping me keep my color either. So disappointing in that respect. Smells nice. Good thick conditioner consistency. Didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive scalp. I&#x27;ve come to expect more from the Fekkai line and this product did not live up to expectations.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter to try and she was thrilled with it. She came running to show me the result after her first use.  She told me that her hair was never better even after only one use. It made her hair soft and full and shiny. The ends are perfect. The smell is nice and not overpowering. Her hair is somewhat thick to start but this made it even nicer and fuller.  Everything about the conditioner is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is a bit on the pricey side and now that she has used it she will want to keep using it. Of course, that is her problem, not mine. :)</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this product ... which surprised me. I&#x27;ve used one other Fekkai product before, the Prx Reparative Mask, and I didn&#x27;t like it very much. But I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this Color Care Mask! First of all, it smells fantastic! It&#x27;s thick, and a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used it once weekly for four weeks now, and I still have half the container left. My color has faded just a bit, but I didn&#x27;t have this until about a week after I last had my hair colored. I haven&#x27;t noticed any fade since I started using it. Also, this mask doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down at all. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I like this conditioning hair mask.  I&#x27;ve used it in the shower leaving it on for 3 minutes, and I&#x27;ve used it out of the shower by placing my wet hair in a warm dry towel for 10 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, both ways left my hair smelling great, it felt soft after blow drying and using a curling iron. The color look good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I think one could get the same results with other less expensive products.</li>
    <li> I love Fekkai products, and when I saw this hair mask had a rose scent, I was thrilled. So the good news: the scent is amazing! And if you&#x27;re like me - when you like the way something smells, you can&#x27;t get enough of it - the Color Care Mask seemed like perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downish side, though, the jar is small. I mean SMALL. I was really surprised. I kept wondering if there was enough product in the container to actually treat my hair. Surprisingly, a little goes a LONG way. I&#x27;m used to masks you slather on. This one,  you slather, but not with a ton of product. It just seems to work best by focusing on the ends of your hair, and not so much on the roots (which is pretty much true for most masks, unless you really like greasy hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrapped my hair up in plastic wrap, then a towel, for an hour. And wow, my colored locks came out great! Shiny, soft, and did I mention, smelling incredible? (I should&#x27;ve been embarrassed, but I kept picking up my hair to smell it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper. I just wish there was more product!</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask helps protects your hair color while doubling as a deep conditioner. You simply apply to damp/wet hair and leave in for 5-10 minutes. Fekkai recommends wrapping with a warm/hot towel (dry) to enhance the conditioning process. You can also blow dry on low heat setting I found this worked just as well for me. Afterwords my hair was amazingly soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a product to be used everyday it&#x27;s only 1.69 ounces so use once a week or every two weeks, and you only need a small amount. I have long thick curly hair and i only needed the size of a quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Color Mask/Conditioner to anyone with color treated hair or anyone with dry hair it works wonders.</li>
    <li> First I have to gush about how awesome this product smells.  Wow!!  I just wish it stayed in your hair a bit so you could keep smelling it!  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very thick, color treated hair.  Since it is long and thick I&#x27;d say it took about 1/3 of the container to coat my hair so that makes this product a bit steep for every day or even multiple times a week use.  However, I did like the product.  My hair is quite smooth and soft.  It seemed to also lay a bit straighter.  However, it also seemed to volumize which for most people is a perk but for me, I definitely do not need any more volume so it&#x27;s a bit of a bummer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the mask performed well but I&#x27;m not 100% sold for it to become a must-have in my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the small amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse hair to my mid back.&lt;br /&gt;The product smells nice, has a thick consistency&lt;br /&gt;I have used it weekly for the last 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It worked ok.&lt;br /&gt;I only color my roots, but it it seems to keep the color fresh</li>
    <li> Good things come in small packages. In this case, it&#x27;s a great thing and a very small package. just a dab of this mask goes a long way. The firming action is significant and long lasting. The scent is pleasing and the results are quite real. I have tried other masks and this one ranks among the best.</li>
    <li> Be super careful here ... this is a sample size. It looks like a little container of face moisturizer (just to give you an idea of its size). I have hair down to the middle of my back. Therefore, this jar contains approximately one and one-quarter treatments. Obviously, for many, this is not the most cost-effective way to purchase this product. This size is appropriate for sampling (especially for those with allergies) and perhaps for travel, but outside of that, the price-point here seems considerable exaggerated.  Now, the product itself feels nice when applying (it is a cross between a gel and a creme) and stays in-place while you wait the allotted time (so there are no uncomfortable drips or problems). It rinses clean and smells heavenly.  The results are better than what I experience with a traditional conditioner or even a leave-in. My hair was super smooth, incredibly shiny, and had very few tangles.  With all of this said, I feel compelled to give this particular product three-stars as a result of its miniscule size. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask 1.69 Oz, 1.690-Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Category: Hair Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Wrap hair in this intense, luscious conditioning mask to help protect the look of color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;• Awaken hair&#x27;s radiance and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes after using the Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask a few times:  My hair texture is super-fine, but very thick -- and to my waist. Fekkai&#x27;s rose scented Color Care Mask is infused with the oil of pure Grapeseed. After shampooing and rinsing hair, as usual, applied the Color Care Mask to my hair, as per instructions. Waited 3-5 minutes and rinsed thoroughly with clean water. The mask, itself has a silky-creamy, non-greasy, texture. A small amount goes a long way. Mask rinsed from hair with no problems, left over residue or tacky feeling. Combed hair out, blow-dryed and styled as usual. No weighted down look, or feel. My hair feels like silk with a very healthy looking shine! Beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Tip from the Fekkai Salon: For an intense conditioning experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;• This Technician Color Care Masque immerses every strand in protective conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles, sips espresso* &#x27;nuf said!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2015</li>
    <li> When this item first arrived, I was surprised to see such a small container. It&#x27;s teensy and fit in the palm of my hand.  That being said, there are a number of uses in the jar, especially if you use it once/week, as indicated. I have long, thick, curly hair and did not need much to cover it all.  This is a rich, thick hair mask, so you would not use as liberal an amount as you might with a thinner, every day conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent?  A bit odd, sort of citrus-y and rose mixed together. It is very mild, and I could not smell it on my hair afterwards, unless I really took a good sniff. But I wasn&#x27;t sitting there with a cloud of fragrance swirling around my head all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made my hair very soft and shiny. I like it! Will get another jar when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> This is ok, but not the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is very small, which is expected since the product info does say 1.69 oz. If you have shoulder length or longer hair, plan on this lasting through 2-3 uses. My hair is to the middle of my back and I had to use half a container to even feel like it was doing anything at all for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a thick rich mask. It has more of a slightly whipped texture. I you&#x27;ve ever used Pureology color care mask, this Fekkai is much lighter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, with just a slight scent of typical hair dye conditioner (like the packets that come in the box with hair dye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses out well with no buildup, but I did sort of expect a bit more conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In defense of the product, it is a mask to protect and extend your color  - it isn&#x27;t meant to be a reparative or conditioning mask. So, we really can&#x27;t expect this to correct damage or provide any other extraordinary benefits. I used my Its a 10 leave in conditioner after using this mask ... I needed more conditioning and moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as for conditioning, detangling, etc, this product works like a regular everyday conditioner, not like a treatment mask in that regard. As long as you&#x27;re just looking for the color care benefits, you will be happy with it, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to bring a little life back to my color and my hair didn&#x27;t look as dull. As for protecting my color, I won&#x27;t be able to tell that yet, and I am not sure that there is enough product in this container to be able to use it long enough to be able to tell if it does help keep your color longer. Using it once a week, for 2 weeks, doesn&#x27;t seem to have kept my color from fading any less than usual.</li>
    <li> I have tried this color care mask as well as the prx mask and the Shea mask and I think I like the shea butter one the best.  This comes in a close second.  I love the fragrance and with using this once a week along with the corresponding shampoo and conditioner I have wonderful hair and it&#x27;s not easy getting gray hair to behave or be soft and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Fekkai products now for about six months and love them more than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried on the market.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with itching or flaking and my scalp doesn&#x27;t break out from being not happy with whatever I happen to use at that moment.  My hair feels clean and I don&#x27;t have the build up like I&#x27;ve had with other brands of shampoo and conditioner.  Amazon has the best price I have seen on these items so far with Target being the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to try a round of the Fekkai product line make sure and pick the right one for your hair type.  Also, get a bottle of the green apple shampoo as that takes and removes any mineral build you get on your hair from hard water.  The stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells wonderful, and the scent stays in your hair for several hours afterward, even if you just use a teensy bit like I do.  As others have mentioned, the jar is very small; however, you really don&#x27;t need to use much at all.  I have shoulder-length hair, and I use just a small dollop.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy and easy to spread throughout your hair.  I comb it through while I&#x27;m still in the shower and let it sit for 4-5 minutes before rinsing.  It leaves my hair soft and moisturized, and smelling great.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair shoulder length that is highlighted regularly.  Because of the volume of my hair, I use a fair size dollop along with a big tooth comb in the shower to comb it through.  I then put on a shower cap for the remainder of my shower as I wash and cleanse myself.  Then, I rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that using this once a week keeps my color in tact for about a month until I get color to deal with the roots.  It does seem to darken the color and I&#x27;m not sure why.  I don&#x27;t object to that because it helps my color last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the other Fekkai products though I have in the past with this.  I don&#x27;t find the others  as helpful as this is for keeping my color locked in.  I highly recommend it if you think your issues are similar to mmine.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for the purpose of testing. The first thing that drew me in was the smell of the product. It smells wonderful, and it made me eager to try it on my hair. After rinsing, I could automatically tell a difference in the texture of my hair, and I was so happy! I styled as normal (blow dry, flat iron) and my hair still felt smooth and conditioned and SOFT. You&#x27;ve sold me, Fekkai. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a deep conditioning treatment that has a mild floral scent.  It can be rinsed out after a minute or two or left in for half an hour for extra intense conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I&#x27;ve become a fan of Fekkai hair products.  I&#x27;ve used various shampoos and conditioners and they all have left my hair looking beautiful.  This one is no different.  This is wonderful.  This gives my hair body and causes it to look sleek and smooth and hold it&#x27;s shape after a blowout.  I can sleep and awake in the morning and see my hair fall into place just by running my fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sample sized container which on short hair can be used for approximately five treatments.  It&#x27;s a creamy thick conditioner which is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally care for scented things but this product have a delicious scent, I would love it as a perfume, just lovely.&lt;br /&gt;The product is creamy and a soft pink color to it. You apply to wet hair and its recommended to leave on 3-5 minutes. I wanted to see if it works first try so I left it on the full 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The scent unfortunately dies away quickly, although it still lightly there if you pull your hair around and put it under your nose. If you use other hair products it would probably wipe it out completely. I have over the shoulder length natural wavy thick brown hair, that is currently colored brown with a Vidal Sassoon product.&lt;br /&gt;Is product did not add any shine but it did allow me to dry it with a hair dryer on low and maintain my curls and it did cut down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I like it for the most part, although it&#x27;s a small container, with my length I might get 3-4 treatments out of it.&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, nice smell and cuts the frizz.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice conditioning masque. It has a mild rosy scent that is very pleasant and not overpowering. The consistency is fairly thin and very easily to apply and spread through the lengths and ends. I like that it makes my hair silky soft but not oily or greasy. It also adds a little shine to my dull hair. I put it on my hair weekly for about 10 minutes (often wrap it with a warm towel) before doing a final rinse. I often have dry, split ends. It makes them soft with less splits that I couldn&#x27;t otherwise achieve using my regular hair conditioners. Great stuff. However, putting too much seems to make my hair flat looking without any volume. A tad of this goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is much smaller than I thought. It&#x27;s only 2.25&amp;#34; in diameter and 1.3&amp;#34; tall. It took me a while to find the instruction which is hidden at the bottom behind the barcode label that you can peel off. There isn&#x27;t much in the bottle but it&#x27;s a weekly application and a tad goes a long way. Fekkai also makes a 7 oz bottle (cheaper per oz) if you find yourself running out too soon.</li>
    <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask.  This is to put in the hair after shampooing.  I leave it in a couple of minutes before I rinse it out.  It is a good product, and it seems to be good on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of products on my hair.  I try to have as low maintenance hair as possible for me, but unfortunately, I still have to do a lot to it and take a lot of care to it.  I like this product and how I use it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair</li>
    <li> After washing my hair, I applied this wonderfully scented color care mask and wrapped my hair in a warm towel per the directions on this page.  I didn&#x27;t see directions on the product, or in the box it came in.  The mask has a thickish, oily texture which feels like it will soak into your hair strands well.  I left the mask on for 10 minutes as recommended.  After rinsing the mask out of my hair, my hair is smooth and shiny.  The product seems effective at deeply conditioning your hair more than just a regular conditioner.  My only suggestion for improvement is provide written instructions as to how often to apply the mask (it said weekly on this page), and how to warm the towel (hot water?) and whether to apply it to wet hair or clean dry hair.  I color my hair, but it will take repeated applications of this product over four weeks, after it&#x27;s colored to determine if it helps the color to stay vibrant.  Will report back. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a deep mask for my hair, so glad to know about this product. So far, so good. I gave this four stars because I didn&#x27;t see instructions with the mask.  If that&#x27;s my mistake of overlooking them, will raise it to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was not familiar with Fekkai brand before I tested this product. I REALLY like it! The scent is amazing! One use is enough to completely change the texture and shine of my hair! My hair is naturally blended shades of grey and this product worked perfectly on it! It will be a permanent part of my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice texture and feel.  The scent is nice, not overly floral. The biggest drawback I see with this item is the amount of product you get in a jar. This is an extremely small container. More like something you would pack in a carry-on. For travel, that might be great. However I believe this is a product that you would use occasionally, not on a daily basis. So I don&#x27;t imagine you would need to pack this on a trip anyway. That being said, I have long thick hair. --I usually need to use a LOT of conditioner in my hair. I used considerably less of this product than I would normally to condition my hair - nearly half (It is not necessary to condition prior to using this product).  I used a wet brush while in the shower to make sure the product was evenly distributed throughout. After one use I have noticed a slight sheen to my hair (even after blow drying which tends to dull my hair.  I air dry whenever possible to avoid this happening).  I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is over-the-top shiny, but it does look silkier, and brighter.  I am due to have my color re-done, so this is nice and much appreciated.  With continued use, I&#x27;d imagine the results may be more noticeable. - But based on the size of the jar, I may only get three more applications (four if I use it sparingly).</li>
    <li> The scent is really nice, and the consistency allows for this mask to spread through your hair well.  This is a small jar, so if you have thick, long hair, you might want to reconsider.  However, if you have thin, fine hair like me, this will last you through several washing&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it makes my hair feel after I use it.  My hair is light brown, and tends to go dull in the winter.  This did brighten it a little bit.  I am hoping, that after several uses, it will brighten it a bit more.</li>
    <li> I love Fekkai products. Yes, they do cost more than the regular drugstore products but they are worth it. I have baby fine, thin, teal colored hair. I use products that won&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair and also protect the unnatural color. I usually use Fekkai products because I love they way they work for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love LOVE this conditioning mask. The scent is truly heavenly. The texture feels like a smooth creme brulee, you don&#x27;t need a lot just need tow work it through your hair. I put it on, then pop on a shower cap for the rest of my shower time, letting it soak in. This is a smaller container but the also offer a larger one as well. Another huge plus is that this does not pull the color out of my hair like some conditioners do.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask is advertised to keep hair soft and silky and to preserve hair color between hair colorings. A family relation of mine, who dyes her hair, found that Fekkai Technician Color Care Mask did in fact keep her hair color from fading between hair colorings. She also reported that it made her hair softer too. What she noted most though, was the lack of fading of her hair between her hair colorings. So, I recommend this product for those people looking to keep hair color from fading.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the mask, it is fresh and flowery. It is easy to apply, and you only need a small amount. Other people say it will last only 2-3 times, but mine is still almost full after several applications. I only take a little bit - only dip tips of my fingers in it, and it covers all my hair without any effort, I can feel it with my hands. It washes away great, too.&lt;br /&gt;The hair feels very soft and sleek and looks glossy after application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not fond of the overpowering scent, or of the fact that you don&#x27;t get a lot of product for your buck (this is truly a Barbie-size container). That being said, the mask does work very well. My hair emerges softer, shinier, and dare I say stronger? Still, there are more economical and less fragrant options out there.</li>
