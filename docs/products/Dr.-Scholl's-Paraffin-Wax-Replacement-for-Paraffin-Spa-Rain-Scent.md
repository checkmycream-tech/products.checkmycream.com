      <li>this is great if you have or starting to get arthrits or just want great feeling hands (and feet).  </li>

      <li>But, the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Paraffin Wax Replace arrived in fine shape.</li>

      <li>It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax.  </li>

    <li> This product is great</li>
    <li> For the price I would have expected enough wax to fill the bath. You would need 4 of these to do so.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent.  Lightweight wax.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The Paraffin Wax Replace arrived in fine shape.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wife loves it and knows where to order more.  Priced right and would recommend it to everyone. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful to have this item purchased at Amazon; however, it is not like a professional  one in that you have to figure out on your own the temperature of the wax.  I&#x27;ll put up with that because in time you get to know the perfect heating area on the dial.  It is so soothing to arthritic hands. The price is right and handy to have in the house.</li>

    <li> The scent is amazing and I got fabulous coverage with it.  I have never used Dr. Scholl&#x27;s brand of Paraffin wax but the thickness was fantastic because the last time I bought wax the layer was so thin and all it did was crack.  I used this just two days ago and there was no cracking, layer was not so thick that it was wasteful, and my feet came out very soft.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feels great on the hands.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a Paraffin Wax Machine from Dr. Scholl&#x27;s which I use weekly to help with my arthritis pain and to super moisturize my hands.  If you have not used one of these, basically, it&#x27;s a small plastic tub that has a lid.  You put this wax into it and it melts.  You then dip your hands (or feet) into it a few times and it gets covered with this thin, warm coat of wax.  You then put your hand (or foot) into a plastic bag and insert it into a mitt where you sit for about 10 minutes.  The purpose of this is to moisturize your hands (or feet).  I have arthritis in my hands, and use it to help with this pain, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains two separate blocks of wax which are intended to be inserted into the Paraffin Wax Machine to melt.  If you do not have any wax in the machine at all, you would use both of these blocks to create enough wax for usage.  However, in my case, I am just using it to refill the machine which is about half full, so I will use only one block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The block will melt to liquid wax once you put it into the machine (it takes about an hour to  1 1/2 hours for this to happen if you have it on melting mode).  Although you can use any paraffin wax in any machine, I purchased this because I wanted to simply &amp;#34;top off&amp;#34; what was already in there and the machine came with wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax has a very light clean scent to it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how to describe the scent, and when I saw that they called it &amp;#34;Rain scent&amp;#34;, I was a bit surprised as it smells a bit more like clean cotton to me.  But, the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The melted wax is very smooth and covers your hands (or feet) very well.  It is very thin, so it is not overly moisturizing (I put lotion on my hands before dipping them in the wax to accomplish this).  As a result of it being thin, I often dip my hands about 3 times to get good coverage.  It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 or 20 minutes (whatever duration you prefer), you simply pull the plastic bag off your hand and the wax comes with it.  It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax.  Since it&#x27;s very light, it is not greasy and leaves your hands feeling clean afterwards with no residue which is great.any wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 or 20 minutes (whatever duration you prefer), you simply pull the plastic bag off your hand and the wax comes with it.

    <li> I needed some more wax for my paraffin tub.  I searched for the cheapest that was not a hideous smell. These arrived in record time, were in two managable blocks, and are good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: good quality, fast shipping, decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: nothing so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.  Cheaper than i can get locally and don&#x27;t have to use any gas!</li>
    <li> Chose this rating because I hope they&#x27;ll give it this rating, too. Sure sounds like it will be a most appreciated!</li>
    <li> its hard to find this wax in the stores, and this stuff works great on my husbands hands - highly recomend this!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to run my Paraspa Plus Paraffin bath</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this wax.  Makes your hands SO soft, and melts fairly quickly...would recommend it to anyone! thanks</li>
