### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>An excellent buy!</li>
      <li>Finally a great non-silicome shiner/defrizzer!</li>
      <li>If they added Argan Oil the product would be absolutely perfect!</li>
      <li>I especially love it on my ends.</li>
      <li>Perfect shine and bouncy hair.  </li>
      <li>As a liquid to use as a targeted frizz control - it&#x27;s great!  </li>
      <li>The smell was very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>so this product is an ideal solution.</li>
      <li>line is a great help with athletes hair,  Meaning swimming, running and any activity that has you out in the elements.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
      <li>This is a good product at a great price.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I think this product would do great for thicker \\&quot;frizzier\\&quot; hair than it does with my baby fine thinner hair.</li>
      <li>Its a great light weight product that reduces frizz</li>
      <li>and I think it is equally effective.</li>
      <li>but I immediately recognized its usefulness as a targeted kind of frizz control.  </li>
      <li>One or two squirts were sufficient, and it was effective throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super happy with the results and will buy again.</li>
      <li>It was a pleasant fragrance and made my hair smooth and silky without a greasy look or feel.  </li>
      <li>, this is the best by far.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and love how it smooths and tames them and takes care of any frizziness and fly-aways.</li>
      <li>Love the serum type pump and the portability.  </li>
      <li>and  lasts more than 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This makes much more sense</li>
      <li>I get better results from the conditioner that comes with my hair dye.</li>
      <li>tried this, one more time.</li>
      <li>But I did notice the Smooth Intense ingredients are almost identical to my high-end serum, and it has a great texture -</li>
      <li>However it did make my hair feel somewhat greasy and with a scent which is not horrible but is just too strong and lingers all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so using too much did not feel pleasant on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I love the Sulfate Free line from L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The strong fragrance didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Eversleek is great because it delivers the right amount of shine and control without being too much.</li>
      <li>A nice alternative to higher priced products.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida where humidity is a good hair day serial killer.  </li>
      <li>For me, half a pump worked best.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping for a silicone free solution.  </li>
      <li>Eversleek will leave your hair shiney and frizz free.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth after towel drying my hair.</li>
      <li>I primarily use this product on my hair as a finishing serum.</li>
      <li>The pump allows me to control the precise amount of serum.</li>
      <li>I found that this hair serum did not help with frizziness as much as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>but to be fair, during those times I&#x27;m sensitive to all fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I opened and splurted out two drops in my palm and smoothed my hands togther and applied to my dry frizzy fly away baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>The bonus is this product is effective at a decent price.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve got more on top, and especially if you&#x27;re a rug head, check out ratings from the more hirsute reviewers.</li>
      <li>and so far she has been very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>times I tried it I ended up with a migraine from the scent after about an hour, I should have known better after the first time I used it..</li>
      <li>I had to use two pumps to get full coverage.  </li>
      <li>The pump is very easy to use with no mess.  </li>
      <li>four pumps to longer-than shoulder-length hair, combing it out and letting it air-dry results in very pretty, sleek ringlets.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d use this very sparingly when I want a more \\&quot;smooth finish\\&quot; to my hair, but I&#x27;d have experiment more with blow drying, and possibly use another product with it, so my hair doesn&#x27;t tend towards the \\&quot;limp\\</li>
      <li>but this is pretty good when I&#x27;m out or when I want something different.</li>
      <li>Eversleek Super Intense Serum has a very smooth texture that glided on my hair very well.</li>
      <li>One quick application really makes a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  </li>
      <li>serum is pretty good for being silicone free, natural oils always work great for hair, the chemicals in other serums tend to make hair shiny and soft at first</li>
      <li>Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: very baby fine and highlighted</li>
      <li>Ok for a sulfate free product, but was looking for something a little more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It is light and has a very silky texture.  </li>
      <li>I gave this to my daughter to test - my own hair is already hydrated enough.  </li>
      <li>Still, I&#x27;ll be experimenting with it for different looks -- it may do well to make a nice sleek ponytail.</li>
      <li>This product is like a light oil, not a thick goopy cream at all.  </li>
      <li>A small amount of this works great.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this in conjunction with my other oils, it certainly leaves my hair feeling clean and smooth, pretty good product so far.</li>
      <li>This product does a good job of keeping the frizzies under control but it can weigh hair down.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the L&#x27;OREAL PARIS Eversleek Super Intense Serum hoping it alone would solve my issue with frizz...</li>
      <li>Eversleek Super Intense Serum (2 pumps)&lt;br /&gt;Suave</li>
      <li>Even if this product falls completely flat for you, at the very least, it has a very pleasant scent, so your hair will smell better than before.</li>
      <li>wowed me the first time.  </li>
      <li>I only use L&#x27;Oreal products on my hair and love them.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in trying</li>
      <li>There is no odor or smell to this product, I even took a big whiff to be sure.  </li>
      <li>Those of us with long potentially fuzzy hair really need a good serum to smooth our hair.</li>
      <li>OK, I&#x27;ve got a big forehead.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Loreal!</li>
      <li>I use silicone based serums (paul mitchell super skinny) on a daily basis, and with this one my hair seemed much more frizzy than normal, as if I had used no serum at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using serums for years now, sometimes it seems like the application is as important as the product, I recommend to use two small pumps ( for long hair) and rubbing your hands together to warm up and disperse the product then to gradually get it in to the hair, touching the top of head last to avoid heaviness where you need lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that may be due to my own circumstances: my balding pattern makes me a good referent only for those with similar hairlines.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For hair that&#x27;s naturally curly and frizzy, this is a great addition to the hair care regime for frizz-free curls and/or sleek blow dried styles.</li>
      <li>On a positive note, the serum did make my hair shinier and softer.</li>
      <li>I was using another product that cost twice as much.  </li>
      <li>Depending on the humidity, it can be wavy or curly or somewhat straight.  </li>
      <li>It is called Intense Serum for a reason.</li>
      <li>This does not work at all when I blowdry my curly hair straight.  </li>
      <li>For reference, I have reasonably curly hair--think Benedict Cumberbatch in, \\&quot;Sherlock.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying</li>
      <li>It was not sticky, and my son (her husband) very much appreciated the appearance.  </li>
      <li>At a modest price, it is definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my hair straight and shiny.</li>
      <li>and so I really wanted to try this.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in the store today, so I picked up L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Smmoth Intense Frizz</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeps the frizz away, but didn&#x27;t do much to make hair softer.</li>
      <li>I really like the L&#x27;OREAL PARIS</li>
      <li>My daughter-in-law thought this product worked very well.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s lightweight, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>No haircut will last more than a week on my hair, it&#x27;s that thick and determined to do its own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, I turned to covering up the dryness by applying some coconut oil (DOES NOT smell nice), and the results I have noticed with Loreal serum is surprisingly similar to the latter, but without the fade out effect.</li>
      <li>I am still always on the lookout for new smoothing products and this L&#x27;oreal Eversleek works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>but other times, I like the sticking out more  - teehee.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works perfectly to tame and smooth my thick cury course hair.</li>
    <li> Most of the serums on the market are way too heavy. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Eversleek is great because it delivers the right amount of shine and control without being too much. The pump allows me to control the precise amount of serum. My hair is bleached, dry, and tends to frizz with all the humidity here in Florida so this product is an ideal solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair serum several times, and overall I am not impressed. I have thick hair with lots of frizz. I found that this hair serum did not help with frizziness as much as I would have liked. This is disappointing, as the product claims to have 48-hour frizz control. On a positive note, the serum did make my hair shinier and softer. Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but if you have frizzy hair, I recommend looking for alternative products.</li>
    <li> Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, one more time. For reference, I have reasonably curly hair--think Benedict Cumberbatch in, \\&quot;Sherlock.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying four pumps to longer-than shoulder-length hair, combing it out and letting it air-dry results in very pretty, sleek ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just don&#x27;t blow-dry, or it will frizz.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this were a science experiment, we&#x27;d lay out the materials and the process, so I&#x27;ll do that, just for sake of argument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Eversleek Super Intense Serum (2 pumps)&lt;br /&gt;Suave Naturals Shea Butter and Almond Shampoo (2 tablespoons)&lt;br /&gt;Revlon Quiet (tm) Hairdryer, six months old (1)&lt;br /&gt;Flat vent brush (1)&lt;br /&gt;Forty-something, frizzy haired female (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash hair with shampoo;  apply two pumps of serum, blow dry for eight minutes using the Revlon dryer and the vent brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, this separated out my hair so that it was frizzier.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it&#x27;s not sticky. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s inoffensive, but not particularly effective.</li>
    <li> For hair that&#x27;s naturally curly and frizzy, this is a great addition to the hair care regime for frizz-free curls and/or sleek blow dried styles. The results last for at least 48 hours. It leaves my hair soft and shiny whether I leave my curls in their natural state OR when blow dried straight. The bonus is this product is effective at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Those of us with long potentially fuzzy hair really need a good serum to smooth our hair. When I was in high school I started using John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz-Ease and thought it was a miracle cure.  I am still always on the lookout for new smoothing products and this L&#x27;oreal Eversleek works pretty well.  I use it right after I wash my hair and make sure to only use it at least 3 inches from my scalp to keep my hair from looking oily.  I blow it dry and then use a final coconut finishing spray.  The whole procedure really makes my hair look thick and shiny without looking greasy.  I would recommend this product as a less expensive than salon product.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of this product - Pros: it&#x27;s lightweight, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or greasy. Cons: it doesn&#x27;t last the 48 hours it says it does - I put this on in the morning before work and by the afternoon I might as well have not used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say what you want about more expensive hair care brands, the higher price definitely means it&#x27;s going to last longer and give you more control - I&#x27;ll stick with my Cibu serum!</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife because she is always \\&quot;dealing\\&quot; with frizz. She has tried many other products and all of them are collecting dust in our bathroom cabinets. She gave L&#x27;Oreal a try and so far she has been very pleased with the results. Her hair stays under control a lot longer during humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;Of course the product is not infallible and something that has to be considered is the type of hair and the level of humidity in your area.  Still, we recommend this product over any other product you can find at your local Walmart, Target, CVS, etc.</li>
    <li> I have tried many silk serum over the course of the last two years, the period when my hair has been miserably dry. Anything from Organix to Biosilk to your generic CVS branded products, I have tried them all. These serums would work just fine for the first few hours, but then after that, the effect would slowly fade out. So, I turned to covering up the dryness by applying some coconut oil (DOES NOT smell nice), and the results I have noticed with Loreal serum is surprisingly similar to the latter, but without the fade out effect. After coming back home after a ten hour shift, my hair is still shiny as it was when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, and at less than ten bucks for a 2 oz bottle, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> This L&#x27;OREAL product did just an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; job at trying to tame my frizzy-day hair, but only after I had to exceed the recommended amount of pumps.  The packaging says \\&quot;1 to 2 pumps,\\&quot; but that would not work on my hair.  I had to use double or triple amount of recommended pumps in order to notice any marginal results.  The pump is very easy to use with no mess.  Obviously no two human hairs are the same and I feel this product is definitely not a \\&quot;One bottle fits all\\&quot; type of product.  At a modest price, it is definitely worth a try.  Even if this product falls completely flat for you, at the very least, it has a very pleasant scent, so your hair will smell better than before.</li>
    <li> It gets very humid in the summer where I live and though I only have wavy, not curly hair, it can get quite frizzy. A small amount of this works great. I have used it after my hair is dry and I have used it when my hair is damp and I think it is equally effective. You just have to be careful not to use too much, then your hair will look greasy and it is harder to style. It is called Intense Serum for a reason. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> They say kids don&#x27;t lie.  I gave this to my daughter to test - my own hair is already hydrated enough.  She tried it once, said it made her hair feel \\&quot;fat and greasy.\\&quot;  I found it in the bathroom wastebasket a few weeks later.  Maybe for people with brittle or really dry hair, but for those of us with normal to oily, it&#x27;s overkill.</li>
    <li> I have long hair down that is always at least to my shoulders, if not 2-4 inches below. It&#x27;s thick and prone to split ends, and I always have to use product of some sort to give it definition. No haircut will last more than a week on my hair, it&#x27;s that thick and determined to do its own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the leave-in conditioners, gels, lotions and serums I&#x27;ve used, this is the best by far. The scent is very light so it doesn&#x27;t clash with anything else I use on my hair. I spritz my hair with water until it&#x27;s damp, then use about 4 pumps total on just the ends of my hair, comb through, add any extra product if I need it (usually a \\&quot;curling\\&quot; lotion\\&quot;) and let it air dry, and it looks great. It&#x27;s allowed me to grow my hair out a few inches without it turning into a big frizzball at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on average 3 days a week for 5 weeks and it&#x27;s only half empty, so it lasts a good long time, too. I definitely recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I love the Sulfate Free line from L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;This line is a great help with athletes hair,  Meaning swimming, running and any activity that has you out in the elements.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found anything that works like this in this price point.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Some smoothing serums can be oily or heavy; this is neither.  It is light and has a very silky texture.  I have naturally curly hair which can sometimes be brittle and frizzy.  This product eliminates all those problems without making my hair too heavy.  The final effect is nice, smooth curl without a dull look.  Perfect shine and bouncy hair.  Like I said... I love it!</li>
    <li> Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: very baby fine and highlighted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I need to be careful with serums because they can weigh down my baby fine hair; however, this product didn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy as some of the other serums I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Eversleek, I did an experiment. On one side I used nothing, and on the other side I used the serum. I blow-dried my hair as usual using a big round brush. I then asked GMR if my hair looked different on one side, and if so, in what way. Later, I asked my visiting brother the same question. Both independently said the same thing, \\&quot;The right side looks smoother and the left is sticking out more.\\&quot; I thought so too but nothing beats a blind testing. So yes, there was a noticeable difference using the product if you want your hair to be smoother and \\&quot;sleeker\\&quot; -- and sometimes I do - but other times, I like the sticking out more  - teehee. Warning though, another time I used it and it weighed down my hair a little too much and made it limp -- a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d use this very sparingly when I want a more \\&quot;smooth finish\\&quot; to my hair, but I&#x27;d have experiment more with blow drying, and possibly use another product with it, so my hair doesn&#x27;t tend towards the \\&quot;limp\\&quot; look. I think this product would do great for thicker \\&quot;frizzier\\&quot; hair than it does with my baby fine thinner hair. Still, I&#x27;ll be experimenting with it for different looks -- it may do well to make a nice sleek ponytail.</li>
    <li> This does not work at all when I blowdry my curly hair straight.  Was hoping for a silicone free solution.  This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Its a great light weight product that reduces frizz and  lasts more than 24 hours. Buy it and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job of keeping the frizzies under control but it can weigh hair down.  I made the mistake of using two pumps for my shoulder length hair and my hair was rather flat.  Even one pump left it with a little less volume (I have fine hair).  For me, half a pump worked best.  I have sensitive skin so using too much did not feel pleasant on my scalp.  A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive to silicone based serums. Finally a great non-silicome shiner/defrizzer! Eversleek will leave your hair shiney and frizz free. I especially love it on my ends. This is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; product.</li>
    <li> I have thin, naturally wavy hair and I have highlights.  I ordered the L&#x27;OREAL PARIS Eversleek Super Intense Serum hoping it alone would solve my issue with frizz...it did not.  However, using it in combination with blow drying with a round brush and a Moroccan oil finishing spray I get the desired result.  Bottom line...for me, the Eversleek Serum is not THE solution but it is one of the elements to my solution.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;oreal Paris Eversleek Super Intense Serum has a very smooth texture that glided on my hair very well. It did not feel too greasy, and my hair straightened well after running the flat iron through it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the directions. I opened and splurted out two drops in my palm and smoothed my hands togther and applied to my dry frizzy fly away baby fine hair. I live in Florida where humidity is a good hair day serial killer.  It worked.  My hair got some shine, but not greasy shine.  There IS A DIFFERENCE.  I really like the L&#x27;OREAL PARIS no sulfate line of hair products and so I really wanted to try this.  There is no odor or smell to this product, I even took a big whiff to be sure.  I can&#x27;t smell a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on damp hair and it means that if I use a blow dryer my hair is not all frizzed to heck and back.  It lies smoother and is easier to style.  I like one pump in my damp hair and one pump to smooth down my styled hair a tad before heading out into the heat.  My hair is past my shoulders and is more long than short. It&#x27;s also brown and chemically highlighted with blonder highlights so my hair tends to get dry even in the humidity.  This product is like a light oil, not a thick goopy cream at all.  It&#x27;s clear and after using it a lot I do not have any product build up.  I&#x27;m super happy with the results and will buy again. Love the serum type pump and the portability.  I just throw it in my purse to apply if I&#x27;m going out on the town.  One quick application really makes a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  Thanks Loreal!</li>
    <li> This product claims to eliminate frizz and add shine to your hair - all for less than $6.  On my hair, it DID make a noticeable, albeit very minimal, impact on my frizz.  The reason for three stars? The minimal frizz control, coupled with the lack of additional shine.  Bottom line:  At just under $6, this product is not over priced, but if it doesn&#x27;t really work, I&#x27;m not sure it can still be considered a bargain. I can get the same amount of frizz control with a medium-hold hair spray.</li>
    <li> I have used the EverSleek line before from L&#x27;Oreal a few times but this was the first time that I tried the serum, usually I use the Fructis Moroccan Sleek oil  in the little orange bottle but this is pretty good when I&#x27;m out or when I want something different. I&#x27;ve been using serums for years now, sometimes it seems like the application is as important as the product, I recommend to use two small pumps ( for long hair) and rubbing your hands together to warm up and disperse the product then to gradually get it in to the hair, touching the top of head last to avoid heaviness where you need lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is pretty good for being silicone free, natural oils always work great for hair, the chemicals in other serums tend to make hair shiny and soft at first but overtime they actually dry it out so after a while the hair is actually worse than before. I will continue to use this in conjunction with my other oils, it certainly leaves my hair feeling clean and smooth, pretty good product so far.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I use silicone based serums (paul mitchell super skinny) on a daily basis, and with this one my hair seemed much more frizzy than normal, as if I had used no serum at all.  However it did make my hair feel somewhat greasy and with a scent which is not horrible but is just too strong and lingers all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times I tried it I ended up with a migraine from the scent after about an hour, I should have known better after the first time I used it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got thick wavy, color-treated hair and prefer to blow dry it straight each time I wash my hair.  That being said, I&#x27;m extremely picky about the product I use - it must do the job the first time out of the bottle or I&#x27;ll throw it away.  I don&#x27;t have time to try it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wowed me the first time.  It was a pleasant fragrance and made my hair smooth and silky without a greasy look or feel.  I tend to spend upwards of $20+ on my product and this made me rethink what I was actually buying in the past - and now the future. I&#x27;m a fan and as long as it&#x27;s being made and available in my store, I&#x27;ll be purchasing this serum.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law thought this product worked very well.  Her hair was less frizzy, used as soon as she got out of the shower. One or two squirts were sufficient, and it was effective throughout the day.  The smell was very pleasant.  It was not sticky, and my son (her husband) very much appreciated the appearance.  An excellent buy!</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve got a big forehead.  And a bald spot.  But I&#x27;ve got some hair in between those two areas, and it gets frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;This product works as advertised to stop the frizzing.  But it does also make my hair a little clammy.&lt;br /&gt;That effect can be mitigated a bit by running your fingers through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;But that may be due to my own circumstances: my balding pattern makes me a good referent only for those with similar hairlines.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got more on top, and especially if you&#x27;re a rug head, check out ratings from the more hirsute reviewers.</li>
    <li> Keeps the frizz away, but didn&#x27;t do much to make hair softer. Ok for a sulfate free product, but was looking for something a little more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I usually buy higher end serums, but grabbed this as a tide-me-over.  I&#x27;m back to purchase a second, but not for use as a shine serum.  Oddly enough, I found this useful as a sort of liquid hairspray.  On my initial use, I was disappointed to find the consistency really tacky (need to wash the residue off hands, as another person mentioned) - but I immediately recognized its usefulness as a targeted kind of frizz control.  It doesn&#x27;t really add shine in my experience, if only because its tackiness doesn&#x27;t let me distribute it as well as a normal serum.  But on the other hand, since it does contain beneficial oils, it is definitely not as tacky or drying as a spray hairspray.  As a liquid to use as a targeted frizz control - it&#x27;s great!  I couldn&#x27;t find this in the store today, so I picked up L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Smmoth Intense Frizz Taming Serum-rats, that is not this product. So here I am to get my EverSleek. But I did notice the Smooth Intense ingredients are almost identical to my high-end serum, and it has a great texture - so if you&#x27;re looking for some inexpensive shine, maybe that&#x27;s the one for you!</li>
    <li> i think there was a difference in my hair.  It makes drying my hair much easier and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry like other products.  I was using another product that cost twice as much.  This makes much more sense</li>
    <li> I live this serum.  It keeps my hair straight and shiny.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair dry and hard. Bad product, it is not like a normal serum, it&#x27;s more like a soft gel or something. Not recommended. I had to throw it.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and have curly hair that tends to get frizzy.  This product worked well. I had to use two pumps to get full coverage.  It left my hair soft, and controlled the frizz for about 24 hours.  I was also able to use a small amount on dry hair to tame some of the small \\&quot;fly away\\&quot; hairs.  I noticed some reviewers complained about the scent being too strong. The scent only bothers me when I have a migraine- but to be fair, during those times I&#x27;m sensitive to all fragrances.  This is a good product at a great price.  A nice alternative to higher priced products.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly/wavy and is prone to frizz. I can&#x27;t say that this product controlled my frizz but I still found that it had some benefits. I primarily use this product on my hair as a finishing serum. After I have dried my hair I use a couple of pumps of this serum to &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; my style. It does improve the shine and softness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I discovered that this product alone will not work for me.  I have to use it in conjunction with other products to get the results I want.</li>
    <li> I have been on a long term quest to find something to tame my fuzzy frizz.  I have fine hair but a lot of it.  Depending on the humidity, it can be wavy or curly or somewhat straight.  I used this product on wet hair as directed on the package, starting with one pump and then two.  I tried putting a little more on my hair after it had been dried and styled, but that made it \\&quot;crunchy,\\&quot; which I don&#x27;t like.  I probably hope for too much from an anti-frizz product, wanting it also to keep my hair straight even in high humidity.  The product would probably work better for those who live in less humid areas.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel greasy and dirty. I tried with all different amounts of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;No matter how little I used it still felt awful. The strong fragrance didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had unmanageably frizzy hair all my life. I had hoped that this serum might help with that, but it made very little difference. I will admit that my hair doesn&#x27;t like to change and often resists anything I put in it, but most products have at least some effect. Unfortunately, this was not the case for Eversleek. I get better results from the conditioner that comes with my hair dye.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth after towel drying my hair. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in trying</li>
    <li> This is getting hard to find in local stores so I ordered a couple at a time. I have curly hair and love how it smooths and tames them and takes care of any frizziness and fly-aways. My hair is sooo soft and the shine is unbelievable! If they added Argan Oil the product would be absolutely perfect! But, it just about is anyway.</li>
    <li> I only use L&#x27;Oreal products on my hair and love them.  I have very thick, waist length hair that is colored.  I normally use the gloss serum but decided to try this as it said &#x27;intense&#x27; and was part of the Eversleek line which is what I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get the soft, sleek results as I do with the normal serum and it left my hair feeling rough.  It may be better suited to fine or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back to using the basic Eversleek glossing serum and will give this to my niece who has fine hair.</li>
