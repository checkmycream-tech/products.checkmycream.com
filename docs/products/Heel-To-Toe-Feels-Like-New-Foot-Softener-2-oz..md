### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is so wonderful.</li>
      <li>(Dishwashing liquid like Dawn works best.)</li>
      <li>the price was just perfect.</li>
      <li>She bought this and loved it!</li>
      <li>did a good job as moisturizer with continued use...</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:mo16NLRC19VV6OE]]I so love this!</li>
      <li>This one absolutely works the best!</li>
      <li>But, dont take my word for it...as cheap as this is, you should get some and try it for yourself and try both ways!    </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and my feet were already leaps and bounds better by that evening.</li>
      <li>jar at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store, $4.49 if you have a free Sally&#x27;s Beauty card.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years and it&#x27;s simply fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is a great product that vastly exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>but I needed a quick delivery.</li>
      <li>The sales lady told me to make it most effective, let your feet soak in a a hot bath, then dry them off, and immediately apply this.</li>
      <li>However, I read about the above process on another website from another reviewer, and this way seems to work even better!</li>
      <li>I use this product daily on my feet, and love it!  </li>
      <li>right then I had to have some.</li>
      <li>Seriously, this stuff is THAT good!  </li>
      <li>In addition, even with repeated massaging of this product into my feet, it only partially absorbed into my skin, most of it remaining on the surface where it rubbed off onto my socks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this when I first got it, so I only used it on one foot for the first two weeks.  </li>
      <li>The first time I ever used this it softened up the thick-skinned balls of my feet</li>
      <li>I put it on my dance-calloused feet the first afternoon I bought it</li>
      <li>It will leave your feet feeling so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It is pretty waxy, but warm hands makes it very pliable,  The color does rub in and disappear, but be careful not to get it in any clothing while using it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for having the product and</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really repair but once feet are in reasonable condition</li>
      <li>I received a .62 ounce free sample of this product at my local Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I am always interested in trying out new products, I will not be using this one again for the reasons stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>callus is going to form, but using this makes that callus easier to live with and manage!</li>
      <li>Sure enough, when I got home and tried it, I could immediately tell a big difference.</li>
      <li>The price here is a bit high</li>
      <li>I have used this everyday since I got it in the mail and my heel is looking much better now.  </li>
      <li>One last thing......even though this product is really inexpensive, I would buy it again even if it was %50 or $60!  </li>
      <li>Plus it smells like chamomile, which is at least interesting to my pets.</li>
      <li>I put this on my feet after every shower and they are as soft as can be.</li>
      <li>It makes my feet so soft...</li>
      <li>I love this product, however lost a star for the price, was a little more expensive..</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t cure cracked skin or profess to perform miracles but when used after a shower or bath and with tools that remove dead skin -- in other words, as a substitute for lotion or other creams -- it absolutely ends dry and cracked skin and leaves my feet smooth and moisturized all</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years and it&#x27;s simply fantastic. You have to use a pumice stone or something else to remove dead skin. This product doesn&#x27;t cure cracked skin or profess to perform miracles but when used after a shower or bath and with tools that remove dead skin -- in other words, as a substitute for lotion or other creams -- it absolutely ends dry and cracked skin and leaves my feet smooth and moisturized all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is ridiculous, $13.02? I make over 100+ Amazon purchases a year and would never buy this here. It&#x27;s $4.99 for a 2 oz. jar at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store, $4.49 if you have a free Sally&#x27;s Beauty card.</li>
    <li> I put this on my feet after every shower and they are as soft as can be. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this everyday since I got it in the mail and my heel is looking much better now.  Thanks for having the product and the price was just perfect.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this when I first got it, so I only used it on one foot for the first two weeks.  At the end of two weeks, there was a definite difference in the look and feel of the callus on the treated foot!  I have suffered from serious cracks that have actually bled in the past, and haven&#x27;t found relief prior to this unless I soaked and scrubbed and lotioned my feet almost every night.  I have tried pumice stones, files, and even bladed tools to fight the cracks that eventually bleed, and nothing has worked as well as this stuff!  I am barefoot almost all the time, so callus is going to form, but using this makes that callus easier to live with and manage! I&#x27;ll never be without this stuff again!</li>
    <li> I received a .62 ounce free sample of this product at my local Sally Beauty Supply. I found this product greasy and intensely, unpleasantly perfumed.

    <li> I have psoriasis on my feet and have been using this along with my prescription medicine.It helps so much!It is not a cure for psoriasis,but even my dermatologist has seen a big improvement.</li>
    <li> It is pretty waxy, but warm hands makes it very pliable,  The color does rub in and disappear, but be careful not to get it in any clothing while using it.  Definitely works though!</li>
    <li> husband found this product to be very beneficial, as he suffers with very dry heels.  did a good job as moisturizer with continued use... would suggest to any one who would use as a routine softener/moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I got this 3 days ago and have been putting it on morning and night every since. It is a great product that vastly exceeded my expectations. I got mine at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for $2.99. It was recommended by the sales rep who tried it herself because her heels were cracking very painful. She bought this and loved it! BTW, she was about 55 and wearing sandals so I looked at her feet, and she looked like she had to the feet (and even heels) of a teenager! I was amazed and knew right then I had to have some. Sure enough, when I got home and tried it, I could immediately tell a big difference. The sales lady told me to make it most effective, let your feet soak in a a hot bath, then dry them off, and immediately apply this. Then, wrap your feet up in Saran wrap, and put on sockies (like footies), and go to bed. The next morning, stick your feet in the foot bath to get the product off. (Dishwashing liquid like Dawn works best.) You will probably also need a pumice stone, because you will see tons of dead skin just falling off! It will leave your feet feeling so smooth and soft. It does come with instructions, and that way works well too. However, I read about the above process on another website from another reviewer, and this way seems to work even better! But, dont take my word for it...as cheap as this is, you should get some and try it for yourself and try both ways!    One last thing......even though this product is really inexpensive, I would buy it again even if it was %50 or $60!  Seriously, this stuff is THAT good!  Hope my review helps someone decide!</li>
    <li> I have tried at least a dozen products for cracked, peeling heels. This one absolutely works the best! Makes a difference after one application - esp at night with footies.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily on my feet, and love it!  Everyday after the shower, I put it on then a pair of socks while I finish getting ready.  Sofffffft Feet!</li>
    <li> This product is so wonderful. I bought the stick version from Sally Beauty Supply, it comes out like a glue stick. It&#x27;s exactly what Flexitol Heel Balm used to be before they changed their formula and made it useless. I put it on my dance-calloused feet the first afternoon I bought it and my feet were already leaps and bounds better by that evening. Plus it smells like chamomile, which is at least interesting to my pets.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo16NLRC19VV6OE]]I so love this! It makes my feet so soft...</li>
    <li> This is one of my daughter&#x27;s favorites. It doesn&#x27;t really repair but once feet are in reasonable condition it does keep feet from getting dry or cracked. The price here is a bit high but I needed a quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This foot softener works miracles. The first time I ever used this it softened up the thick-skinned balls of my feet (I call them dinosaur feet).  All my cracking stopped.  I don&#x27;t even feel like paraffin wax compares to this product, and you seriously can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;ve had 2oz of this product for almost a year, and i still have about 1/5 left; a little really does go a long way.  My suggestion when using this product: after putting the product on, immediately put on a pair of socks or slippers for about 15 minutes because it is very sticky and can be messy.  It also may leave grease stains on your linens if you don&#x27;t cover you feet (the grease stains wash out though).</li>
    <li> I love this product, however lost a star for the price, was a little more expensive..</li>
