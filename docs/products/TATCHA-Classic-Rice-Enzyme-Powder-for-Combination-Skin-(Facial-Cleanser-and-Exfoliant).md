      <li>My skin has never looked and felt better.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take more than a 1/2 teaspoon of powder per use, so you will get lots of uses from each container.</li>

      <li>This is a wonderful product, I use it almost everyday, it leaves your skin feeling amazing.</li>

      <li>Very nice, like the way it makes my skin feel really soft</li>
      <li>My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom after using this powder.</li>

      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Right away after I wash it off I can tell my complexion is brighter and my skin smoother.</li>
      <li>This product is unique in its formula and application - the powder contains pearl and other amazing ingredients that reduces inflammation, and it turns into a creamy foam that leaves my skin polished and gleaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes a great short term impression, but I&#x27;m going to wait out on the long term results, to see if it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>so I decided to keep it instead of return the product.ce vellum like tissue paper with pretty art on it.</li>
      <li>Classic is the one used most frequently, followed by gentle and soothing.</li>
      <li>Really like using this every day after I washed my face.</li>
      <li>Gentle exfoliator.  </li>
      <li>It has helped my skin so much.  </li>
      <li>Gently exfoliates skin.</li>
      <li>I am also not sure as to how this light liquid-y foam is supposed to exfoliate the skin, but I do enjoy the results.</li>
      <li>The only other exfoliator I&#x27;ve used that has impressed me this much is the freemans charcoal and black sugar mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times and have noticed decent results.</li>
      <li>For reference I have normal to combo skin and in my 30s.</li>
      <li>I rarely need to use the deep exfoliating version.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more from reading past reviews.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling baby soft and glowing like a pearl!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all four versions (classic, gentle, deep, and soothing).</li>
      <li>Luckily there is another tape where the the little slider is on the inside</li>
      <li>Luckily there is another tape where the the little slider is on the inside</li>
      <li>Which is a total opposite of this soft foamy</li>

    <li> I had been using a Clarisonic Pro brush since 2010 to exfoliate my face a few times a week. I stopped using the Clarisonic ever since I started using the enzyme powder. It is that good! I&#x27;ve tried all four versions (classic, gentle, deep, and soothing). Classic is the one used most frequently, followed by gentle and soothing. I rarely need to use the deep exfoliating version. This is well worth the splurge and I no longer have to buy replacement Clarisonic brush heads. For reference I have normal to combo skin and in my 30s.</li>
    <li> Gentle exfoliator.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have only used a few days but so far I like it.LOVE the smell, amazing. The only downside is I find all my makeup is not removed, but not a huge deal for me.</li>
    <li> My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom after using this powder. My facial skin also looks brighter. Well worth the price. It doesn&#x27;t take more than a 1/2 teaspoon of powder per use, so you will get lots of uses from each container.</li>
    <li> I used St. Ives Apricot Scrub on my face for years. It wasn&#x27;t until I discovered this product that I found out how effective and gentle exfoliation could be. This product is unique in its formula and application - the powder contains pearl and other amazing ingredients that reduces inflammation, and it turns into a creamy foam that leaves my skin polished and gleaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to people who are still out there using exfoliating &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; that are too rough on their skin. My skin has never looked and felt better.</li>
    <li> best product period! My skin has never looked so flawless!</li>
    <li> Over rated!  A gimmick.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, my skin feels squeaky clean afterwards (it literally is squeaky) and I can just see the difference.  It has helped my skin so much.  A must have!</li>
    <li> Really like using this every day after I washed my face. It feels really clean after using this.</li>
    <li> Very nice, like the way it makes my skin feel really soft</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. Gently exfoliates skin.</li>
    <li> I used to have a serious problem with acne - I would be tormented by breakouts all the time. This cleansing powder was AMAZING and completely changed my skin. I rarely break out anymore, and when I do, it is never as bad as it used to be. Myy pore size has decreased significantly - I can&#x27;t believe that I was once embarrassed about my skin. There were these bumps on the front of my nose for years and after a few weeks of using this, they just disappeared. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, thank you TATCHA!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, I use it almost everyday, it leaves your skin feeling amazing.</li>
    <li> This is truly skin-changing!  It leaves your skin feeling baby soft and glowing like a pearl! LOVE! Do not want to go a day without it!</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from reading past reviews. Didn&#x27;t notice significant before/after differences. For the price, I would say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful makes your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> best cleanser for all skin types, especially if you use retinoid cremes</li>
    <li> This exfoliator is very interesting in the way it works. It&#x27;s like a grainy powder that you dissolve in water and it turns foamy. You then use it for 10-20 seconds, they specifically say 10-20 seconds in the directions. This makes me wonder what happens if you use it for a longer amount of time. lol. I&#x27;ve only used it accordingly, so I&#x27;m not sure. I am also not sure as to how this light liquid-y foam is supposed to exfoliate the skin, but I do enjoy the results. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times and have noticed decent results. Right away after I wash it off I can tell my complexion is brighter and my skin smoother. I don&#x27;t know how it does this, but it does it. It makes a great short term impression, but I&#x27;m going to wait out on the long term results, to see if it was worth the price. I have some faded acne scars that I&#x27;m working on, so we&#x27;ll see how this does with that. The only other exfoliator I&#x27;ve used that has impressed me this much is the freemans charcoal and black sugar mask. That mask is on the opposite price range and has amazing results also, but that&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t mind sugar scrubs. Which is a total opposite of this soft foamy exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this product is the price. I mean, I looks as expensive as other brands at this price range, but we&#x27;ll see if it is really worth it. The container is very smooth and pretty. The small purple thing-y protrudes out and is not a sticker, so that in itself tells me they must&#x27;ve put a pretty penny into the design of these containers. Even the lid looks expensive. lol. When you open it, the product is sealed with another plastic lid. There is a small opening under a sliding contraption thing that covers the hole. XD Great description, I know. lol. Although the powder can get stuck at and around the opening, it seems to be a good way to deliver the product without having to contaminate the whole thing or accidentally over pouring. The box it came it was very pretty, and the container was wrapped with a nice vellum like tissue paper with pretty art on it. I threw it away before I decided to take a picture for this review. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is the packaging. And this is totally a seller thing, but my product looked like it was opened already. That purple tape/strip thing that keeps the lid on was twisted like someone opened it already. Luckily there is another tape where the the little slider is on the inside and it didn&#x27;t look like it was tampered with so I decided to keep it instead of return the product.ce vellum like tissue paper with pretty art on it.
