<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything as expected.... well packed</li>
    <li> item exactly right and exactly as described; shipped promptly; perfect transaction</li>
    <li> I love the lavender scent of this soap and it is a good price.  I have reordered these a few times and I&#x27;m always happy with how quickly I get it.</li>
    <li> I bought a two pack from Amazon before purchasing this one and unfortunately I am not pleased with it this time around.  It is concerning to me that the liquid has a yellowish hue, when I know it should be a clear color as the ones I&#x27;ve purchased before were clear.  The smell is okay and seems normal but I&#x27;m afraid it could simply be old soap.  I will continue to purchase Mrs. Meyers because of the quality and beautiful fragrant intensity of the soap, but will use a different vendor next time.</li>
    <li> Product smells very nice and it&#x27;s not drying for hands. Love it.</li>
    <li> Convenient sized refills that pour without mess.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery good smell</li>
    <li> Our go-to soap.  Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Very pleasant, effective hand soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for so many year and it still as good!</li>
    <li> good product we continue to us</li>
    <li> Mrs Meyers makes a great hand soap. I have used it for years and will continue to do so. The soap lathers nicely and leaves  a clean scent. It is gentle and nonirritating.</li>
    <li> The lavender hand soap is great and the packaging and service from the provider was excellent.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Nice smell not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff! No strong chemical smells and cleans great. I use it everywhere!</li>
    <li> Soap is wonderful and, as you can tell, I use it all the time</li>
    <li> We use this hand soap since year, we usually purchase the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The refill size is much less expensive and the soap is the same ...</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent price &#x3D; happy customer!</li>
    <li> Received my product - good value and quick delivery!  Love Mrs. Meyers soaps!</li>
    <li> Smells great without being overpowering. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t contain all of the nasty stuff other commercial brands have.</li>
    <li> Thinner than I would like. Smells great but expected a thicker liquid.</li>
    <li> We use Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s lavendar hand soap in the bathrooms of our restaurant. Our customers appreciate the calming natural aroma. This is a good value and we order every other month.</li>
    <li> smells great and good for washing.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Smells great.</li>
    <li> My Daughter gets extremely dry hands. Mrs. Meyers Liquid Hand Soap has helped her hands from drying out and skin splitting.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this product more than once and will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> I ordered lavendar but received olive oil &amp; aloe vera. Can&#x27;t recommend this scent. Yuck</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Mrs. Meyers lavender hand soap for years. I think it&#x27;s the best liquid hand soap there is. At least it&#x27;s the best of all the ones I&#x27;ve ever used. If you&#x27;ve found a liquid hand soap you prefer, please leave a comment. I&#x27;d like to try it. We have dispensers in all our bathrooms and at the kitchen sink. I have psoriasis and while this soap doesn&#x27;t cure it, it doesn&#x27;t make it worse. It&#x27;s not advertised as being a moisturizing soap but I think my hands are always a little softer after using this product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a great price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> As anticipated, quick delivery and I love the earth friendly product</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. The scent is unbelievable. I would recommend it to anyone who loves nature.</li>
    <li> Mrs Meyer&#x27;s brand is wonderful (IMHO)! Ordering these refills in bulk helps me to save a little money and they come to my house quickly!</li>
    <li> Smells and cleans great&lt;br /&gt;It is non-abrasive. My guests love it...and so do i</li>
    <li> I love this hand soap better than any hand soap don&#x27;t contain triclosan or any harmful ingredient that will ruin my hands, Thanks Mrs. Meyers!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product.  Smells great as well</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite soap right now! It smells so fresh and has been great for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Great product that was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Happy to have a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; soap.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to someone who loves this soap.  It arrived very quickly, thank you.</li>
    <li> Always the best, and easiest with these refills.</li>
    <li> I really like this dish soap. It smells great, really light and clean, and is really gentle on my hands. I wish I could get a larger refill size, but this will do.</li>
    <li> Very nice hand soap.  The hands feel refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> Smells Awesome! Gentle on hands. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Smells great and cleans hands well.  Made with plant-derived ingredients and essential oils.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> best soap on the planet, great value</li>
    <li> Love,love,love these products. I especially like the lilac scent which is hard to find as it is seasonal. No more harsh chemicals on my hands with either the hand soap or the dishwasher soap. Much cheaper on their web site,however.</li>
    <li> I love this product. And it was nice to be able to buy the larger bottles so that I could just refill the ones that I have now.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for your house and environment!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. The package of the item, not so great. When I placed my order the item exploded during shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Guests love it too</li>
    <li> I love this hand soap.  I bought the initial soaps on sale at WholeFoods and the refills on Amazon. The price is great. The seller is also great (the products were in excellent, new, wrapped condition).  Scent is fragrant and nice (though not the typical lavender I&#x27;m used to).  Highly recommended. UPDATE:  I found these a lot cheaper on Mrs. Meyers&#x27; website - free shipping over $50 there.  But these sellers were good too, so whatever is more convenient for what you&#x27;re willing to pay.</li>
    <li> Only use this for hand soap.</li>
    <li> Best hand soap ever. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hands as other soaps do.</li>
    <li> This lasts forever. A good 6-8 month supply for kitchen and 2 baths.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product. Of course, the quality is excellent. The pricing is SO out of range. I found similar product at Whole Foods toay for $11.99!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the scent but I will use it sense I ordered two. It cleans well, but dries the hands.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully gentle soap in a great packaging. Easy to fill smaller soap dispensers in your home or business. Nice soft smell of lavender, nothing over powering. Great price!</li>
    <li> I love knowing that I am using less plastic by refilling from larger containers.</li>
