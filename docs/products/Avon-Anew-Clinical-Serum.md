      <li>Did I mention it only takes one pump to do my whole face neck?</li>
      <li>though the serum far too oily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of weeks but saw absolutely no lifting or tightening of the skin. It went all well but didn&#x27;t work for my aging skin.</li>
    <li> I like it, but just recently started to use it.  But I have to say, Avon has been true blue throughout the years with their innovative products.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Cannot understand why Avon gave up on it.</li>
    <li> This really works!  You wake up looking so refreshed. It does lift your face during the night.I think it firms the skin, also. My face looks so much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for awhile and I dont really see any results. Its been about two months. I wish I could say I like it but sadly no.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SERUM AND IS CHEAPER HERE THAN THE AVON SITE SHHH..IT LEAVES YOUR FACE SO SOFT AND FRESH I WILL RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT 100%.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I will continue to buy.  I have tried a lot of Lift and Firm products and I can say so far this one has worked for me the best!!!</li>
    <li> This product was much cheaper than I would have paid if bought directly from Avon.  However, I used this product for over 5 months and witnessed no results.  I used the enitre product line as suggested and saw no overall improvement in my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> used this product for years with good results</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product with my regular Avon purchase.  I tried to order it through Avon, but it doesn&#x27;t exist in catalogs or online.  I asked Avon online how I could order it but never received a reply.  I was glad to find it on amazon. It smooths out appearance of fine wrinkles and makes foundation go on much smoother.  It feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> This Avon Anew Clinical lift and firm serum has become one of my favorites.  I continue to buy this product because of the way it makes my skin feel smooth and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Avon stopped selling this, so happy Amazon still had it!! Awesome product, tightens pores, lift and firms. Basically it does what it says it should. Wonderful product, stings a tad.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My 69 year old skin is plump and almost wrinkle free when I use this.</li>
    <li> Not fabulous, but I&#x27;ll use it up.  No lifting or firming or very little.  A bit stinky, too.</li>
    <li> Paul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  though the serum far too oily.  I experienced  very little (if any) result. I would not recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a week I&#x27;m 27 with moderate sun damage and I am developing a crease between my eyebrows. I apply this daily and I&#x27;ll be honest I&#x27;m shocked at how effective it is, my skin looks like a baby&#x27;s. That ugly crease has nearly disappeared and once i use my moisturizer after it does. Imagine what it can do for you! I&#x27;m a little freaked by the fact that it sinks into your skin but ill take what works at this point. It&#x27;s pricey but u can catch it on sale and maybe your avon lady can throw u a discount if u buy skin products regularly youd be a good customer!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Will continue to buy as long as it is available.  I use it at night and just love it.</li>
    <li> I use this product for a quick \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; and \\&quot;instant lift.\\&quot;  Not sure about the long term benefits, but if you need something quick and you don&#x27;t have much time, this product is good.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me.... and I did not notice any change in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always in the lookout for a good lifting serum/cream so I wanted to give Avon a try. I have almost finished the bottle and I see no change.</li>
    <li> received product in a timely fashion, but item was extremely cloudy and there&lt;br /&gt;was no beads in bottle, beads were distorted and product did not work&lt;br /&gt;very sad, really hope it would.</li>
    <li> I am 70 and see a dirrerence in my skin. Somewhat tighter in appearance. Face it, if it works a little for me, it will work on anyone.</li>
    <li> Again this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything - and it annoys my skin - so I use very little of it - never tried an Avon product before and not impressed.  Will not buy Avon again and will stick with more expensive products that actually seem to work - and I&#x27;m lucky to have great skin - with no wrinkles - a line or 2 I&#x27;m not happy about - so I like to try new stuff -</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have been wanting to try it but it&#x27;s so expensive from Avon. I was shocked to find it here for a fraction of the price. I ordered immediately! Since I&#x27;ve gotten it my face looks amazing. I think this is my new favorite Avon product. I even use it in the back of my hands and they even smoothed out and looked way younger! I hope I can  continue to find it on here cause I will be buying more. Did I mention it only takes one pump to do my whole face neck?</li>
    <li> Feels good on the face</li>
