      <li>This is a great finishing spray.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>This spray is amazing!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for working or out for the night because u don&#x27;t have to reapply more makeup on ur t-zone to suck up the oil, this stuff keeps the oil away</li>
      <li>Helps with oil and gives ur skin a nice glow!</li>
      <li>Works just as good as UD</li>
      <li>but this is the original formula and company for the best value.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Turns out, this is magic as a mascara primer!</li>
      <li>Gives a nice matte finish to my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was very surprised,  this spray is excellent.  </li>
      <li>It looks natural, and sets makeup great!!</li>
      <li>I let my primer,  concealer, and foundation set, the better the finishing spray works.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many complements from friend n customers at work .</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I really feel like my make up stays on longer and its a great finishing touch for your makeup...</li>
      <li>Easy to apply the spray.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks now, and while it does a great job of keeping make-up in its place, it dries out your skin in the process.</li>
      <li>Mascara goes on smoothly with not clump to be found.</li>
      <li>and I must say, I am not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>put your mascara on right away!</li>
      <li>A good buy, and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>Received my items super quick.  </li>
      <li>It probably keeps my makeup fresh for about 4 hours.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.  </li>
      <li>My makeup lasts all day AND it looks so much more natural.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, product as described !</li>
      <li>I think it dries pretty fast once you apply it.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t spend that long on my hair in the morning (2-3 min), leaving more time for my makeup.</li>
      <li>In Florida it is so hard to keep looking good for hours, because of our heat and humidity.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I work in a warehouse and find myself sweating quite often, but thanks to this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking like Gene Simmons from Kiss.  </li>
      <li>use this product in combination with Rimmel matte translucent powder and it works really well.</li>
      <li>When I use this paired with a primer, my makeup keeps up very well for about 5hrs before getting the &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; look and needing a TouchUp.</li>
      <li>Hot new tip ...</li>
      <li>A fine mist of setting spray with just a few pumps gives normality back to the face by taking away the excess matte look to the skin after many powders.</li>
      <li>would suggest sticking it in your purse and reapplying later on if it&#x27;s a very hot day.</li>
      <li>agree that it holds better if you wait a few minutes in between applying the makeup and applying the spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it does seem to help makeup last in hot weather.</li>
      <li>it helps my makeup to last all night and makes my set foundation look like real skin again!</li>
      <li>This fixed that issue.</li>
      <li>it neutralizes the look, makes it look natural .</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their makeup on for a while.  </li>
      <li>A little spendy but worth every penny!</li>
      <li>well worth the price and actually the same brand that makes the urban decay setting sprays as well</li>
      <li>Without primer, obviously not as long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This hasn&#x27;t worked all that well for doing the above; however, perhaps I just need someone to show me how to use it.  I like the idea of using a spray versus powder for setting undereye concealer.  Someone had recommended spraying this on a brush and then patting it over the concealer.</li>
    <li> My skin usually gets oily after applying foundation a couple hours before. I wanted to try this out to see what this finishing spray was about. I love it. It does what it says.</li>
    <li> Makeup doesn&#x27;t really last all day long....I think it dries pretty fast once you apply it. It probably keeps my makeup fresh for about 4 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks now, and while it does a great job of keeping make-up in its place, it dries out your skin in the process.</li>
    <li> I can wear my makeup through workouts</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Only problem is that the spray comes out heavy and almost ruins the makeup under. I also get shiny after it dries but I have to put my face powder to get rid of the shiny. Otherwise,  my makeup last long on my face.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it but that&#x27;s only my opinion. Every one&#x27;s different so you might like it. Bye for now.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised,  this spray is excellent.  Even my eye shadow and eye brow powder stayed in place. No caking or shinny spots.</li>
    <li> In Florida it is so hard to keep looking good for hours, because of our heat and humidity.  Makeup suffers and never stay on for long.  I started using this for when I go out in the evening and it does work, keeps makeup stay on and in its place.</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing!  Worth the money.  I used it on my wedding day and it worked so well. I was still getting compliments on my makeup at the end of the night (12 hours after application and it was a humid day &amp; an outdoor wedding!).&lt;br /&gt;I agree that it holds better if you wait a few minutes in between applying the makeup and applying the spray.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in combination with Rimmel matte translucent powder and it works really well. Gives a nice matte finish to my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest sticking it in your purse and reapplying later on if it&#x27;s a very hot day.</li>
    <li> Helps with oil and gives ur skin a nice glow! Perfect for working or out for the night because u don&#x27;t have to reapply more makeup on ur t-zone to suck up the oil, this stuff keeps the oil away</li>
    <li> Received my items super quick.  I was very happy about that.  The product is great!  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great finishing spray. Works just as good as UD All NIghter. I would repurchase this product. Also I would tell my friends and family about it and recommend it. Easy to apply the spray.</li>
    <li> A fine mist of setting spray with just a few pumps gives normality back to the face by taking away the excess matte look to the skin after many powders. It looks natural, and sets makeup great!! my look is not complete until I use this! it helps my makeup to last all night and makes my set foundation look like real skin again! I will repurchase again! Don&#x27;t go through all that hard makeup work without setting the final product. well worth the price and actually the same brand that makes the urban decay setting sprays as well but this is the original formula and company for the best value.</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve notice that when I spray it after am done  it neutralizes the look, makes it look natural . I&#x27;ve gotten so many complements from friend n customers at work . I defiantly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Never used a setting spray before. Watched a video showing how it&#x27;s used. My foundation was starting to look powdery after application and I didn&#x27;t like the look. This fixed that issue. My makeup lasts all day AND it looks so much more natural. Love it!!</li>
    <li> It was wasy to use and i like it and it does seem to help makeup last in hot weather.</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily skin all year &#x27;round. When I use this paired with a primer, my makeup keeps up very well for about 5hrs before getting the &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; look and needing a TouchUp. Without primer, obviously not as long. For me, I find the longer I let my primer,  concealer, and foundation set, the better the finishing spray works. I am a Black woman that wears my hair natural so I don&#x27;t spend that long on my hair in the morning (2-3 min), leaving more time for my makeup. For example, I don the primer then eat breakfast; don concealer then brush my teeth; don foundation then jewelry and shoes, fix my daughter&#x27;s hair; then spray finishing spray. A good buy, and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> i recommend it for both beginners and experts it will set your foundation perfectly .&lt;br /&gt;you can use it before you put your makeup on</li>
    <li> Bought the 2 oz size of Skindinavia&#x27;s Makeup Finishing Spray to take on vacation. I never get on a plane without my Makeup Finishing Spray. Hot new tip ... after you spray on ritual \\&quot;X\\&quot; and \\&quot;T\\&quot; pattern ... put your mascara on right away! Turns out, this is magic as a mascara primer! Mascara goes on smoothly with not clump to be found. Try it!!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have bought this brand and I must say, I am not disappointed.  It keeps my makeup on all day and does not cause any skin irritation.  It does not make my face feel sticky or like I sprayed a funky chemical on it.  I work in a warehouse and find myself sweating quite often, but thanks to this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking like Gene Simmons from Kiss.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their makeup on for a while.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> I really feel like my make up stays on longer and its a great finishing touch for your makeup...Fast shipping, product as described !</li>
    <li> If I could afford it, I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without this product.  A little spendy but worth every penny!</li>
