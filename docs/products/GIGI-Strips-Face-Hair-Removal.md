      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got kind of fed up with #1 and after running out of my Gigi strips</li>
      <li>The wax strips are just the kind you warm with your hands and for lip use they didnt do well at all.</li>
      <li>Just wish it had more to it in the package.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sooo glad I tried another brand after all these years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i was expecting something better.</li>
      <li>These are just okay.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t work on short hair, works perfectly on longer hair.</li>
      <li>These will help with the slits I make in top of chain and mustache.</li>
      <li>this works so much better.</li>
      <li>18 would be perfect for what I&#x27;m doing when I do slits in my forehead alternating black and blond and for top chin and mustache</li>

      <li>The wax is incredibly runny and you really have to be careful applying or it</li>

      <li>It works very well for eye brows.</li>
      <li>I bought this a few days ago based on other review and that wasn&#x27;t a very good decision.</li>
      <li>I kind of wish they would make half the strips curved and half straight, but that&#x27;s a marketing thing and would probably cost more.</li>
      <li>I did some pretty heavy research on Amazon to try to find some better strips.</li>
      <li>It really works for an at-home quick waxing on my upper lip and chin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent product I suppose, but it takes some practice getting used to.</li>
      <li>They do not remove the hair completely, but they get a majority.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s no mess.  </li>
      <li>I have like small cuts and it is very dry in the spot I used the product,check the picture in front page for more details</li>
      <li>The clear plastic strips tend to get lost in sight on the bathroom sink, then get caught by a mysterious bathroom breeze and flutter to the floor then get stuck.</li>
      <li>The Nad&#x27;s strip removed ALL the hairs on my upper lip, including the coarse/darker ones and the soft hairs.</li>

    <li> I just recently bought Nad&#x27;s facial strips on Amazon and now I know what I was missing out on with these Gigi facial strips -- I&#x27;m sooo glad I tried another brand after all these years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my 3 reasons why the Gigi facial strips aren&#x27;t great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They do not remove coarse/thicker hairs and I always, always have to &#x27;clean up&#x27; the ones left behind with my tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The clear plastic strips tend to get lost in sight on the bathroom sink, then get caught by a mysterious bathroom breeze and flutter to the floor then get stuck. Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The after-wax oil is relentless and never succeeds at removing all the wax from my face. I generally scrub at the stupid wax with a towel or tissue and finally resort to just scraping it off with my fingernail, ouch and yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got kind of fed up with #1 and after running out of my Gigi strips I did some pretty heavy research on Amazon to try to find some better strips. I ordered a couple boxes of the Nad&#x27;s facial strips (they&#x27;re about the same in price) and just tried a couple strips last night on my upper lip. And YAY! The Nad&#x27;s strip removed ALL the hairs on my upper lip, including the coarse/darker ones and the soft hairs. In one try. And then I used the after-wax facial wipes and they removed all the remaining wax on my face. I am so glad I switched!</li>
    <li> Recommended by a pro, I am so happy to have purchased this product.  It really works for an at-home quick waxing on my upper lip and chin.</li>
    <li> These strips work very well. I have ordered them several times. My facial hair is a little wiry and this takes care of it..</li>
    <li> This product does not remove hair at all! It may pull of  3 or 4 stands of hair if you are lucky but it is not effective, there is barely any wax on the strips.</li>
    <li> i was expecting something better. The wax strips are just the kind you warm with your hands and for lip use they didnt do well at all.</li>
    <li> These are just okay. They don&#x27;t remove tiny hairs or thin hairs. I don&#x27;t have a hairy upper lip, but would like to remove the peach fuzz and these don&#x27;t really do that. I have to continue to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> It does the job for me especially since I am unable to have the epilation done professionally here in West Africa except the threading method which is very painful.  This is a good substitute for waxing.</li>
    <li> I thought that i was buying the strips for the microwavable All purpose formula.  this works so well and there&#x27;s no mess.  I bought the all purpose formula too and the wax for the entire body... this works so much better.</li>
    <li> Used it on my lip, worked really well.  I usually use the Salley Hansen face wax strips, they tend to leave quite a bit of residue, which ends up giving me pimples, even after I use the post-waxing azulene finishing oil.  This didn&#x27;t leave anything behind and gave me a really smooth surface.  I also only had to use one (double-sided) strip, with other products I sometimes have to use two. Lol, I&#x27;m not that hairy! I will most likely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The real scoop about this stuff is this: the directions say it only works on hair that is at least 1/4&amp;#34; long.  If you are like me that is WAY too long for facial hair.  It won&#x27;t work on short hair, works perfectly on longer hair.</li>
    <li> After using this, I guess when I pulled it there was a friction burn. Now I have a dark scar above my mouth that looks like a tiny mustache, its been a month and has yet to heal.</li>
    <li> The hair removal was not very good at removing hair I had to use for strips to remove my hair.</li>
    <li> I read reviews of other products like this and chose this one based on what I had read. For me, this one works just fine, no trouble. I kind of wish they would make half the strips curved and half straight, but that&#x27;s a marketing thing and would probably cost more. For this product, these work great and I&#x27;m very happy. My search ended with this box. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.  Not all of the fine hairs below  my chin were removed.  I saw maybe two hairs come off.  Not as sticky as it should be to do the job.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> Works well, trusted brand. Just wish it had more to it in the package. It works very well for eye brows.</li>
    <li> yes it hurts when you pull the strip off. but hair doesn&#x27;t come back for 5 wks!! it works for me</li>
    <li> Just bought and returned this from Sally Beauty. Hardly removes any hair. Hardly any wax on the strip. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like to convenience of these strips. They do not remove the hair completely, but they get a majority. They are great if you can&#x27;t get in for an appointment to be waxed or if you don&#x27;t have the ability to wax at home.</li>
    <li> The wax is incredibly runny and you really have to be careful applying or it goo&#x27;s all over and doesn&#x27;t always come off. I lifted my skin under my eyebrow just trying to get the rest of the wax off. It&#x27;s a decent product I suppose, but it takes some practice getting used to.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days ago based on other review and that wasn&#x27;t a very good decision.I used it as per direction and it burned my face,it&#x27;s been 3 days now since that and my face still hurt.I have like small cuts and it is very dry in the spot I used the product,check the picture in front page for more details please.No I don&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Amazon did NOT added the picture I uploaded and I don&#x27;t know if they will but you can have an idea how bad my face looks.</li>
    <li> These will help with the slits I make in top of chain and mustache. Perfect for this and not permanent in case I want to change it up. It might be better if they lasted for a month till next payday. 18 would be perfect for what I&#x27;m doing when I do slits in my forehead alternating black and blond and for top chin and mustache so I&#x27;d actually will need 24 per month so 48 per month since they last 2 weeks. I want to use them for shaving above lip and below lip. I don&#x27;t need shaving cream for nothing.</li>
