      <li>This is the best product that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>This one though, is by far the best that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>the Mitch Clean Cut itself is a good product.  </li>
      <li>It is almost the same feel wise (in your hands) and hold wise (for your hair) but the product doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.</li>
      <li>This has a nice strong hold and doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy feeling by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>Better that salon prices.  </li>
      <li>Nothing is better than this.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>many guys,including myself,would overlook this product because of the name.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite.</li>
      <li>/crusty (like when you use most gels).</li>
      <li>and I would say I prefer this stuff better.</li>
      <li>cruelty free, and works wonders!</li>
      <li>I have short hair and it is perfect for my pixie.</li>
      <li>My sons favorite hair gel.  </li>
      <li>Way better than the Crew brand, all around.</li>
      <li>Great product for short hair but does not work good with longer hair.</li>
      <li>My favorite cream for my hair.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>Goes on clean and has nice matte finish.</li>
      <li>Great control without too much shine and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>, I guess I should have stuck with a good thing in the first place.</li>
      <li>This is pretty good styling cream.</li>
      <li>this clean cut is a much better product and holds my hair much better.</li>
      <li>but will still keep your hair in place and is really easy to wash off when you shower.  </li>
      <li>This product is another Paul Mitchell easy to use grooming aid.</li>
      <li>and it is not as strong as the Clean cut product which is more waxy.</li>
      <li>I read a review where someone felt the scent was strong.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it works great and smells nice as well.</li>
      <li>, that was a huge step</li>
      <li>Fantastic styling product.</li>
      <li>It is important to note that these are demo sizes and not the 3 oz. size.</li>
      <li>But it does get smooth after a while.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Holds nicely without too much shine.</li>
      <li>A bit soft but good looks.</li>
      <li>Love it, you can use in dry hair, not sticky, not shining, good smell,</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Mitch Clean Cut styled my hair well</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I don&#x27;t do a clean cut look,why would I use this?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Nothing special, but it works well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got good hold and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a total greaseball afterwards.</li>
      <li>I bought the barbers classic and the clean cut gels to see which was better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not his favorite product though, so he&#x27;ll be trying to find something new.</li>
      <li>I think it should say best for long men&#x27;s hair for extra hold.</li>
      <li>Personally I have a gentleman&#x27;s cut with long hair that sweeps to the side away from a part on the side and the sheen makes it look nice, but the hold doesn&#x27;t allow it to stand up like I was able to do with a matte paste.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>For clarity, I have fine and somewhat wavy hair that I style in that \\&quot;old</li>
      <li>The smell is actually way better than the texturizer with the highest hold, so I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
      <li>Bought my first one at Supercuts.</li>
      <li>I started using this stuff and along with the Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Reformer&amp;#34; (Orange top), it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use anymore.</li>
      <li>Not too stiff, but a good hold.</li>
      <li>and clearly it is the clean cut.</li>
      <li>Depending on how much you put, it can feel more natural or more stiff.</li>
      <li>I keep my hair short/medium length year-around but am very particular of how it looks.</li>
      <li>Coming from someone who used to use gel, this stuff is more sticky than gel once it starts to dry.</li>
      <li>The end result is similar to the Reformer product but is not applied as easily.</li>
      <li>Reformer (Red Lid) is labeled as a texturizer with strong hold and a matte finish.</li>
      <li>While labeled as a strong hold I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily so.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  You need just a small dime size scoop and it holds your hair in place all day while still leaving your hair soft to the touch, without the residue.  It is very similar to B&amp;B Sumotech for half the price</li>
    <li> Not extra hold at all!!! I think it should say best for long men&#x27;s hair for extra hold. Not recommended for short hair.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair short/medium length year-around but am very particular of how it looks. I like to style it but I don&#x27;t like the gelled/greasy/&amp;#34;trying too hard&amp;#34; look at all. I started using this stuff and along with the Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Reformer&amp;#34; (Orange top), it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use anymore. It holds firmly while still allowing that natural look. I&#x27;ve also been told that it&#x27;s healthy for your hair in comparison to other products out there. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> A little to &amp;#34;heavy &amp;#34; for me.  Used it several weeks , then stopped.</li>
    <li> My favorite cream for my hair. Holds it in place without it looking greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. Bought my first one at Supercuts. Haven&#x27;t looked back since. It&#x27;s got good hold and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a total greaseball afterwards. That&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff iv ever used. I like to do a messy sort of 50&#x27;s look and this stuff works great for it.</li>
    <li> greaser than I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this and two other Mitchell products: \\&quot;Construction Paste\\&quot; and \\&quot;Reformer\\&quot;. I prefer the other two over this one. I find this one is actually the easiest to work in, and the hold is excellent, but the final result makes my hair stiff and crunchy. I was surprised to see some other reviewers say otherwise. The other products feel much more natural when applied. Maybe these products react differently to different hair types; I would classify my hair as somewhat oily by nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: it looks good, but don&#x27;t use it on a date when you&#x27;re hoping she&#x27;s going to want to run her fingers through your hair! :)</li>
    <li> My barber highly recommends this product and had put in my hair after a coupke of cuts. I tried messing around with some of the American Crew products and various hair waxes and I like this the best. For clarity, I have fine and somewhat wavy hair that I style in that \\&quot;old school\\&quot; look (not a pomp so much but kind of Mad Men-ish). This product gives the exact amount of texture and hold that I want without leaving grease on my pillowcase and has no cloying odor (like AC grooming cream, which smells like citronella to me.... gross). It may not be the product for everyone but if your requirements are similar to mine you won&#x27;t be disappointed. And seriously, a little goes a long way. Start out with a coffee bean sized dollop and figure out your baseline from there.</li>
    <li> Every time I get my hair cut at Paul Mitchell they use this product and I like it each time. I like the hold for medium length hair but if you have short hair don&#x27;t use too much. You&#x27;ll puncture someone&#x27;s eye. I was also told by the hairdresser that if you want to tone it down you can use it on damp hair. It dilutes it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Would recommend to anyone. I am Asian and part my hair like a pompadour. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This review is not specifically for the Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;Clean Cut&amp;#34; product as pictured here because the item we received was the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream. Not sure what the mix-up was, but we didn&#x27;t receive the product pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to return, so husband has been using the Tea Tree Shaping Cream without incident. It&#x27;s not his favorite product though, so he&#x27;ll be trying to find something new.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good styling cream. it has a small scent, which I like. I&#x27;ve only used wax before, but it&#x27;s pretty similar. Depending on how much you put, it can feel more natural or more stiff. I find that it flakes a bit after you&#x27;ve applied it and you try moving your hair around.</li>
    <li> My hair now reaches the heavens!</li>
    <li> This cream combines the hold of gel with the flexibility and softness of Pomade! It is a waxy substance that holds my hear in a short pompadour style better than American Crew gel! I would highly recommend this cream to anyone. The price is high but the little container will last a very long time, because all that&#x27;s required is a finger of gel. I will never use anything but this!</li>
    <li> Both my son and I use this.  I have short hair and it is perfect for my pixie.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected :)</li>
    <li> I bought the barbers classic and the clean cut gels to see which was better and clearly it is the clean cut. the barbers classic is too goopy and messy for me. save your money and dont buy the barbers classic. this clean cut is a much better product and holds my hair much better. only down side it is very expensive for the amount you are buying.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used product in my hair for almost 20 years. Nothing is better than this. It&#x27;s a cream and isn&#x27;t sticky. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and crispy, yet holds its form all day. There is no residue left over and it mixes in very well. I get my hair cut every month or so. I get it cut short, about an inch or less on top, and then it grows to about 2.5-3 inches by the time I get it cut again. This product works for all lengths of my hair. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same amount of hold as a traditional matte paste but adds a little bit of shine to your hair if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. It is the compromise between a firm matte paste and a shiny gel. Choose wisely depending on your hair, the length and style you are going for. Personally I have a gentleman&#x27;s cut with long hair that sweeps to the side away from a part on the side and the sheen makes it look nice, but the hold doesn&#x27;t allow it to stand up like I was able to do with a matte paste.</li>
    <li> Way better than the Crew brand, all around. Doesn&#x27;t cake on or leave a residue</li>
    <li> Great product for short hair but does not work good with longer hair. I use to use this product all the time till my hair got to 4-5 inches. Greta for styling if your hair is under 3-3.5 inches.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Price!</li>
    <li> Great for keeping the hair in place.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t give me crunchy or greasy hair. This works really well, and holds throughout the day. It can be restyled with a little bit of water. Has a nice smell too (subtle, not overpowering). Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; half the price they charge at my local salon</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2O4G0XE2SZ14X]]I am reviewing three similar products in the included video to compare and contrast the products. I spike my hair/wear it messy and don&#x27;t love it when it is very brittle/crusty (like when you use most gels). It is important to note that these are demo sizes and not the 3 oz. size. (In the video they are .35oz. I am guessing that this product should last a while because you really do not need much product to get the desired effect. I read a review where someone felt the scent was strong. It is definitely scented and I actually like the scent of all three. I don&#x27;t feel that it is off putting in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Barbers Classic Pomade (White Lid) is like thin vaseline. I don&#x27;t mean that in a bad way it is a way to make your hair shiny and loosely hold it in place. It is not hard at all and didn&#x27;t meet my needs for spiky/messy hair. If thats your thing then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reformer (Red Lid) is labeled as a texturizer with strong hold and a matte finish. This is why I did the video review. While labeled as a strong hold I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily so. I like the product and it is not as strong as the Clean cut product which is more waxy. This product is the consistency of drying glue. It Best suited me and I really liked it. It can give that messy look easily while holding your style in place without feeling brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean Cut (Yellow Lid) Product is labeled as a medium hold / Semi-matte styling cream. I felt that it had the strongest hold. Out of the jar it has the consistency of similar wax type products. The end result is similar to the Reformer product but is not applied as easily. It still doesn&#x27;t appear shiny when on and does not have a brittle finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps and is probably an overly long review for some stuff you put in your hair but I thought it was necessary. I hate buying stuff that ultimately doesn&#x27;t meet my needs</li>
    <li> Great hold but does not feel sticky in the hair. Have tried plenty of other products but this is by far my favorite. This jar lasts 4-6 months with daily use. Only a dab is needed to get the hold you need.</li>
    <li> rub into hands and spread in for that control look and not the plastered down look - smells nice too!</li>
    <li> Fantastic styling product. Not greasy w hairspray works great!</li>
    <li> Very nice, i loved it.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling product to add just a hint of shine while holding the hair in place.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product and the seller!! Great price and amazing shipping, got my Paul Mitchell Clean Cut stuff days ahead when I was to even begin expecting it. Hands down this is a product for any serious barber to have, several master barbers attend my church and swear by it, now I&#x27;m swearing by it too. Combined with thee Paul Mitchell products this/they create an unmatched effect on your hair. I&#x27;d gladly buy from this seller again 100 times over!!</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s a texture type cream and holds hair very well. I don&#x27;t leave house without it.</li>
    <li> So,I&#x27;ve tried plenty of hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on all the American Crew products, a few Tigi products,and a few Wella products,but nothing would hold my hair the way I wanted it to. I do a messy look similar to Rob Pattinson or Jim Chapman.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling desperate, I went to get a trim. I asked the lady if she suggested anything,and she showed me this. And when I saw it I was like, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t do a clean cut look,why would I use this?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This leads me to the ONLY con of this product:The name.&lt;br /&gt;So many guys,including myself,would overlook this product because of the name. It works well for a clean cut style,or a messy style.&lt;br /&gt;It has great hold and isn&#x27;t completely matte,but isn&#x27;t shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The perfect product.</li>
    <li> Much runnier consistency than other hair products I was told to compare this to (namely American Crew Fiber). If you have thin hair I would NOT use this product. While it does hold well at first, the hold doesn&#x27;t last. It clumps thin hair together to make you look bald and adds unnecessary sheen.</li>
    <li> My girlfriends&#x27; mom owns a hair salon so rest assure that I&#x27;ve tried almost every product on the market.  This one though, is by far the best that I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel hard at all but will still keep your hair in place and is really easy to wash off when you shower.  You will not be disappointed with this product.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, but it works well. My husband likes it. It doesn&#x27;t make his hair super stiff or aything. A good buy.</li>
    <li> Goes on clean and has nice matte finish. Holds well in the heat. This is the best product that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, it holds my hair all day long. I realy like this product. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Product had a more chemical smell unlike other identical wax I bought previously.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It has a nice shine and hold to it. I usually get Crew and I would say I prefer this stuff better.</li>
    <li> It was what I needed at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I like it. A bit soft but good looks. Maintains after exercise. Not shine which is a must for me!</li>
    <li> Coming from someone who used to use gel, this stuff is more sticky than gel once it starts to dry. But it does get smooth after a while.&lt;br /&gt;It eventually calms down throughout the day and gives that slightly shiny bed-head look, very easy to re-work hundreds of times if you wanted to without flaking at all.</li>
    <li> I like it. Just great. Minimal shine, natural hold. Not much else to say but Troy who work for PM is pretty cool.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have very thick, naturally dry hair. With that being said, this product is surprisingly decent. I have a couple go-to products, and it&#x27;s hard for me to find something I like more than those, while this didn&#x27;t replace any of my go-to products, it did surprise me. It had a fairly decent hold, and a little bit of separation and texture, but it was mostly pretty matte. No, I would not suggest it to someone with hair like mine, but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Great styling product! Holds nicely without too much shine. Impossible to find at any stores near me--most reasonable online price!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair. Allows me to style but still feels natural.</li>
    <li> Works Great and easy to apply.  No greasy look.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this. The hold is perfect and the matte finish ideal.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice! will leave your hair smelling and feeling good all day. One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Medium hold/semi-matte.  Left my hair pretty coarse and it dries into the hair making it almost &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  Not a fan of this, but it does work.</li>
    <li> the Mitch Clean Cut itself is a good product.  However I order two bottles from the Beauty House and they both were grainy.  This made it impossible to apply without having these grain chucks in my hair.  When I sent them back they only partially refunded me because I had used some of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the American Crew Products. I&#x27;ve tried Hanz De Fuko products. I&#x27;ve tried Kevin Murphy products. I&#x27;ve tried Gatsby. I&#x27;ve tried fudge. I&#x27;ve tried Redken products. This is my favorite. I cocktail this with Kevin Murphy&#x27;s night rider as I want some of the texturizing effect of it and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is the best and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Seeing it as a medium hold, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be the strongest thing on the market. With that being said, let&#x27;s start off with the basics. The smell is actually way better than the texturizer with the highest hold, so I&#x27;ll give it that. Now onto the bad things; it left my hair feeling very greasy which I hated. Along with the greasiness, it made my hair look very oily as well, which is what I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Better that salon prices.  Authentic and at a great price!!</li>
    <li> Crazy that such a small can costs 16 bucks but it works really well. I have boughten a 5 dollar much bigger tube from target and although it is firm hold not medium it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend and use it every day. Paul Mitchell products is used a lot of companies use in salons. Try a few products  Also try layrite It may be? Check on spelling but that works similar and same price range.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble styling my very thick hair. This has a nice strong hold and doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy feeling by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product. Amazing hold without being too greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my barber.  Best product I&#x27;ve used.  Not too stiff, but a good hold.</li>
    <li> Weird smell associated with this product. Good hold.</li>
    <li> Great control without too much shine and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> cruelty free, and works wonders!</li>
    <li> the only product my very... non product using boyfriend uses... so yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we got him started on deodorant this year, that was a huge step</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of hold without feeling like hair gel</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, I would definitely recommend putting it in wet hair. Trying to style dry hair with this product feels like you&#x27;re trying to tear out your hair. Other than that, it works great and smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> Works grate. Love it, you can use in dry hair, not sticky, not shining, good smell, reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Really recomende it.</li>
    <li> Great hold and a little goes a long way.  I buy this product all of the time for my teenage son.</li>
    <li> one of the best products to styleing your hair</li>
    <li> Awesome product, saw it cheaper at walmart</li>
    <li> This product is another Paul Mitchell easy to use grooming aid. A small amount is all it takes. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not what I expexted, has very little consistency.  Was hoping this would be like the tea tree shaping cream.</li>
    <li> Mitch Clean Cut styled my hair well but I developed several brain tumors after using it for over two years.  After the brain tumors were removed, I started using the hair product again and developed another brain tumor again!</li>
    <li> I previously have been using the Paul Mitchell Reformer strong hold/matte finish (red label) and decided that I liked that product so much I would try out another one, so I purchased this one. It is almost the same feel wise (in your hands) and hold wise (for your hair) but the product doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. It has a very industrial smell, like glue or something of that nature. So I was not a fan, I guess I should have stuck with a good thing in the first place.</li>
    <li> My sons favorite hair gel.  Keeps hair in place without looking to stiff or heavy.</li>
