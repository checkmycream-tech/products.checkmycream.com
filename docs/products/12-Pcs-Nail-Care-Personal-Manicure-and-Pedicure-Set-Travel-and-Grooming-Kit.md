      <li>What more can you want.</li>
      <li>In in the end, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>would be better if they had just put all the items in a sandwich bag instead of that case.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a bunch of metal in a cute case.</li>
      <li>Many items that are helpful when do my gel nails.</li>
      <li>Anybody would love to have this kit in there  reach.</li>
      <li>The case it comes in is nice and closes securely, so</li>
      <li>I thought the Asian box was cool too!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product at an exceptional price!</li>
      <li>Some of the utensils were substandard such as the clippers but the nippers are very good.</li>
      <li>but it does not latch easily.  </li>
      <li>All the tools you need for giving yourself a home manicure, in a compact easy to pack case.  </li>
      <li>This was more than we expected, such a great nail care set in a nice case!</li>
      <li>Although the size may have worked better than I thought, as it was about the size of a large wallet, so it could be easy to place in a drawer or take on a trip.  </li>
      <li>Adorable -- exactly as describbed.  </li>
      <li>recommended to everyone who is looking for a set good quality to buy, buy now while supplies last.</li>
      <li>after 6 months of using every other week for me and my husband all still works great</li>
      <li>Very nice set exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of useful manicure tools inside.  </li>
      <li>its really worth it</li>
      <li>The only down side, is the appearance of the tools and the case could be more attractive...</li>
      <li>but I find the ones I do know how to use very sleek and powerful.</li>
      <li>I considered sending the product back, had they been any more epxensive</li>
      <li>The case itself feels nice, but the locking mechanism is cheap and is hard to latch.  </li>
      <li>Certainly would recommend it.</li>
      <li>when arrived most of the tools were loose inside  the case, a couple were bent.</li>
      <li>bummer was really looking forward to give this as a gift ...</li>
      <li>Very well made and</li>
      <li>and we both really like it.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it, however appears to be very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Poor cover but very good overall.</li>
      <li>Decent quality.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>My sister loves this set she gonna use it with her new nail art kit</li>
      <li>I bought this to toss in my first aid kit while back packing.</li>
      <li>The vendor I purchased this from (through amazon) sent it in it&#x27;s original packaging, which was a tattered old box w/ an Asian language scrawled all over it (nothing against asian languages!)  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a professional nail kit and this one fits the bill.</li>
      <li>The Manicure and Pedicure set she had was not substantial enough to hold up, I purchased her one that was made of stainless steel.</li>
      <li>The tools are cheaply made and the cuticle nipper was broken right out of the package.</li>
      <li>Mid grade quality materials, case is decent and stays locked.</li>
      <li>This is a smokin&#x27; deal on a solid, heavy-grade, complete grooming set.</li>
      <li>Not much that wasn&#x27;t really trash.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the tools are sharp and are high quality.</li>

<li> This also should be negative 5 Stars!!</li>
<li> SORRY I JUST DON&#x27;T WANT YOU TO GET IT.</li>
<li> The items in the kit are as stated but the case is almost useless because the clasp doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> They look scary.</li>
<li> The things are absolutely useless.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this manicure set is garbage.</li>
<li> It is of very poor quality.</li>
<li> The files/scrapers/ear cleaner peices are junk, they&#x27;re just thin, badly pressed metal.  </li>
<li> By dirty</li>
<li> It was very disappointing.</li>

    <li> Adorable -- exactly as describbed.  Decent quality.  Lots of tools.</li>
    <li> This is a smokin&#x27; deal on a solid, heavy-grade, complete grooming set. Ordered one for travel, the other for home.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this set she gonna use it with her new nail art kit</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  HELPS ME STAY UP IN BETWEEN PEDICURES</li>
    <li> It is of very poor quality. Don&#x27;t recommend to buy this item. The things are absolutely useless. It was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The item is a lot smaller than the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The case won&#x27;t even closed...bummer was really looking forward to give this as a gift ...</li>
    <li> This is a great product that satisfies all my needs at home for both manicure and pedicure. Certainly would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with both the quality and packaging of this item.</li>
    <li> You Get What You Pay For........The case is garbage, the clippers and tools are just so-so. would be better if they had just put all the items in a sandwich bag instead of that case. when arrived most of the tools were loose inside  the case, a couple were bent. it was a challenge to get the case open because of the poor design of the latch.</li>
    <li> This manicure set has many features that are simply great.  All the tools you need for giving yourself a home manicure, in a compact easy to pack case.  The tools seem to be of good quality. The only down side, is the appearance of the tools and the case could be more attractive...a rather drab looking assmbly of tools.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this manicure set is garbage. The vendor I purchased this from (through amazon) sent it in it&#x27;s original packaging, which was a tattered old box w/ an Asian language scrawled all over it (nothing against asian languages!)  The case itself feels nice, but the locking mechanism is cheap and is hard to latch.  The tools themselves are very &#x27;dirty.&#x27;  By dirty I mean that they haven&#x27;t been cleaned/polished since creation.  There&#x27;s jagged edges and grinding powder/metal barbs on the clippers, the scissors cant even cut paper.  The tweezers do not &#x27;tweeze&#x27; together evenly where they should.  The files/scrapers/ear cleaner peices are junk, they&#x27;re just thin, badly pressed metal.  I considered sending the product back, had they been any more epxensive than they were i would have.  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> This was more than we expected, such a great nail care set in a nice case! I would not hesitate to order another one. Simply superb!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for her birthday (in October of this year). Haven&#x27;t used it, however appears to be very sturdy. Folds up in a nice case. I like the looks of it.</li>
    <li> recommended to everyone who is looking for a set good quality to buy, buy now while supplies last. its really worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.......after 6 months of using every other week for me and my husband all still works great</li>
    <li> Since purchasing this manicure and pedicure set, I haven&#x27;t had to dish out tons of money to get it done elsewhere.  It has everything you need and then some.</li>
    <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This also should be negative 5 Stars!! This item is made very cheap.  SORRY I JUST DON&#x27;T WANT YOU TO GET IT.</li>
    <li> Incredibly durable and it comes with a plethora of nail care utensils. I have no idea how to use 95% of them but I find the ones I do know how to use very sleek and powerful. The quality of the metal used in this kit should not be overlooked because it makes the difference between purchasing another set in a month or having it last longer. In in the end, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. Maybe in the future I will swallow my manly pride and find out what the other tools do. They look scary.</li>
    <li> It is what is shown and it is just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Bought as a gift and I think they well like it.</li>
    <li> The items in the kit are as stated but the case is almost useless because the clasp doesn&#x27;t work. We use a rubber band to keep it intact.</li>
    <li> The manicure tools seem very good quality and there are many uses for them. Though I&#x27;m  disappointed that the case is faulty and will not stay closed.</li>
    <li> This is a very small kit, which I had anticipated it being larger.  Although the size may have worked better than I thought, as it was about the size of a large wallet, so it could be easy to place in a drawer or take on a trip.  It has a lot of useful manicure tools inside.  The way you open the case is a bit awkward and almost made me feel it was broken or going to break, so that would be my only real flaw.  It wasn&#x27;t broken and hasn&#x27;t but is a but strange.</li>
    <li> Mid grade quality materials, case is decent and stays locked. Very pleased. I bought this to toss in my first aid kit while back packing. Comes wth several tiny thin edged tools.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent nail kit it has all the tools I need for a perfect manicure and pedicure. Anybody would love to have this kit in there  reach.</li>
    <li> Very nice set...bought three as stocking stuffers...the ladies loved them.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a professional nail kit and this one fits the bill. It comes in an amazing leather case and I love the structure of the utensils. I will probably buy another one for traveling. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> very good quality,highly recommend,will buy more for gifts,best set ive found in years,so convenient and handy to open and use</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my son as a gift.  He is leaving for basic military training soon, and he needed a personal care set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a manly man manicure set, with all the tools you need to clip your toenails . . . or dig out your child&#x27;s hair from the twirly parts of the toy helicopter when it gets stuck.  What more can you want.</li>
    <li> The set was just what my wife had wanted for some time.  The Manicure and Pedicure set she had was not substantial enough to hold up, I purchased her one that was made of stainless steel.</li>
    <li> Excellent tools.  Poor cover but very good overall.</li>
    <li> Biggest issue here is that the case it comes in is to thin to full close it without braking. everything inside is of great quality thou so a good buy all and all.</li>
    <li> I looked around for a set for my sons Christmas stocking.  Not much that wasn&#x27;t really trash.&lt;br /&gt;This was perfect.  And the cost was way below what I thought I would have to pay for something that&lt;br /&gt;had enough quality to actually function.  Very well made and Case was perfect.</li>
    <li> Very nice set exactly what I expected. Many items that are helpful when do my gel nails. Would def recommend</li>
    <li> I ordered this to do my brother&#x27;s hands and feet (suffered a stroke and is not able to care for himself).  Some of the utensils were substandard such as the clippers but the nippers are very good.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit. All the tools are sharp and are high quality. The case it comes in is nice and closes securely, so no worries if you want to take it with you on a trip and have it open and spill everything. I bought one for myself and one for my mom and we both really like it. It has all the normal essentials, and a few extras.  I would recommend it to anyone who either does their own nails, or needs a touch up before going to your manicurist.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my son in law and grandson.  They were very nice and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love the happy faces on the tools, they brighten my day!  The tools themselves are great, the case is very nice but it does not latch easily.  I thought the Asian box was cool too!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product at an exceptional price!</li>
    <li> The set looks nice but that&#x27;s about it. The tools are cheaply made and the cuticle nipper was broken right out of the package. It&#x27;s just a bunch of metal in a cute case.</li>
    <li> my husband and boys loved!</li>
    <li> You get what your pay for.  Very cheaply made. I have returned it.</li>
    <li> Nice presentation. Seems like a quality product for the price.  Think my teen daughter will like the smiley faces.  Good stocking stuffer to go with the nail polishes she is getting.</li>
