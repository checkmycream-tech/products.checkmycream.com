      <li>and they clean up good.</li>

      <li>I love this brush set</li>
      <li>I have used them for dance competitions it applies a healthy amount of make up to the face</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t quite found a perfect use for the second biggest one yet.  </li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t think of anything better.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m appreciative of my belongings, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft--I like the feel, but they fray a tad too easily.</li>
      <li>The brush hairs are nice and clean and retain a pretty shape with no noticeable errant strands.  </li>
      <li>All of the eye brushes have a bit bigger than I thought in my head and have a bit of a taper to the end so, again, these are great for contouring and detail work.  </li>

      <li>The coverage wasn&#x27;t that great, but hey I bought it for a pretty low price.</li>
      <li>I really like these brushes I love them for the price</li>
      <li>The make up brushes are nice and soft</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft and very fine.</li>
      <li>Soft brushes...blends makeup very well...and they&#x27;re easy to clean</li>
      <li>There are other cheap brands like the one I mentioned that work way better than these for only a couple bucks more.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The brushes are synthetic, so they don&#x27;t pick up quite as much powder as you&#x27;d like..</li>
      <li>No powder brush.. which is the main reason I ordered this.</li>
      <li>The handles are very sturdy and the bristles are so soft!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I had to re-glue the metal to the wood, but other than that they&#x27;re fine.</li>
      <li>wow.  </li>
      <li>soft and neat gets the job done.</li>
      <li>they are really professional.</li>
      <li>I just got my brushes today I must say they are so soft and</li>
      <li>but I ended up only paying more since I had to buy brushes other than these later anyways.  </li>
      <li>they nice thick and long</li>
      <li>Seriously, for this entire set, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>

    <li> Soft brushes...blends makeup very well...and they&#x27;re easy to clean</li>
    <li> for the price, what a great set of brushes.  The handles all well weighted.  The brush hairs are nice and clean and retain a pretty shape with no noticeable errant strands.  I haven&#x27;t noticed them shedding any bristles yet.  The two big face brushes were a little smaller than I expected.  The largest one is not bad as a blush brush but with the size and a slight taper at the dome, it&#x27;s actually a perfect cheek contour brush.  Haven&#x27;t quite found a perfect use for the second biggest one yet.  All of the eye brushes have a bit bigger than I thought in my head and have a bit of a taper to the end so, again, these are great for contouring and detail work.  Then you&#x27;d have to use a round blending brush to blend it out.  The angle brush is WONDERFUL for gel eyeliners.  Achieved a perfect cat eye with it.  The brushes are synthetic, so they don&#x27;t pick up quite as much powder as you&#x27;d like.. but you know, the art of makeup is a subtle building of colors anyways, so you can&#x27;t go wrong.  For $2.50... wow.  GREAT value.</li>
    <li> This set of makeup brushes is fantastic. Great quality brushes for a great low price, I can&#x27;t think of anything better. Seriously, for this entire set, it&#x27;s worth it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> soft and neat gets the job done. I luv the brushes I use them for my eye shadow and they clean up good.</li>
    <li> It was nice and very affordable. The brushes are soft and very fine. very good quality. Very Great beginners set.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! The handles are very sturdy and the bristles are so soft! You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I love this brush set and I use them quite often. They are perfect for the price and very convenient to use. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best finds in awhile. The brushes are perfect sized and they are very very soft bristled. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I had to re-glue the metal to the wood, but other than that they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> these are so cheap and so I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that they almost all broke off after using them a few times. I guess you can still use the brush part without the wooden stick :/</li>
    <li> Great for anyone that is just starting out with make up!</li>
    <li> I would give it no stars if I could. Horrible brushes. Don&#x27;t waste money. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> No powder brush.. which is the main reason I ordered this. Quality is to be expected. Definitely not real hair.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re soft--I like the feel, but they fray a tad too easily. The coverage wasn&#x27;t that great, but hey I bought it for a pretty low price. I was expecting an eyebrow brush as well since it was listed in the description, but there wasn&#x27;t one. Oh well. Since I&#x27;m appreciative of my belongings, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product. If you&#x27;re some makeup guru or stuck-up brat, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes for starters. I think the price is the most redeeming factor. They haven&#x27;t broken on me yet and don&#x27;t seem like they will.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I would be saving money but I ended up only paying more since I had to buy brushes other than these later anyways.  The quality just wasn&#x27;t there.  There are other cheap brands like the one I mentioned that work way better than these for only a couple bucks more.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting. However, for the price I can&#x27;t complain. Brushes are soft but not much flexibility.</li>
    <li> The head of my most used size fell off within a week.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes today I must say they are so soft and they do not shed wat so ever I really like these brushes I love them for the price they nice thick and long I have no complaints ...</li>
    <li> The make up brushes are nice and soft they are really professional. I have used them for dance competitions it applies a healthy amount of make up to the face doesn&#x27;t cake on to the face. Enjoy</li>
