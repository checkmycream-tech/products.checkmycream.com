      <li>This is a wonderful hair towel.</li>
      <li>Best hair towel ever!!!</li>
      <li>Launders great!</li>
      <li>Very great towel for curly hair!</li>
      <li>; I thought I found the perfect turban for leaving coconut oil in my hair at night.</li>
      <li>great idea</li>
      <li>I just cut 6 inches off of my hair and this towel fits great.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s great for someone with shoulder-length or shorter hair, I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>May be great for others, but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>This is a great luxurious towel to wrap around your head.</li>
      <li>Great for curly hair and travel.</li>
      <li>I purchased one of these for my sister and one for myself based on the two good reviews.  </li>
      <li>Good absorption.</li>
      <li>Good.  </li>
      <li>I will buy a couple more!</li>
      <li>When I first opened the package I was impressed with the softness of the material.  </li>
      <li>I should have read more reviews on this one!</li>
      <li>My wife liked the item and will continue to use  it.</li>
      <li>This is not a turban or head wrap, and there are no directions, or even hints, on how to fashion some kind of turban or head wrap out of it -- like the one in the photo, for instance.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if there was a fastener.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with this purchase and it arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>This is the most absorptive hair towel I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
      <li>Better than my brookstone wrap.</li>
      <li>If I find out a good way to make it useful for hair</li>
      <li>I love the size of the towel</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>It would be nice to have some kind of fastener, but it stays in place pretty well.</li>
      <li>Wonderfully soft, great absorbency.</li>
      <li>It also is easily turned into a turban and keeps washed hair neatly covered.</li>
      <li>If you have super long hair, it might not be the best fit.</li>
      <li>So why wouldn&#x27;t I use a special towel that doesn&#x27;t manhandle the hair while removing the water?</li>
      <li>I use special shampoo &amp; rinse to maintain the color and shine.</li>
      <li>but makes my hair full of tangles</li>
      <li>Really nice, lightweight, absorbent and soft.  </li>
      <li>The true size when recieved was 17&amp;#34; by 33&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and the towel dries quickly in between uses.</li>
      <li>Greatly cuts down on drying and stying time.</li>
      <li>I think I would’ve had better luck if I had purchased a very soft towel and cut and hemmed it myself.  </li>
      <li>I love that it uses natural bamboo fibers.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace my old towel hair wrap and love the material</li>
      <li>not very big, but nice quality</li>
      <li>The towel is super soft and easy to wrap around your head.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than a regular towel.</li>
      <li>I love my red hair - and maintain it diligently with visits to my hairdresser!.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice towel, but it isn&#x27;t wide enough to fit my hair in it.</li>
      <li>After I washed it the wrap lost much of its softness, so the material may have been treated with a softening agent (which washes out the first time it’s laundered).  </li>
      <li>She says it fits well, is really soft and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Although the material is super soft, and very absorbent, the picture of the towel is very deceptive.</li>
      <li>The material dries my hair really well</li>
      <li>The bamboo hair towel gently</li>
      <li>DOESNT REALLY  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>i thought it would be just like the current hair wrap I have, all you have to do is flip your hair down and insert into the pocket, twist it, and then tuck the end to the bottom loop, very secure and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Super soft and highly absorbent.</li>
      <li>Very soft and absorbent!</li>
      <li>It is very soft yet it absorbs the water from wet hair very quickly without feeling damp.</li>
      <li>Very absorbent and soft.  </li>
      <li>Not this one, although it is very soft.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel particularly soft to me, and I can&#x27;t comment on the &amp;#34;wicking away water&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>So incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>Put my old microfiber hair towel to shame.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as a regular towel</li>
      <li>So the wife gave me a disappointed look, and I&#x27;m returning it and looking for another to try to make her happy...</li>

<li> So the wife gave me a disappointed look, and I&#x27;m returning it and looking for another to try to make her happy...</li>

<li> Finally a towel long enough to wrap around my head.</li>
<li> I have a lot of long hair, and I wish it were a tad larger, so I took one star off.</li>
<li> It is too short for my long hair, and has NO fasteners on it!</li>
<li> I searched for a &amp;#34;turban&amp;#34; head towel for my wife who is now into leaving strange hair product stuff in her hair overnight.  </li>
<li> It is plenty long, but the width of the towel makes it to where my hair hangs out at the end of it..</li>
<li> but it takes a long time to air dry on the towel rack after I have used it to dry my hair.  </li>
<li> wicks away the moisture before I comb out and blow dry by &amp;</li>
<li> DRY YOUR HAIR  </li>
<li> The towel barely lets me wrap my hair up, and my hair is just past shoulder length.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a towel, too small to pass as a valid bath towel and way too short for my hair.</li>
<li> Not suitable for long hair.  </li>
<li> As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m holding a plain, small, white, expensive towel.</li>
<li> This one popped up, and I assumed it was the usual type of turban with a velcro or other fastener.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as secure as the type with the pocket that goes around your hair and then a tail that you twist and pull through an elastic loop.</li>
<li> To make it even worse, the packaging says hand wash only - what a pain.  </li>
<li> It is just a small rectangle towel.  </li>
<li> I am disappointed, and would not recommend this to anyone who likes to wrap their hair up while they get dried and ready to dress or go to bed.  </li>
<li> Just a plain thin towel, which arrives in packaging indicating it&#x27;s just a plain towel (nothing about a turban!).  </li>
<li> So I have purchased something I am unable to use.</li>
<li> Got it in the mail yesterday, and I must say I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a nice towel, but it isn&#x27;t wide enough to fit my hair in it. It is plenty long, but the width of the towel makes it to where my hair hangs out at the end of it.. That was the entire reason that I bought the towel!</li>
    <li> Not what i was expecting for being a hair wrap</li>
    <li> Wonderfully soft, great absorbency. I have a lot of long hair, and I wish it were a tad larger, so I took one star off.</li>
    <li> not very big, but nice quality</li>
    <li> Best hair towel ever!!!</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. Have not heard back on how it is.</li>
    <li> Although the material is super soft, and very absorbent, the picture of the towel is very deceptive. The towel barely lets me wrap my hair up, and my hair is just past shoulder length. I am disappointed, and would not recommend this to anyone who likes to wrap their hair up while they get dried and ready to dress or go to bed.  The true size when recieved was 17&amp;#34; by 33&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I should have read more reviews on this one! It is too short for my long hair, and has NO fasteners on it! So I have purchased something I am unable to use.</li>
    <li> I love my red hair - and maintain it diligently with visits to my hairdresser!. I use special shampoo &amp; rinse to maintain the color and shine. So why wouldn&#x27;t I use a special towel that doesn&#x27;t manhandle the hair while removing the water? The bamboo hair towel gently wicks away the moisture before I comb out and blow dry by &amp;#34;do.&amp;#34; I have 2 of these head wraps and carry one with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> DOESNT REALLY  DRY YOUR HAIR  ANY FASTER</li>
    <li> Finally a towel long enough to wrap around my head. All others are like hand towels. This one works!  I will buy a couple more!</li>
    <li> I just cut 6 inches off of my hair and this towel fits great. If you have super long hair, it might not be the best fit. The material dries my hair really well and the towel dries quickly in between uses. It would be nice to have some kind of fastener, but it stays in place pretty well.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Better than my brookstone wrap. Super soft and highly absorbent.Greatly cuts down on drying and stying time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for Mom. She says it fits well, is really soft and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the towel but it takes a long time to air dry on the towel rack after I have used it to dry my hair.  Launders great!</li>
    <li> Very soft and absorbent! I was very pleased with this purchase and it arrived very quickly.</li>

This one popped up, and I assumed it was the usual type of turban with a velcro or other fastener.  Nope.

So the wife gave me a disappointed look, and I&#x27;m returning it and looking for another to try to make her happy...</li>
    <li> After searching &amp;#34;women&#x27;s towel turban,&amp;#34; I was given a selection of those pre-made terrycloth turbans...all except what turned out to be this. Swayed by &amp;#34;bamboo microfiber,&amp;#34; I thought I found the perfect turban for leaving coconut oil in my hair at night. Turns out I bought a mini towel made in china. I gave it a chance only to wake up in a puddle of oil with something rolled up underneath my neck.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as a regular towel but i like the smaller size</li>
    <li> Very absorbent and soft.  Feels luxurious. I bought this to replace my old towel hair wrap and love the material but it is not the type that fastens with a loop and button. It&#x27;s basically a big hand towel which is why I&#x27;m taking off one star. It&#x27;s advertised as a head wrap but there are no instructions for how to wrap it as seen in the picture. I manage to get it to work but it&#x27;s not nearly as secure as the type with the pocket that goes around your hair and then a tail that you twist and pull through an elastic loop.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for my sister and one for myself based on the two good reviews.  FYI: from the picture it looks like a turban but it’s really just a small towel, however, that isn’t why I gave it a low rating.  When I first opened the package I was impressed with the softness of the material.  After I washed it the wrap lost much of its softness, so the material may have been treated with a softening agent (which washes out the first time it’s laundered).  It also is not cut evenly.  I think I would’ve had better luck if I had purchased a very soft towel and cut and hemmed it myself.  Plus, I probably could make 4 of them out of one towel.</li>
    <li> Good absorption. It would be nice if there was a fastener.</li>
    <li> This is the most absorptive hair towel I&#x27;ve come across. I love that it uses natural bamboo fibers. The towel is super soft and easy to wrap around your head.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair towel. It looks like a luxury towel and feels like a luxury towel. It is very soft yet it absorbs the water from wet hair very quickly without feeling damp. It also is easily turned into a turban and keeps washed hair neatly covered. I will be ordering another.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail yesterday, and I must say I&#x27;m disappointed. This is not a turban or head wrap, and there are no directions, or even hints, on how to fashion some kind of turban or head wrap out of it -- like the one in the photo, for instance. It&#x27;s just a towel, too small to pass as a valid bath towel and way too short for my hair. As far as I can tell, I&#x27;m holding a plain, small, white, expensive towel. Maybe it&#x27;s great for someone with shoulder-length or shorter hair, I wouldn&#x27;t know. It doesn&#x27;t feel particularly soft to me, and I can&#x27;t comment on the &amp;#34;wicking away water&amp;#34; effect. At our house it&#x27;s been passively re-assigned as a hand towel. May be great for others, but it&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Currently searching for &amp;#34;hair headwrap turban&amp;#34; information on the &#x27;net. If I find out a good way to make it useful for hair I will revise my review.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! So incredibly soft. Put my old microfiber hair towel to shame. Will be ordering another one as a backup soon.</li>
    <li> Good.  My wife liked the item and will continue to use  it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  It is just a small rectangle towel.  Not suitable for long hair.  No closing.  No instructions on how to use it.  i thought it would be just like the current hair wrap I have, all you have to do is flip your hair down and insert into the pocket, twist it, and then tuck the end to the bottom loop, very secure and easy to use.  Not this one, although it is very soft.</li>
    <li> Very great towel for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than a regular towel.</li>
    <li> great idea but makes my hair full of tangles</li>
    <li> This is a great luxurious towel to wrap around your head. I like it a lot!</li>
