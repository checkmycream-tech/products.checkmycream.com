    <li> My favorite lotion ever!!!  It smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> Fresh Melon and coconut fragrance gives you an endless summer experience each time you use it.  Clean and crisp scent make you feel like you are on vacation.</li>
    <li> I had a small bottle of OPI Avojuice given to me as a gift.  I loved it and went searching for more.  I ordered several small bottles and found out that I love many of the \\&quot;flavors.\\&quot;  My favorite is still the coconut melon, but, others are great, too.  It has a great, mild, scent, and leaves my hands smooth and silky.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this lotion in a local beauty store. Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t have the product for sale yet. I went on-line, found it HERE, of course, and ordered it. It arrived on time, is luscious - you should smell it! Perfect for summer, and my skin just drinks in the moisture! Yum!</li>
    <li> I have used and liked OPI Avojuice Coconut Melon Juicie  before that is the reason I bought it. thanks</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. She says she really likes that it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Happy wife, happy life. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this lotion. She has used it for many years. I buy this large size for the savings compared to the smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  She recently had knee replacement surgery and raves on how this product is better for scars than Vitamin E. She has also gotten other family members using it because it softens and moistens the skin. (ASIN:B0012KI55E OPI Avojuice Skin Quenchers Coconut Melon Juicie Hand Body Lotion 6.6oz]]mg</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no fan of anything Melon or of lotion in general, but this stuff is absolutely awesome.  The smell is absolutely wonderful; it starts out strong (I have no problem with this) and gradually becomes more subtle.  As far as moisturizing, it does a better job than most with my chronically dried-out elbows.  I use it sparingly because of the cost but I refuse to let myself run out as long as they keep making it.  Try this, especially if you like coconut or tropical scents.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I just discovered OPI Avojuice, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The product is very light, absorbs almost immediately into your skin (leaving no sticky residue), lasts for hours and hours, and smells wonderful.  Terrific moisturizing properties.  My two favorite scents are the Coconut Melon and the Peach.  The Coconut Melon is a very light, pleasant scent.  The Peach smells heavenly, and is a stronger scent.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Mango - the scent is a little too strong for my taste, and really does smell like Mango!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be an Avojuice fan for a long time!!</li>
    <li> OMG! This is the best lotion I have ever used. It smell great,feels great on your skin and is not at all greasy. It is totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for OPI&#x27;s tangerine juice quencher.  Unable to find it, I took the plunge for their coconut melon product and was not disappointed.  Smooth, refreshing, and invigorating, with the island fragrance of coconuts to intoxicate your senses.  Great gift idea for Christmas.  Your sweetheart will love it.</li>
    <li> opi avojuice is the best hand lotion i ever tried - the scent coconut melon juice reminds of&lt;br /&gt;being on the beach - any of my friends who have tried it want to know how they can&lt;br /&gt;order it</li>
    <li> The item was very thin and watery, not thick like it should be.</li>
    <li> Never greasy. My skin feels soft for days.</li>
    <li> I like it but it doesn&#x27;t have the nice coconut smell that the original Opi Coconut Melon Skin Quencher has.  You have changed it somehow.&lt;br /&gt;Jane B</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff! Who knew?!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Besides it smelling delicious, it leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> i have been using this type for years. works great and a very nice smell. can be put all over your body.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend. I first bought the 6 pack sampler, but then loved the coconut melon scent the best. This lotion is like water - it&#x27;s not greasy and dries very quickly. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this lotion.  They use it at the nail salon I go to and I just love the smell.  A little perfumey for those who do not like that.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating and smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I had received a small sample and used it during the severe weather this past winter when my skin started cracking to the point of hurting.  It was the only lotion that seems to help.  Great product and seller&#x27;s delivery was prompt with excellent packaging.</li>
    <li> My hair salon hands out samples of these during the holidays.  I used some at the bank today, and the teller loved the smell!  I then decided to search&lt;br /&gt;Amazon for it.  I am so obsessed with how it seems to soak in to your skin, as if you skin just took a drink of water.  I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it!  I am so happy to find it on Amazon and plan to keep this in stock since I suffer from dry skin during the winter heating months!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lotion! A little goes a long way and feels great on your skin. It is easily absorbed and not greasy at all! It seems to work 24+ hours because I still feel it in (not on) my skin when I get my next shower. The scents are nice but a little overbearing. I would love a non-scented one that didn&#x27;t clash with my perfume. The price is very reasonable and it lasts forever. Again, I love it.</li>
    <li> The lotion makes your skin so soft and the fragrance is wonderful.  Would definitely buy again and would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> I gave my granddaughter at the age of seven a travel tube. Fast forward five years later and I have been buying her the lotion ever since.  Her mom and younger sister use it also.  My granddaughter told me yesterday she still has the travel tube.  It is there favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> Excellent  lotion. Very fragrant and not too strong.. Rich and smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> The coconut scent overpowers the melon scent, so while it&#x27;s not all that bad, I can&#x27;t say that I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Smells good and makes my skin soft.  Much cheaper than what I paid my hair stylist for it.</li>

    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using for several years. Nice &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; smell, absorbs into your skin quickly, not greasey at all!</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Great value and it came very quickly!!</li>
    <li> My nail specialist recommended this for my hands. I love it so much that I use it on my face. It&#x27;s like liquid water hydration for your skin. Some miisturizers sit on your face like heavy oily and feel greasy. Liquid thirsty quencher for tge skin.</li>
    <li> the best Hand creme ever!</li>
    <li> Have used product for yeas, works fine</li>
    <li> Smells great feels great and keeps skin soft all day!!</li>
