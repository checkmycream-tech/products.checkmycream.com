<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Favorite lotion! Hands down, it smells amazing and makes your skin shimmer. You&#x27;ll notice results almost immediately. Also, the lotion is very thin so you won&#x27;t be gross afterwards.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing but isn&#x27;t too flower-y. It isn&#x27;t flower-y at all actually! It is a nice subtle scent. No bronzer is a plus and my clothes do not get stained from this. It is great and the bottle looks cool too! The chain broke but oh well :)</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and was true to description. Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the best lotion I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t have bronzers. You get such amazing color from it SO quickly, especially my legs! I love this lotion and it will forever be my go to lotion, I hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
    <li> I was first attracted to this lotion just because the bottle is so damn pretty! My tanning salon retails lotions for so much money.. seems like a waste to spend 60 dollars on an 8.5 oz bottle of lotions they have. This was delivered to me in less than a week and even came with a free sample of another Designer Skin product! It smells really good. I don&#x27;t like the after tan smell that much, but I&#x27;ve never found a lotion that I do. The only complaint I have is that it leaves a weird film on the tanning bed after I&#x27;m done, and it seems to make me a little sweatier than other lotions. Totally worth it though. Also, retails in my salon for $90, this price is so unbeatable. Gives me a dark brown color, and I even use it when I go to the pool.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin soft and smelling great after tanning.</li>
    <li> Yes I only use all designer skin products. I bought this one for outside because there&#x27;s no added bronzers or dha! This is so smooth and silky soft. I use this for the beach but I also occasionally mix it into my tanning bed routine. Now I use three tingles and two bronzers for indoors. All the tingles have bronzers in them so this is a nice switch for your skin! If you tan a lot as need a great outdoor one I would so get this! Xox</li>
    <li> I am totally obsessed with this lotion.  After reading reviews of this and a few other indoor tanning lotions, I went with Phoenician and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  This lotion really moisturizes and leaves my skin smelling great and feeling silky.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much color I got after using it only once.  I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> This product has a great smell, leaves skin feeling silky smooth and moisturized. Can&#x27;t tell much for how it performs for color, as I am fair skinned and it takes me longer to get color.</li>
    <li> so they only reason i even know about this is because the tanning salon i just signed up with tried selling it to me for 50$ and that was 35% off of its normal price they have it for which is 75$, wow 50$ for a tanning lotion i think NOT, so i decided to do some research on the number one best shopping sight, \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; and whalla i found it for 32$ with free 2day shipping, perfect!  so this is the third day ive used it and i can see it doing its work, i use it in a stand up tanning booth and the smell is amazing and the way it makes your skin feel is also a plus, feels like you just used the liquid baby powder all over your body!! Didnt notice any burned smell after coming out of the tanning booth, still smelled amazing, over all i love it. I do want to try a bronzing tanning lotion later on tho.</li>
    <li> This lotion is low / absent of bronzers, so I get the best natural tan possible. I love the scent, especially because I can&#x27;t stand all the fruity, island inspired fragrances in most tanning lotions. Fantastic! Very pleased...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different tanning lotions over the years and Phoenician is by far my favorite lotion that doesn&#x27;t contain bronzers. I alternate my tanning sessions between bronzers and non-bronzers (DS Bellezza is my favorite bronzer). For those who haven&#x27;t tried Designer Skin&#x27;s silicone lotions the texture is phenomenal. I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any spa treatment that could make your skin feel so soft and smooth. It soaks into your skin right away, no wasting time rubbing it in. There is no greasy feeling and it dries almost powdery. It has a very soft scent. Don&#x27;t be put off by the fig fragrance. A lot of fig-scented lotions and perfumes, as well as real figs themselves, can be quite strong. This has a subtle fresh fig fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger or leave you with that dreaded \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell. I kind of wish the smell would last longer because it&#x27;s so nice. I would recommend this to both beginner and experienced tanners.</li>
    <li> This is the first one that I have used that didn&#x27;t give me that really bad burned skin smell after the tanning bed. One can actually go somewhere after tanning without being paranoid about how weird and burned one smells. It seems to do a decent job, could do better, but it works fairly well.</li>
    <li> I have a base tan already and am as dark as I usually get.  But I tried this one and my skin seemed to darken up within a few hours of use.  I really like the feel also.  My skin is silky smooth.  AND.. no after tan smell either!!</li>
    <li> Authentic.. a fourth of retail.. and just what you need to boost your melanin if you hit a plateau in tanning that hot body;) Then you can switch back to a bronzer.. I use these from Designer Skin because I love the consistency.. its smooth and non sticky.. and you dont smell like a roasted marshmellow after!! ;) Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I thought the price was reasonable for the size of the product. It comes in a fairly large bottle. I bought this because I did not want a bronzer.  It is a great lotion. It leaves my skin satiny smooth. I tan easily, so I cannot say with certainty that it assists with tanning. However it is wonderful to moisturize skin while tanning. It is worth the amazon price. I would have been very unhappy had I paid the price posted at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I did not think I would ever hate any product from Designer Skin; I have loved every product of theirs that I have ever tried---except this one. I should have listened to some of the negative reviews about the scent-----it is VERY STRONG AND PERFUMY (yes I am making that a word). If you do not like strong perfume smells STAY AWAY from this product. I did notice a little color from it the 2 times I did use it, but the horrible headache it gave me and the asthma attack it gave my husband when he walked past me, was not worth it. I promptly placed an order for Juicy Gossip as reviews said it has a sweet fruity smell (I am hoping that it will smell like the Juicy tan extender I had also ordered---love the way it smells). Next time I will listen to those who say it has a perfume smell. Anyone want to buy a bottle of Phoenician that was only used twice ??? Just $20 shipped.....LOL</li>
    <li> For someone that is light skin and is looking for a very natural tan without the use of chemical bronzers, this is it! I got the tan I wanted in 3 weeks (medium tan) and I have been complemented so much of how natural it looks. I loved it, too, because it has all those anti-aging natural ingredients and it promotes cell production as well.  However, if you legs are hard to tan like mine are you should get the Gorgeous Gems from designerskin and you will be amazed of how great that product works too.</li>
    <li> High quality tanning lotion. Shipped fast and far cheaper than you will find it in a tanning salon. Thanks so much! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing the ridiculous prices of tanning lotion at the salon. Mostly I wanted a moisturizer and something to cover up that after tan odor. I am not somebody who tans regularly, but since I was in school full time I wanted to work on being less pale for an upcoming vacation and tanned for a month prior to the trip. Just saying this all because maybe those who tan regularly and long term may get different results than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to not wanting to deal with bronzers this was one of the only lotions I could find without bronzers in it. I love the way it goes on your skin, very smooth and lasts for nearly the rest of the day. I&#x27;ve gone tanning before class in the morning and did not have to shower again because it has a pleasant scent. I have been complimented by the staff at the salon and 2 of them expressed interest in the lotion since they do not sell this type at their location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, not sure if it helps your tan, but definitely moisturizes you and makes you smell nice for the rest of the day. It&#x27;s a powdery light fresh scent and I still crack up thinking of when one of the girls told me she could smell the lotion as I was tanning (or baking as I added).</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! I have really fair skin and it doesn&#x27;t burn me! It is a perfect tanning lotion for fair skin! Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is sold in my salon for about $80! The color you get from it is awesome! Not too bronzy (is that a word? lol) The smell is so nice. A warm perfume type fragrance. Its a bit strong at first when you put it on, but then wafts throughout the salon while tanning. I get lots of compliments on the scent. And it smells just as great after tanning so I don&#x27;t worry about showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to really nourish the skin well. My skin dries out easily.  I would buy this again, especially at such a great price. This is the real product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works as well as It should. I&#x27;ve used many other tanning lotions and they seemed to accelerate my tan much better.  Somewhat disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> This product arrived a week before it was scheduled to be delivered, which was awesome since I hate waiting for shipping! The lotion itself is great smelling and feels amazing on your skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky like some lotions. The silicone really helps to treat your skin and make it baby soft! Everytime I use it, I end up rubbing my arms and legs for the rest of the day because it&#x27;s so damn soft.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great and smells great before AND after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more of this stuff. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 24 year old daughter since she and my wife tan together. She loved it and she is really dark.</li>
    <li> First of all, I tan moderately (mostly as a treatment for medical conditions) and my goal is not to be as brown as I can be. I just want to enjoy my tanning sessions and maintain some color, so if you&#x27;re looking to get to that \\&quot;next level\\&quot; in darkness, maybe this product isn&#x27;t for you. :) What&#x27;s important to me is to have a tan that looks natural on my skin (fair but with a yellowish-olive tone), so I tend to avoid bronzers altogether, especially DHA! I don&#x27;t trust chemicals not to turn me orange--and besides, DHA smells just awful after tanning.    That said, Phoenician is great because it&#x27;s bronzer-free but has compounds that supposedly amplify the skin&#x27;s natural ability to tan. The silicone makes the lotion feel great, and the fig fragrance smells wonderful both before and after tanning. The lotion never feels sticky, heavy or gross on my skin. And even though ALL lotions contain harmful chemicals, at least Phoenician is chock-full of vitamins, amino acids and plant extracts, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting the lesser of two evils when I use it. ;)     Anyway, Phoenician sells for over $90 at salons but I&#x27;ve never paid more than $35 for it on Amazon. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner, nicely packaged with plastic encasing so no way it could leak. I&#x27;ve used this product before so if you want a good enahncer without the bronze streaking, this is the one to get. I found out I was expecting the day I receieved it, so it is still unused.</li>
    <li> Great buy! I will buy this product again. You will notice a color change within the first two sessions of use. I am German, Irish, and polish but I tan fairly well. The first session I was red, but the by the second use you can start to see that warm color set in. The smell is light and great, not overbearing, and doesn&#x27;t smell like a normal tanner. The firming action is great! My skin feels silky smoothe and I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality lotion.  It spreads really well, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get your body covered.  It has a great smell to it too, very important for how you smell after the tan.  I had been buying this from my salon, and it is priced well over $100.  I will never buy tanning lotin from the store again.  This is the place for great deals!</li>
    <li> Packaged well, exactly as described. Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> The place I used to tan at has this same product for $110! That seems ridiculous to me when you can get the same exact product online.  I had no trouble recieving this ontime. (It actually came a day earlier than I thought)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! Smells great, leaves my skin soft and smooth, and there&#x27;s never an after tan smell. Oh and since there&#x27;s no bronzer I don&#x27;t have to worry about it turning me into an umpa loompa. Lol!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for moisturizing.  The smell is a bit strong. Based off the smell i would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;tanning lotion\\&quot; extraordinaire, BUT... I really like this one! It smells super good, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, and it works. It isn&#x27;t a bronzer, but definitely accelerated my tan. A lot of people have been complaining about the way this product smells after tanning, but I haven&#x27;t noticed. I like how I DON&#x27;T smell like a tanning bed when I use this product.</li>
    <li> This product just smells so good you want to eat it.  It goes on smooth and creamy and dissolves into your skin.  Very good product that I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I agree that the product makes your skin soft but the purpose is to enhance your tan from the indoor tanning, which it did not. I feel like the lotion was awaste of money!!!! I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Im very picky when it comes to tanning lotions. I tried this one and I LOVE IT AND HAVE ANOTHER BOTTLE ON THE WAY..!!! My color is amazing. This is the very best ive ever used. The smell is really good with no after tan smell. I SAY GET THIS</li>
    <li> This is the only tanning lotion I will use. It leaves your skin feeling soooo soft. And I love the way it smells. Gives you a great pure tan without all the nasty bronzers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Phoenician for the past 2 summers. I&#x27;m white/Mexican so I tan for a month each year. I already have a little color to my skin, although its very pale. This lotion makes my tan look natural. It&#x27;s smooth. It doesn&#x27;t stink but it has a mild pleasant smell. This year, however, I haven&#x27;t had much time to tan and go every day. If you are a busy person and can&#x27;t tan every day, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. This lotion accelerates your tan but i think a bronzer would give you a tan faster.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I first began tanning a little under a month ago. Pale white and never seen sun before, now I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how tan I look. This built up my base tan FAST and feels great on the skin. No gross after-smell and seemed to really work. Now I&#x27;m graduating up to bronzers and tingles and not having the best of luck finding a lotion that is as amazing working AND smelling as this one... they just all fall flat. I&#x27;m definitely keeping this lotion in my rotation (will reorder once I&#x27;m out!) and I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only Giving This 4 Stars Because I Hate the smell. but its not fake and i was using extreme situation and then to this. it definitely excelled my tan and i cant stop touching my hands or my arms because there so soft. but i just wish this had a better sent it reminds me of cheap perfume i love this tanning lotion and i only used it once. but i don&#x27;t think this would be for fair skinned people because i feel like you need a base with this so try doing what i did first then get this. i wish i could give this a 5 star but i REALLY don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells kind of weird, but leaves my skin extra soft. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my tanning experience though.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, not overly flowery or tropical. You can leave the tanning salon not stink like you just came from a tanning salon! The lotion itself is light and not at all greasy. And the lack of DHA is a plus. I&#x27;ll stick with this one for a while!</li>
    <li> If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Product arrived without any safety seal, so the product is probably knock off. Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with this and the smell is annoying.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so great and it smells rich and warm but not icky sweet.  Love it.  It leaves skin super uber soft. No bronzer in it, so no stains on clothes.</li>
    <li> I loved loved loved loved this tanning lotion!!!! it was absolutely amazing!!! i was super nervous about the seller after I placed the order though since they are company that sells condoms and sex stuff... other than that i was very pleased with my order and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is very effective for gaining color from bed tanning.  It has no bronzer and no tingle, both of which I loathe. The scent while applying and after tanning is delightful--- there is absolutely no \\&quot;I just got out of the tanning bed smell\\&quot; with this lotion. It has a very powdery scent, very much like a Guerlain perfume I use. The feel on the skin it delightful. It is not slick or greasy or sticky at all. I adore this lotion and will definitely be ordering it again in the future.  The packaging is rather pretty, but I jerked that silly chain off and tossed it on my first use. Also I have noticed glitter from the bottle on my hands but it is only a speck or two and I have not noticed it transferring to my body as I applied the lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Im a Huge designer skin fan anyways, but I really like this lotion. Deep color, but awesome moisture.</li>
    <li> this is my go to lotion.  i love the silky feel it gives your skin and the smell is awesome!!</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my skin feel silky and gives me a beautiful dark tan. I have been using Phoeniician for at least 3 years and highly recommend it</li>
    <li> LOOK MY DESIGNER SKIN PHOENICIAN AND THE LUMINARY BRONZER.  I SWICTH EVERY OTHER VISIT AND THEY ARE THE BEST TO ME.  I HAVE BEEN USING THESE PRODUCTS FOR YEARS AND THEY PLEASE ME AND GIVE MY A NATURAL GOLDEN GLOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS DESIGNER SKIN PRODUCTS FOR SUCH AN AMAZING PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt; CONNIE</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion, but it is not my favorite designer skin product. It was silky as you put it on and I didn&#x27;t have trouble smelling like a tanning bed or my skin drying out.</li>
    <li> Shipped next day. And the prices are unbelievable. This is my second lotion from them and because their prices and quality I can afford to own amazing tanning lotions that retail for 125+</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion helps to create a deep dark tan while making your skin so soft. The scent is a little strong for me but the tan is great! I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great seller, not too happy with the lotion.</li>
    <li> Great website to order from-Product came in on time to go to beach-tanning lotion does a great job -anyone who used it loved it</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes your skin feel silky smooth and the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tanning lotions for over a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this has been my favorite. Why purchase it for $120 at the tanning salon when it&#x27;s cheap on amazon??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin smell really good. Almost like cotton candy. And it makes your skin shimmer and silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always feel a lot more beautiful using this lotion!</li>
    <li> This lotion is a very love it or hate it scent, so I highly recommend smelling this at your tanning salon if you can before purchasing it on Amazon. I,unfortunately, didn&#x27;t, &amp; I really hated the smell of it. It did feel very nice &amp; silky going on, but it was purely the silicones, &amp; doesn&#x27;t actually have any moisturizing properties. Despite popular belief that silicones are moisturizing, all they do is coat your skin, they don&#x27;t hydrate it. I can&#x27;t really describe the smell, other than it&#x27;s VERY STRONG &amp; perfumery. I should&#x27;ve prefaced this by saying that I am not sensitive to scents in the slightest, which is why I ignored the reviews on here saying it was too strong &amp; perfumery. I could probably (maybe) ignore the fact that I hated the scent if it gave me a great color boost, but nada, I&#x27;m afraid. Nothing at all. I ended up selling this on eBay after trying it only once to at least get some of my money back. (You can sell used lotions on eBay as long as u list them as used, which I did of course.) I didn&#x27;t give this 1 star because it wasn&#x27;t horrible, just bad, so it gets 2.</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is awful. Literally the worst smelling thing I have ever put on my body. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s expired, or fake, or if this is really how it is supposed to smell (which I doubt) but its horrible. It was fulfilled by Beauty Supplies, I believe, not Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great (even for men), spreads well, eases itching, not oily and I did notice a slightly darker, richer tan.</li>
    <li> First lotion purchased from Amazon. Arrived wrapped and in new condition. DS Phoenician is very silky soft, has no bronzers so it will not make you tan instantly. Has been the only lotion i use when i go tanning and it does gradually work considering i was very pale. Did not burn or turn any orange colors. After tanning you do not smell funky, the fragrance is very light. I did notice my face tends to get red spots in tiny areas so would not recommend it for your face. Overall i would repurchase/recommend to others especially since it leaves your skin so soft you might not be able to stop rubbing your arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Smells AWESOME, works PERFECTLY and a real BARGAIN!!</li>
    <li> You have a quality product that goes on like silk, feels like silky smoothness on your skin, smells slightly perfumy but not floral or sweet. So luxurious after tanning. Skin is never dry and tight. I bought it after trying a small drop sample at my salon.</li>
    <li> This is my second favorite tanning lotion to Color Bomb. I switch between the 2 so I don&#x27;t over do it with bronzing. This smells like a really expensive perfume and feels good going on. Can&#x27;t beat the price on here compared to the salon, either!</li>
    <li> I have high pigment in my skin, so I easily turn orange. It&#x27;s hard to find a great lotion without a bronzer. I like this one and I will definitely be buying again! The shipping was quick, which I like, it only took a few days to arrive. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> really good product if your looking for a good tanning lotion this is the one goes on clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, I get asked all the time what lotion I use!  It&#x27;s very creamy and feels great.  I don&#x27;t break out anywhere either.  I am a blue eyed, red-haired, freckly woman, and this bronzer has really helped bring out my tan before my wedding!</li>
    <li> Sold by Glamour Tanning and shipped by Amazon.  This product is very questionable.  The original seal is gone and packing tape is wrapped around the top of the bottle.  I will be taking issue with Amazon.  What a crock.</li>
    <li> I am a fair skinned redhead and this is the first lotion that I have used that&#x27;s actually helped me to get a nice healthy glow. I have used other lotions from the tanning salon that I go to but this lotion has given the best color and actually feels really good. Before I ordered this from amazon I read a TON of reviews for different lotions, made notes about problems with shipping, not getting a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product and things like that but I have had none of those issues. I plan to buy another bottle of this and probably try some more lotions by Designer Skin.&lt;br /&gt;oh, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad but I&#x27;m convinced that all tanning lotions are gonna smell a little weird no matter how much we don&#x27;t want them to....</li>
    <li> received this very fast. I got this within 2 days of ordering the product. This is definitely the real stuff. I use this tanning lotion very often so I would know. Its worth the price! it sells for over 90 dollars in the salon! So buy from amazon &amp; save money... I ordered from tanforless &amp; will def be ordering from them again! :-)</li>
    <li> couldnt beat the price for this</li>
    <li> This lotion has definitely sped up my tanning process. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since using it, and since it&#x27;s not a bronzer it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin streaky like other products have. It smells nice and it does make your skin feel amazing after using it. Only con to this product is that the chain and the plaque holding the title of the brand fell off within a couple days.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a must have. If you are tanning in a tanning bed or even at all, you need to be using this lotion. No questions. It have silicone in it to help with the elasticity of your skin which helps prevent wrinkles and aging. You can shower after you use it, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few lotions I have ever tanned with that smelled the same before &amp; after. It smells amazing too! It&#x27;s consistent perfume smell makes this a lotion that I can tan with and still go somewhere afterwards smelling wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t use bronzers, so it doesn&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; look at all. I tan with SunTan City, and they sell this for $95 a bottle. They compare it to their stores special blend lotion Amour, which also smells great, but does not help your skin as much color as quickly, nor can you find Amour anywhere but in their stores for $105 a bottle. Phonecian really nourishes your skin - just read the ingredients - it actually contains ALL the proteins your body needs to keep your skin in top shape, good moisturizers, plant extracts, and yes silicones which help it spread smoothly and evenly (according to the salon girls, silicone based lotions are the reason they don&#x27;t have after tan odor). I noticed I didn&#x27;t have to use as much of this lotion to cover my whole body compared to others, so it makes it a better value. I absolutely recommend this lotion! If you don&#x27;t tan easily, this lotion will definitely help. If you do tan easily like me, be prepared to notice huge color within 1 hour of tanning! I was shocked at how much more color I got with this lotion, even compared to the &amp;#34;special blend salon exclusive&amp;#34; lotions!</li>
    <li> Very good starter tan lotion for beginners.....I still use thisntonget a nice glow even after obtaining a base tan.....nice product!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion. It leaves my skin very smooth and my boyfriend loves the feel and smell of my skin after using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff will change our life! I don&#x27;t use it for tanning, use it for smell and feel. It&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I think it has pheromones in it for real, and makes your skin silky smooth. Kinda rockstar material!</li>
    <li> The smell is great. It is light and easy to apply. I do wish that it had more bronzing effect than it does. I like that it can be used indoors and outdoors.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much at all for me. Almost like just having a lotion. Bummed I spent that much on it and got nothing.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and burn easily when i go to a tanning bed. I bought this product hoping it would stop me from burning so much. It does wonders i hardly burn while tanning and it helps me become tanner faster. Well worth the purchase and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells good with no after tan smell. Feels amazing and rubs in well.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. As a redhead I have a hard time getting a tan but this lotion has really helped accelerate my tanning. I&#x27;ve gotten a great color from using it! I would definitely recommend this lotion for anyone who wants to steer clear of bronzers.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s cheaper to buy it on Amazon than it is to buy it in a tanning salon. I really like the lotion, it works great.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I think: if you&#x27;re like me, and you like getting dark without the fake bronzers but still want to see color results fast then this is the product for you!!!! While you don&#x27;t get the blackness of the bronzer look, you get a DARK tan that&#x27;s REAL and the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t wash off when you shower! your tan is there to stay!! I mean really could there be a more perfect product!? So happy I purchased this. I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while so I already had a good tan but this pushed me past my tanning plateau I hit a couple weeks ago. Now I feel like there&#x27;s no limit with how dark I can get and I can&#x27;t wait to keep seeing good results! :) my tan is beautiful with this product! Really dark and natural looking. And NO STREAKS!! makes my skin feel awesome and the smell is to die for!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but I love it. I think alternating this with a bronzer is going to get me my darkest! The smell is to die for, before AND after tanning. Usually I always smell burt when getting out of the tanning bed, but Phoenician does the trick! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good intensifier tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Good for gaining base tan - good smell, no bronzers</li>
    <li> It does keep my skin from burning, but that signature Phoenician smell (like sweet figs or something) is just not there.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice that it enhanced my tan in any way, besides keep me moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I received it, the chain holding the Phoenician label on the front had broken off, and the label was starting to peel- so maybe what I got was just old or expired. I think I&#x27;ll stick to buying from the salon from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for a base tan and good for rotation because its an accelerator, and just fun to use! If you have reached your peak id say get a stronger accelerator or another lotion, that&#x27;s where im at now.  It has a verrry veryyyy light hint of bronzing, no dha or fake stuff that washes off so you have NO hand staining or streaking. Gave me a beautiful golden brown base! This is a lotion that I also use outdoors. Packaging was good, the lotion was SEALED.  This lotion will make your skin so velvety smooth soft! I wanted to use it sitting at home, I loved the silicone so much that I went on a search for a body lotion that did the same, if anybody is looking for that as well &amp;#34;designer skin BLACK extender&amp;#34; gives you that silicone silky soft while extending your tan :-)</li>
    <li> I was a little weary of ordering a tanning bed lotion online.they are so expensive&amp;getting them for half tha price on Amazon,you&#x27;re scared u might get ripped off.even at half price I payed $30 for this&amp;I have to say it was worth every penny.I definitely noticed a small difference immediately.I just went today,so tomorrow I know it&#x27;ll be even deeper.&amp;tha application is soooo smooth&amp;soft.I love it so far&amp;u cannot beat tha scent! No burnt tanning or basic coconutty smell w this.it smells very nice&amp;mellow</li>
    <li> Shipping time was fast. The lotion&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t bad either. Makes your skin very soft. I have very very fair skin and this lotion seems to be improving the way I tan.</li>
    <li> A very nice product. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> ok I don&#x27;t think I have EVER written a review but I sure had to with this one!!! I try to tan 5 times a week. My current lotion (acaiberry by Squeeze) was running out so I started researching what was out there, bronzers or no bronzers etc.I tried many sample size things at my tanning place and wasn&#x27;t totally sold with any. Decided I needed to still get just a regular accelerator, no bronzer, and looked on the companies websites directly before coming to Amazon..honestly mostly I focused on the smell because I have a very sensitive nose and hate certain smells. So I bought Phoenician via amazon. Smells awesome even after tanning! Yup, no burnt skin smell after, and my skin feels absolutely fabulous and soft...so silky! Best part of all? I got a nice dark color right after first use even though I have been tanning for a while! I would not have noticed except I was not careful on how I laid on the tanning bed so when I got up guess what...MAJOR tan line! So I need to go back today to even it out hahaha. Truly in love with the lotion after just one use...and one of the girls at the tanning place fell in love with it too and will be ordering it for there. She was so impressed with the color AND the nice scent! I want to add a picture I took...it is such a difference it looks like a skin fold but its not!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a skam. The lotion isn&#x27;t real designer skin lotion. Do not purchase</li>
    <li> annoyed that the bottle was open when recieved...didnt bother to send back. used anyway...but dont feel like the product worked as well as a bottle ive used before.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on the designer products from amazon. They are not real . Please purchase your tanning products from your tanning salon. I know they are a lot more expensive but at least you can get your money back when you feel it doesn&#x27;t work for you without paying shipping</li>
    <li> The smell of the lotion was nothing like it started in the review. I had so shower after using the product, it smelled horrible.</li>
    <li> smell, application, and results &#x3D; one satisfied customer! Worth every penny again and again! It moisturizes so well and the scent is tops</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give the desired tan that I would get using other designer skin products</li>
    <li> Have used other tanning products but this one got me tanned after one use. This is my new favourite product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to have a tan for years now and with this it finally seems possible! With Irish descent super pale skin on my body I thought that this super whiteness was good as it&#x27;s gets. Ive only been using it a few weeks and already am several shades darker than I was. and actually have a tan line! What! Miracles happen! I already ordered my next bottle. Super pale people&#x27;s that think this is as good as it&#x27;s going to get your wrong try this stuff. One down side I&#x27;m a guy and the bottle is very femin looking but who cares get it</li>
    <li> Not into bronzers, so it worked well for me.  Love the scent - no &amp;#34;tanning stink&amp;#34; afterwards.  Leaves skin very soft.</li>
    <li> The product came without a factory seal.  The bottle was simply wrapped in plastic wrap.  These tanning lotions are often faked due to the huge markups and profit margins that come with them.  Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for tanning if you don&#x27;t like the ones with bronzer in them</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with the \\&quot;free super saver shipping\\&quot; (which usually takes forever) and I received it in 3 days! I was going to wait a week to review this, but that&#x27;s not even necessary. The smell is delicious, before and after tanning. And so is my skin ;) My skin is sooo soft, moisturized, and tan tan tan! Before using this I had been tanning for a month and was still really pale. But just two days of using this and I am much darker! I love it. And for 33$ flat, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Provides great color without any bronzers. The fragrance is great! Will definitely buy it again as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. The lotion has a very strong fresh, flowery scent. The scent is very strong and not my favorite but it is still pleasant. It does not have that &#x27;burnt after tan&#x27; smell. It&#x27;s not greasy and left my skin feeling very moisturized. It retails at my salon for $90+. I personally do not think it&#x27;s worth full price but for $34 on here, it&#x27;s definately worth it.  **Update: About 2 hours after I applied the lotion I broke out in hives everywhere. Apparently this isn&#x27;t the lotion for me, but still a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I was very skeptical at first.  I&#x27;ve heard not to buy off the internet due to people replacing bottles with lotion, etc., but I came across this company with their high ratings and figured I would give them a shot.  Fast shipping as said, sealed pkg., I didn&#x27;t burn so I&#x27;m guessing the product wasn&#x27;t a fake. Can&#x27;t beat the 70% difference in the price of getting it at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It feels super moisturizing, and helped me get really tan, even without bronzers. I was only going in the bed about once a week, and still getting compliments from people on my tan. I will be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Same stuff they used to sell at Sun Tan City, but much cheaper. Nice!</li>
    <li> It really gets you dark even without the DHA&lt;br /&gt;Smell is kinda light, and not my favorite (reminds me of hand soap)&lt;br /&gt;Goes on awesome, very silky, spreads great, dries quick&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, I reaLly like this accelerator</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, but it won&#x27;t give you a deep dark tan of that is what you are looking for. It still smells great after tanning too :)!</li>
    <li> I am a pretty fair skinned person and have had my fair share of crappy tanning lotions. No bronzers at all. So I never had to worry about looking orangey. This tanning lotion had a light scent and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling slimy and sticky during or after tanning. I love this product. I&#x27;m very glad I went with this one</li>
    <li> Definitely not real because it has a Brown color. Intensifiers are all white or clear. I asked the lady in the tanning salon she showed me the difference. She said the bottles online are leftovers mixed with fillers (knockoffs) so its hard to tell the difference. But I still used it no rashes or streaks, but the lotion would leave residue after tanning. Definitely not salon quality but you get what you pay for. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion. I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have tried several different brands and types of indoor tanning lotions. I can&#x27;t use anything with DHA, as it tends to look extremely streaky no matter how careful I am with applying it. I hadn&#x27;t tanned in several months, and within a week and a half of using this and a designer skin tingle lotion, I am significantly darker. It has the best smell of any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! slightly perfume-y but not overpowering. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, and my skin feels great when I get out of the bed. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been an avid tanner for years, and have tried hundreds of lotions (literally). I am extremely happy with this lotion. It smells absolutely amazing before and after tanning with a minimal ATO. I will be buying this lotion again whenever I finish this bottle. I would definitely recommend it to first time tanners, as well as frequent tanners. This lotion could be used for building a base tan, or breaking through that plateau! LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> So it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Chance, but that&#x27;s what it reminds me of.  Yes, it is a strong smell, but it&#x27;s got a hint of citrus base to the smell, just a hint, so it&#x27;s bearable.  The silicone in the lotion really helps it spread smoothly.  There is not a greasy feel or stickiness and the results after the tanning bed are immediately noticeable.  I haven&#x27;t tanned all winter so I went for 5 minutes.  Yes, I can see a difference and I would not have seen one if I hadn&#x27;t use this accelerant. Not after just 5 minutes!  And as other reviewers have stated, you can go straight from the tanning bed to work/school/restaurant and not be self-conscience about the odor...it doesn&#x27;t smell like you just left the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Works well, no funky odor, I don&#x27;t buy many tanning products so I don&#x27;t have too much to compare it too but I can&#x27;t stand the tingling ones, so I do like this! And I received it the very next afternoon! I was amazed at the quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that this review is for how this product worked for me. I have dark everything (brunette to the extreme) so I tan very easily anyway. I will end up rotating this with a bronzer and tingle, but I am beyond pleased with the results of this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Smell: It is delicious and not fruity just fresh No ATO&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Amazing. It is silicone based but not like the other Designer Skin lotions, which always feel like they&#x27;re sitting on my skin (which makes sense because silicone will never soak in bc it isn&#x27;t compatible with skin) This felt silky&lt;br /&gt;Moisturization: This is number 1 for me with tanning lotions, and this does a wonderful job of leaving my skin smooth and supple&lt;br /&gt;Tan &amp; color: This is giving me such a beautiful, natural, brown tan. My husband even commented on the color being so nice from 2 uses with a base tan.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I would highly recommend, especially if you shy away from bronzers and want delicious skin.</li>
    <li> Made skin feel nice, smells great, &amp; would surely recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about purchasing items online, especially tanning lotions, but after hearing both great and conflicting reviews I went ahead and purchased this item. I&#x27;m glad I did. I love the scent of this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical &amp;#34;I just got out of a tanning bed&amp;#34; lotion, it goes on like silk and the results are amazing. I already have a base tan so when I tried this the first time I could see results instantly.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Would purchase from this vendor again!</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product, except that it didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I would have liked.  The lotion goes on great and evenly, smells good, and leaves my skin very soft after tanning, but as far as giving me a dark tan, it didn&#x27;t. It does not feel thick, sticky, or greasy. I didn&#x27;t want to purchase a product with DHA so I went with Phoenician after reading all the great reviews.  I will purchase Designer Skin products again, but this wasn&#x27;t the one for me. I&#x27;m a fairly light skinned hispanic.  I tan easy and get dark somewhat quickly.  I was hoping this would give me an added boost while in the tanning bed sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The bottle is pretty and it smells great, like something from Victorias Secret.  It makes my skin super soft and i&#x27;m not a big fan of bronzers, so i&#x27;m happy this lotion doesnt contain any.  It came 2 days earlier than expected and i&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Not to mention its incredibly cheap!!  This is definitely the way to buy tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! I don&#x27;t like bronzers and I&#x27;m beige skin and now I&#x27;m dark golden tan. Not the grey brown or orangy I get with bronzers! Smell is okay wish it was less flowery bug it seems to be gone once I tan!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this lotion, and was so happy to find it here on Amazon for such a good price! Most tanning salons sell it for around 90 dollars, so I was stoked! This product is amazing.... It doesn&#x27;t have bronzers in it so your tan isn&#x27;t fake, it has silicon in it and makes your skin super soft, and to top it off it smells delicious even after you tan! I hate that smell you get from tanning lotions, but I have actually been complimented on how good I smell a couple of times after I hit the tanning bed. I had no problems with shipping, and plan to order from this seller again! So happy!</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion. Usually, I use bronzers. But this lotion is perfect for the winter when you just want to keep up a nice, natural tan! It leaves your skin smelling amazing after you tan - it does a great job of covering up that &amp;#34;just tanned&amp;#34; stank. I&#x27;m also a sucker for pretty packaging;) PLUS, it makes your skin really soft and is not greasy or sticky! A little squirt of this stuff goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Great product that really works on my hard to tan skin. It&#x27;s a fabulous price over the tanning salons, and it has a pleasant fragrance.  You won&#x27;t smell like you just tanned.</li>
    <li> leaves your skin super smooth and soft to the touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice light scent- can go out without feeling the need to shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can really see the color when you leave it on for a couple hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if youre looking for an intensifier this one is the best in my opinion :)</li>
    <li> My boyfriend purchased this tanning lotion for me. It smells really nice, but after tanning it leaves me VERY splotchy. I was really looking forward to using this and watching it do wonders, however it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smell is unbelievable. Everyone tells me how great I smell after using this and tanning. Silky smooth and leaves skin super soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the bronzer lotions so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for lotion to use for tanning that doesn&#x27;t have that stuff in it. I had read reviews that this stuff smells really good and I was surprised that I totally agreed. Big fan.</li>
    <li> I use a bronzer but then I use this and holy moly I&#x27;m dark!!!! I have been tanning for my wedding and anytime I feel like the color is fading I add this tan and come out with perfect results EVERYTIME!</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft, I would buy this product again! Awesome product, great price! Tanning salon sold this product for over $100.. my new favorite tanning lotion</li>
    <li> This was great for tanning beds and it smells way better than  most tanning lotions! I looked much darker in just a few sessions!</li>
    <li> For the past month I have been using JWOWW50x darker and people tell me I look orange and I can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m dark at all.. I seen the reviews on here for Phoenician and I bought it last Friday and it came in today which is Tuesday!! It was sealed and packaged up so I know it was the real stuff... It smells nice and its not thick lotion it&#x27;s thin and u use a lot more in one squirt because its such a thin lotion.. I tanned ONE time and I noticed I&#x27;m darker... I&#x27;m very light skinned and it takes me forever to tan... I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look in a week! I highly recommend this product and I defy will be buying again :)))</li>
    <li> AMAZING evened out my odd tan lines from a standard tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Got this today and had to go try it out. It smells wonderful and made my skin very soft. Also helped me get a shade darker. It was also 50 dollars cheaper than what the tanning salon wanted!!!! Great product.</li>
    <li> This has a nice clean scent and has none of that &amp;#34;after tanning&amp;#34; funky smell. You can tan in the mornings and then go right to work without anyone knowing the difference! It gives you a nice color too. I dont like instant bronzers since I&#x27;m so fair skinned that everything looks streaky on me but one this works fabulous without the instant color. It absorbs super quick and keeps the skin well hydrated all day. I highly recomend it!</li>
    <li> best product ever used...love the smell...the feel of your skin....no burn....</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Not the greatest scent that I have ever used in a tanning lotion, but this stuff does the job. A little bit of lotion seems to go a long ways and it really intensifies my tan wonderfully without the bronzing power, because I want my tan to look natural. I use this lotion in conjunction with Designer Skin&#x27;s Juicy Gossip, meaning I alternate days and I am building a nice, dark, natural tan. Am definitely going to purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> This was about half the price then what they charge in the salon. Brand new in the bottle. Love the savings.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel, this lotion gives a great tan as well but my favorite part is how my skin feels after tanning. The scent is also light and not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal, this goes for $100 at my salon and WOW was this a great deal and the color is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I previously used Australian Gold&#x27;s VOGUE and loved it. I heard alot about designer skin since my girlfriend is currently using Luminary and loves it. When I ran out I decided to give Phoenician a try since I wanted an intensifier and not a bronzer. I was definitely not dissappointed! The lotion itself is great and it leaves the skin moisturized and feeling healthy! A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE ALWAYS BEEN HAPPY WITH DESIGNER SKIN LOTIONS, EXCEPT FOR THEIR PRICE TAGS IN SALONS.  Really got a great value with this purchase and I far prefer silicone based lotions for indoor tanning. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I just received this lotion yesterday, so I can&#x27;t quite attest to how well it works for tanning just yet, but I can tell you that it makes your skin feel SUPER SOFT!!!  It is amazing!  Smell is pleasant, but not overpowering.  I am looking forward to seeing how well it helps me to tan.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion a few times and already see such a difference.  Another great product by designer skin!  No bronzers, so you get a deep rich natural looking tan.  Love this lotion, will be using it regularly along with Luminary.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to deepen and extend their tan.</li>
    <li> I just opened mine and the scent is like something you could picture Elizabeth Taylor smelling like, but i cant complain. We will see in the next week if it lives up to its name on color and skin quality.</li>
    <li> Always a great buy thank you!</li>
    <li> Not too happy with the product. Says &amp;#34;dark tanning&amp;#34; but its more like a regular tanner.</li>
    <li> Really good intensifier I already have a really dark tan and this actually got me darker even without bronzer in it. I found using an intensifier and lower level bed a couple times a week helps my tan go darker then just always using bronzer and higher level beds. The great moisturizers in this lotion leaves me feeling soft and smooth all day too.</li>
    <li> It works oka, it&#x27;s not the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased from amazon. I like to switch things up so I tried this. The smell is not for me at all. It reminds me of men&#x27;s cologne. It&#x27;s pretty thin on your skin though. Doesn&#x27;t leave heaviness. Just can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> I received it much quicker than I thought I would so that was a nice surprise. Love the smell and the texture, it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy. I just started using it in the tanning beds. The store owner even asked where I bought it , said I got a great deal and that it was a very good product. I look forward to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Well all I can say is I could tell with in the first tanning session that I was a lot darker. After using if for awhile my tan hasn&#x27;t faded!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Great intensifier - no tingle, no bronzer.  Just perfect coverage for indoor tanners.  The smell is nice and clean too.</li>
    <li> No fake tanners here. Leaves skin feeling velvety. Smell is not too strong. Love it!</li>
    <li> This lotion is Great! I had noticeable color after just 2 uses.. smells great and leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> weird smell, and the bottle is kinda flamboyant plus I haven&#x27;t really found it too moisturizing or darkening. I know it&#x27;s not a bronzer but it makes no difference if I tan with this stuff or anything else.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was recommended for fair skin. To give you some background, I am a 24 year old caucasion female (finnish and german decent) with extremely sensitive skin and am naturally very fair. I do not tan outdoors (I will burn), but with the help of indoor tanning I can achieve a really nice tan over time (about 2 months consistant exposure) with a bronzing lotion typically. I have achieved a really nice tan over time using Paint It Black 50x bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this product to start my tanning regime again after giving my skin a break over the fall and winter. Before I started using this product, my skin was at it&#x27;s natural state with no sun exposure from September to March. I noticed after switching to this product from a bronzing lotion that I burned more easily. I normally take a couple weeks to build myself up to 20 minutes by going in the bed for small increments of time. At 10 minutes on my 7th day tanning I had burned to a crisp. Just to touch my burn was irritating and uncomfortable. I never used to burn at 10 minutes after a week of tanning with a bronzer. I have noticed in the past that I developed a tan quicker with a bronzer than with an accelerator which is what this product is considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, due to my experience with bronzers vs. accelerators and being fair skinned, I would stick to a bronzer if you burn easily. I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to tanning, but I feel as though the bronzers help to protect the melanin in your skin more so than an accelerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this product really does smell great! If I had to describe the scent, I would say it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; type of smell, almost like the way your skin smells after you have just washed your body with dial soap, but it&#x27;s not that strong. $30 seems a little pricey for the size, especially when I have used other products for half the price and they worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use thisproduct, but will have to go for smaller increments of time for longer than I normally would to keep from burning again. If you&#x27;re really fair skinned and want a natural bronze glow, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. You&#x27;ll probably get burnt a heck of a lot faster than you will tan.</li>
    <li> Smells great and got me tan quick with a natural looking bronzed glow no yucky fake orangey bronzers just a natural intensifier making my tan dark and natural</li>
    <li> Great product, got exactly what I paid for.  Have ordered my second bottle, and will reorder as needed.</li>
    <li> I like this product for several reasons, 1) it&#x27;s not thin as water 2) it smells nice 3) it applies smoothly and 4) an hour after tanning, all smells have faded away including that of the tanning process itself. When I started tanning, I bought Girlfriend Sexy which was a great entry level product. I then went to Conceited, which was a nice step up. I received a free sample of this product at my tanning salon and the way it felt on my skin solidified my choice to buy this. I have used it three consecutive times and am still very impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been tanning since the beginning of the year. I bought a variety of lotions to try. I don&#x27;t want tingle or bronzers, so this one came in high on the list. I&#x27;m approximately 3/4 of the way through the bottle and I am not overly impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t seem to accelerate as well as some of the others I have. After several sessions, it doesn&#x27;t seem to accelerate any faster than tanning with no lotion. It also sort of sits on top of the skin rather than rubbing in. I guess that&#x27;s the silicone in it. It leaves a greasy feeling to me instead of soaking in and feeling moist. I also don&#x27;t like the odor much. I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but it doesn&#x27;t agree with my nose. Luckily, it&#x27;s not a very strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an ok tanning lotion. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle. For the money, I just don&#x27;t like it as much as some others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: WOW! The price of this has jumped drastically since I posted this review. I&#x27;m bumping it down a star because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d pay fifty bucks a bottle for this lotion. There are MUCH better options at a more reasonable price available.</li>
    <li> I always use this lotion when tanning. I am not a fan of bronzers and this gives me a fairly quick natural tan. I think the first few days you use it the results are somewhat light but after the third time I started to really get good color and continued to get darker. I am fair skinned i stopped tanning as often after using this to slow down the color so I didn&#x27;t look ridiculous! Love this lotion and highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery from these guys and the lotion smells great, even post tan. It goes on smoothly from the silicons and gives a nice, natural and even color. Doesnt stain clothing at all. Favorite lotion that Ive used!</li>
    <li> I marked this bottle as fair because I know it&#x27;s been altered with. I worked in a tanning salon for almost a year and I know that this is a pure lotion- meaning no added bronzers. I compared my bottle from this seller to the bottle at the tanning salon at it has definitely had added bronzers in it. It is a brownish color and not off-white how it&#x27;s suppose to look. The price is about $60.00 less on here than they sell it in the store,which is a plus..and smell is still the same, but be careful if you want a true &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
    <li> very nice product. goes on clean and smells good as well. dont like bronzers since they always seem to wash away after use so this is a nice lotion that works just as well!. will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Doesn&#x27;t stink like some lotions do and I have never gotten this dark this fast with my in home tanning bed. Love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, great product. This lotion works as expected, it helps build a tan without bronzers so you don&#x27;t have that orange tint that bronzers leave behind. While it isn&#x27;t a heavily perfumed lotion it has a pleasant smell even after tanning. The best part is your skin will feel like silk after using this lotion, there is no greasy feeling!</li>
    <li> Natural color, good skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; makes skin feel great!  Love it!!  Will buy again! Beautiful bottle, great product.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE. I bought this based on the price, thought I was getting a great deal. This is not authentic at all. Tanning lotion companies only sell to licensed salons. This product was absolute crap. Did not help me tan better at all. Did not help moisturize my skin. If you want the real deal, purchase Designer Skin from an actual salon. You will see the difference I promise you!!</li>
    <li> I am new to tannig beds, and as such bought several different lotions to try. Phoenician is the only sillicone based lotion I purchased, and I&#x27;m sorry for that now. This lotion leaves my skin feeling incredily soft and smooth. This stuff is never thick or greasy and does not cause any body breakouts (I have sensitive skin that can be prone to acne).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m NOT a huge fan of the scent, it&#x27;s bearable, but reminds me of a fragrance that an older lady would wear (I much prefer coconut and vanilla scents, or citrus scents). Also, I think I detect a bit of an after tan odor when I use Phoenician, that I haven&#x27;t noticed with any of my other lotions. It&#x27;s not strong, and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel the need to rush home and shower away the smell, but it is there none the less.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the fact that I have several different lotions that I am testing, and I am new to tanning and am starting out with VERY pale skin, I can&#x27;t honestly say which of my lotions is best for developing my color. I have to go slowly, to avoid burning. So I am unable to give this a real rating for it&#x27;s intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I give this four stars primarily due to the way my skin feels after I use it. If the fragrance were different I would probably give it five stars...</li>
    <li> I wanted a lotion with a lot of silicone and no bronzers. This lotion seemed like the perfect fit and boy was I right. I&#x27;ve tanned 4 times this season with this lotion and my body already has a beautiful glowing tan. I love the silicone it has in it because it feels so rich and creamy on my skin. The smell is perfumy but I like it. It isn&#x27;t very strong but does well to mask out the after tan odor we all hate. This lotion goes for $100+ in most salons so for $35 I knew I was getting a deal. It is the real thing, don&#x27;t worry. Salons just mark lotion up a lot to make their money. It&#x27;s just like any other company. Weather you buy it on here or at your salon, I would highly recommend it. It&#x27;s perfect for a first time tanner or an experienced tanner like myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the tanning bed for a couple years now. It definitely speeds up the tanning process, but my favorite quality about it is the way it leaves my skin! It feels so silky smooth; I absolutely love it. And as far as tanning lotions go, I have no complaints about the scent either.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Thursday, and received it Saturday!!!  Super fast shipping was one plus, but the biggest plus is that I went to tanning salon and with only 1 use I have nice color!!!  This lotion leaves you super silky soft after application. There is a perfume smell to it, that lasts even after tanning. The smell is not my favorite, but it is not so strong that its overpowering. I love how easy it applies, leaving you silky soft instead of sticky or slimy feeling. I will be ordering this product again &amp; again!!!!  Not to mention $30. Is a great price for such amazing quality lotion!!!!</li>
    <li> loved how it went on my skin, quickly absorbed...but man, that smell is strong! I feel like I got sprayed with every single perfume at the MACYs cosmetic counter after I tan with this lotion. Too much scent for me, but others might enjoy it....</li>
    <li> **I CANNOT FULLY REVIEW THIS PRODUCT** I personally could not get past the smell. Its not that it smells bad, its just not a smell for me. (I am personally a very picky person when it comes to scents.)&lt;br /&gt;The first night I received it I placed a small amount on the back of my hand to see maybe if I would get used to it, but the longer I had it on, the more I knew there was NO way I could rub this all over for a tanning session ... HOWEVER, this I can say;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I received it in a timely manner Amazon Prime, great shipment packaging. No damage.&lt;br /&gt;- Upon opening the bottle the little gold chain did pop off on both sides. I read in other reviews prior to purchase that this has happened to them as well. Honestly though, who really cares as long as the lotion lasts right?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve always found the price attached to them ABSURD. Add to that the fact that I&#x27;m incredibly allergic to DHA (as in: full-body, red, angry, measles-like rash allergic. NOT cute!) and finding a lotion without it is a little tricky. However, after seeing the crazy-low price for this one and reading so many positive reviews--I knew I had to try it. I noticed a difference after just one use! It was only my second visit to the tanning salon after more than a year without exposure to any UV beds and I&#x27;m already back to my proper, Mexi-tan brown ;) Ok, well not quite fully as brown as I like but it&#x27;s only going to take another visit or two. This lotion smells great, is non-irritating to my skin and has made me a believer in specialty tanning lotions--to Designer Skin in particular :) I bought this with the DS Saving Face facial accelerator (also amazing and I&#x27;m reviewing it too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Just a note: I bought this because it was fulfilled through Amazon and available for Amazon Prime--thereby assuring me of it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
    <li> This was shipped on time, however the bottle is very glittery and gets on everything. The chain attached to the sign on the bottle broke off on day one. As far as the tanning lotion goes, it has an old smell to it, but if you can get past it, it does a pretty good job. Non greasy and does not streak.</li>
    <li> I love trying different tanning products, but the Designer Skin products are my favorite.  This particular tanning lotion has silicone and it makes your skin so soft.  I have never smelled the burn smell after tanning and the tanning lotion itself smells great.  I love it.  As far as making me dark, I noticed after the first time.  The seller delivered the product wrapped properly, so I didn&#x27;t feel anyone had tampered with it.  It was also delivered quicker than I expected.  I actually recently ordered another lotion (Designer Skin Steamy Confessions) from the same seller with a tingle and a bronzer so that I could swap them out!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion!  Leave your skin feeling soft without a nasty smell.</li>
    <li> I am a Designer Skin Tanning Lotion freak, I rarely use any other tanning lotions. This is one I haven&#x27;t got to try so I was excited. It works great, I like it so far. Not as much as I love Luminary, however, if you are looking for a nice tan and you tan easily this product can really help get you there.</li>
    <li> Smells good before and after tanning. Gives a nice golden brown color. I like it!</li>
    <li> Wish I have gone for something with a little accelerator. I have plenty of lotions but this wasn&#x27;t much, if any help in tanning.</li>
    <li> Great tanning accelerator. My tan is much deeper with Designer Skin. I highly recommend using this if you are want a nice tan!</li>
    <li> Love it!!  GREAT COLOR!!!  My salon was selling it for triple the amount!  Another score from Amazon!  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This lotion really tans you well and it really smells good and leaves your skin so soft , i recommend it</li>
    <li> I am the type to turn a bit orangish with a bronzer. No orange color, no funny smell, silky smooth after application. No tingle which i never cared for those lotions anyway.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described and it was shipped on time.  It works really good and I will get it again.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Smells great and has silicone so it goes on super smooth and leaves skin feeling silky.  Noticed a clear difference in the type of tan achieved with this product.  I will defiantly buy again!</li>
    <li> OK I could live without the smell of this lotion but the color is gives is phenomenal!!! and nothing beats the silky smooth feeling a silicone lotion adds to your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a while now and decided to go for another intensifier since I&#x27;m very fair skinned (the other being Juicy Gossip). After just one use, I can already see great overall color and a deeper glow than what I had before. I noticed no after tan odor, which is a first for me. The service was fast, I ordered on a Friday and it was delivered the following Wednesday. Not only was the delivery fast, but they threw in a sample packet of a different lotion! Would definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> Smells great and half the price of the salon. This actually does help your tan. Perfume smells usually give me headaches but this bottle has never bothered me.</li>
    <li> I worked at a tanning salon so I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of lotions &amp; Phoenician is one of my favorite intensifiers. It gives great color results If you don&#x27;t like bronzers. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of silicone because I like to apply a lot of lotion when I tan so with Phoenician a little goes a long way. I also don&#x27;t love the smell- very fresh &amp; clean, like laundry. So I give it 4 stars..you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many tanning lotions, and many of them are just \\&quot;ok\\&quot; or smell awful. I absolutely love Phoenician. It smells really good, like a cologne. It is suitable for both men and women. I have never experienced an after tan odor, it smells exactly the same. The thing I like most about Phoenician is it gets me so dark. I rotate this lotion with tingles and bronzers, and I&#x27;m darker than I have ever been. It makes your skin feel very soft, and has great skincare ingredients, which is essential considering what tanning does to skin. Just get it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected.  Smells wonderful, feels so good and leaves the skin soft.</li>
    <li> This lotion is 100% authentic. I am currently working in a tanning salon, and we stock this on our shelves for almost $100. I compared the product we have at our salon and the lotion off amazon and they are exactly the same. Seriously. It smells just like it, has the same consistency and smells exactly like what people pay $100 for. The only reason I gave this 4 stars, was because when I received it the little sign on the front was broken off from the chain. Otherwise it&#x27;s perfect! And its defiantly a FULL bottle of lotion. I would order from this supplier again. Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. I could notice that I got darker faster when I started using this lotion. It smells very pleasant and no bad ATO either. I love this lotion and will continue to use it all summer.  I love designer skin lotions though.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good but is not as strong and fruity as other lotions, which I love. I think that the scent would be good for guys or girls. I had been using JWOWW bridal lotion, and it left streaks all over and smelled strongly like coconuts. I wasn&#x27;t noticing any color difference while using it either, but with this lotion i noticed how much darker i was after the first use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the 14K Gold and I also still liked my old favorite Spellbound better than this one. Did smell as good as either of those.</li>
    <li> Exact product and in great condition was not expired and was not the wrong lotion in the bottle.  Would buy from this seller again for all my tanning lotions in future.  Took about a week to come</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast.  The lotion smells amazing and it makes your skin super soft! I will defiantly buy this lotion again from this seller.</li>
    <li> This is a great accelerator. I can tell that it’s helping my skin tan quicker than others I&#x27;ve tried, and I don’t leave all yellow or brown (unnatural) since it has no bronzer. The smell is unique, its fig, so the lotion has a bit of purple tint. I wouldn’t say you leave smelly great but you don’t leave smelling super perfuming like some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I also have sensitive skin and appreciate the lighter sent and natural ingredients so my skin doesn’t break out.</li>
    <li> It stinks, giving a bad after tan smell.  Not only that, but I wasn&#x27;t getting much darker, and ended up having an allergic reaction to it.</li>
    <li> It gave a pasty red head like myself color...i&#x27;m in love!  I had been using Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond but after 1 use of Designer Skin I am converted.  It smells so good and makes my skin feel unbelievable.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> dry and gooey feeling left on skin, no absorption at all.  i love designer skin products, but this one needs to go.</li>
    <li> Had not been to tanning bed in 1 year after 6 visits golden brown and silky soft. I tanned gradually 8 min 2 days, 12min 3 days, then 15 min 1 day. Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I really like this tanning lotion. It has helped me get tanner. I am not to fond of the smell but works well.</li>
    <li> I like this product smells and works great..  i am very, very happy to be able to get this product over Amazon for such a better price. The prices in the tanning salon are insane, totally unrealistic! i would not ever pay their prices, no matter how good the product is..well, back to this product, it does what it says, works great, happy :)</li>
    <li> Feels great when and after putting it on. Smell is good. Not sure it helped out my tan much since I am a pretty light skinned person.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this tanning lotion, but it&#x27;s okay. It smells great before you tan but after the smell isn&#x27;t that great, whenever I use it I have to shower in a reasonable amount of time because I can&#x27;t stand the smell. The lotion is kind of thick which I also don&#x27;t like very much. But I did get a great tan each time I used it.</li>
    <li> Phoenician is the BEST and most mojsturizing accelerator out there. I am so in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also lime this seller. I recieved a bottle of the real deal and not a tamered with, knock-off bottle that some of us are unfortunate enough to encounter on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super happy! :D thanks for your business, Green Web Inc!</li>
    <li> It smells really nice. It has enhanced my tanning by leaps and bounds. I was using Amour intensifier but this is so much better and my tan is lasting longer than ever. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Amazing smelling product. This is my first time tanning and I&#x27;ve only gone twice so far. I actually see a tan!!! That means a lot because I&#x27;m a natural ginger with very pale skin. Great because it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible bronzer to make me orange. It is a gradual tanner, but I do plan on sticking to designer skin products.</li>
    <li> I Buy This At The Tanning Salon Because It&#x27;s Amazing! The Salon Wants $120+ For It! This Is Rediculous! I Started Looking Online To See If I Could Find It Cheaper And Not Be A Rip Off Brand And I Found It On Amazon! Got The Product In The Mail And I Love It! Definitely Recommend This To Everyone!</li>
