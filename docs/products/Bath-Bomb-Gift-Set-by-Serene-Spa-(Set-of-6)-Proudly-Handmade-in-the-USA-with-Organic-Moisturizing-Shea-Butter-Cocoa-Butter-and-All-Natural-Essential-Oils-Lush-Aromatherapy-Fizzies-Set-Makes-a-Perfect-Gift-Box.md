      <li>She said it was honestly like having a spa in her home</li>

      <li>That has no bearing on my review of them, this is my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>nice product, ;erfect for gift giving.</li>
      <li>gift box contains 6 bath bombs each with its own fragrance:</li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a Serene Spa – Bath Bomb Gift Set to facilitate this review, however as always all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
      <li>box has a window so you can see it&#x27;s contents and is adorned with a nice silver bow!&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
      <li>but I decided to give this gift set a try because I liked the packaging.</li>
      <li>so good the packaging is great to they melt in the bath very well</li>
      <li>and I smell good until the next day lol!</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t a very strong scent &amp; would be perfect for those who are sensitive to smells.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a perfect gift for my little sister. She&#x27;s obsessed with the lush bath bombs but she said that these didn&#x27;t make our bathtub gross like lush bombs do. I would buy these again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought it as a gift for someone and they loved it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my girlfriend and she really enjoyed trying all the different fragrances. she said the coconut lime made her smell like a tropical paradise</li>
    <li> I usually have a sunday spa day where I pamper myself at home. These bath bombs were a gift and think I might  order a couple sets as favors for an upcoming bridal shower. The deep ocean and white garden were my favorite. There isn&#x27;t much to clean up after. I used the floral bomb as a pre soak for my pedicure and loved it too. The smells soothes out a long day and feels like you are in a fancy spa far far away.</li>
    <li> I gave these out to all the women who work in my office and they loved them. I definitely plan on buying more in the future. I also got 2 free because of how many I ordered</li>
    <li> I got this for a present for a good friend of mine and she absolutely loved it. She said it was honestly like having a spa in her home so naturally I bought myself a set to try it out and it did not disappoint. The bubbles and fizz last for awhile and the scent given off my the different types it awesome, deep ocean blue is my favorite. I would definitely recommend this for anyone trying to get a unique gift for that special someone or just a good friend or anyone actually including yourself!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got me a set for our anniversary, as it was my first time using bath bombs and it was an awesome experience! The packaging is beautiful in itself, and it felt like a spa day experience! Would highly recommend for gifts for your girl, or just to treat yoself!</li>
    <li> My wife used the bath bombs when we went away on vacation and they were lovely. Not only are they mesmerizing to watch dissolve but the smell and feeling that it leaves lingers in your mind. I feel great and pampered after our relaxing bath!  Will continue to buy more of these sensual bath bombs for our vacations together.</li>
    <li> These are great! I got these as a present about a month back and since then have bought 2 sets. One as a gift and one for myself. I love how they’re made of all natural ingredients and make my skin feeling sooo soft. My favorite smell is the honey nut bomb!</li>
    <li> Loved these bath bombs. Smelled great and made my skin feel great too. I would recommend these to anyone who likes to take bath with bath bombs and doesn’t want to pay the ridiculous prices that Lush charges. Definitely beats spending $9 for a bath bomb.</li>
    <li> Just bought this for our anniversary as a gift to my wife and she loved it! Highly recommend to anyone looking to buy something small for a girlfriend or wife. Won&#x27;t go unappreciated!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as an anniversary present and she loved it! Highly Reccommend!</li>
    <li> Got these for my mom for mothers day and she loved them, she says they work great and smell good</li>
    <li> Great gift. I gave these out to the girls that work in my office. Two of them actually came back to me and asked me where I got them haha. The gift box they came in was nicely done with a bow. Definitely great for re-use.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect gift for my girlfriend. Now after a long day of school and work she can relax with a nice bath.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters, and they became obsessed with the amazing scents. They now take baths with them all the time. I would recommend this as a gift for anyone!</li>
    <li> From the moment I opened that Amazon smiling box I knew these bath bombs were going to be a delight. I had a terrible day at work with the boss breathing down my neck, changing deadlines and demanding work be handed in.  This bath bomb gift set was supposed to be for another pain in my ...neck. Ready to give as a gift to my mother-in-law who is the hardest woman to shop for, I took one look at the box and opted out of giving it to her. This box was too nice, and I needed a special treat. This bath bomb did not let me down. I started with one and was tempted to put all six in my tub. I practiced restraint and stayed with one. I knew there would be more crappy days to come. Especially when my spouse found out I gave away good ol&#x27; Mom&#x27;s gift. A gift card was going to have to do, she could buy her own set. Oh, and just so you know, the kids may complain that Mom is spending too much time in the bath. Let &#x27;em deal. Surely they can survive 30 minutes without you. You won&#x27;t want to miss some alone time in the jacuzzi tub with one of these guys. Trust me.</li>
    <li> Awesome gift. Would definitely recommend this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it! She uses it almost every night now. I would definitely recommend this bath bomb to everyone!! It also came packaged very nicely and would make an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a unique gift to give your friends then these bath bombs are definitely worth it! Not only is the packaging nice but the product is amazing. First, the way the bath bomb dissolves is so captivating and the product itself leaves your skin feeling so smooth. All of the smells are so strong and pleasant, white garden in particular is my favorite scent. I would definitely recommend this product to people looking for an inexpensive gift for friends or family members!</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are a life saver!  If you need a great gift for your girl to help get you out of a jam or to just score some points, then this is the thing to get. They come in a really nice, premium gift box -- makes it look way more expensive than it is.  And I&#x27;m sure whoever uses it is going to love it.  My wife is not an easy critic and she loved everything about it -- the scent and relaxing nature of these bath bombs, and most importantly my wife loved that they are natural. She really hates artificial stuff so I&#x27;m not sure she would&#x27;ve even tried this if it wasn&#x27;t all natural.  This is a perfect gift idea that will make you look good.  Just go get it...you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift  &amp; the recipient texted me a very happy thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought this box for Valentine&#x27;s day. My girlfriend finished most of the basket and has already placed an order for herself and her mother.</li>
    <li> Life is tough for a suburban gangsta like me, Easy E. Fortunately, these bath bombs have found a way to help me relax and stop thinking about all the of things on my Honey-Do list. Just pour myself a nice, hot bath, pop one of these awesome bath bombs in the water, jump in, and forget about life for awhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect way to escape life&#x27;s problems for awhile, buy yourself these amazing bath bombs by Serene Spa. And when your friends ask you who told you about these amazing bath bombs? Tell &#x27;em Easy E sent ya!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, you need a couple of these bath bombs for a relaxing bath. For this size they should fill the room with scent and have that wonderful scent creeping under the door and through the house. This just does not happen with Serene Spa bath bombs. The scents are nonspecific enough that you can grab any two bombs and get a nice odor. A better made bath bomb in this size fills my house with a wonderful smell. For the same price as Serene Spa you can use one bath bomb and have a better experience. Happy pampering!</li>
    <li> My wife and I ordered the 6-pack bath bomb set three days ago, it arrived the next day, and after the first one down, we already love it! Great product and one we&#x27;ll buy again and again, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take baths but I recently got this as a gift from a friend so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. I tried the coconut lime bath bomb and between the scent and the fizzing I was so relaxed. The scent and fizzing are just enough, not too overwhelming. I will definitely be taking baths more often and I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other scents.</li>
    <li> Once or twice a week, I like to take a long bath while I do a deep conditioning treatment on my hair or a face mask. I grab a book and a drink and sit back and relax with some bubble bath or bath salts. The last two times I did this, I used a couple of these bath bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fun. Please note they&#x27;re wrapped in two layers of plastic. The outer layer is a bag that&#x27;s tied with a ribbon. The inner layer fits the form of the bath bomb more closely and you may need scissors (or a sharp fingernail) to get it off. While this is a little irritating, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the double-wrapping keeps moisture off the bath bombs until you&#x27;re ready to use them. This will keep them in good shape for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t really instructions on the package so I just dropped one bath bomb in the tub as it was filling with hot water. It&#x27;s hard to see the white bombs working in my white bathtub, but when I used one of the blue bombs, I could see the fizzing as the color slowly spread out in the tub. I thought these made the skin of my legs feel soft while I was in the bath. They dissolved completely and didn&#x27;t leave any residue in the tub (very important in case you are planning to shower afterwards -- you don&#x27;t want to slip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents were pleasant but mild in the tub (the scents are stronger if you sniff the intact bombs before using). These did not cause any skin irritation, which is great, since my skin is sometimes sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the item description calls these \\&quot;tennis ball sized.\\&quot; This is a bit of an exaggeration (I have a lot of tennis balls in my living room to compare to them). Although they are larger than golf balls, to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a card in the package that says they&#x27;re 4.2 ounces each. The ingredients are listed on the card: sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, citric acid, sodium carbonate, polyethylene glycol (400), essential oils. I love that they&#x27;re scented with essential oils but I don&#x27;t think the ingredients list is complete because some of the bombs have dye in them and that is not listed on the card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I was quite happy with how these performed, and the presentation is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.ome of the bombs have dye in them and that is not listed on the card.

    <li> These bath bombs are the bomb!  I just got these delivered 2 days ago, and have already used 2 of them...the coconut lime and honey nut.  The smell is outrageous, just enough so you get the aroma, but not enough to overpower your senses.  The bombs come in a nice looking gift box with a bow in the front.  These would make a nice gift for almost anyone!  I am planning on re-ordering these when I run out, they are really unique.  So much better than bubble bath solution in a shampoo-like bottle.  I&#x27;ll order some as gifts around holiday time as well.  Nice, unique, upscale gift for anyone on your list!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave any reviews but I loved these bath bombs so much that I had to! They smell fresh and come well packaged and nicely presented. My favorite one is the Coconut Lime- smells refreshing .&lt;br /&gt;In the bath tub they are wonderful and relaxing, leaves your skin really soft. I will definitely be getting more for myself and as gifts. Great customer service..highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These Bath Bombs come nicely packaged in an attractive silver gift box wrapped with a satin ribbon.  The bath bombs are much larger than I expected them to be (about 2 1/2\\&quot; in diameter).&lt;br /&gt;Each bomb is double wrapped...an inner wrapping similar to plastic wrap which protects the bomb, and an outer cellophane wrapping which is tied with a blue ribbon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for gifting, but if you try one, you might want to keep it yourself &amp; will have to buy a 2nd set to gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gift box contains 6 bath bombs each with its own fragrance: Honey Nut, Deep Ocean Blue, Flower Bath, Coconut Lime, White Garden &amp; Clean Cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bombs are large so being the frugal person I am, I tried to break the bomb in half. I slammed it against the edge of my countertop but just broke an edge off the bomb which tore a small hole in the wrappings and then  a little bit  of the bomb crumbled &amp; came out of the hole.&lt;br /&gt;I then tried cutting it with a knife...that didn&#x27;t work. So I gave up trying to break the bomb in half &amp; used all of it in my bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the bomb fizz, but didn&#x27;t feel the fizz.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long before the bomb dissolved &amp; released its fragrance. I tried Coconut Lime first &amp; liked it. It wasn&#x27;t a very strong scent &amp; would be perfect for those who are sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;My bath was very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how moisturized my skin was afterwards. I didn&#x27;t even need to use body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed was that my tub was a little bit slippery...not bad, but enough for me to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product, ;erfect for gift giving. You might want to buy one for yourself too.&lt;br /&gt;Review sample provided.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than a long soak in a hot bath, and these bath bombs make it just that much more elegant. I love to drop one of these in the water and watch it fizzle away, faintly coloring the water and adding a gentle fragrance I can enjoy while I relax. There are six fragrances to choose from, and you pick the one to match your mood. I took a morning bath a few days ago, something I rarely do, and chose the coconut lime for a pick-me-up. These bath bombs make the water feel silky and leave the same feeling on your skin --- not greasy, just silky. When I&#x27;m  just soaking in the tub, I rinse off in the shower afterward, but I don&#x27;t use soap. When I dry off, my skin still feels moisturized. I received this set in exchange for an honest review, and I can say I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed using these bath bombs. They are nicely packaged and would make a beautiful gift.</li>
    <li> This is such a luxurious and yummy bath bomb set. Right when I opened the package I was treated to various heavenly scents. Honey nut is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is perfect for gift giving. You could wrap the whole box or divide them up because each one is nicely individually wrapped. With the first one I used a whole bomb. I realized that a half would work and it would give me more uses, so I hit one on the edge of my counter and get two baths per bomb now. I make sure to rinse the tub out well after my bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seriously makes my whole bathroom smell lovely and my skin feel great. I love that they are natural and safe for my children. I have no complaints about them at all. I was sent these to test and review. That has no bearing on my review of them, this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The bath bombs come in a lovely silver box.  They are double wrapped which is a little irritating, but understandable.  The bombs wouldn&#x27;t work as well if they were exposed to moisture.  I enjoyed the mild scents and my sensitive skin was not adversely affected at all.</li>
    <li> I never used anything like these before, but a friend of mine had some so and they looked awesome so I figured I&#x27;d treat myself! So glad I did!! They made the bath smell amazing and the whole experience was just much better than usual! I will likely start buying these every week now lol!</li>
    <li> I love soaking in the tub, but rarely have the time and privacy to do it.  I normally use Epsom salts, and maybe put a few drops of my favorite essential oil in the water.  Those relaxing baths are few and far between, so I was delighted when I had the opportunity to test Modern Living Serene Spa bath bombs and &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to find the time to soak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived in a beautiful gift box with a magnet closure and a ribbon.  With each bath bomb separately wrapped and tied with a ribbon, they could also be given individually as gifts for teachers, your dental hygienist and hairdresser - those hardworking people who surely could use a relaxing soak in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collection I received contained one each of: coconut lime, honey nut, deep ocean blue, clean cotton, white garden, and flower bath. Each bath bomb is big enough for two regular baths or one whirlpool tub sized bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday night, after I finally got the kids to bed, the last load of laundry folded and the kitchen cleaned up, I had a mini spa night with the flower bath scented bomb, a loofah and a good book.  The bomb fizzed gently in the water for about ten minutes, and made the whole bathroom smell as heavenly as a florist&#x27;s shop.  The bath salts and essential oils in the bomb left my skin soft and moist, and I could feel the stresses of the day soak away.  Even better, I didn&#x27;t have to scrub out a ring in the tub when I was done - the bomb didn&#x27;t leave any residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought these bombs were a little expensive, but after enjoying one of them and seeing how nicely they&#x27;re packaged I think they&#x27;re worth it.  I have a friend who just had major surgery and I&#x27;m going to buy a set for her to enjoy, and I can whole-heartedly recommend them for anyone looking for a luxurious, decadent bath time treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Serene Spa bath bombs for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item.

    <li> I absolutely love this product! For years I swore by Lush products but I couldn&#x27;t pass up this deal when I saw it on Amazon. I am so happy I decided to purchase this set of bath bombs. For starters, not only did I love the packaging but  I was pleasantly surprised with a 15% coupon for my next order. When I opened the box, I immediately thought what a great gift it could be. Each bomb is individually wrapped and sealed, which gives you the option of giving the whole set as a present or one by itself! After using the Deep Ocean Blue, I realized how perfect the product is. The bomb was scented and lightly colored. Even with the color, there was no residue on my skin or tub afterwards (HUGE plus). Instead, I finished the bath feeling refreshed and my skin was incredibly soft. The bomb was the perfect size for a relaxing bath. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents! Thank you Serene Spa, you truly are the BOMB!!</li>
    <li> She loved it! Would recommend it to anyone else. May be a good couple&#x27;s idea too.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Odd chemical smells like &amp;#34;fresh cotton&amp;#34; that I don&#x27;t like as much as natural essential oils. Crazy levels of packaging - nice box covered in plastic you have to tear off, then untie the ribbon on the box, then the bath bomb is in  plastic wrap with a ribbon to untie, then underneath that the darn thing is sealed in clear plastic.  I suppose it&#x27;s nice for a gift set but for my own use does it really need 4 levels of packaging? Bombs last one bath in my claw foot tub, smell is not very strong (which is good because the artificial scents are not ones I really like).</li>
    <li> This Bath Bomb set was a gift for my fiancé so this is her review, great product! Smells amazing! My favorite one is the white one (I forget the smell) but I only use chunks of them because I have sensitive skin so too much is over powering! But makes my skin smooth and I smell good until the next day lol! Thank you for such a great relaxing &amp;#34;home spa&amp;#34; experience!</li>
    <li> This Bath Bomb Gift set arrived in the cutest box ever!&lt;br /&gt;The box has a window so you can see it&#x27;s contents and is adorned with a nice silver bow!&lt;br /&gt;Then each bath bomb is separately packaged as well, with a nice little blue bow.&lt;br /&gt;The time and care in packaging alone shows you the quality and level of care the company has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;The bombs themselves are nice bright colors.&lt;br /&gt;They are made with amazing essential oils and have a nice scent to them.&lt;br /&gt;I used Honey nut first and was instantly relaxed and loved the way it transformed my bath.&lt;br /&gt;The room had an intoxicating scent, it was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The bath bomb left my skin super soft and not dried out from the warm water.&lt;br /&gt;There was no tub residue left behind so clean up is as simple as pulling the drain!&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive these at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:25b7b10941c9577f3582aed4714c0d9a]] Bath bombs are a nice addition to your tub, I like them a lot more than bubble bath as I think the ingredients are safer and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Made primarily from baking soda, a natural deodorizer and skin refresher. Essential oils are added for scent and sometimes have some therapeutic value as well.&lt;br /&gt;This set of six good sized bombs is packaged in a silver box, complete with a silver ribbon. Perfect for gift giving.&lt;br /&gt;Since each one is individually wrapped in cello with it&#x27;s own tiny ribbon, they can be passed out to different people.&lt;br /&gt;The individual wrap also helps keep them fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These can also be used as drawer sachets.&lt;br /&gt;Simply untie the ribbon, leaving each bomb in the cello, and place in your dresser drawer. A few weeks scenting your clothes, and after that they are still fine for use in the tub. Make sure you keep them semi-wrapped to avoid any color transfer onto your clothes or linens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing, skin softening, and a nice way to de-stress after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.

    <li> I really love the Bath Bomb gift set and I will buy more not only is beautiful is also a great product thank you so much and the price was excellent too</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a gift idea, I came across the Serene Spa – Bath Bomb Gift Set. I had no idea when I received it, that I would wind up keeping it for myself and ordering two more. First, they smell amazing. Second, they are packaged VERY well, so make sure you have scissors handy to get into them. This great packaging is what keeps them moisture free, so this is not a bad thing. Just something you need to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;They look so pretty, almost like little round easter eggs. ha! They are NOT as big as tennis balls, but they are quite a bit larger than a ping pong ball or golf ball.&lt;br /&gt;When they dissolve in the bath you can see the fizzing and the color. The scents are very pleasant and mild, and my skin felt so soft after using one.&lt;br /&gt;I have already gone through my whole box, because I enjoy a bath to unwind almost every night. I was pleased that there is no color left behind and the full dissolve leaving no trace of themselves once dissolved. I didn’t even see color in my bathtub after draining the tub.&lt;br /&gt;These would make a GREAT gift idea for any lady in your life and not necessarily for a birthday or Christmas, but perhaps as a “just because” gift. I was even thinking my author friends should pick up a few and give them with a copy of their new release books for a relaxing bathtub soak and read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Serene Spa – Bath Bomb Gift Set to facilitate this review, however as always all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> These BOMBS are the BOMB!  They are fantastic!  The packaging was perfect!  The scents were lovely!&lt;br /&gt;I would DEFINITELY purchase from this seller again.  It was a great overall experience.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order more for holiday gifts!</li>
    <li> So there wasn’t that many reviews but I decided to give this gift set a try because I liked the packaging. I got this as a mothers day present and its awesome! My mom is going to love getting this gift set this weekend. Its a very neat package with a ribbon and smells great. Definitely a go to birthday or mothers day present. </li>
    <li> Great stuff! would get again</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are top quality for an amazing price. My girlfriend and I use these in our tub, and this brand has longer lasting and better smelling products compared to the competition. Great scents and styles that make a bathing experience like no other. Highly recommended, will be repeating customer for YEARS to come.</li>
    <li> I got these bath bombs for my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday. She takes baths all the time and loved the bath bombs so it was a perfect gift. It left the bathroom smelling really nice. After seeing how much she liked them I also decided to buy an extra gift set for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day especially because the packaging is elegant.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these as a gift for any occasion!</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself and was instantly de-stressed. So lush. Loved it.</li>
    <li> High quality bath bomb set. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using these, they have left my skin smooth and make for a relaxing experience.  It&#x27;s like having a spa experience at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think these would make a great gift, I plan to purchase more for myself as well as extra sets for others!</li>
    <li> This is a very lovely gift set of body moisturizers that you just toss in your tub.  They release tiny bubbles and a fragrance that lets you lay back, close your eyes and drift off to your happy place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each ball is individually wrapped in the beautiful presentation box.  These would make the perfect hostess gift or &amp;#34;we&#x27;re besties&amp;#34; surprise for a GF.  The fragrances are: HONEY NUT - a little honey, a little almond; DEEP OCEAN BLUE - tropical beach; FLOWER BATH - a garden of roses; COCONUT LIME - I like this one, it smells like an umbrella drink;  WHITE GARDEN - flowery  gardenia scent;  CLEAN COTTON - this one smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made from compressing natural bath salts with natural essential oils.  Plop one in a tub of hot water and prepare to relax with a wonderful skin hydration.</li>
    <li> I bought this bath bomb gift set as a gift for a friend but after receiving it I am contemplating keeping it for myself!  It came in a very beautifully presented package.  They are made with all natural ingredients which is always a plus and the scents all sound amazing!  This is the perfect gift for a friend, family member, or someone special.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are great!  After a long day, these bombs are essential to a nice relaxing bath.  I love taking baths and these save me a trip to the store. The scents are amazing and refreshing.  I love the cute packaging and highly recommend this product to every bath lover who wants a spa-like escape in their own bathroom!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things on the planet is a lovely, hot soak in the bath with a good book and I recently received some great smelling bath bombs to help with that from Serene Spa. These bath bombs simply smell amazing and they also leave my skin feeling very moisturized when I step out of the bath! It really does create a heavenly bath, and I also love the way they are packaged in a beautiful little box that is perfect for gift giving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received free for review purposes</li>
    <li> I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  I also use Amazon Reviews for most of my purchases (even if I am not purchasing at Amazon) so I appreciate honesty and will always post my honest review.  These bath bombs smell so. Ice!  They come beautifully packaged in a silver box (with clear window on top) with a pretty silver bow closing it.  It will make a beautiful gift, if you can part with it (I can&#x27;t, well maybe a couple).  What is nice is that each bomb inside is individually packaged with a little blue bow and the scent identified.  Individually they would also make a great gift (think stocking stuffer).  The smell is awesome and they fizz nicely in the bath.  What a wonderful way to relax!</li>
    <li> I love this they all smell so good the packaging is great to they melt in the bath very well soften my skin I recommend anyone buying these if you want a clean screne bath that smells the whole bathroom</li>
    <li> These Bath Bombs are just Beautiful. I ran a bath the minute I opened the box, WELL can I just say the aroma was Amazing and Serene I got in the tub and just stayed in until the water was too cold to stay in any longer. That&#x27;s how great I felt just laying their, SO relaxed !  I know what I am buying EVERYONE for Christmas!!</li>
    <li> They didnt dissolve without me having to break them up with my hand.  Maybe they are old...not sure.  They arent the best bombs ive ever used but they are acceptable.</li>
