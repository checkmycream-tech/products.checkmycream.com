      <li>I am in love with it!</li>
      <li>I love the smell and there&#x27;s a good amount here.  </li>
      <li>Visiting Korea we liked this product and it&#x27;s great to see it is available on amazon since we have not found this product in Chicago stores.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it is that effective.</li>
      <li>Looked up the product on Amazon and liked what I saw.</li>
      <li>It comes with a spatula, but honestly, it spreads so well</li>
      <li>I also love love love the smell!!</li>
      <li>Very smooth</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very light; there&#x27;s just a lot of product in the container.</li>
      <li>I love ordering from your site.</li>
      <li>ok, i just received this</li>
      <li>I apply more liberally at night - like a water mask and my skin is fully hydrated when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nice light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>love this refreshing moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I will def be buying more when I run</li>
      <li>Many competitor&#x27;s products even have harmful ingredients like parabens and denatured alcohol.</li>
      <li>love, love, love this and will be using this moisturizer until my skin&#x27;s ph changes again.</li>
      <li>and you are going to love it.</li>
      <li>I found this on Amazon by chance and would love to try korean brand.</li>
      <li>It feels amazingly refreshing but it broke me out.</li>
      <li>and this really came in handy!</li>
      <li>but I think it is a good product for normal skin</li>
      <li>so i kind of figured it was because of the cap design, but no, i twisted off the cap</li>
      <li>Amazing, very moisturizing but not greasy</li>
      <li>softening, light feel on skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nature Republic proves yet again that most skin care companies are ripping us off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and airy but still hydrating.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, smooth, and a beautiful shade of baby pink.</li>
      <li>The original jar still sits on my shelf with 30 mLs still inside it.</li>
      <li>Make your skin soft and nice.</li>
      <li>sum up, this cream is light, smell really nice and more likely suitable to normal skin, avoid if your skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>I feel skin still feels dry after applying good for oily skin it absorbs quick into skin.</li>
      <li>the package, by the way is my new favorite in my collection.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this because of the reviews, and because of my new obsession with Korean skincare products.</li>
      <li>This cream is light suitable for day time but not moisture enough at night.</li>
      <li>my face does feel really hydrated and smooth after i use this.  </li>
      <li>Now trying a more natural hydration instead...</li>
      <li>fresh but not sporty, it&#x27;s a feminine floral.</li>
      <li>I just got it and it was worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>This product made my skin so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>Korean face creams are the only kind I use.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin that easily breaks out with hives when even just smelling some with fragrance.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m just going to write a first impression review.</li>
      <li>lovely womanly floral lingering scent.</li>
      <li>It also hydrated my skin very well!</li>
      <li>I already use other korean skin care products and it was a nice addition.</li>
      <li>DO however think it would work wonderfully for a normal skin type, and if you are a little less dry than me and use it with an oil of some kind (like 100% argan oil or rose oil), it would most likely give you enough hydration and nice little glow.</li>
      <li>subtle classy watery sparkle container and the cap is so cool too lol.</li>
      <li>Very messy!&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was my first day started to use it.</li>
      <li>organic pure aloe vera, maybe that will work out.</li>
      <li>To me it brings back memories of Bonne Bell lipsmackers and cheap moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Its ok its not what I expected.</li>
      <li>it is light and soft feeling on the skin, not heavy; probably not as moisturizing as i was hoping for winter.</li>
      <li>It smells lightly floral and sinks right into my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a gel consistency, which typically doesn&#x27;t work very well for skin as dry as mine (with the exception of Dior&#x27;s moisture gel), so it&#x27;s kind of my fault for trying a gel-like product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>:) it is a lovely delicate pink creamy gel.</li>
      <li>Although I do feel my skin feeling relatively softer the next morning, its smell is way too strong to put on my face.</li>
      <li>After transferring 50 mLs of this cream into one large bottle, I find I only need one pump for my whole face.</li>
      <li>But my problem with this product is the smell -- to me it smells a little too feminine and girly, in kind of a teenage way.</li>
      <li>I have super dry skin and</li>
      <li>Maybe it also depends on the individual&#x27;s skin, for me it takes about 45 mins- 1 hr for the gel to really absorb, therefore my face looks and feel very greasy during that time of application.</li>
      <li>My skin also felt very soft.</li>
      <li>It has a TON of ingredients, which would normally turn me off, but around 90% of them are natural plant extracts.</li>
      <li>My skin cracked after first use actually</li>
      <li>Wow email, ladies subscribe if you&#x27;re not already.</li>
      <li>I used about 1/4th of the jar so far</li>
      <li>This cream provides coolness and protection, as well as very supple skin when I wake up the next morning.  </li>
      <li>my skin is too sensitive to use it.</li>
      <li>I would say that it&#x27;s not great for very dry skin, but would probably be excellent for any other skin type.</li>
      <li>they are affordable and work like no other</li>
      <li>It does have a faint rose smell but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>Even though I am very breakout-prone, I also have a very dry surface (due to topical antibiotic application every day), and need a very hydrating moisturizer to combat flaking.</li>
      <li>: first impression; container is new favorite, even lovelier than in pic, but no spatula :(</li>
      <li>Use it at least twice a day on clean skin.  </li>
      <li>and I def recommend if you have dry sensitive skin like I do!</li>
      <li>The result on me is so-so for my dry and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that also tends to be dry and a friend of mine who has combination skin loves it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I received it. The box was open. All the cream is all over the case! Very messy!&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was my first day started to use it. It was oily not watery.&lt;br /&gt;I started to have pimples today. It&#x27;s only two days!!! My face is like wearing a oil coat couldn&#x27;t breath.&lt;br /&gt;Never gonna us it.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to a suggestion from a blog I read. I have sensitive skin that also tends to be dry and a friend of mine who has combination skin loves it. I use this at night after my toner and it&#x27;s hydrating without being greasy. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and already see the difference in my skin. I already use other korean skin care products and it was a nice addition. my face is less dry and noticeably smoother</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this because of the reviews, and because of my new obsession with Korean skincare products. But my problem with this product is the smell -- to me it smells a little too feminine and girly, in kind of a teenage way. To me it brings back memories of Bonne Bell lipsmackers and cheap moisturizers. I also had a few breakouts when trying this product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this!  It feels so luxurious and it smells so nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this day and night.  I apply more liberally at night - like a water mask and my skin is fully hydrated when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, so it&#x27;s tough to find a moisturizer that makes my skin feel balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this and will be using this moisturizer until my skin&#x27;s ph changes again.</li>
    <li> ok, i just received this so i&#x27;m just going to write a first impression review. when i received this there was no type of safety seal, which is not awesome. i read reviews and heard it was heavy so i kind of figured it was because of the cap design, but no, i twisted off the cap and it&#x27;s very light; there&#x27;s just a lot of product in the container. i was bummed out that they did not include a spatula! :) it is a lovely delicate pink creamy gel. the package, by the way is my new favorite in my collection. subtle classy watery sparkle container and the cap is so cool too lol. the scent is lovely! fresh but not sporty, it&#x27;s a feminine floral. it&#x27;s been 5 minutes since application and the scent is still lingering. it is light and soft feeling on the skin, not heavy; probably not as moisturizing as i was hoping for winter. i&#x27;ll do another review after a couple weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tldr: first impression; container is new favorite, even lovelier than in pic, but no spatula :( lovely womanly floral lingering scent. softening, light feel on skin.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer works well on skin with beautiful scent</li>
    <li> Amazing, very moisturizing but not greasy so it&#x27;s great for every season!!! I will def be buying more when I run and and I def recommend if you have dry sensitive skin like I do!</li>
    <li> This product made my skin so soft and smooth! It also hydrated my skin very well! It&#x27;s winter season and this really came in handy! My skin felt so dry from the cold that it&#x27;s unbearable to just let it stay that way, but after I apply this cream on, the feeling of dryness went away! My skin also felt very soft. It got rid of my pesky little pimples on my face too!!! This ones a keeper!! A little goes a long way so this cream would last me a while. I also love love love the smell!! Would totally buy again</li>
    <li> Great product ... I re-ordered for myself and recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> my skin is too sensitive to use it. but I think it is a good product for normal skin</li>
    <li> Slightly fragrance and I like the cooling sensation upon initial application.  However, after 3-4 hours, my skin (especially around the cheeks and eyes area) feels tight and parched.  I bought this version because it was advertised for dry skin.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide sufficient hydration.</li>
    <li> It feels amazingly refreshing but it broke me out.</li>
    <li> I found this on Amazon by chance and would love to try korean brand. The result on me is so-so for my dry and sensitive skin. This cream is light suitable for day time but not moisture enough at night. My skin cracked after first use actually so I tried for the second time and it was still the same, cracking my skin. Since I already thrown all the package away and past the returning due, I ended up using it as body cream instead.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, this cream is light, smell really nice and more likely suitable to normal skin, avoid if your skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> The rose scent is beautiful and it feels so moisturizing for hours. Great product!</li>
    <li> my face does feel really hydrated and smooth after i use this.  I love the smell and there&#x27;s a good amount here.  would buy again!</li>
    <li> Visiting Korea we liked this product and it&#x27;s great to see it is available on amazon since we have not found this product in Chicago stores.</li>
    <li> I just got it and it was worth the wait.  The smell is a little too flowery for my taste but this product feels like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I went to Korea I can have enough of Korean cosmetics. they are affordable and work like no other products.&lt;br /&gt;A poly , kamsahamnida!for the extra samples. I love ordering from your site.</li>
    <li> It is so good. Very smooth and you are going to love it. Make your skin soft and nice. Dry skin go for it.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin that easily breaks out with hives when even just smelling some with fragrance. Although I do feel my skin feeling relatively softer the next morning, its smell is way too strong to put on my face. I find myself dreading applying it, but i wanted to at least commit to finishing it and see how it goes. I used about 1/4th of the jar so far and I don&#x27;t think it is that effective. My face only feels hydrated up to that morning and still looks quite dry. So for me, it&#x27;s not worth the commitment to putting it on every night and suffering from the smell. Some have described the smell as \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;...not really, it smells really artificial and perfume-y.  Maybe it also depends on the individual&#x27;s skin, for me it takes about 45 mins- 1 hr for the gel to really absorb, therefore my face looks and feel very greasy during that time of application. I haven&#x27;t touched it for the last two weeks...dread means it&#x27;s not for me.  Now trying a more natural hydration instead...organic pure aloe vera, maybe that will work out.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. Like flakes on my face everyday skin. Problem is I hate face lotion. I hate the way it makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s suffocating and not to mention super sticky. But I had to do something. Saw this in a Pow Wow email, ladies subscribe if you&#x27;re not already. Looked up the product on Amazon and liked what I saw. I ordered the pink one that is meant for dry skin. It does have a faint rose smell but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It makes your skin feel smooth without making it sticky or suffocating. It&#x27;s light and airy but still hydrating. I even use it before I apply my makeup. I just wait a few minutes between to let it set. I&#x27;m anxious to see how this holds up in the winter. I&#x27;m on my second container and will be a lifetime user.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and Korean face creams are the only kind I use. They leave my face hydrated without looking greasy, unlike American brands I&#x27;ve tried like Aveeno and Olay. I have never tried Nature Republic products but figured I&#x27;d give them a try since 1, EXO advertises for them and I&#x27;m a sucker for anything they sell, and 2, the price for a jar of this stuff was less than ten bucks (on ebay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it! This is a gel-type cream, if that makes any sense. It&#x27;s lightweight, smooth, and a beautiful shade of baby pink. It has a TON of ingredients, which would normally turn me off, but around 90% of them are natural plant extracts. It comes with a spatula, but honestly, it spreads so well and you need so little of this product that 80 mLs would literally last me 3 years. I threw the spatula in a drawer and bought an airless pump bottle instead. After transferring 50 mLs of this cream into one large bottle, I find I only need one pump for my whole face. The original jar still sits on my shelf with 30 mLs still inside it. It smells lightly floral and sinks right into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature Republic proves yet again that most skin care companies are ripping us off. Biotherm, Elisha Coy, Shiseido, etc. have products similar to this but sell them at over twice the price, and they have less natural ingredients. Many competitor&#x27;s products even have harmful ingredients like parabens and denatured alcohol. For the price, you absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this Super Aqua Max! Two people can even use one jar and it will still last for months. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!  My winter skin is so dry from indoor heat, that it actually hurts!  This cream provides coolness and protection, as well as very supple skin when I wake up the next morning.  I am in love with it!</li>
    <li> love this refreshing moisturizer.  Use it at least twice a day on clean skin.  Nice light fragrance.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Its ok its not what I expected. I have dry skin I feel skin still feels dry after applying good for oily skin it absorbs quick into skin.</li>
    <li> I have to say that even though this cream does not in any way break me out (which is saying a lot), the fact that it is targeted towards people with particularly dry skin is a little misleading, in my opinion. Even though I am very breakout-prone, I also have a very dry surface (due to topical antibiotic application every day), and need a very hydrating moisturizer to combat flaking. This product, unfortunately wasn&#x27;t able to give me that hydration, and after applying it, my skin felt tight and started to flake in areas about 4 hours later. It is a gel consistency, which typically doesn&#x27;t work very well for skin as dry as mine (with the exception of Dior&#x27;s moisture gel), so it&#x27;s kind of my fault for trying a gel-like product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO however think it would work wonderfully for a normal skin type, and if you are a little less dry than me and use it with an oil of some kind (like 100% argan oil or rose oil), it would most likely give you enough hydration and nice little glow. I would say that it&#x27;s not great for very dry skin, but would probably be excellent for any other skin type.</li>
