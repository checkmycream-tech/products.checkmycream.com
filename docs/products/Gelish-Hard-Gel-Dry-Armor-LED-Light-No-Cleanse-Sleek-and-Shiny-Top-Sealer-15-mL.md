### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This ultra-shiney topcoat works wonderfully for both gel and acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for  gel home application.</li>
      <li>Beautiful shine!</li>
      <li>lol...</li>
      <li>it may work great</li>
      <li>the top sealer is very good, drys without cleanser..</li>
      <li>acrylics n gel polish, works good on acrylic nails</li>
      <li>Looks great with nothing on top.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love that it cures in 30 seconds and the shine can&#x27;t be matched!  </li>
      <li>Will buy more!</li>
      <li>This is a nice no wipe sealant for gels and acrylic</li>
      <li>When I first got it, it worked great.</li>
      <li>Top</li>
      <li>Its scent is a lot stronger than most gel polishes</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m not even sure this product is even needed.  </li>
      <li>Love this no cleanse top coat.</li>
      <li>This product gives a lovely shiny coat, but almost CRACKS immediately.</li>
      <li>Worked sooo much better.  </li>
      <li>I bought both the Top</li>
      <li>I prefer the top it off gel over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this on top of \\&quot;acrygel\\&quot;,</li>
      <li>it does crack after awhile, but still a strong top coat.</li>
      <li>You do need an LED light for this.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, has a bit of an odor.</li>
      <li>Also, cure for a full TWO minutes with an LED light, or FOUR minutes with a UV light.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll probably stick with Top It Off since gel nails are a pretty time-consuming process.</li>
      <li>This top coat really lived up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
      <li>I love Gelish products, but this one falls short of the standard Top it off top coat.</li>
      <li>it will soak completely off in about 20 minutes...making sure to break the seal before hand.</li>
      <li>DIY is really worth it, though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been working good so far, I put regular nail polish on top, and this hard gel top protects the soak off gel underneath from acetone when I change colors.</li>
      <li>Starting to love this stuff, but it&#x27;s still not shiny ;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on several clients and with all of them, it comes out of the light nice and shiny and within 24 hours it&#x27;s got a matte finish to it and by the second day it is peeling off.</li>
      <li>This is a really cool, super shine for a top coat, and long lasting.</li>
      <li>i open the package and the smell was so strong it almost knocked me out, it made me nauseaed and dizzy.</li>
      <li>Seriously, no sticky residue!</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t self level very well, so I ended up having lines in the finish from the brush bristles, even though I wait for a minute or so before curing so the gels level.</li>
      <li>Just as described Thanks</li>
      <li>I put regular polish on top then clear.</li>
      <li>makes me want to go back to the original.........</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather keep using Top It Off and spend an extra second wiping off the tacky layer.</li>
      <li>Do NOT use it on natural nails!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not going for super shiny pink and whites</li>
      <li>It Off is more flexible than this product, which is HARD.</li>
      <li>I would NOT recommend this product to anyone with soft nails.</li>
      <li>but overall I really like is alot.</li>
      <li>It dries super fast and hard with an led lamp.</li>
      <li>I will do a thin layer of this and finish with the cnd top coat as I have found it to be the shiniest.</li>
      <li>I use an ultra thin coat of this on top of the gel/acrylic combo.</li>

<li> -- maybe that&#x27;s the only use for it if you wear those 80s pink and white nails.</li>
<li> super thin coats n use either the soak off foundation or soak off structure n polishes before applying</li>
<li> With minor repairs, my manicure lasts for almost a month.</li>
<li> It Off and the Dry Armor sealers.</li>
<li> So if you use Dry Armor and your nail bends, the surface cracks, then flakes off.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s essentially useless, unless you file it down a little and add opaque color gel and a different top coat.</li>
<li> but it really makes nails tough and sturdy.</li>
<li> Just be careful.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t feel like the shine was comparable to other topcoats ive used.</li>
<li> I use regular np over Gelish Hard builder gel</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
<li> Im a little worried about removal after reading the reviews</li>
<li> little odor an, not like Acrylics</li>
<li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
<li> No residue to wipe off, but dull as dishwater, and has no shine at all.</li>
<li> This product is to be used with Harmony Hard Gel, but even the hard gel nails bend sometimes.</li>
<li> Both times it seriously chips and cracks off.</li>
<li> It is very hard and can crack</li>
<li> but it gets heat spikes worse than any I have used before.</li>
<li> sorry</li>
<li> Am I doing something wrong?</li>
<li> A couple of hints from a pro - use a very thin coat, and it won&#x27;t crack.</li>
<li> where you dust gel base with acrylic powder before curing.</li>
<li> This is a horrible product!</li>
<li> It smells HORRIBLE!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I first got it, it worked great. But now....it is still sticky and if I cleanse it all the shine goes away</li>
    <li> cracked in one day every time i used.</li>
    <li> It needs to stay shiny longer!</li>
    <li> This product gives a lovely shiny coat, but almost CRACKS immediately. It&#x27;s essentially useless, unless you file it down a little and add opaque color gel and a different top coat.</li>
    <li> This ultra-shiney topcoat works wonderfully for both gel and acrylic nails. Do NOT use it on natural nails! A couple of hints from a pro - use a very thin coat, and it won&#x27;t crack. If necessary, use two coats, curing between them. Also, cure for a full TWO minutes with an LED light, or FOUR minutes with a UV light. Wait about five minutes or so before applying cuticle oil afterwards. Yes, you will have to file this product off. Just be careful.</li>
    <li> Love this! Will buy more! Seriously, no sticky residue!</li>
    <li> I bought both the Top It Off and the Dry Armor sealers. Top It Off is more flexible than this product, which is HARD. So if you use Dry Armor and your nail bends, the surface cracks, then flakes off. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone with soft nails. This product is to be used with Harmony Hard Gel, but even the hard gel nails bend sometimes. I should have listened to earlier reviewers. I wasted my money on this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice no wipe sealant for gels and acrylic but it gets heat spikes worse than any I have used before.</li>
    <li> This is a really cool, super shine for a top coat, and long lasting. I put regular polish on top then clear. So I don&#x27;t have to use all gel polish. When I remove my regular polish with acetone, this product still shines. Looks great with nothing on top.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product! I&#x27;ve used it on several clients and with all of them, it comes out of the light nice and shiny and within 24 hours it&#x27;s got a matte finish to it and by the second day it is peeling off. So I tried it on myself... Same thing. It&#x27;s not worth the money. I&#x27;d rather keep using Top It Off and spend an extra second wiping off the tacky layer.</li>
    <li> Just as described Thanks</li>
    <li> I love Gelish products, but this one falls short of the standard Top it off top coat. Goes on smooth, has a bit of an odor. No residue to wipe off, but dull as dishwater, and has no shine at all. Am I doing something wrong?</li>
    <li> I have used this twice. Both times it seriously chips and cracks off. I prefer the top it off gel over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I put this on acrylic nails.... Worked sooo much better.  I guess the gel must be too flexible. It was like Armor on the acrylic nails. I upped it one star.... isn&#x27;t this supposed to go on gel nails??</li>
    <li> after you use this, but does not \\&quot;cure to a sleek shiny surface\\&quot; as Gelish claims. It also doesn&#x27;t self level very well, so I ended up having lines in the finish from the brush bristles, even though I wait for a minute or so before curing so the gels level. Disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********Edit***************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added a star to my initial review. I have been using this on top of \\&quot;acrygel\\&quot;, where you dust gel base with acrylic powder before curing. I use an ultra thin coat of this on top of the gel/acrylic combo. It&#x27;s been working good so far, I put regular nail polish on top, and this hard gel top protects the soak off gel underneath from acetone when I change colors. Starting to love this stuff, but it&#x27;s still not shiny ;)</li>
    <li> This top coat really lived up to it&#x27;s name. It took me about an hour to remove it, even after buffing to scratch the finish. If I have the time, I will continue to use this product. But I&#x27;ll probably stick with Top It Off since gel nails are a pretty time-consuming process. DIY is really worth it, though. With minor repairs, my manicure lasts for almost a month.</li>
    <li> Love this no cleanse top coat. Beautiful shine! The trick is super thin coats n use either the soak off foundation or soak off structure n polishes before applying n it will soak completely off in about 20 minutes...making sure to break the seal before hand.</li>
    <li> Discovering this product was like back in the day when I discovered Seche Vite for regular nail polish. It dries super fast and hard with an led lamp. Its scent is a lot stronger than most gel polishes but it really makes nails tough and sturdy. I didn&#x27;t feel like the shine was comparable to other topcoats ive used. Next time I do my nails I will do a thin layer of this and finish with the cnd top coat as I have found it to be the shiniest. Im a little worried about removal after reading the reviews but hopefully it will come off!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for  gel home application. Stays on for two weeks and longer when applied correctly. little odor an, not like Acrylics</li>
    <li> it does crack after awhile, but still a strong top coat. i wonder why it cracks like that. anyone know?</li>
    <li> the top sealer is very good, drys without cleanser.. But it cracks.. makes me want to go back to the original.........</li>
    <li> I purchased this never used it, it came broke an leaking i open the package and the smell was so strong it almost knocked me out, it made me nauseaed and dizzy. it may work great but i sent mine back asap i couldnt take the smell.</li>
    <li> Gelish seems to have discontinued/renamed this product.  It smells HORRIBLE!! Also, I&#x27;m not even sure this product is even needed.  I use regular np over Gelish Hard builder gel so I&#x27;m not going for super shiny pink and whites -- maybe that&#x27;s the only use for it if you wear those 80s pink and white nails. lol...sorry I know some people like them.</li>
    <li> It is very hard and can crack but overall I really like is alot.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to use on acrylics n gel polish, works good on acrylic nails but when I used it on gel polish it crack the polish within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I use both Gelish and IBD gels and this can go over either brand.  I love that it cures in 30 seconds and the shine can&#x27;t be matched!  You do need an LED light for this.</li>
