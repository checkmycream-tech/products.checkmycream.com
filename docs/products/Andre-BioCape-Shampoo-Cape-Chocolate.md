      <li>Covers a large man as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a larger man, and it fits me just fine.  </li>
      <li>I like the velcro neck closure because it is adjustable to fit properly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to color my hair, I remove my shirt and put this on, and leave it on till I get in the shower to rinse my hair.  </li>
      <li>Cleanup after the haircut is much quicker and easier.</li>
      <li>The cape is large enough to cover their entire top and the chair they sit on.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what we were looking for...something that fits a normal sized adult, instead of the miniature one that came with our shaver set.</li>

      <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used this for adult haircuts for about a year and it still functions well.</li>
      <li>This is a perfect cover for home use and protects you from those annoying itchy hairs.  </li>

      <li>It barely fits our almost three year old, but it fits him.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long enough to fully cover my husband&#x27;s and brothers&#x27; legs and they&#x27;re both pretty tall.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I cut my husbands hair, brothers, grandsons....great item....cheaper than the beauty supply store. And in a color the guys can stand.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I can use them for cutting my daughter&#x27;s hair.  However, the hair sticks to the cape, and it&#x27;s quite difficult to brush off.  I actually have to spray down the cape to remove the hair.  i guess I should have realized that this is Shampoo Cape.  So very nice water proofing.  Will probably have to find another one in a different material.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law since she does home haircuts for her husband and three boys. The cape is large enough to cover their entire top and the chair they sit on. Basically this is the kind of cover you&#x27;d find being used in salons.</li>
    <li> Nice and large, covers the whole body when sitting down.  The back of the cape overlaps once it&#x27;s attached around the neck, which prevents hair from getting on the back.  Hair doesn&#x27;t stick to the cape, and a couple quick shakes removes any hair on it.  Great cape, great price.</li>
    <li> i just needed to get a cape for my husband and three boys to use during home haircuts.  This has great adjustable sizing for the next so that my husband and all three of my boys can use it, even my 2 and a 1/2 yr old!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for adult haircuts for about a year and it still functions well. Nice color.</li>
    <li> My wife does the haircut for me. Once we have this, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair getting to my back any more. It is good quality and large and can cover the whole body when sitting down. Definitely, would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly. Will use it for coloring my mom&#x27;s hair at home. Looks roomy and of a good fabric. Great price and, according to the manufacturers, is made of eco-friendly fabric.</li>
    <li> Quality product and price where as promised. Delivered and received as expected and did a great job.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s washable (a definate plus) comfortable for both my husband and my 6 year old.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, the hair sticks really bad to this cape it&#x27;s more shower curtain liner material than cloth, whichI wanted, I wanted to the hair to slide off of it and it sticks to both sides.  It&#x27;s probably too late to return this so I would find something else if you&#x27;re wanting something for cutting hair.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what we were looking for...something that fits a normal sized adult, instead of the miniature one that came with our shaver set.</li>
    <li> The cape is very useful for home haircut. Very good condition, and totally worth of money.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair at home for about four years now. I cannot believe I waited that long to get one of these! This one is great. The plastic is thick and not uncomfortable or crinkly. Cleanup after the haircut is much quicker and easier.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it when cutting my boys hair ages 5, 8 and 10.</li>
    <li> Works great!  just what we needed.  and I use it for my husband and 3-year old son, too!</li>
    <li> I was hoping the product would be more like cloth, not plastic.  The person gets too hot under this when hair is being cut.  I will be on the look out for something to replace it with</li>
    <li> I recommend this cape for the at home, DIY barber.  It works very well, and cleans with a shake (outside preferably).</li>
    <li> Bought this just to use at home for cutting my husband and boys hair.  Really like the length, sturdy velcro, good contruction.  Being able to put it in the washer is nice, but I have only done that twice - it rinses off easily.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and it works just as I hoped it would. The neck velcro ties tight enough to block clippings from falling down under the cape and the material is easy to clean. A good shake and most of it comes off. I also like that it can be machine-washed. I actually bought another one to put on the floor and collect the clippings.</li>
    <li> We always cut our son&#x27;s hair ourselves with clippers and his main complaint has been the hair that gets on him.  I used to tie towels on him but they never worked to protect him from the clippings.  This cape works great and prevents a lot of meltdowns!  It covers well and makes for easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and works just like it should.  I just wish I could figure out a way to not have all the hair stick to the cape after the hair cut.</li>
    <li> High quality, slick surface keeps your client clean and dry.  Velcro neckband makes the fit perfect for anyone, small to large.  Hair comes right off when cape is shaken.</li>
    <li> This is heavier than I was anticipated.  It still works for me.  I mostly use it for cutting hair.  Easy to shake out when done.</li>
    <li> Nice and big, plenty velcro in the neck to customize the fit.  Slippery surface works great for home haircuts!</li>
    <li> Covers an adult body comfortably, doesn&#x27;t smell terribly, hair shakes off, and it can be folded back into the little box it came in.  I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home, so I needed a cape. This one is perfect. I like the velcro neck closure because it is adjustable to fit properly. No hair down the neck. It is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is great quality for under 8 bucks!  Sturdy material well made.  Very happy with this product.  It wraps around all the kiddos full and well.  Covers a large man as well.</li>
    <li> The cape is OK except the plastic smell. I leave the cape outside the living areas to avoid the harmful gas.</li>
    <li> This cape is pretty big. My son is 8 and it will cover him completely (which helps because he is a wiggler).</li>
    <li> Good product.  Clipped hair doesn&#x27;t stick to the material.  One part of the velcro keeps on poking into my neck though but manageable.  If they fix, I would definitely give it a 5 star.  I wish they make a little collar as well.</li>
    <li> It looks silly, but it keeps the hair off of me when I can find a friend or relative to buzz my head or just cut my hair.</li>
    <li> Package came in good time.    Simple in design but it does work.  Velcro to secure around the neck and good size to cover past the waist.  Seamed edges.  What else is there to write about?    Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Not expensive and it works because the neck is adjustable and it keeps the clothes dry.  It is great for home use.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> whatever your basic home cutting needs are, this cape will cover you. I use it for my husband and for my 6-year-old son. thick material doesn&#x27;t seem like it will get any holes in it any time soon. good velcro closure.</li>
    <li> It is good, but the neck size is not designed for big people.  I have 300 lbs client and this smoke does not fit them.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it meets all expectations</li>
    <li> LIKE IT, NICE MATERIAL</li>
    <li> Now this cape is good quality and fits even the bigger person with plenty of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Really glad I purchased it. Highly recommend it not just for shampooing but for coloring as well.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair at home and it was always a pain using the thin plastic cape that came with the clipper kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this nice big cape makes a huge difference in home haircuts.  It stays attached with a good velcro closure, and it is long enough and big enough to keep the hair off of me.  It even cleans off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to keep me dry and to keep hair off of me when she gives me a hair cut.  It doesn&#x27;t itch around the neck and cleans up very easily.  If you are looking to cut your own hair at home, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This works well for my wife to cut my hair.  I&#x27;m a larger man, and it fits me just fine.  We don&#x27;t use it often, so I can&#x27;t speak to how durable it is.  We do like it and are happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> You should get one of these.  Why, oh why didn&#x27;t I do it sooner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those D&#x27;Oh! things.  I color my own hair, but have it cut professionally.  I see my hairstylist using the same capes for coloring hair and cutting hair.  One day, looking at the calendar, and the grays poking out, I thought, \\&quot;Wow, it&#x27;s kind of a hassle coloring my hair.  When I&#x27;m at home, I wear t-shirts and sweatshirts.  I can&#x27;t pull them over my head when I&#x27;m coloring, and I&#x27;m really tired of wrapping an old towel around myself.\\&quot;  And then I came across this item, and the light bulb popped on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m ready to color my hair, I remove my shirt and put this on, and leave it on till I get in the shower to rinse my hair.  If hair color drips on it, no problem.  I just fold it over when I&#x27;m done and run it through the washing machine, then hang it on a drying rack.  If I get just a couple little drops, I don&#x27;t have to wash it.  I can wipe those with a damp paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it about six months now, and it&#x27;s holding up fine.  I do find it a bit wide, and it may brush against walls because of that, thus four stars.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, heavy duty cape with good velcro closure.  I use this for cutting my families hair.  I suppose the hair does stick to the cape a bit, mostly around the velcro. A shake in the wind and its fine.  Definately does the job well, and will hold up to some abuse by squirmy kiddos.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every month for 3-5 boys (including husband &amp; brothers) for 6+? months now and it does just what I need it to! The velcro neck closure is awesome and almost fits snugly around my toddlers&#x27; necks. It&#x27;s long enough to fully cover my husband&#x27;s and brothers&#x27; legs and they&#x27;re both pretty tall. It easily wipes clean with a damp rag after being shaken off and folds down small enough to fit into my case for my clippers, etc. (You just have to know how to fold it right) AWESOME. I did tons of research on others before buying it, too, just fyi.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect cover for home use and protects you from those annoying itchy hairs.  It barely fits our almost three year old, but it fits him.</li>
    <li> Good Cape. I does the job. Velcros tight around the neck to keep out hair, soap, etc. There&#x27;s not much more I can write about a shampoo cape.</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE;  .... ............ ................ ... ......... .......... ......... ......... ...... ....... ......... ..... ........ ...... .... ...... ......... ......... .</li>
    <li> It is smooth sailing cutting my husbands hair with this cape! No more hairs all over his clothes. Yea! Highly recommend.</li>
