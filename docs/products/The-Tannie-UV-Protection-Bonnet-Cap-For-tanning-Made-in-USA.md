      <li>Awesome transaction and speedy delivery.</li>
      <li>I tried to cover it the best I could</li>
      <li>This cap is great!!  </li>
      <li>It works for what it&#x27;s for... Just not the best quality.</li>
      <li>this is GREAT protection in keeping it fresh looking!!!</li>
      <li>Great fit and great UV protection.</li>
      <li>This UV Cap is great for keeping hair from lightening and is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable!</li>
      <li>so I could be sure to give it a fair assessment.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>but to each his (or her) own.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made of some kind of fabric instead of plastic material.</li>
      <li>Good quality annd comfortable.</li>
      <li>However it is very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>After 4 months, I am still just as pleased that I bought it.</li>
      <li>When we spend as much money as we do to have our hair colored, $13 is worth it to keep it looking its best</li>
      <li>Okay product.</li>
      <li>My head would sweat causing me to have to wash and style my hair more often often.  </li>
      <li>so it blocks your hair more than this...but</li>
      <li>Love this cap.....</li>
      <li>Very easy and light.</li>
      <li>This one is cloth and while heavier, it is actually more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Fits well and breathes easily.</li>
      <li>This probably wouldn&#x27;t fit a child-</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t protect from UV light at all.</li>
      <li>If you hold this thing up to a light bulb - 99% of the light goes through.  </li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>I love this cap for tanning and keeping my colored hair protected, it has not faded the color at all now thanks to this cap!</li>
      <li>My mother liked it so much she stole the first one!</li>
      <li>The Tannie is super light and breathable so the sweating is gone.  </li>
      <li>I purchased one of these; and it helps tremendously to keep that from happening.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>I originally bought the Tannie to protect my hair from uv but quickly realized the many other benefits.  </li>
      <li>and it seems when I was in the tanning bed that the color would fade very fast.  </li>
      <li>I bought a generic brand before this &amp; I like the Tannie much more.</li>
      <li>The last one I had looked more like tinfoil.  </li>
      <li>It ripped as soon as I tried it on the first time.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>To hot in tanning beds.</li>
      <li>they certainly are not mesh like this.  </li>
      <li>cap was a little tight, Ive purchased this same cap before and it fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>avid tanner and with new coloring every 4 weeks...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>High quality product</li>
      <li>My hair has been as normal as when I don&#x27;t tan.</li>
      <li>The other side which was covered was perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>but the color faded quickly and my hair was quite dry and fried looking.</li>
      <li>I have relaxed hair, and within 2 tans - it is already more dried out and discolored (lightened) than normal - which is the classic response to regular sun (or tanning unprotected).  </li>
      <li>I have very vibrant red colored hair and so far the tannie has done its job with helping with the bleaching effect the tanning bed has on it.</li>
      <li>I went in the bed with a hot pink stripe in my hair and came out with a light, baby pink stripe on one side only where it slipped off.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but the light just seriously goes right through this mesh fabric.</li>

    <li> Kinda sounds crazy to be protecting your already dead hair yet baking your skin in a tanning bed but to each his (or her) own.  I originally bought the Tannie to protect my hair from uv but quickly realized the many other benefits.  Before I was using one of those infomercial type hair turbans.  My head would sweat causing me to have to wash and style my hair more often often.  The Tannie is super light and breathable so the sweating is gone.  I prefer stand up beds but don&#x27;t like getting \\&quot;sun\\&quot; on my face so I would use a towel that always managed to slip off.  Now I just pull the tannie over my face.  I can see through it and breathe through it and tan in comfort. The downside to using it like this is that some of my hair in the back is exposed to uv now but I have not noticed any damage.  I am buying a second Tannie to cover the exposed hair.  It gets washed regularly with my delicates.  Quality product.</li>
    <li> This UV Cap is great for keeping hair from lightening and is very comfortable. Great fit and great UV protection.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t protect from UV light at all. I have relaxed hair, and within 2 tans - it is already more dried out and discolored (lightened) than normal - which is the classic response to regular sun (or tanning unprotected).  If you hold this thing up to a light bulb - 99% of the light goes through.  So, I don&#x27;t get this at all.  REI sells clothes that block UV rays for people who hike and stuff...they certainly are not mesh like this.  Foil is the only way to block your hair 100%.  A towel is at least thicker so it blocks your hair more than this...but harder to use in a stand up.  Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but the light just seriously goes right through this mesh fabric.</li>
    <li> Not sure how it protects your hair. It has holes all through it.</li>
    <li> It works for what it&#x27;s for... Just not the best quality. It ripped as soon as I tried it on the first time.&lt;br /&gt;In all.. Okay product.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give zero stars.  How big would one&#x27;s head need to be to keep this floppy piece of fabric with no real elastic on your head?  It won&#x27;t stay on mine while tanning, even with a bandana underneath!  $15 of junk :(</li>
    <li> Good quality annd comfortable.</li>
    <li> This cap is great!!  I have a dark red color on my hair and it seems when I was in the tanning bed that the color would fade very fast.  I purchased one of these; and it helps tremendously to keep that from happening.  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> cap was a little tight, Ive purchased this same cap before and it fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> This cap is saving my hair color! It works so well. I can now tan without worrying it will bleach my hair.</li>
    <li> This probably wouldn&#x27;t fit a child- not worth the money to send it back but can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love this cap.....avid tanner and with new coloring every 4 weeks...this is GREAT protection in keeping it fresh looking!!!</li>
    <li> I have very vibrant red colored hair and so far the tannie has done its job with helping with the bleaching effect the tanning bed has on it. However it is very cheaply made. I looks like something my niece could throw together with a sewing machine and she&#x27;s 5.</li>
    <li> I waited almost 4 months to post a review so I could be sure to give it a fair assessment. I only tan during &amp;#34;shorts season,&amp;#34; and last year, without the cap, I had fire engine red lowlights in my hair. I tried to cover it the best I could but the color faded quickly and my hair was quite dry and fried looking. I use Wen and my color NEVER fades so I knew it was the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;This year I purchased the cap and I have magenta (pinkish purple) chunks in my hair. Since using the cap, my hair hasn&#x27;t faded a bit nor is it dry. My hair has been as normal as when I don&#x27;t tan. The cap is quite large (and I have a small head) so I did need to put in a few stitches by hand to make the elastic smaller but that took all of 5 minutes - no biggie. I can tell you that BEFORE I sewed it smaller, it slipped off my head a bit on one side the day after I had my hair colored. I went in the bed with a hot pink stripe in my hair and came out with a light, baby pink stripe on one side only where it slipped off. The other side which was covered was perfectly fine. Proof that - somehow - this cap, with all its tiny holes throughout it, works. After 4 months, I am still just as pleased that I bought it. When we spend as much money as we do to have our hair colored, $13 is worth it to keep it looking its best</li>
    <li> If you color your hair at all, or you just want to keep your natural dark hair color: this is a fab thing for tannig bed use.  I highly recommend it.  The last one I had looked more like tinfoil.  This one is cloth and while heavier, it is actually more comfortable.  Nice.</li>
    <li> To hot in tanning beds.</li>
    <li> This is my second Tannie purchase... My mother liked it so much she stole the first one!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it not only protects my hair but it keeps it out of my face as well.  Very easy and light.</li>
    <li> I love this cap for tanning and keeping my colored hair protected, it has not faded the color at all now thanks to this cap!</li>
    <li> I have noticed that it takes a lot longer for my color to fade then it took before I started using The Tannie.</li>
    <li> Like the cap and it works well to protect hair.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable! Fits well and breathes easily. Bought to protect  my platinum hair.... so far so good. Well see how it works!</li>
    <li> I bought a generic brand before this &amp; I like the Tannie much more. It&#x27;s made of some kind of fabric instead of plastic material. Use it everytime I tan.</li>
    <li> Way to big, I needed to sew it in to keep it on my head.</li>
    <li> Perfect tanning cap! High quality product ~ I recommend it for anyone who tans. Awesome transaction and speedy delivery. A+++ seller.</li>
