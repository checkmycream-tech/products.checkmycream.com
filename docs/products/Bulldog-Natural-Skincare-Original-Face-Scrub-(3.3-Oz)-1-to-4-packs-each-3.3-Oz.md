      <li>I will still be looking for another product to beat the Apricot scrub, because that does a phenomenal job.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll look better.  </li>
      <li>Problem is, I haven&#x27;t been able to locate it anywhere besides Amazon.  </li>
      <li>, my blackheads on my nose are gone and my skin feels nice and smooth</li>

      <li>I enjoy this.</li>
      <li>kinda \\&quot;clay-y\\&quot;  Wish all the BullDog products were available here in the USA</li>
      <li>it has a very mild scent, and it makes my face feel clean.</li>
      <li>Skin feels smooth after using, no issues here.</li>
      <li>and it smells nice, but does not exfoliate very well.  </li>
      <li>No dryness after use, and has enough &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to scrub out blackhead or great for preshaving.</li>
      <li>Nice smell and works very well.</li>
      <li>For the cost, a great facial scrub.</li>
      <li>Always good to have a natural product that does</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, I have only used it once so far, but it was that great.</li>
      <li>Original Moisturiser, 3.3 oz.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of light on the abraisive part (the pumice), so sensitive skin is no worry.</li>
      <li>Among its dozen natural ingredients, I appreciated pumice the most as I lathered Bull Dog Original Face Scrub across my face after priming it with warm water.</li>
      <li>Finally a good facial scrub!</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and natural.</li>
      <li>With natural ingredients this scrub makes my pores nice and clean and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>The Bull Dog rinses off quickly, which I like.</li>
      <li>It has a light, clean scent that&#x27;s actually really refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells great, isn&#x27;t harsh, a face scrub that isn&#x27;t full of plastic.</li>
      <li>However, it does exactly what you need it to do: clean your face and prevent ingrown</li>
      <li>Not a miracle cure for me, but worth the money.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly after shaving and it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>I would buy again while the price is right.</li>
      <li>but none have had the right balance of grit like Bulldog.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about medium on the gritty scale, but leaves my face very smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend to any guy looking for a first time scrub.</li>
      <li>A bit too coarse for me so OK for a 1 or maybe 2x use a week.</li>
      <li>, Only downside is I touch my face more since it feels</li>
      <li>Works better than soap but not well enough to justify the cost.</li>
      <li>I bought Bulldog Original Face Scrub 3.3 oz along with Bulldog Natural Skincare:</li>
      <li>I really like this scrub.</li>
      <li>I reckoned really penetrated my skin after the pumice had done its work.</li>
      <li>My blackheads are gone, and my skins is soft and fresh looking.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s helping my skin</li>
      <li>For the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>The product cleans really well.</li>
      <li>My face looks and feels so much smoother and clearer after exfoliating with this gentle face scrub.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients with essential oils.</li>
      <li>actually enjoy this more than some of the other facial scrubs I have tried/used over the years...</li>
      <li>This little miracle is absolutely worth recommendation and at such a reasonable price, everyone should own it.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and this face wash is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t contain artificial colors and synthetic fragrances.</li>
      <li>Decent smelling scent, seems to exfoliate the skin well and doesn&#x27;t cause me any adverse reactions or skin irritation.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this highly and plan on buying it again.</li>
      <li>You can tell from the scent of Bull Dog products that they use high grade ingredients.</li>
      <li>Trying to find good skin care products as a man can be tough.</li>

    <li> My face looks and feels so much smoother and clearer after exfoliating with this gentle face scrub. The consistency is nice and thick, and it&#x27;s packed with natural scrubbing ingredients like pumice and coconut shell. It has a light, clean scent that&#x27;s actually really refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is happy!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells and feels great. It&#x27;s a bit thick but it smooths out nicely once you start scrubbing. Don&#x27;t need a lot to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this facial scrub to try to promote healthier looking skin. I don&#x27;t know if it is working or not, but it FEELS like it is working.</li>
    <li> I have used face wash in the past but it often made my face feel overly tight and would sometimes cause its own blemishes when used once a day. I use this product once a day and I have noticed the difference, my blackheads on my nose are gone and my skin feels nice and smooth, Only downside is I touch my face more since it feels so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do put some mosturizer on after my shower in the morning but without it I dont get that same tight feeling that I would get with the previous product I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is almost non-existant so I am happy with that as most facewashes smell either feminine or of chemicals, I also like that the ingrediants are easy to pronounce and read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Bummer that it&#x27;s made in the UK.  Guessing it&#x27;d be 1/3 less here???  Anyway, good product and it does the job.  Rated by GQ as one of the best men&#x27;s skin care products in your local pharmacy.  Problem is, I haven&#x27;t been able to locate it anywhere besides Amazon.  Anyway, does the same as Jack Black or Zirh for a lot less.  Add it to your skin care regimen twice a week and you&#x27;ll look better.  Trust me on this one.</li>
    <li> This scrub doesn&#x27;t work well at all for myself or my husband. Expensive for the amount of product in the bottle, leaves your face feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Smells great, isn&#x27;t harsh, a face scrub that isn&#x27;t full of plastic. I approve. Makes me look and smell great, but also feel great.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month now in the shower after using Cerave&#x27;s face cleanser. I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s helping my skin but the product is gritty when I rub it into my face so I can feel the power of exfoliation.. For the price I can&#x27;t really complain. I would buy again while the price is right.</li>
    <li> It seems to get your face clean but it smells kinda bad. Works better than soap but not well enough to justify the cost. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it twice.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the smell and texture.  I have not used Bull Frog before but will definitely try other items</li>
    <li> I have using Billy Jealousy for some time now and just felt like I needed a change. Can&#x27;t even remember how I found this but the whole product line is great. Love the fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients with essential oils. Love the beads and washes off clean. Now I wish they sold it in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Trying to find good skin care products as a man can be tough. You need products that do a good job, and don&#x27;t rob you of your dignity. This product is amazing, I have only used it once so far, but it was that great. The scrub is not to light nor thick. It has a great scent and has a bunch of natural ingredients. When i first used it, my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight, and my skin was smoother as well. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, and right now is a Prime product as well. I will be trying their other products as this has me sold.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with it, it just doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin is getting as clean or smooth as I would like.  I&#x27;ll keep searching for the perfect face scrub.</li>
    <li> Not quite as effective as my wife&#x27;s Apricot scrub, but pretty good.  I bought this, because I wanted a more manly scent and a product made just for men.  I also purchased the Kyoku Face Scrub - www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003607ZNG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_30 and it smells nice, but does not exfoliate very well.  I will still be looking for another product to beat the Apricot scrub, because that does a phenomenal job.</li>
    <li> This face scrub is something serious. It doesn&#x27;t have some big, fancy smell to it. However, it does exactly what you need it to do: clean your face and prevent ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is thick, and has minimal smell to it. This product will definitely be part of my routine going forward. I&#x27;m loving all the Bulldog products that I have.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub. The smell is nice and natural. I would recommend this highly and plan on buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I realize that this is a man&#x27;s face scrub, but I have to say it works wonderfully on my face.  I have tried numerous facial scrubs trying to find one that wouldn&#x27;t break out my face and this is a keeper.  It cleans and scrubs the skin while leaving it moisturized.  Also a plus for me is that it does not have a heavy fragrance.</li>
    <li> i use it 1 or 2 times a week. love it. it&#x27;s kind of light on the abraisive part (the pumice), so sensitive skin is no worry. smell&#x27;s bland. i like that. perfume on my face pisses me off.</li>
    <li> Great scrub, leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft.  This is one I will order again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I liked this. I didn&#x27;t hate it, but it wasn&#x27;t fine enough and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling nice.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It&#x27;s not as aggressive (abrasive) as some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but they can get pretty gritty.  The Bull Dog rinses off quickly, which I like.</li>
    <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t spread easy and the tube is small.</li>
    <li> actually enjoy this more than some of the other facial scrubs I have tried/used over the years...</li>
    <li> I use the product at least 2 times a week (overtime I wear heavy makeup). My skin is very sensitive and this face wash is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t contain artificial colors and synthetic fragrances. after I scrub my face, I usually leave the scrub on for 3 mins for the essential oils to be deeply absorbed into my pores. Bulldog keeps my skin clear and refreshed. The feeling my pores get after I use the face wash makes me feel like I just left the spa. Everyone compliments me at work saying my skin is glowing so I could not thank this product enough for finally giving me the results I&#x27;ve been striving for with other products. This little miracle is absolutely worth recommendation and at such a reasonable price, everyone should own it.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job.  Elise my face feeling clean without Making it too dry</li>
    <li> I bought this scrub to help get rid of the acne on my face. Nice smell and works very well. Does not cause any allergic reactions or other problems. Wish the bottle was a bit larger. Would recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> its crap.... kiehls is way better. the end. i will never let that poison touch my skin again.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I&#x27;ve used it before and had a wonderful experience. I personally recommend this item. I enjoy this.</li>
    <li> For the cost, a great facial scrub. No dryness after use, and has enough &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to scrub out blackhead or great for preshaving.</li>
    <li> This product does a superb job without irritation or strong smells. The natural ingredients and neutral smell are great. This scrub has made my skin clearer and smoother. My blackheads are gone, and my skins is soft and fresh looking. The only draw back is that I have to hide the bottle because my wife steals it instead of using her expensive products. For the price and the result though, I don&#x27;t mind sharing. It&#x27;s an excellent and affordable product.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is awesome. When you apply it it smells so good. The beads are also pretty small so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s scratching your face off</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial scrub after my girlfriend said my face my yearning for it so I stumbled upon Bull Dog. The name is what attracted me and read a few positive reviews to give it a shot. The product turned out to be great for my facial needs and really takes away the dead skin that&#x27;s left behind on a daily basis. I&#x27;d recommend to any guy looking for a first time scrub.</li>
    <li> This scrub is good. Exfoliating is wonderful feeling combined with the Wash and Lotion</li>
    <li> I like it. It has small granules that seem to help with the cleansing process. Not a miracle cure for me, but worth the money.</li>
    <li> Big fan after a couple weeks of using this. It&#x27;s about medium on the gritty scale, but leaves my face very smooth feeling. Always good to have a natural product that does it&#x27;s job and I would suggest it to anyone else looking.</li>
    <li> Great face scrub, doesn&#x27;t break my face out, I use it a couple times a week....  Good smell, kinda \\&quot;clay-y\\&quot;  Wish all the BullDog products were available here in the USA (It&#x27;s a UK Company)</li>
    <li> The product cleans really well. I only use it a few times a week because I used it every day at first, and my skin got really dry. I use it mostly after shaving and it leaves my skin really soft. If you leave it on your face for a few minutes, it works really well.</li>
    <li> Smells good... &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;. Skin feels smooth after using, no issues here.</li>
    <li> Bulldog is truly a man’s best friend. With natural ingredients this scrub makes my pores nice and clean and leaves my face feeling fresh. It’s perfect because it’s all-natural and doesn’t smell like any chemicals or perfumes. I also really like the little scrubbing beads that make me feel like I’m actually doing something rather than just rubbing something on my face. Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great face scrub, love the smell.  Just ordered another.</li>
    <li> Although I like the grit in this scrub and think it works well, the scent really stinks. It smells borderline rancid, which is gross as you slather it all over your face. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I use Apricot Facial Scrub on occasion just to get rid of rough patches and try to smooth things out. What I didn&#x27;t like so much was the perfume, so I looked around and decided to try something that, hopefully, would work the same but not be quite as smelly. Bulldog Face Scrub actually works just like that. It feels similar to the Scrub but is a little smoother and the scent is very mild and neutral. I was impressed that they managed to make something with a great smell that was subtle, and still had the ingredients to help my skin look its best. I will continue to use Bulldog for my skincare needs.</li>
    <li> A bit too coarse for me so OK for a 1 or maybe 2x use a week.</li>
    <li> Very nice and gentle scrub, very effective .</li>
    <li> Really solid face scrub.  I&#x27;ve used a few different brands in the past but none have had the right balance of grit like Bulldog.  I&#x27;m also a big fan of no animal testing and the lack of sulfates and parabens in their line of products.</li>
    <li> Once a week and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought Bulldog Original Face Scrub 3.3 oz along with Bulldog Natural Skincare: Original Moisturiser, 3.3 oz. They caused my face to break out in red splotches. I threw them both away.</li>
    <li> Probably the best face scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. You can tell from the scent of Bull Dog products that they use high grade ingredients. The face scrub is no exception, resembling same scent as their face wash. The texture is thick like a paste with bits of grit.</li>
    <li> Was pleased with the results. will consider buying it again when out. the ingredients are acceptable along with the price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff works well</li>
    <li> Among its dozen natural ingredients, I appreciated pumice the most as I lathered Bull Dog Original Face Scrub across my face after priming it with warm water. While rubbing the Scrub into my skin in gentle, circular motions I could feel tiny grains of pumice rolling over me. I imagined this is what triggered the exfoliating effect of the Scrub.  The remaining elements: an assortment of oils, coconut shell and shea butter I reckoned really penetrated my skin after the pumice had done its work. I appreciated how the Scrub lathered just enough for proper lubrication as well as how it did not rinse away too easily--demonstrating the quality of its oils.  The after-effect of this Scrub is as pleasurable as it is to work it into your skin. My face felt cool and smelled good. Using Bull Dog Original Face Scrub is an ideal way to start and end my day.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i am a girl and i use it as my regular scrub. i see no reason why girls should be thrown off by the company marketing it to men. the scent is not masculine in my opinion... and its not like you would smell it after using it anyway. . it has a very mild scent, and it makes my face feel clean. i don&#x27;t use it every day, maybe two or three times a week...</li>
    <li> Finally a good facial scrub! I used to use another brand i would get at my local drug store, but it isn&#x27;t made anymore, it used walnut shell pieces for the scrub. This one uses coconut pieces and it works very good. Decent smelling scent, seems to exfoliate the skin well and doesn&#x27;t cause me any adverse reactions or skin irritation.</li>
