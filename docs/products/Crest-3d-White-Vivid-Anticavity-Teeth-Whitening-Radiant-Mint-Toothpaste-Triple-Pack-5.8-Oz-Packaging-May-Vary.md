      <li>It leaves your mouth feeling very fresh.</li>
      <li>I messed up ordering this because I really wanted the Gel, but this works great with my new sonic toothbrush</li>
      <li>My original review is below.</li>
      <li>It also seems to keep them clean for hours after brushing.  </li>
      <li>Our dentist has made comments that are teeth are remarkably clean, so this makes</li>
      <li>The taste is awesome and it does clean teeth leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh great for bad breath too.</li>
      <li>Cool.</li>
      <li>also with the help of [[ASIN:B001MIZMJS ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]]</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely LUCKY</li>
      <li>I tried this product earlier this year and was very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>-&gt;So buy Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Toothpaste, Mint, 5.8 Ounce (Pack of 3) here at Amazon because it&#x27;s the BEST VALUE by far</li>
      <li>I switched to crest about two months ago, I have noticed that my teeth are whiter and this keeps my breath fresh.</li>
      <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
      <li>I want to start whiten my teeth to have that Hollywood Smile again..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference using this toothpaste, as has my roommate who has her own tube.</li>
      <li>I like this better than my old Colgate toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>it makes teeth more white and feel so clean and fresh</li>
      <li>This Crest 3d White on the other hand is awesome.</li>
      <li>help with my own enamel issues I alternate with [[ASIN:B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]</li>
      <li>My first time trying the 3d White, so far so good no complaints yet.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll likely see anywhere, trust me, and you&#x27;re going to LOVE it</li>
      <li>My Mouth feels better, and my teeth are definitely whiter and brighter.  </li>
      <li>Pretty packaging?</li>
      <li>However, my dentist actually encouraged me to continue using it and said it was perfectly safe for me to continue to keep using.  </li>
      <li>The teeth does seem whiter...could be a psychological factor :)</li>
      <li>Just be aware of that when you order this product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The taste is not too harsh and feels good on your teeth.</li>
      <li>The cap/tube combo is comparable to a high end hand cream type design; very soft tube, oversized cap, no-mess spout; stands on the cap quite easily.  </li>
      <li>now it&#x27;s become a major part of the HUGE SCAM to keep doctors and the pharmaceutical companies in business...</li>
      <li>Normally, by the time we get halfway through a tube, my kids have cross threaded the twisty cap so many times that I almost need vice grips to get it off.  </li>
      <li>The White Vivid Fluoride Radiant Toothpaste, however, is my favorite (until they come up with another new one for me to try) as it leaves a really fresh taste in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>THANKS FOR YOUR OFFER.</li>
      <li>This product really works to keep the tarter and stains off my teeth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> supposedly the bubbles in the toothpaste are harmful?</li>
    <li> This is the third time I bought this product from Crest,&lt;br /&gt;Great results, لاetter than any other product I try</li>
    <li> Crest 3D white is amazing!!! It does not leave an harsh after taste. I also seen results within weeks; this works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I want to start whiten my teeth to have that Hollywood Smile again..32 White comin soon.. and also it was a deal that I cant say no to</li>
    <li> I switched to crest about two months ago, I have noticed that my teeth are whiter and this keeps my breath fresh.</li>
    <li> weird taste afterwards but overall it does it&#x27;s job to help your teeth. that&#x27;s the most important part i guess</li>
    <li> These are a good size three pack and was an ADD-ON item.  It was definitely worth it.  Feels good.  I don&#x27;t know about whitening my teeth, but it has a nice Minty taste.  I like this better than my old Colgate toothpaste.</li>
    <li> The taste is awesome and it does clean teeth leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh great for bad breath too.</li>
    <li> Good taste, seems to work great. My first time trying the 3d White, so far so good no complaints yet.</li>
    <li> We like this toothpaste. Like any whitening toothpaste, I am not sure I see drastic differences, however it certainly is keeping my teeth white like they were.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste and the price can&#x27;t be beat. The taste is not too harsh and feels good on your teeth.</li>
    <li> This is just a good brand and I used this brand a lot. Good smell and suitable amount of bubbles.</li>
    <li> buying a  3 pack means never running out. love the taste and keeps trips to the store to  a minimum</li>
    <li> Seems to whiten teeth some, has some kind of blue inside the past which are the cleaning specles, Not sure it is worth the extra price.  Probably need strips to get even better results.</li>
    <li> Amazing love it makes teeth more white and feel so clean and fresh im absolutely in love with this product and i odered it from us cause we don&#x27;t have this kind of toothpaste in france</li>
    <li> I messed up ordering this because I really wanted the Gel, but this works great with my new sonic toothbrush so I really have no complaints, the mess up was my fault.</li>
    <li> 3 pack of this toothpaste for $11? Sign me up. Haven&#x27;t exactly noticed that my teeth are any whiter, but I just use it as toothpaste and keep my expectations limited so as not to be let down. Good taste, umm, foams nicely? Pretty packaging? I mostly got it because it was a deal now I won&#x27;t have to go to the store for a while for toothpaste. Cool.</li>
    <li> Very good at keeping teeth white. My kids enjoy the taste which keeps them brushing their teeth. Will continue to use since it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I used to use them, and now I moved onto the 90% Crest White which is pretty much the same thing as this one. Just use whatever you can find cheap in the market.</li>
    <li> I always use Crest and this time I decided to order it from the internet to enjoy some more crest action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 3 pack, so fairly decent price for each&lt;br /&gt;- Always tastes great, for crest, and doesn&#x27;t foam if you keep it under control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-All this 3D whitening stuff is not always necessarily good for you, but nothing that I could tell.</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth.  Easy&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  It comes straight to the door.  What&#x27;s there not to love?  We buy many items like this.</li>
    <li> EXCELENT PRICE AND QUALITY. THANKS FOR YOUR OFFER. PLEASE LET ME KNOW EHRN YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER OFFER LIKE THIS</li>
    <li> tastes good and cleans your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;what else do you want?&lt;br /&gt;Nice container and attractive packaging... yes, crest gives you that as well.&lt;br /&gt;Does it give you noticeably whiter teeth?&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t take before and after photos, so can&#x27;t verify.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this.&lt;br /&gt;use a soft toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Tooth paste is a staple item in my home, and with the additives I like what it does.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite kind of toothpaste. I did notice my white getting a tad bit whiter after using these for a month or so. Your breath feels and smells fresh using this (compared to other products where you smell clean but toothpaste-y). I also like how it comes out looking &#x27;sparkly&#x27;.</li>
    <li> My teeth do not feel radiant.</li>
    <li> My Teeth Are Looking Better Everyday:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little sensitivity after a few days, but that is a given with any teeth whitening products.</li>
    <li> This is my go to toothpaste.  My teeth are noticeably whiter after use..  Crest is a trustworthy brand and I can be assured I will get a good product.</li>
    <li> Great price for the pack of three. And its a good paste!&lt;br /&gt;I get them fast and it last long.</li>
    <li> Everything was ok with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Reccomended.</li>
    <li> Has a good taste to it and seems to keep my teeth white - what more could a girl ask?</li>
    <li> It tastes delicious, and it actually whitens your teeth. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other toothpaste for a while.</li>
    <li> Yes, it gives you white teeth. It does what it says it will do.... I have been using this for over a year.</li>
    <li> I luv this product my teeth are always white I only have to whiten them twice a year if that.</li>
    <li> My teeth do feel clean and would use this toothpaste again, but not sure how much whiter they have gotten.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference using this toothpaste, as has my roommate who has her own tube. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect results, but hey, I&#x27;ll take what I can get. Even other people have taken note of the whiteness change, and it&#x27;s not like my teeth were yellow.</li>
    <li> I tried Crest Pro Health before this and it was absolutely the worst tooth paste I&#x27;ve ever used. This Crest 3d White on the other hand is awesome. It leaves your mouth feeling very fresh. I guess it whitens your teeth a little bit, but I can&#x27;t really say if it has either way. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothpaste</li>
    <li> Crest toothpaste is great.  I prefer over colgate.</li>
    <li> this is my second time to buy this stuff.i was used it continually i felt my teeth was cleanler than before!this is truth!not very nice but really felt that it changed a lot.i will continue to use it !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think a toothpaste will ever whiten as well as whitening strips or gel, I think it&#x27;s mostly helpful to maintain whiter teeth and prevent staining between more intense whitening treatments.  It has fluoride and a nice minty taste.</li>
    <li> I thought at first Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Toothpaste might be harsh on my now compromised teeth after a horrible injury and exposure to a detrimental drug.  I thought the crystals might be too abrasive due to the fact that this medication I had been taking wore off so much precious enamel.  However, my dentist actually encouraged me to continue using it and said it was perfectly safe for me to continue to keep using.  I LOVE the taste and how fresh my mouth feels for so long afterwards!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my other friends using Crest 3D White Vivid they absolutely swear by it and claim noticing immediate whitening results and it&#x27;s long lasting fresh minty taste.  They say they all LOVE it BIG time!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help with my own enamel issues I alternate with [[ASIN:B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] also with the help of [[ASIN:B001MIZMJS ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]] and this regime is working out GREAT!!  My dentist also says my teeth are STILL way too beautiful to consider expensive veneers that could never duplicate the originals but I did have the front ones bonded recently which helped strengthen them allot and helped them appear whiter along with the regular use of Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Toothpaste as the key word here is definitely \\&quot;Radiant\\&quot;!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALWAYS had the most PERFECT TEETH ALL MY LIFE, no braces, no cavities, always implicitly care for, but about 10 years ago I experienced the most unthinkable and horrible injury. I&#x27;m extremely LUCKY my neck was not broken as I suddenly flew over my bike when a psycho who stalked me for most of my life, (even after I put him in jail), appeared in my path and grabbed the bike stem -&gt;Yah, a Schwinn, not a motorcycle if ya can believe this and please DO as ANYTHING can happen when a sick obsessed PSYCHO is hunting you down ... My upper teeth shattered into my lowers when I landed like a swan dive in the middle of the street; I was very fortunate that because I have a 2mm overjet that my front teeth were spared.  I had 18 fractures and my jaw was broken in 6 places. I was spitting out my own teeth for 3 weeks and eating baby food; it was one of my worse nightmares come true.  Then I had to look forward to EXPENSIVE prosthetics, endodontic surgeries and multiple dental procedures and devices not to mention the endless PAIN, PAIN, PAIN and the fact that this caused me the need to take out a 2nd mortgage to pay for it all and now my also beautiful home is in danger I&#x27;m so upsidedown.  -&gt;So buy Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Toothpaste, Mint, 5.8 Ounce (Pack of 3) here at Amazon because it&#x27;s the BEST VALUE by far you&#x27;ll likely see anywhere, trust me, and you&#x27;re going to LOVE it too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;ALSO PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THIS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER TAKE THE DRUG SUBOXONE FOR YOUR TEETH WILL SURELY BE DESTROYED AND IT&#x27;S VERY BAD FOR YOUR BONES, (especially if you&#x27;re a woman), AND YOUR BODY IN GENERAL PLUS IT AGES YOU TERRIBLY AND YOU FEEL AWFUL EVERYDAY ONCE IT TAKES YOUR ENDORPHINS AWAY!!  (Like the color, the music &amp; anything meaningful has been drained from your world).  As for your teeth you will brush the enamel right off of them and they will discolor horribly if you&#x27;re lucky enough to keep them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A detox doctor who did not know me from Adam put me on ridiculously high doses of this drug all because I had become somewhat addicted to high doses of Lorcet, (10/650 Viccodin/Tylenol), prescribed for knee surgery for about 9 months.  I think I was his only Rx non-street using patient and had to deal with regular visits of being exposed to this awful element.  I was a prisoner of Suboxone for 8 years and it took me 3 of them to taper down from 16 mg a day to less than 1/2 a mg.  I am now elated to announce that after all this time of \\&quot;dancing with the devil\\&quot; daily, living through hell and doing everything possible to SAVE &amp; protect my teeth I am Suboxone FREE and NEVER LOOKING BACK EVER!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;Studies and research show that \\&quot;No one should ever be placed on Suboxone unless faced with jail or death\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;Please do not EVER take this synthetic opiate detox - it is by far worse getting off of this than it would have been any opiate pain killers or even heroine.  And it&#x27;s so obvious now it&#x27;s become a major part of the HUGE SCAM to keep doctors and the pharmaceutical companies in business...-&gt;The business of it being much more profitable to keep people SICK rather than HEALING them; it&#x27;s no news to the world but more people seriously need to PAY ATTENTION to this fact!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this review is about Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Toothpaste I sincerely hope that no one reading this ever comes close to going through ANY of this but at least you&#x27;ve been warned of these serious DANGERS regarding PSYCHOS &amp; SUBOXONE that can very well affect your teeth and even your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**And please take care of yourself and protect those precious and gorgeous pearly whites ~ You only get one chance to!!**</li>
    <li> I tried this product earlier this year and was very pleased with the results. I drink coffee, tea, and sometimes &amp;#34;adult beverages&amp;#34; which obviously can darken your teeth. Combined with my sonicare toothbrush, this toothpaste keeps the stains from getting out of control and definitely gives you a brigher smile. I also use the 3D vivid white tooth whitening strips; the combination works well.</li>
    <li> Crest is the best when it comes to teeth whitening ,I have to say that it really has everyone asking me about my beautiful smile :)</li>
    <li> This toothpaste goes hand in hand with Crest White Strips  it seems like it maintains the white color until it&#x27;s time for the next time the strips are used.</li>
    <li> This is a very good whitening toothpaste that works great with the mouthwash. I do not care for the whitening strips. But I do recommend this toothpaste and you will see the difference in a month just like those commercials. And it&#x27;s way cheaper than getting your teeth whitened at the dentist.</li>
    <li> EDIT (11/29/2013): My original review is below. Here is the update. When I wrote my review it was still possible to buy both Crest 3D White and Crest 3D White Vivid toothpastes at Target (and presumably other major retailers.) However, when I checked recently I found that 3D White Vivid is no longer available. Either Crest has merged the two products or discontinued the Vivid version altogether. Just be aware of that when you order this product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I have ordered this product twice in the last week (original order and a replacement order) and the wrong product was sent to me both times. The product on this page is Crest 3D White Vivid Anticavity Toothpaste. However, I received the regular [[ASIN:B006GPV3AY Crest 3D White Toothpaste]]. They are actually two different products, regular 3D White versus 3D White Vivid. Just be careful when you order and receive this product!</li>
    <li> teeth feel very clean</li>
    <li> We have this on our subscribe and save and it works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our teeth are clean and white as expected.  Our dentist has made comments that are teeth are remarkably clean, so this makes our 6 month check ups easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is nice, no bitter aftertastes or films like some other brands so that is a plus as well.</li>
    <li> The cap/tube combo is the unsung hero for me!  Normally, by the time we get halfway through a tube, my kids have cross threaded the twisty cap so many times that I almost need vice grips to get it off.  Even if I rinsed out the cap and cleaned the threads, it was still really hard for the kids to open.  I swear I felt like a dental assistant when it came time for the kids (and sometimes my wife) to brush teeth...&amp;#34;open this it&#x27;s too tight&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;there&#x27;s nothing is coming out&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;I see some in there but I can&#x27;t squish it up any farther&amp;#34;.  You get my point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a large, wide cap that you can flip up and out of the way with one hand.  Then it just snaps shut; no twisting or tightening needed.  The cap/tube combo is comparable to a high end hand cream type design; very soft tube, oversized cap, no-mess spout; stands on the cap quite easily.  The entire cap is even removable from the tube if it should ever need to be rinsed out. So far the kids&#x27; tube is mess-free (I had to go check it myself because they have not brought it to me to open yet).  I also suspect that I will not be doing the &#x27;two-handed squeeze&#x27; for them when the tube is almost empty because, the toothpaste itself doesn&#x27;t seem as thick or overly sticky as others do.  Before, I found it very irritating, almost cheated, when there was obviously toothpaste still inside the tube...like enough for several more days of use...but it always went back up to the other end because everyone squeezed from the middle of the tube...and the physics of the tube seemed to purposely make sure I had to throw it away before I got every drop out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are probably other brands out there that have similar caps and tubes and consistencies, but this Crest 3D white has a great taste that I like.  My wife likes.  And even my kids like.  The minty-ness stays with you for a while; like mouthwash.  I feel like I will no longer be &#x27;buying whatever is on sale&#x27; because &#x27;they are all basically the same&#x27; and &#x27;I can&#x27;t remember who hates which kind or what we had last time&#x27;.  Now we have one product everyone agrees on.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste for whitening your teeth, I have noticed several shades whiter since I started using this toothpaste. I love the minty taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem wtih Crest.  Using for long period, i do notice the slight change in color.  The teeth does seem whiter...could be a psychological factor :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M A CREST 3D FAN FOR LIFE MY TEETH IS WITHER NOW , THIS AND THE MOUTHWASH TOGETHER ARE THE BESTV I&#x27;LL TRY THE TOOTHBUSH TOO.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this toothpaste I can see how it keeps my teeth whiter than anything I used previously.  It also seems to keep them clean for hours after brushing.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is nice. Mine were not close to the expiration date and the price was excellent! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Crest toothpastes and always try whatever new one they put on the market.  Basically all of them are made of the same ingredients, but there&#x27;s always a bit of variation.  The White Vivid Fluoride Radiant Toothpaste, however, is my favorite (until they come up with another new one for me to try) as it leaves a really fresh taste in my mouth.  I usually brush at least twice a day, but with this toothpaste, I&#x27;m brushing even more often.  In fact, I even gave a tube of it to a friend to try and her opinion was the same as mine.</li>
    <li> DO the talking.  My Mouth feels better, and my teeth are definitely whiter and brighter.  I am sure that it helps that I do not smoke or drink coffee.  I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> A lot milder than I imagined -- meaning there is not a strong minty taste and feel when I put into my mouth. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent refill, this set will keep you for a few months so you don&#x27;t have to go to the store. Tastes great. I&#x27;m not sure if my teeth are whiter because of it, but I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and say it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything &#x27;special&#x27; in terms of whitening power or taste, but is a good toothpaste. Good purchase for the money.</li>
    <li> I always liked Crest toothpaste,  but this 3D is not good for me. It makes my mouth very dry and I can feel like my mouth is on fire, even several hours later. About whitening,  it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth whither.  I am very disappointed with this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> So nice to order and not have to look at the store ads ,received the three pack ,I thought this is a great price for the whitening toothpaste</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of tooth paste for the past 4 years.  However, I&#x27;ve been purchasing it from a major retailer for almost 7 dollars a tube.  I was really happy to find the multiple tubes on Amazon at a bargain.  This product really works to keep the tarter and stains off my teeth.  Especially when used in conjunction with the white strips.</li>
