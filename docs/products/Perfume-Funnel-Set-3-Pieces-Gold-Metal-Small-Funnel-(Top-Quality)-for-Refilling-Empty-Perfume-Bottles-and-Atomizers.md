<li> They took a long time to come--I think they came from China.  </li>
<li> I bought them for refilling toner cartridges so I can pour refill toner into the little hole on the cartridge when refilling.</li>
<li> And now it looks like there are some less expensive options which I would order next time.</li>
<li> I ordered these for making DIY essential oil products such as bug repellent, beauty serum, and custom blends in bases such as witch hazel and carrier oils.  </li>
<li> Works well for getting the liquids in those small bottles.  </li>
<li> Too small for what I was going to use them for</li>
<li> If you need these, order at least a month in advance to assure they arrive on time.</li>
<li> At the time I order, these were the least expensive pair of 3 I could find.</li>
<li> So, nothing wrong w these,  just shop around.</li>
