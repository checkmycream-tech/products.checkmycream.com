<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product and buyer! Thanks!</li>
    <li> my hair has split ends and is very dry, i spray this in after i shower and before i heat style on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;it leaves hair feeling so silky soft and leaves sort of shine, not too shiney tho, I love the smell and it makes my hair look great (:</li>
    <li> I love and reccomend this product. I saved a little by buying this online. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the product so naturally I wanted to save a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I bought this from this seller and it really does save my hair from extra unwanted damage. If you already have super damaged hair you shouldn&#x27;t except this product to magically fix your hair. If it is damaged, I would suggest cutting off the dead pieces with trims or actual full on haircuts and minimizing the heat you put on your hair for a couple of weeks if not months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly damaged hair from years of tugging at it and not properly educating myself on easy ways to take care of my hair. Like brushing it properly and washing it anywhere from every two to three days to help lock in moisture. I didn&#x27;t expect a quick fix and even then it worked like magic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To enhance this product I used oils towards my ends after I properly distributed the heat pretectant. By doing this I can keep my hair straight for about 3 to 4 days. I have very latin hair, (a bit frizzy, not too curly, not too straight and a bit of everything in between) so my hair can naturally hold a curl a lot easier than most women and my curls can equally last about four days. After about two and a half days of having a curl, the curl falls a bit but it looks very natural and still very presentable.</li>
    <li> This is great your hair feels great after using it go an buy this you will love it will be ordering from them again as soon as I run out</li>
    <li> Daughter says it&#x27;s great for her hair</li>
    <li> The spray broke after using it few times and now it feels like it&#x27;s spitting on me every time I use it.</li>
    <li> AWESOME hair care product!!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well for styling with the heat, Helps!</li>
    <li> i could never use the bottle actually and it smells horrible</li>
    <li> Love this product! I was skeptical at first but WOW am I impressed. My hair smells great, very smooth and I have gotten compliments on how shiny it looks. Would definitely buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> I love the way this heat protector smells! The spray is so easy to apply and it really does leave my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> PROS:  Lightweight mist with a pleasant scent.  Formula is nice that it keeps your hands clean by having it in a spray rather than a gel, cream, or mousse.  Keeps hair smooth and soft without feeling greasy or heavy.  My hair even looks great the next day without looking oily or flat.  Hoping I can get another day out of my blow out before having to wash it.  Good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Bottle&#x27;s design is hard to use on yourself so much so that you have to contort your wrist in an awkward position to get the back of your head.  It would have been better if the bottle was a pump spray rather than a spray gun.  I&#x27;d give this product 4 stars, but the bottle&#x27;s design made me give the product 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I love because I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair yet. However, it smells really heavy, but not overbearing! It&#x27;s very light weight. Also, I got this product 1 week earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and smells soooooo good! Smooth and shine hair after blowdry!</li>
    <li> I love TRESemme. I use this spray everytime i straighten my hair and it always gets the job done. I use this so my hair doesnt burn when i straighten it and i love the way it makes my hair feel. I tried other heat protecting products and none of them make my hair feel like this one. It works awsome and i really love the way my hair feels now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, i also use it for blowdrying my hair and it works awsome too. I like my hair to be straight so i spray this then straighten my hair then spray a little more and rub it in, then blow dry. Its an awsome product and it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love TRESemme because they care about their customers. They always make quality products for hair that i love using. This is my 5th bottle from them and it always works the best. Thanks alot TRESemme</li>
    <li> Yes, it has a bad design, but it does what it says! Leaves my frizzy curls soft, bouncy, and protects against heat! And it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Lol so I know its not the sellers fault but my spray was completely frozen I mean frozen solid. I&#x27;m hoping it still works after it thaws</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I am not a huge fan of the other tresemme heat protectants but this one really works. The first day I used it I got complimented on how shiny my hair was. It makes my hair silky and smooth. I have fine hair so sometimes products can weigh my hair down, this doesn&#x27;t do that at all. I have noticed less split ends, and my hair just looks healthy overall. I will definitley be repurchasing. It&#x27;s also nice that this product is affordable. You don&#x27;t have to spend $20+ on a good heat protectant.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart, not on Amazon but it&#x27;s the same product. I read a review online that said it permanently uncurled a woman&#x27;s hair but that seemed highly unlikely so I proceeded to buy it. Some reviews complained about the smell, I sprayed it before buying and thought it smelled quite nice. My only complaint is that is makes my hair feel a tad heavier but I haven&#x27;t been using it exactly as directed. I think it says to spray while hair is damp but I shower at night and forget to spray it on before bed. This my correct the small issue I have with it. Otherwise, great product and I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I read rave reviews online saying that it was pretty much the best at home heat protection spray you can buy at the drugstore. It was cheap enough but I feel like so were the results. I use it on damp hair every time I blow dry my hair and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t make much more difference than when I don&#x27;t use it at all.  Just finished the entire bottle and I can say that after all the times I gave this product a try I am not convinced I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> TRESemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Heat Protection &amp; Shine Spray,...&lt;br /&gt;me encanta el producto! me proteje el pelo y me mantiene la onda en el.</li>
    <li> It was sent at a timely fashion. The packaging was nice. I only gave four stars because I haven&#x27;t used the product yet just got it today. Looking forward to using it, it seems light because of the spray top.</li>
    <li> This item complies with condicones Information. In terms of price and quality is acceptable. I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure it&#x27;s good ^^&amp;#34; I used it once or twice but I can see the different ..</li>
    <li> It works well on my hair. I only blow dry my hair once a month. But, when I do this is the protection I use.</li>
    <li> The price for this great protectant spray was so unbelievably cheap I just couldn&#x27;t believe it. And it works on my hair. No split ends since I been using it including the fact since I don&#x27;t really straighten my hair as often as I do. But it keeps my hair really soft and silky. Don&#x27;t spray too much though then you end up greasing up your hair</li>
    <li> more like a heat protectant, less like a shine and silky hair feeling. Would not buy it again, but it was &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while now and it doesn&#x27;t let me down is does magic for my hair.</li>
    <li> I was dying to use this product and finally got it. It is really good, I love it. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This not only smells great! But, after straightening my hair, it looked so healthy and shiny! I am so impressed with this product and I would absolutely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Daughter uses when she flat irons her hair..leaves her hair so soft and smooth..great product and price! will buy again for stocking stuffers!!</li>
    <li> I realized after I received this that I keep trying Tresemme products and they always disappoint me;  maybe there is something about this brand that doesn&#x27;t agree with my hair, which is thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been heat styling a lot lately, and have never tried a heat protectant spray, so I was excited to receive this.  It smells nice.  The bottle actually says &amp;#34;flat iron spray&amp;#34;, and I wanted something to spray on before curling.  My curls fell out really quickly, so maybe this is indeed more for straightening.  It smells nice, but I noticed no improvement in my hair as opposed to using nothing before curling.  In fact, my hair felt drier and less silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also sort of weird that the front of the bottle says &amp;#34;flat iron spray&amp;#34; but the back instructs you to spray it into WET hair. idk about you but I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair wet.</li>
    <li> I ave only used it once and since it was the first time i may have taken extra care on my hair and that is why it worked so well but i also just started the same kind shampoo and conditioner ... I am mainly writing this review because  I bought this product from Amazon mid February and it no longer has that weird spray cap and looks like a regular spray... so for those who had issues with that it is no longer the design at least with the batch Amazon has.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and love all their products I use this product and OMG it made my hair silky and so shiny :D</li>
    <li> Amazing. Actually smooths the hair, if you follow the instructions and spray it liberally onto your shower-damp hair. And I have frizzy thick hair, so that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tresemme products for almost 10 years. I love the heat protectant. Personally I don&#x27;t think it adds much shine but it works very well on wet hair, once dried hair is very manageable and less brittle feeling after flat ironing. Works best on wet hair. I would not use this on already straightened dry hair, only after washing before blow drying or other heat applications.</li>
    <li> I have fine, kinky, curly hair and was looking for a product that would protect my hair from the heat of the blow-dryer. I decided to try this product and do not regret it one bit. It left my hair feeling soft, smooth, and manageable. It did not feel crispy afterwards like it normally would so I was impressed. It also has a mild, and pleasant scent. The only thing I did not like was the trigger. It was pretty challenging trying to find the proper placement for my fingers to get a comfortable squeeze to disperse the product. I will have to empty the contents into another spray bottle before I use it again.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Im sure it protects but you feel how it stiffins the hair until your next wash. Its so stiffin tht it doesnt allow volume or flexible hair. Not too happy but it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I have 3C/4A type hair.  I usually do not apply heat to my hair.  I either wash and go or I air dry before styling.  But since I wanted to check the length of my hair my styling called for the blow dryer and the dreaded flat iron.  I erred on the side of caution for my beloved locks and purchased this product along with the shampoo and serum for this Keratin smooth line of Tresemme.  I could run my fingers through my hair until I applied this product.  Immediately I could see the moisture leave my hair and my hair became sticky and rough as I blow dried. (BTW, I didn&#x27;t use too much product, I separated my hair into four sections and sprayed each section three times, root/middle/ends, and combed through). Flat ironing did not smooth out my hair.  I had to start over by deep conditioning my hair for an hour and then using a homemade conditioning treatment of keratin, leave in conditioner, and argan oil.  Thankfully my hair is silky smooth with no signs of heat damage. I do not recommend this product and will not be using it again.</li>
    <li> I usually use Biosilk&#x27;s spray shine product. It is pricey and I have had issues finding it in local stores. I decided to try this and was surprised what a great job it did. I have noticed that if I used it and blow dry my hair normally it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference. However, if I spray it on individual sections and use a roller brush to dry my hair it makes a dramatic difference. Creates a shiny, healthy, bouncy look. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like it but I was expecting the pump top like shown above. I got a spray bottle instead. I like the product a lot but the spray bottle is hard to tell where it is pointing.</li>
    <li> Ordered it at least two days ago and it&#x27;s already here. Shipping Is amazing, it works amazing!!  Love this product. Will be buying again when I run out. Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a friend whose damaged hair was on the right path to recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to give you some insight, her hair was porous with split ends and had a very rough, dry texture due to poor maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within four months, her hair was completely revitalized after weekly hot oil treatments, protective hairstyles like braiding, bi-weekly protein treatments and weekly deep conditioning sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She ended up straightening her hair with a relaxer. After a month she wanted to maintain her look and I bought this product for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did an excellent job at maintaining her hair&#x27;s sleek appearance despite two weeks worth of curly new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched keratin online and discovered its other benefits like:&lt;br /&gt;- Stops frizz&lt;br /&gt;- Repairs hair such as damaged or chemically treated hair (colored, permed, relaxed, highlighted or bleached)&lt;br /&gt;- Adds shine, softness and smoothness&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizes and resolves hair damage&lt;br /&gt;- Dramatically decreases drying and styling time&lt;br /&gt;- Seals color</li>
    <li> I found this flat iron spray from Tresemme when I was looking for something to help my hair from being so damaged from the flat iron , blow dryer , curling iron etc. I was so happy to find a reasonably priced product that also works ! I will be buying more in the future .</li>
    <li> with my hair being fine and curly, it tends to go in all different directions when i use a blowdryer.  with this shine spray, a few mists keeps the frizz to a minimum without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a gorgeous shine, and hair feels softer, smoother and better quality. I highly recommend this product especially if you style your hair with heat-methods.</li>
    <li> Wish it came with a different sprayer, good stuff but hard to maneuver. Definitely combats dry hair and makes it feel silky without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Helps to smooth my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this thru Amazon because I save huge $&#x27;s compare to Walmart &amp; this product actually protects my hair from hair straightener, blow dryers, etc.</li>
    <li> Really it is good and long lasting with fine smell, it smooths the haib brush and shine it for more than 24 hours</li>
    <li> Love it! I have the course Asian hair that just will stick up and look crazy after you lay on it. So if you take a shower at night and let your hair dry completely while you sleep you know you&#x27;re going to wake up looking crazy. This is the perfect spray to get that straight shiny look and keep your hair healthy. I use this when I&#x27;m going to use my flat or curling irons.  Love the scent.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped quickly and it was exactly as described. It has a nice smell and it leaves hair shiny. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. Only problem I have with it is they test on animals. I probably won&#x27;t buy again cause of that..</li>
    <li> I recently got a keratin treatment. I used this spray when I got out of the shower and my hair was still wet and tangled. After spraying all over, then I combed through to get it spread throughout. I really felt like my hair was super soft and smelt great because of this spray.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good and it last awhile. Doesn&#x27;t take much to help flatten the hair. I would recommend the product</li>
    <li> I think this product will be of more use for someone who doesn&#x27;t use a serum on their hair. I use a really nice serum from kerastase, so this product really doesn&#x27;t add any more functionality to my hair. If I need my front bangs to stay a bit more coiffed during the day, this does the job.</li>
    <li> This is what I used for 10 years ago. Like this brand and keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;While, I did not compare the price with others, I will suggest you check with physical store</li>
    <li> Blow drying my hair has never been more easy! I don&#x27;t fry my hair and it comes out soft and smooth. Flat irons too. I love this product. Lasts long too.</li>
    <li> I love this and the smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used heat protection spray before, but I guess this works as well as any other. However, in 20+ years of using hair styling products, this is THE most difficult bottle to hold and spray I have EVER used. The first few days I was literally having to use two hands--one to hold the bottle and one to pull the trigger. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and have small to average hands. At it&#x27;s widest, my hand span (pinky to thumb) is 7.5&amp;#34;. This bottle is too wide (side to side) for me to hold comfortably and it&#x27;s too narrow (front to back) for me to hold comfortably. Also, the trigger is too high above the bottle and complicates the whole process. :(  I have finally figured out how to hold this bottle so that I can actually spray it with one hand, but it&#x27;s difficult and I have to THINK about it. I really do not want to have to be THINKING about how to hold my hair product so that I can actually get it on my hair. And, the hand hold I finally figured out is totally different from every other product I use. Anyway. I suggest looking for a product with a more standard bottle design. I know I will be.</li>
    <li> Great product for heat protection!</li>
    <li> This came before the estimated arrival date. It keeps my hair protected from any damage caused by heat styling. It has a nice smell. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I am still using this spray.  It really seems to help protect the hair when using a curling iron.</li>
    <li> this product does work. It keeps your hair shinny, don&#x27;t have to worry about it being greasy looking after using. Keeps your hair soft looking. Just blow dry your hair</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or your hands sticky, and on top of that I noticed that it makes my hair softer and adds a nice shine to it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Great scent, very light... keeps hair smooth and soft when flat ironing. I love it! I highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> what can I say? the product performed as it always does! a consistent, quality product that you can count on.</li>
    <li> i love how smooth and frizz free it leaves your hair , I would deffenetly RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> I liked-loved this product for the effect it gives to my hair, the protection it provides whenever I curl/straighten my hair, and the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;The container is different from the picture.</li>
    <li> Good product..does what it says!!</li>
    <li> It works ok, it&#x27;s a little drying to the hair though I expected it to be more conditioning to the hair</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair. Get out of the shower, towel dry my hair and then spray liberally into my hair. All over. I usually leave it in for a good hour and then blow dry and style it. It works amazing. My head usually gets really itchy after about 2-3 days of not washing it, but with this I can go a little longer. I like to only wash my hair 1-2 a week. Sounds gross, but it&#x27;s good and this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t leave it oily without leaving my scalp too dry. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have frizzy crazy hair. This makes it look less dried out and no more frizzies! The smell is to die for.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received did not have the handle spray pump, but just the small press down nozzles. It was a little tough at first but ended up fine and gave a nice fine mist. It also smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it had no effect on my hair. There was no change in smoothness versus frizz. There was no way to tell that I did anything different to my hair. So really it is a nice smelling water.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference between the instances when I use this product, and the instances when I don&#x27;t. With that in mind, I tend to believe it isn&#x27;t doing a whole lot to protect my hair, and as such I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a different when using this product. My hair is a little smoother after blow drying but not dramatically different. I hope this product is working and actually protecting my hair, I just can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t tame my frizz - but I should add that I have naturally curly hair, so putting my hair thru a flat iron is a lot of work to begin with.  I was hoping that it&#x27;d tame the frizz without it looking too greasy.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair a tangled mess. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I found this really helps protect the hair whilst blow drying.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it says helps control fly aways</li>
    <li> This product has a spray bottle-like top. Mine didn&#x27;t look like this. It had a push down spray button instead.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see how dull my hair is when I use this product.  It seems like there&#x27;s a film left on it.  My hair is much shinier without it.  Maybe after time, that will change.  But after 3 uses, it seems still too dull.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try. I kept forgetting it when out shopping.  So I see it was being sold here so I ordered it.  It came fast and I know my hair is protected from all the heat I have to put to my hair on a daily basis. Thank you Amazon for allowing this seller to be apart of you!</li>
    <li> my hair loves this stuff my favorite heat protectant</li>
    <li> I want to give this five stars so bad, but the bad smell is keeping me from doing that! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does it&#x27;s job, without a doubt. It makes your hair silky and shiny, but it smells a bit weird. I spray it on wet hair. The smell goes away eventually.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product. I just do not think it was for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This spray is a very fine mist that you spray all over your  towel dried hair  before you blow dry it. The product is very easy to use, smells great, and do much more then protecting your hair from heat. I use a generous amount on my hair and make sure it is well distributed. As soon as I started to blow dry my hair I can see the immediate  effect of the spray. There is less frizz, and I get smooth and silky hair in no time. When my hair  was finish dry it looked really shiny, smooth  and soft to the touch. I then sometimes uses a flat iron or curling iron to finish up my look and then add a little more spray on my ends. Afer I am finish my hair style looks sleeker, hair style lasts all day, curls stay put and your hair looks like you just step out of the salon. Overall I just love this product and would recommend this for anybody who wants to achieve a sleek look.</li>
    <li> it did not work well in my hair at all</li>
    <li> I guess it works but no real way to tell, doesn&#x27;t really feel different, not much of a scent. Could just be water and product?? But maybe tis supposed to be like that. IDK its ok but probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using tresemme for years now and i started using the heat protectant spray a year ago. It is good for all types of hair and keeps your hair from getting damage. Give it a try it is worth it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a heat protectant that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky and this is it. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried others that came highly recommended and didn&#x27;t like it and I couldn&#x27;t believe a drugstore product would be this good. I find that I have less split ends than before and my hair holds it&#x27;s style longer too and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my hair and i love it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I purchased this heat protectant, my hair definitely seems healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I have bleach blonde hair that i dye myself, so I will use anything that will protect my hair from damage. I use this before I blow-dry my hair and flat iron it, and it keeps my hair soft and all of the little fly-aways are tamed.&lt;br /&gt;My friend asked me if my hair gets greasy, or looks greasy and thats a huge negative! I followed the directions on the bottle, I don&#x27;t over spray, I use the perfect amount for my hair length. I also make sure I use 1 or 2 extra sprays on the front of my hair {side bang area} because that is what is flat-ironed the most.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone who applys heat to their hair -- male or female. I purchased this product on amazon because it was cheaper than target or walmart.</li>
    <li> Read all the positive reviews and ordered Shine Spray Protection infusing spary and my experience was horrendous.  First of all it didn&#x27;t spray, so naturally I looked inside to see if it had one of those safety dripping caps.  It didn&#x27;t so I gave it another spray and NADA.  I fiddled with the top and all of a sudden it dislodged from a little divice and while trying to put the &#x27;thingy&#x27; back in the hole - three plastic small things fell onto the counter and I had no idea what the were or how to put them back into their proper place.  So there I was unable to use this Keratin Tresemme treatment.  LAST TIME I WILL PURCHASE THIS CHEAP PLASTICK SPRAYING APPARATUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the one in the Black bottle with pink top and it did the exact same thing - fell in pieces.  Now I have two (2) bottles of this crap.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its a fragrant mist that doesnt leave your hair greasy like some heat protectants. I work in a restaurant n sometimes to freshen up the smell of my hair after work ill spray it a couple times. Ill definately keep using this product it really smoothes my hair when i use the flatiron. I love it!</li>
    <li> Anything to protect my hair because it&#x27;s too valuable!  I love the scent.  Definitely would buy it again.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have bought this Item, but unfortunately received another, which isn&#x27;t for &amp;#34;FOR SMOOTH, EASY TO STYLE HAIR&amp;#34; which I ordered, but it is &amp;#34;CONTROLS FRIZZ FOR 48 HOURS&amp;#34;, and it just burned my hair, I feel very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> My hair did not like this product.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing the one you use with the flat iron . It is almost the same as this one.  Working with that bottle cap gives you a hard time. I use it with Garnier blow dry perfector before I blow dry my hair.  My hair is dull, thin and frizzy. The humidity just makes my life miserable. This combination of products makes my hair silky and smooth and you need a shine spray to just give you that much needed shine.</li>
    <li> I have tested the Tresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray through the Vine Program.  This was an eight ounce bottle with a spray nozzle on top.  I wanted to try this as it said heat protected to protect my hair while playing golf in the heat of the summer.  I wear a visor while playing golf and thought this would help protect my hair.  It was suppose to shield the hair from damage of heat styling and add shine to your hair.  It said to use their shampoo and conditioner first but I did not have that product.  This was suppose to protect from all heat such as dryers, heat appliances, hot rollers and curling irons and designed to transform your hair with a smooth style that last for 48 hours.  This product is infused with keratine that leaves hair sleek and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to spray liberally onto your damp hair then towel dry the hair and comb through.  I  found the nozzle was hard to use, it was hard to get the sprayer to work.  It also suggested to blow dry your hair while pointing the dryer downward to make the hair smooth.  This worked as I have straight hair and it is thick so drying the hair in this fashion made my hair smooth and straight.  I may have used too much of the spray solution as my hair looked dry by the end of the day.  I will be using this again when our summer weather gets here so see if it has the protection that it says it has.  Fairly easy to use once I managed to work the sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letta Meinen</li>
    <li> I picked this up after using (and also being happy with) [[ASIN:B000H88QOM TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray]]; my hair is wavy when it air dries (which takes forever), so I usually blow-dry it, which straightens it a bit, and use a [[ASIN:B000CSLJ78 Straightening Brush]] or [[ASIN:B000NJE14E Ceramic Thermal Hair Straightener]] to help it along, and then use a curling iron as needed, so my hair gets some abuse. Since I&#x27;d tried the regular Heat Tamer spray and was happy with it, I figured, why not try this \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; version of the Tresemme heat protection product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((Note, I&#x27;m mentioning the other products I use in case it helps you; of course, your results will vary!))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done with washing my hair (note, I haven&#x27;t tried the other Tresemme shampoo or conditioner products in this line, I use a different kind of shampoo and conditioner), I spray this on liberally, then comb through with a shower comb or [[ASIN:B0002YE8F2 Revlon RV2513 Color Swirl Detangling Comb]]. If I don&#x27;t use some kind of spray, even with shampoo, my hair is very hard to comb through, and it ends up with frizz when I dry it. This product does the trick very nicely; it does indeed leave my hair comb-able when wet, and soft and silky when dry. I haven&#x27;t noticed any drying or buildup (and as I said, I use an anti-residue shampoo once a week anyway), but your results may vary. Also, my hair tends to be oily at the roots, and thankfully this doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh it down or make it look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Does what it promises (protects from heat, helps smooth hair, keeps the little frizzes down, and a little spray is good for a quick touchup)&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive (note, I bought mine in my local supermarket)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-They redesigned the spray part of the bottle in a way that is harder to use when you&#x27;re spraying it on your own hair (it&#x27;s more of a gun-type spray top now than a pump-type). The way you might hold it to spray the back of your head seems to cause stress to the attachment of the spray piece to the collar that attaches to the bottle, which causes the spray part to snap off, and I&#x27;ve not been able to get it to twist or snap back on with any luck, making the product unable to be used as a spray. I&#x27;ve kept an older bottle to refill when this happens, but it&#x27;s frustrating! It&#x27;s happened three times out of four already, and I&#x27;m not rough on it in any way. I&#x27;d recommend keeping an extra bottle with a different kind of top on hand to pour this product into in case this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: It&#x27;s very slippery, so use caution when using it on a smooth/slippery/tile/tub surface!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really do love the product, and it does deliver as promised. I&#x27;m just disappointed that the bottle tends to break in a way that isn&#x27;t easy (if possible at all) to fix. Still, I would recommend it.k of your head seems to cause stress to the attachment of the spray piece to the collar that attaches to the bottle, which causes the spray part to snap off, and I&#x27;ve not been able to get it to twist or snap back on with any luck, making the product unable to be used as a spray.

    <li> I love to try new hair products and am glad I gave this a try.  I use it when my hair is damp, comb through and use my hair dryer.  It has a nice scent and makes my hair very soft and shiny.  Other products I have tried have left my hair feeling greasy but not this one.  If you want soft and shiny hair I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product helped my curly,frizzy, colored blond hair to straighten it and regain a natural shininess ! Good product for this price ! Had more expensive products that didn&#x27;t do much,but I am happy to say I did see results after using this product !</li>
    <li> Need to get more and more and more and need to find more made my hair smell great and touch too :)</li>
    <li> I purchase this product by mistake and it wasn&#x27;t really the type of heat protector that I was looking for, but it is the same brand. The problem I have with this product is that it&#x27;s more like water instead of an oil; I was looking for something oily. This product makes my hair difficult to straighten.</li>
    <li> TRESemme Keratin Smooth is awesome. It is more than I expect it . So I recommend to try it .</li>
    <li> love the mist  and the sprayer.  leaves my hair shiny and ready for the flat iron.  my hair is fine, thin and this product works.  my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.  i&#x27;ve spent $40 twice, on Brazilian Blow Dry or whatever it&#x27;s called, and my hair still looked like #$&amp;/!!!! -- llike Bozo the Clown.  It worked great when I had long hair but not with a bob.  This product works great on a blunt cut.  Love it!</li>
    <li> was delivered late but great product</li>
    <li> The scent is strong but pleasant.  And this stuff works.  And it is CHEAP!  So it is definitely a winner!</li>
    <li> great product and works wonderfully! didn&#x27;t like the smell as much as I like the regular tresemme heat protection spray but this is still really nice smelling!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, have had spiral, kinky curls since I was very little. Straightening was always an issue, it would take me hours. My sister got me the Kerittan 7 day treatment as a present in my Christmas stocking. After using this product for approx. a month, the entire top layer of my shoulder blade length hair broke to about 3 inches ( no more than the length of a pointer finger ). This product permenantly damaged my hair and will take many hair appointments to keep the damage done at bay and close to a year to gain back the length. I would not recommend this to anyone. The information on the bottle did not specify to over use and the company should take this product out of stores. I will never buy another treseme product again.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd go to hair straightening spray. My 1st &amp; favorite is the Brazilian flat iron spray because it has a brown tint, but it has been off the shelves for some reason &amp; overpriced online. So I&#x27;ve been using this red one for awhile now &amp; thought I should write a review since I feel like a pro now. I spray this generously all over my hair after I shower &amp; before I comb it out with a wide tooth comb. I will also use another spray like the kukui oil anti-frizz &amp; mist it everywhere from top to bottom. I really don&#x27;t like the way the tresemme split remedy leave-in conditioning spray feels on my hair, but since I have it, I will focus this product only on the ends of my hair &amp; not the roots or top part. Then I blow dry my hair. When it&#x27;s almost completely dry, I use a wide squarish paddle brush &amp; gently work on my hair as I blow dry some layers on both sides of my head. This helps to add a little stretch &amp; straighten out my hair. After it&#x27;s all dry, I further straighten my hair with a flat iron (rusk heat freak) section by section. To do this I take some hair starting from the back &amp; I spray the tresemme Keratin smooth onto the paddle brush &amp; I brush out that section of hair that I isolated. I try not to spray too much, maybe 1 or 2 sprays, because I repeat this process with several sections of hair until I&#x27;m completely done ironing out all of my hair. I use a big clip to hold he hair that I haven&#x27;t gotten to yet &amp; I use a smaller one when towards the end when all I really have left to straighten is the front layers. After I&#x27;m done I use the wide comb to comb my hair a little &amp; then I finish off by using Kenra silkening gloss polish &amp; shine (4.4fl). I pump a little onto my hand because you don&#x27;t need a lot, so although it is expensive, it lasts awhile &amp; worth the investment, then I rub my hands together with it &amp; apply it into my hair focusing in the back &amp; under, not really the top part of my hair. It will distribute nicely just by workin your hands &amp; fingers through your hair with it. This is my routine for straight shiny healthy looking hair. Unfortunately you will lose hair with over straightening &amp; over washing, but I feel like I have no choice :/</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or oily. It protects the hair as well. I spray it on my hair before I straitened them. Makes my hair soft looking perfect and protected.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Couldn&#x27;t find locally n didn&#x27;t want to drive out of town</li>
</ol>
