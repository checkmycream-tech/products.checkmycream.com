      <li>Pure Pitz is amazing!</li>
      <li>I have been on the lookout for a great natural deodorant, and I am so glad I found one I love.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and really does the job.  </li>
      <li>Totally natural, no chemicals and smells great.</li>
      <li>Now I swipe it gently twice under each arm pit and am good for the day.  </li>
      <li>The scent is really clean and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>This is the top of the line deodorant, it totally masks the smell of sweat and its very own smell</li>
      <li>I did get a rash the first couple of days, but that cleared up and it works amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many natural deodorants through the years and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It is, by far, the best deodorant I have ever used and the fact that it is totally natural and organic is a huge plus...</li>
      <li>This product smells amazing and really gets the job done.</li>
      <li>When I broke my shoulder and was in a sling for six weeks, I discovered that my deodorant was no longer able to keep me smelling fresh all day.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the size, but I am not crazy about the packaging.</li>
      <li>Perfect for travel as the product is quite small.</li>
      <li>so, I love so many scents, but natural ones!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
      <li>If you ignore the price, the deodrant is good especially in summer.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t stop the sweat (due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients), but it works great at blocking odor.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
      <li>I have actually had people comment on how good fresh I smell</li>
      <li>As a recent breast cancer survivor, I have tried so many organic and natural products that simply aren&#x27;t effective and just don&#x27;t smell good.  </li>
      <li>This is a premium product and worth every cent.  </li>
      <li>Ok People,I have to say I have tried every natural deodorant made over a 35 year span,and even tho this is made by my sister Lisa, I still have to tell you it is</li>
      <li>have tried prob most natural deodorants out there.</li>
      <li>- I&#x27;ve used natural unscented deodorants since and experienced the same problem.</li>
      <li>it is simple, clean and works better than anything on the market.  </li>
      <li>Great to travel with small</li>
      <li>because of its small size it is great for travel and one container lasts about 4 months.  </li>
      <li>The week I stopped using it and went back to lavanilla (which smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t quite keep you from stinking the way pure pitz does)</li>
      <li>Thank You Pure Pitz!</li>
      <li>Where did they come up with this super high price for 14 cents worth of product?  </li>
      <li>Thats all i need for a hot day here in the south.</li>
      <li>I work in a hot kitchen and was hoping that this was &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; but I had to stop using it.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE the essential oils.</li>
      <li>It took a while to find one but this one really does works!</li>
      <li>this one really works!</li>
      <li>I refuse to use aluminum and alcohol deodorants, and actually cannot because most of them give me a rash.  </li>
      <li>I will still wear it under dark shirts (one of the better natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve found) but beware light shirts!</li>
      <li>I can put in a full day of work, go to dance class for 2 1/2 hours, sleep and still smell fresh the next morning without ever having to reapply.  </li>
      <li>i  know the product is pure and well made.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m out of my sling but still using Pure Pitz.</li>
      <li>I think the oils in the Pure Pitz one help prevent that.</li>
      <li>I tell them it is my Pure Pitz deodorant.</li>
      <li>A close friend suggested Pure Pitz.</li>
      <li>Been using Pure Pitz since it came out</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend using Pure Pitz!</li>
      <li>It is light weight but strong enough to last all day.</li>
      <li>The super concentrated formula allows for all day protection while needing to use only a small amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;Being very versed in organic products, I love the clean, fresh scent of Pure Pitz.</li>
      <li>Pure Pitz works better than I ever expected and one stick lasts forever.</li>
      <li>the best!!&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for many months you only need a few swipes under the arm pits and I love the smell,but I am also an Herbalist and Aromatherapist</li>
      <li>It lasts about a month, but it REALLY WORKS.  </li>
      <li>None of the ingredients cost much so</li>
      <li>Also appreciate the fact that it is the only BPA free container that I&#x27;ve found in the deodorant market.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear deodorant that often but when I do, I really need it.</li>
      <li>Neutralizes odor very well and lasts all day</li>
      <li>and so I really appreciate the purity of this product.  </li>

    <li> This is by far the best deodorant I have ever used.  Yes it is tiny but it does last because you don&#x27;t need very much, it is that concentrated!  I can put in a full day of work, go to dance class for 2 1/2 hours, sleep and still smell fresh the next morning without ever having to reapply.  I did get a rash the first couple of days, but that cleared up and it works amazingly well.  And I LOVE the smell!!</li>
    <li> Ugh. doesnt do a thing - actually made me smell worse!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear deodorant that often but when I do, I really need it. This is the top of the line deodorant, it totally masks the smell of sweat and its very own smell is very refreshing and not to pungent. I also love how small it is, I can leave it in my backpack and no one even knows what it is. I would highly recommend anyone to try it, you&#x27;ll never go back to using anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this product! As a recent breast cancer survivor, I have tried so many organic and natural products that simply aren&#x27;t effective and just don&#x27;t smell good.  This product smells amazing and really gets the job done. While it looks like a small amount, It is highly concentrated so only takes a couple of swipes. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 months and have barely made a dent in it. I&#x27;m so grateful and relieved to have a product that is safe, effective, and makes me smell AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Pure Pitz is so small, yet so powerful. Just a little bit goes a LONG way. No need to bulk up on deodorant, this is the one. It travels well too!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have been using Pure Pitz since I first discovered it several years ago. I love everything about it - the scent, the organic ingredients, the effectiveness, and convenient product size. While it may seem small at first glance, only a small amount is needed - a tube lasts me for months. I work out every day and never have any issues with odor.</li>
    <li> What an absolutely excellent product! I love that it&#x27;s small and compact, but goes a long way and it&#x27;s perfect for traveling. It&#x27;s so nice to feel like there&#x27;s something to use that isn&#x27;t just pouring chemicals into my body!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!! The scent is really clean and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.Great size and worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> this is the ONLY deodorant you will ever need.  it is simple, clean and works better than anything on the market.  because of its small size it is great for travel and one container lasts about 4 months.  i  know the product is pure and well made.  even gave out as stocking stuffers at Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deodorant I have ever used. It is light weight but strong enough to last all day. I have actually had people comment on how good fresh I smell and that was at the end of the day. I tell them it is my Pure Pitz deodorant. Great to travel with small and you do not need a lot. I suggest it to all my clients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants.....this one really works!</li>
    <li> Ok People,I have to say I have tried every natural deodorant made over a 35 year span,and even tho this is made by my sister Lisa, I still have to tell you it is the best!!&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for many months you only need a few swipes under the arm pits and I love the smell,but I am also an Herbalist and Aromatherapist so, I love so many scents, but natural ones!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try,and don&#x27;t over do it!!&lt;br /&gt;As far as rashes go, I never use deodorant right after I have shaved,skin likes to be free!&lt;br /&gt;So for all those out there,give it a try ,even men love it!!!</li>
    <li> I first found Pure Pitz when my very organic conscious cousin recommended it to me.  I refuse to use aluminum and alcohol deodorants, and actually cannot because most of them give me a rash.  I was SO excited to get Pure Pitz - even though its VERY small, and VERY expensive for a deodorant.  It lasts about a month, but it REALLY WORKS.  I found it actually worked better than my old non-organic antiperspirants and deodorants from Secret and other big brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They warn you that it&#x27;s very concentrated, and the reason for that is because it contains baking soda as one of the main ingredients.  If you are the least bit sensitive, it WILL give you a rash...It&#x27;s happened to everyone I know who&#x27;s used it.  After buying my second tube, my armpits were itchy, and bruised.  The week I stopped using it and went back to lavanilla (which smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t quite keep you from stinking the way pure pitz does) the rash went away.  Thankfully I had read other customer reviews saying the same thing so I knew I wasn&#x27;t crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still keep it in my bag for emergencies - just not everyday use.  I purchased a tub of baking soda free organic deodorant from a company called &amp;#34;Meow Meow Tweet&amp;#34;, and although it&#x27;s not as powerful against the stink as pure pitz, it definitely works and no more rash for me.</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for a natural product that I would be able to use without fear of embarrassment and this is it.  I can use this in the morning and go out all day without re-application.  The scent and the efficacy give this 5 stars.  I also like that the size is perfect for your purse in case you stay overnight, you can re-apply the next day.  The price is a bit high for .6 ounces but a little also does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Been using Pure Pitz since it came out and I love it! And I&#x27;m a sweaty gal...I completely trust the formulation as well. Totally natural, no chemicals and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, I love the texture, and I love that it works. I recommend it totally. It&#x27;s the only deodorant I use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all my other deodorants and replaced them with this.  I use this all the time.  The base is a floral, pleasing fragrance (jojoba oil) with baking soda.  There are other things.  Overall, feels natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some of the more chemically products out there.  I might drop it a star because it&#x27;s pricey but that doesn&#x27;t related to the product so I left it at 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product less now that its made my white and light shirts yellow in the armpits. I will still wear it under dark shirts (one of the better natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve found) but beware light shirts!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product.  It has a pleasant scent and really does the job.  I was surprised how long the tube lasted given it&#x27;s size.  I strongly suggest this organic deodorant to anyone who is considering trying it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  A little goes a long way and it lasts all day.  I have tried many natural deodorants through the years and this is by far the best. Thank You Pure Pitz!</li>
    <li> But it has a butter-like consistency and melts, and it also caused some irritation for me. I think this might work really well for some people because it did keep my armpits dry all day; I smelled more than when using my regular Dove deo, but I wasn&#x27;t sweaty. Love the Amazon return policy cause $15 is a lot for me to waste.</li>
    <li> The first stick worked so well (no odor, no reapplication) that I didn&#x27;t mind the stronger scent of essential oils during the day. It&#x27;s small, so use sparingly. Unfortunately while using the second stick, my skin became very sensitive, and very red. Now I have hyperpigmentation. I can only guess that I am allergic to the proprietary blend of essential oils. I wish the essential oils were listed so that I can pinpoint the cause because I use essential oils for other purposes and don&#x27;t have a reaction. Back to finding a natural deodorant that works...  Update 2/16/15 - I&#x27;ve used natural unscented deodorants since and experienced the same problem. The issue is the baking soda. Not sure I&#x27;m willing to try the apple cider solution.</li>
    <li> Where to start...it is ridiculously priced for such a small amount of product.  I knew it was small, but really it is teeny, tiny.  I did not care for the fragrance; it did not work as a deodorant; and it gave me a rash.  The ingredients are not listed on the container, so if you are sensitive to anything that you know of, there is no way to know if it&#x27;s in this stuff.  Felt like this was a total rip off.  And being a personal care item, it can not be returned.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> It is definitely a good deodorant  but I ran out in 2 weeks! I don&#x27;t think I can afford buying it every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Have tried so many natural brands and hoped this one would be different. It immediately caused a rash on my underarms just like all the others. The worst part is the price for what you get, this was literally travel size!! Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> I am giving it three stars mainly for the price. Its very expensive and lasts only 3 weeks. None of the ingredients cost much so not sure why the price is so high. If you ignore the price, the deodrant is good especially in summer.</li>
    <li> I have been on the lookout for a great natural deodorant, and I am so glad I found one I love. Pure Pitz works better than I ever expected and one stick lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Pure Pitz is the best deodorant my husband and I have ever used - bar none.  Both my husband and I use it and one container lasts us months.  It is ultra concentrated and only one swipe is needed.  It has an amazing, delicate scent from pure essential oils - I am very allergic to artificial smells and so I really appreciate the purity of this product.  And I adore the compact size - fits perfectly into a purse or a gym bag!</li>
    <li> This Pure Pitz deodorant is tiny .6 oz.  , it does smell nice and seems to work good, but is a bit sticky.  might be good for traveling because of its size.</li>
    <li> Pure Pitz is amazing! It is the only all natural, organic deodorant that I have tried that really, really works! It is super concentrated, so you only need to use a little to stay protected all day. The small container fits easily into your gym bag. I would highly recommend using Pure Pitz!</li>
    <li> Been trying lots of natural deodarants but they dont stop the odor, recently got pure pitz and I have to say so far so good!!  It seems to be working and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Neutralizes odor very well and lasts all day</li>
    <li> Great product. Wife would give it a 5 star. Just on the small size.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant I have found that truly works! I love the smell and the size, but I am not crazy about the packaging. I preferred the round dispenser. Also, I gave it to a large man to use and he said it was too small for him to apply easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer packaging that is round and larger.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t stop the sweat (due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients), but it works great at blocking odor.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on clear, long lasting. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. No reapplication needed. It even holds up to a sweaty run. I found out that if I shave then put it on, it irritates my left pit (but not the right!). I simply used my other stuff, Toms, until the rash went away, then started again. I have a history of picky pits. On the days I shave, i use coconut oil and Toms...or shave at night then use Pitz in the morning. I like the smell, I like the small container (tucks away in my purse for use on the Toms days if I need it). I like that its natural, and a little really does go a looooong way. I put a bit on then move my arm back and forth to spread it around. Thats all i need for a hot day here in the south.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care how good this product is (i haven&#x27;t tried it yet) the size is so small that it will run out in about a week with normal use.  Where did they come up with this super high price for 14 cents worth of product?  UPDATE: I have tried the product a few times, and I can say it doesn&#x27;t work for me as good as some other products I have tried. So being so high priced and doesn&#x27;t work as good as other natural products, puts this item on low category in my book, and will never order any products from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Works great and without the harmful ingredients!</li>
    <li> It took a while to find one but this one really does works! I bought for my daughter&#x27;s use and was extremely skeptical because most natural deodorants really don&#x27;t do the job for the really stinky sports pitz. Well, low and behold this one does. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great product, great travel size</li>
    <li> When I broke my shoulder and was in a sling for six weeks, I discovered that my deodorant was no longer able to keep me smelling fresh all day. A close friend suggested Pure Pitz. This product worked so well that I abandoned my previous deodorant and have used Pure Pitz regularly. It kept me feeling dry and odorless all day even when my arm was immobile. Two swipes under each arm is all it took. I&#x27;m out of my sling but still using Pure Pitz. It worked for me during a stressful time. Now it works for me daily.</li>
    <li> I would give 5 stars because this is the only natural deodorant that works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried prob most natural deodorants out there. NONE of them work. This stuff however, is amazing! I recommend it to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the size. ITS WAY TOO SMALL!!! And it&#x27;s quite expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this company will make a bigger size!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! Feels smooth, smells fantastic and works great...and a little goes a long way! Best organic, natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> As the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  This is a premium product and worth every cent.  It is super concentrated, has a gorgeous silky texture and I LOVE the essential oils.</li>
    <li> I have tried many organic deodorants over the years with no success. Pure Pitz is the one and only product that has lived up to my expectations. The super concentrated formula allows for all day protection while needing to use only a small amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;Being very versed in organic products, I love the clean, fresh scent of Pure Pitz. Love the convenient size as I am on the go with work, travel, gym and yoga. Also appreciate the fact that it is the only BPA free container that I&#x27;ve found in the deodorant market. Highly recommend Pure Pitz.</li>
    <li> I felt like I had found the Holy Grail of deodorants until my pits started to itch and then broke out in a terrible rash. Ugh. I work in a hot kitchen and was hoping that this was &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; but I had to stop using it. I have read about the ACV neutralizing the baking soda yada yada yada. Maybe that works for some people but the trade off is not worth it to me. Back to the crystal I go!</li>
    <li> My wife is addicted to these. They&#x27;re so small... god I wish they were normal size, there are tons of tiny deodorants in my cupboard... on the upside, she smells great!</li>
    <li> I had this product before ( my daughter had ordered for me , maybe 1-2 years ago ) and it was excellent . This time I ordered it myself and ,&lt;br /&gt;  unfortunately , was disappointed . It&#x27;s not the same quality : too soft , almost falling apart , difficult to use it  .  I&#x27;ve bought three items , so far I am&lt;br /&gt;  using one ( with big difficulty ) . Two others I didn&#x27;t open yet .&lt;br /&gt;  I was very happy to discover this deodorant and thought now I&#x27;ll be always ordering it . And now I don&#x27;t know ... I would return two others , but it&lt;br /&gt;  seems like too much trouble ... I think I need to check the other one and then make a decision .&lt;br /&gt;  I wish this product come back to that excellent quality , which it used to have before ...</li>
    <li> It is just so small. For $15??</li>
    <li> This deodorant works! This tiny tube lasts me for over 4 months. I only use 2-3 swipes on each armpit once a day, that&#x27;s all you need, unless I go to the gym, then I use it before the gym too. Still lasts me for over 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never gotten a rash from using this one. For me it has helped with razor burn actually. I have used another baking soda based, natural deodorant and that gave me a rash, but this one doesn&#x27;t. I think the oils in the Pure Pitz one help prevent that. But some will still be sensitive I guess.</li>
    <li> Earthly Remedies by Erin makes a great deodorant that stands up great. Check out the site at  [...]  Wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this product, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I REALLY REALLY like everything about this product, mainly that it truly is 100% pure and not a scam.  It is really small like a lot of reviews state and very sticky to put on, but once its on, it works wonders!  I have tried so many all natural products and this is the only one that works!  Works better than medicated deodorant even!  I gave it a 4 though. because after a couple months of use, I had to stop using it because it started to give me a REALLY bad rash everytime I used it.  I am not sure which natural ingredient it the problem, but it became too painful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - have never used a deodorant this effective - and no irritation. A small amount goes a long way - don&#x27;t overuse. Perfect for travel as the product is quite small.</li>
    <li> The first few times I tried it,  my skin got irritated and I developed a rush,  but I quickly realized I was probably putting on too much.  A little bit goes a looong way. Now I swipe it gently twice under each arm pit and am good for the day.  I like it.</li>
    <li> It is, by far, the best deodorant I have ever used and the fact that it is totally natural and organic is a huge plus... I never have to worry - it just works &amp; I love everything about it - from the lovely scent to the ease of application.... Just a little goes a long way.</li>
