      <li>This product works better than Crest 3d White.  </li>

      <li>A real find and thank you Amazon again for having this item !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an espresso lover myself, and it can be a challenge to keep up with whitening when you love rich, dark coffee.  </li>
      <li>Not sure I have seen the degree of whitening advertised, but nevertheless, it is a good product.</li>
      <li>The mouthwash tastes odd to him but the toothpaste is working good so far.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>This tooth paste really lightens ones teeth.</li>
      <li>My teeth are much whiter</li>
      <li>was fast</li>
      <li>Well at first this toothpaste will light your mouth on fire, but after a few uses you get use to how hot this toothpaste is.</li>
      <li>For my own use it is safe, but there is perhaps an extremely small percentage of people who will experience an untoward reaction when using Optic White, such as that reported by another reviewer here.  </li>
      <li>For my own use it is safe, but there is perhaps an extremely small percentage of people who will experience an untoward reaction when using Optic White, such as that reported by another reviewer here.  </li>
      <li>Be sure if reordering you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made and order the smaller tubes.</li>
      <li>That is not a common occurrence in my experience with patients using the product,</li>
      <li>That is not a common occurrence in my experience with patients using the product, however.</li>
      <li>a normal polishing followed by, 2.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right folks; just gather up all the foam in your mouth and spit several times, but don&#x27;t use water or mouthwash to rinse.  </li>
      <li>In our dental office, this is the toothpaste we recommend for maintaining a white smile after professional whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get complements on my smile daily, and I am often asked if I have my teeth professionally whitened.  </li>
      <li>My hubby is using this toothpaste and so far enjoys it.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste, with regular use, really whitens teeth.</li>
      <li>Similar to how peanut butter can separate the oil.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the savings, should have bought a single tube from the local store.</li>
      <li>However, for most people it would take a long, long time -- if ever -- to achieve the same results with an over-the-counter toothpaste that are achieved in less than an hour with professional whitening.  </li>
      <li>For some people with very deep staining, even professional whitening won&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>the actual tooth paste started to separate into a clear liquid and solid paste.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We received the toothpaste as ordered and on time. It&#x27;s exactly what we ordered. We&#x27;ll place them in our bathrooms and the rest in storage for future use.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product. Have used regular Colgate toothpastes in the past. This surpasses them and they&#x27;re great. I&#x27;ve shared this with others.</li>
    <li> The tubes was over inflated with air when we got it, very odd...&lt;br /&gt;Then the actual tooth paste started to separate into a clear liquid and solid paste.  Similar to how peanut butter can separate the oil.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the savings, should have bought a single tube from the local store.</li>
    <li> All of the tubes were not properly sealed so toothpaste comes out of the bottom. Lesson learned, don&#x27;t buy toothpaste on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste, with regular use, really whitens teeth. I use it all the time and results are really quite good. Equivalent to trays.</li>
    <li> Well at first this toothpaste will light your mouth on fire, but after a few uses you get use to how hot this toothpaste is. It will probably take 5-7 days to whiten your teeth dramatically.</li>
    <li> I hate buying things one at a time because it is so easy to run out of your fave item. So I ordered these online and don&#x27;t have to worry about running out any time soon!!</li>
    <li> tooth paste I have being using all the time, smells well and leaves tteeth and mouth smelling good,can be recommended</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and works well for me.</li>
    <li> I do like the brand but my teeth look the same so for me I won&#x27;t spend the extra dollar next time.</li>
    <li> I just came from the dentist today. Folks have been having side affects from Colgate Optic White Toothpaste. I am one of them. My gums were swollen and bright red. My cheek looked like I had a golf ball in it. I had skin peeling off my gums. Do not know what the ingredient is. I would hate to see anybody have this happen to them. Google and you can read for yourself. How in the hell is this garbage on the market????</li>
    <li> No savings here...keep moving. Now Wal-Mart has figured out to beat paying the tax man and keep the price the same as store prices. Fail by Amazon...</li>
    <li> wow 4 of them at a great price,it is refreshing and true to their words when they say you&#x27;r teeth get whiter and whiter they do,also use the optic colgate mouthwash.I do recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste we have ever used</li>
    <li> Optic white is the best whitening toothpaste there is. It tastes better than any Crest product. But it is not a teeth whitener.  It is great for maintenance. You need to use a carbamide peroxide [[ASIN:B00JOW50I2 Teeth Whitening Gel]] to get them the whitest then usethis as your everyday toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste ever!  I get complements on my smile daily, and I am often asked if I have my teeth professionally whitened.  I use this toothpaste with my Sonicare toothbrush, and I have found the trick to maximizing the toothpaste&#x27;s whitening power is not to rinse.  That&#x27;s right folks; just gather up all the foam in your mouth and spit several times, but don&#x27;t use water or mouthwash to rinse.  This leaves a thin layer/ residue on the teeth that continues to whiten after you finish brushing.  I also usually try not to drink or eat anything for 30 minutes after brushing.  Works great for me and my teeth have never been whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering about my mouthwash use, I use a pre-brush mouthwash instead.  Happy brushing and don&#x27;t forget to floss.  As my dentist says, \\&quot;Only floss the ones you want to keep.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great! Fully satisfied!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought after researching the best available product with value for whitening.  Go for it without reservations.  Be sure if reordering you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made and order the smaller tubes.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste really lightens ones teeth. I don&#x27;t know what their secret is. But whatever it is, it works!!! A real find and thank you Amazon again for having this item !</li>
    <li> If you like to keep your smile looking bright and white, this is the toothpaste for you.  In our dental office, this is the toothpaste we recommend for maintaining a white smile after professional whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some in these reviews have described obtaining good results with the toothpaste alone, without professional whitening.  That will likely work for some people, especially those whose chief problem is extrinsic (outside the teeth) staining.  However, for most people it would take a long, long time -- if ever -- to achieve the same results with an over-the-counter toothpaste that are achieved in less than an hour with professional whitening.  My experience is that most people do well with:  1.  a normal polishing followed by, 2. use of a speedy in-office or at-home whitening kit, then 3. maintenance with Optic White.  This is the best chance for most people in obtaining and maintaining a bright smile longterm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular coffee or soda drinker?  Wine aficionado?  You need this toothpaste to avoid dark, dingy looking teeth recurring after whitening.  I&#x27;m an espresso lover myself, and it can be a challenge to keep up with whitening when you love rich, dark coffee.  Optic White gives you a leg up for staying stain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the best whitening solution for you?  Start small, and move up from there.  Try a toothpaste such as Optic White.  If you&#x27;re not happy with the results, you can move up to other over-the-counter whitening solutions, such as Crest White Strips.  If you don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for results, or you&#x27;re still not happy with them, you can seek professional treatments.  For some people with very deep staining, even professional whitening won&#x27;t work.  There still may be other options, such as veneers or crowns to cover unsightly, stained teeth.  Choose a skilled, caring dentist, who can help you achieve a smile that looks not just bright and white, but natural on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product 4 stars only because it does not currently have the American Dental Association&#x27;s Seal of Approval (although a number of other Colgate products do).  This seal is given by the ADA&#x27;s Council on Scientific Affairs to products that have been proven safe and effective.  I am confident the product is effective for most people.  For my own use it is safe, but there is perhaps an extremely small percentage of people who will experience an untoward reaction when using Optic White, such as that reported by another reviewer here.

    <li> gives you clean and fresh feel</li>
    <li> An excellent product - would recommend it to others. Not sure I have seen the degree of whitening advertised, but nevertheless, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Same toothpaste that I buy at Target, but now I am too lazy to go to Target so instead I order on Amazon. When I order on Amazon I do not also buy a Coca-Cola slushie so buying it on here is definitely better for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this toothpaste whiten your teeth? No. Does it taste better than Crest anything? Yes.</li>
    <li> My hubby is using this toothpaste and so far enjoys it. The mouthwash tastes odd to him but the toothpaste is working good so far.</li>
    <li> great product arrived on time  i recommend it to everyone shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tea drinker so my teeth tend to get discolored. I was happy to find whitening toothpaste that seems to work for most folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works. I noticed my teeth getting whiter and brighter after only a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;* It makes my mouth tingle, so I feel that my teeth are getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product contains hydrogen peroxide (the bleach), you do need to be careful when you wipe your mouth or get the toothpaste on your hands. I made the mistake of using a dark colored towel to get off the residue and the towel got bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you are careful and don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this product may work well for you.</li>
    <li> This product works better than Crest 3d White.  I used to use Crest 3d White and I use this product now.  I saw results within four days.  I think the products works best with the Colgate Optic White Tooth brush and mouth wash.</li>
    <li> I love Colgate Optic White toothpaste! I have tried so many others, but this is the one I have found that always leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh the best!</li>
    <li> I purchased this tooth paste because it claims to whiten teeth in two weeks.  I&#x27;m still waiting and it has been a month.  Buy this tooth paste for being a tooth paste, not a whitener!</li>
    <li> as toothpaste goes I like Colgate and when I saw the price for these 4 tubes I like it even better..thanks</li>
    <li> My teeth are much whiter and I have only used half the tube! I let the paste shot on my teeth for a few seconds before brushing .</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes great, stings a little, but is worth it for the way it leaves my mouth feeling clean.  I am looking forward to whiter teeth too as time goes on.  It was packaged well and I received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Standard goodness. There is not much to add.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this for a long time. Have tried other brands&lt;br /&gt;but did not like them.</li>
    <li> package was smashed when I got them.</li>
    <li> my tooth got whiter in less than a week</li>
    <li> No need to pay hundreds of dollars for whiter teeth.  This product works!  I received it free from Influenster as part of their March Sugar and Spice VoxBox.  I had never used it before, but it came at a great time.  I have been looking for other methods to get my teeth whiter.  This works in just a few short days.  This is a product I would purchase again.</li>
