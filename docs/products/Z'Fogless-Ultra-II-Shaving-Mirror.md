### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The shelf is great for storing all of his shaving things!!</li>
      <li>it was a bit disheartening, but the product its self is great!!</li>
      <li>The construction of the mirror is great.  </li>
      <li>The workmanship isn&#x27;t that great</li>
      <li>however, that does not do you much good when the mirror keeps falling to the ground.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, it has good zooming for the ones who likes it.     </li>
      <li>All in all its a good product.  </li>
      <li>It does not fog up very easily.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best fogless shower mirror that I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy to pay a shipping charge for this, but it arrived very very promptly via UPS Priority mail.</li>
      <li>It just fell apart because it was very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>The suction cups are really strong and the mirror has a nice rack with holes which I use it for my tooth brush, tooth paste and razor.</li>
      <li>There is no such thing called a perfectly fogless mirror.</li>
      <li>I have read many articles and reviews about fogless mirrors before I bought this one</li>
      <li>It was just more of this waterproof tape holding the mirror on.  </li>
      <li>Many folks say it fogs</li>
      <li>It works okay.</li>
      <li>Otherwise the product is OK.</li>
      <li>For as many times that it has fallen the mirror is still intact and it does not fog up while he is in the shower.</li>
      <li>This mirror is just ok.  </li>
      <li>I expect I will be able to put it on with a better adhesive.</li>
      <li>Maybe you will have to buy the spray that comes for fogless mirrors to make it better.</li>
      <li>Nice size, great magnified mirror, and solid feeling construction to it.</li>
      <li>With maybe just a splash of water to clear the beaded water you can see great.  </li>
      <li>The good news is it is very durable.  </li>
      <li>Shelf on top very useful.  </li>
      <li>Easy to change magnification.  </li>
      <li>Only good thing is that the suction cups hold nicely to the wall...</li>
      <li>The second unit worked great for one month until this morning when I found the mirror laying on the shower floor.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have experienced is that my razor falls out of the slot designed to hold it.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy having a mirror in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I have a smooth tile shower and they don&#x27;t even work on mine.  </li>
      <li>This thing is cheap.</li>
      <li>The mirror was made of cheap a plastic.</li>
      <li>If magnification is really important I would pass on this product.</li>
      <li>So Far so good.</li>
      <li>Cheap material and full of fog</li>
      <li>Generally the build quality was good.   </li>
      <li>The original one in a landfill somewhere by now.</li>
      <li>Originally we thought it was because he had his razor and lotion on it, but he stopped doing that</li>
      <li>They give you a towel that has the spray on it to clean and keep the mirror fogless.</li>
      <li>I went with this one based mostly on the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Nothing right with this product!  </li>
      <li>Received it today, inspected it, and can conclude initially that it looks good.</li>
      <li>First of all, unless you have a perfectly smooth, plastic shower surround, the suction cups will never work.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product a while back, but hadn&#x27;t written a review until purchasing the toilet tree fogless mirror which is awesome.</li>
      <li>If this product were $5-$10 it might be worth giving it a try because that&#x27;s about the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>Not the end of the world, the advantage of shaving in the shower is worth it.</li>
      <li>It works good when used with the fogless spray, but without spray, it fogs up like any other mirror.  </li>
      <li>After couple of weeks the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror became covered with fog the moment I opened the hot water in the shower.</li>
      <li>After a mix up and the first one getting lost in transit.</li>
      <li>I Bought a better one at the local Walgreens for $6.95.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product unless you are willing to repair and improve the adhesive mounting.</li>
      <li>It does not warrant replacement as long as it does not get any larger, otherwise it works great</li>
      <li>Overall the product is OK...</li>
      <li>Overall, pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>The plastic is strong and not cheap and may handle more weight but</li>
      <li>This hasn&#x27;t really been that big of a nuisance as I am in the shower more often than that.  </li>
      <li>I wanted something that would stay and not something that would have to be put up and taken down each time, so I just think this product is average at best.</li>
      <li>but I liked the large size and ability to mount using something other than suction cups</li>
      <li>The mirror is easy to mount and sturdy enough to hold tooth brushes, razor and shaving cream, all the items needed in the shower.</li>
      <li>Although, maybe next time I will buy a model with a light built in.</li>
      <li>But this product absolutely fell apart,</li>
      <li>The whole thing is flimsy plastic, including the mirror.  </li>
      <li>My only regret was that i didn&#x27;t order it with a light.</li>
      <li>The whole mirror surface became quite \\&quot;matte\\&quot; after some time, and</li>
      <li>bigger items may not sit comfortably because the rack is slim.    </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it will change much.     </li>
      <li>It has pervormed very well.  </li>
      <li>Still, this is designed for a wet environment and you are supposed to be able to increase the magnification by twisting.</li>
      <li>The warping is uneven creating a fun-house mirror kind of effect.</li>
      <li>Based on some of the high reviews the Zadro Z508 Fogless Shower mirror was receiving, I decided to buy one since I like to shave in the shower.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product considering their are better products at cheaper prices.</li>
      <li>If you like the feeling of a normal mirror like me, buy one with no magnification.</li>
      <li>The variable \\&quot;magnification\\&quot; is achieved by rotating the ring which puts more warping into the mirror making the fun-house effect even more impossible to deal with and also causing the plastic mirror to pop of from its foam sticky pad.</li>
      <li>This one is ok, it gives you enough time to shave and if it fog just splash a little water on it and it will not fog for a while.</li>
      <li>Now I must wipe it clear two or three times during a shower.</li>
      <li>The mirror needs to be sprayed with fogless spray every time it is used in order to keep it clear.</li>
      <li>Finally, I didn&#x27;t think the magnification will effect the mirror that much</li>
      <li>Unless you buy the ones that work with worm water which I don&#x27;t like because it adds extra work and that negates the whole principle from buying a fogless mirror.     </li>
      <li>The mirror is not stuck in place by anything other than this sticker and if you press it on with your thumbs it dimples creating a fun house effect.    </li>
      <li>I recently bought a decent fog-less mirror in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The first time gave me a real start, though, as it came crashing down in the middle of night while I was sleeping.  </li>
      <li>Had this for about 6 months now and if you happen to have hard water, no amount of cleaning (using their recommended products) will ever make it anywhere near as it was originally.</li>
      <li>(I have mine mounted directly under my shower head, so a different location might eliminate that.  </li>
      <li>It may have cost a little more, but no more headaches.</li>
      <li>Mainly because it seems like the item might rock off the shelf, not that it would bring down the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing is cheap. The workmanship isn&#x27;t that great and it stayed \\&quot;fog-less\\&quot; for a whopping couple of months. Then I ended up buying a de-fogging spray for my fog-less mirror. I recently bought a decent fog-less mirror in Macy&#x27;s. It may have cost a little more, but no more headaches.</li>
    <li> Garbage. the mirror would not stay connected to the base.  Save your money. I Bought a better one at the local Walgreens for $6.95.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a Christmas present.  It arrived promptly, however, the mirror was floating loosely in the box; unattached to the frame.  The mirror was also warped so I sent it back to the seller.(J&amp;R Music)  They provided me with a refund once they received it (less the postage).  Overall I was not impressed by the quality, and would avoid purchasing anything made by Zadro again.</li>
    <li> The construction of the mirror is great.  The suction cups keep in in place without issue.  The fogless quality however is a bit questionable.  It works good when used with the fogless spray, but without spray, it fogs up like any other mirror.  The mirror needs to be sprayed with fogless spray every time it is used in order to keep it clear.</li>
    <li> Generally the build quality was good.   However, the mirror is stuck on with an adhesive sticker and immediately fell off. The mirror is not stuck in place by anything other than this sticker and if you press it on with your thumbs it dimples creating a fun house effect.    I expect I will be able to put it on with a better adhesive. Still, this is designed for a wet environment and you are supposed to be able to increase the magnification by twisting. It is designed to fail.</li>
    <li> This was out of the box, and installed in less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3 simple suction cups, and it&#x27;s up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the shelf seems that flat or sturdy.  It would hold a small can of shaving cream, but I wouldn&#x27;t overload it.  Mainly because it seems like the item might rock off the shelf, not that it would bring down the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog in a steamy shower, and the zoom in / zoom out magnification feature (used by twisting the mirror clockwise or counter clockwise) works, but does take several twists.  Easier just to set it and forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, is that during a shower, some water gets stuck to the mirror, making it slightly difficult to see into the mirror.  (I have mine mounted directly under my shower head, so a different location might eliminate that.  All in all its a good product.  I wasn&#x27;t happy to pay a shipping charge for this, but it arrived very very promptly via UPS Priority mail.</li>
    <li> Based on some of the high reviews the Zadro Z508 Fogless Shower mirror was receiving, I decided to buy one since I like to shave in the shower.  When I received my purchase, the mirror was not attached to the self adhesive tape, it had popped lose.  I made several attempts to reattach, would only last a few hours before it would pop lose again.  I returned the product and reordered a second one, everything was seemless.  The second unit worked great for one month until this morning when I found the mirror laying on the shower floor. I would not recommend this product unless you are willing to repair and improve the adhesive mounting.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best fogless shower mirror that I have ever purchased. Thank goodness my last mirror broke.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even had it hanging for 24 hours and the thing is falling apart.  What you may not realize is that the mirror is held to the frame by a sticker!!!  Problem is the sticker does not stick.  Only good thing is that the suction cups hold nicely to the wall...however, that does not do you much good when the mirror keeps falling to the ground.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Awful!! Came apart in shipping, mirror out of holder, had the worse time getting it to go back in place and stay. It doesn&#x27;t hold on the shower wall for very long, when you least expect it to, it falls off. Quite a racket when it falls and I don&#x27;t know why I just didn&#x27;t send it back. I don&#x27;t recommend this mirror. Many folks say it fogs but I can&#x27;t comment on that as the suction never held long enough to find out.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just ok.  It will stay on the wall long enough for you to shave, but you will then have to take it down and store it somewhere until your next shave.  I wanted something that would stay and not something that would have to be put up and taken down each time, so I just think this product is average at best.</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of junk. The \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; is plastic and is held in place with sticky foam. This warps the mirror creating the \\&quot;magnification\\&quot;. The warping is uneven creating a fun-house mirror kind of effect. In addition, the magnification and warping of the mirror make it so that you can only focus (if you call it that) if your face is 6 inches or less away from the mirror. The variable \\&quot;magnification\\&quot; is achieved by rotating the ring which puts more warping into the mirror making the fun-house effect even more impossible to deal with and also causing the plastic mirror to pop of from its foam sticky pad. If this product were $5-$10 it might be worth giving it a try because that&#x27;s about the quality of the product. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> When I received the mirror it would not stay attached to the frame.  It just fell apart because it was very cheaply made.  I sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Had this for about 6 months now and if you happen to have hard water, no amount of cleaning (using their recommended products) will ever make it anywhere near as it was originally.</li>
    <li> A lot of negative comments on this shower mirror caused me some pause but I liked the large size and ability to mount using something other than suction cups (suction cups being the consistently worst way to mount a shower mirror). Received it today, inspected it, and can conclude initially that it looks good. Nice size, great magnified mirror, and solid feeling construction to it. Mirror spins from its base which seems unnecessary and might loosen over time but can&#x27;t tell that yet at this point.</li>
    <li> the manufacture only gives a 30 day guarantee on this.  My mirrow fell out after 60 days.  The double face tape did not hold.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> This mirror replaced an earlier model from Zadro, which despite it&#x27;s name was anything but fogless.  Unable to find a highly rated alternative, I took a chance on the Z508 and have been pleasantly surprised so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a while back, but hadn&#x27;t written a review until purchasing the toilet tree fogless mirror which is awesome. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product considering their are better products at cheaper prices.</li>
    <li> The whole thing is flimsy plastic, including the mirror.  You twist it to adjust the magnification.  The first time I did that, I twisted it too far and it popped apart.  I couldn&#x27;t get it back together.  Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using the mirror for about a month now.  It has pervormed very well.  With maybe just a splash of water to clear the beaded water you can see great.  It doesn&#x27;t fog!  The only problem I have experienced is that my razor falls out of the slot designed to hold it.</li>
    <li> It works okay. After a couple of months, I noticed it isn&#x27;t as fog resistant. Now I must wipe it clear two or three times during a shower. Not the end of the world, the advantage of shaving in the shower is worth it.</li>
    <li> Cheap material and full of fog</li>
    <li> Pro: Shelf on top very useful.  Easy to change magnification.  Stays on shower wall.  Con: This is not a fogless mirror as claimed by the manufacture.  After one week I had to start using a liquid de-foger.  Very disappointed in the lack of this feature.  I would not have purchased it if I had know.</li>
    <li> I have read many articles and reviews about fogless mirrors before I bought this one so I know what I am getting my self into.     There is no such thing called a perfectly fogless mirror. Unless you buy the ones that work with worm water which I don&#x27;t like because it adds extra work and that negates the whole principle from buying a fogless mirror.     This one is ok, it gives you enough time to shave and if it fog just splash a little water on it and it will not fog for a while. Maybe you will have to buy the spray that comes for fogless mirrors to make it better. They give you a towel that has the spray on it to clean and keep the mirror fogless. I didn&#x27;t try that but I don&#x27;t think it will change much.     The suction cups are really strong and the mirror has a nice rack with holes which I use it for my tooth brush, tooth paste and razor. The plastic is strong and not cheap and may handle more weight but bigger items may not sit comfortably because the rack is slim.    Finally, I didn&#x27;t think the magnification will effect the mirror that much but it did. If you like the feeling of a normal mirror like me, buy one with no magnification. I tried to set it up at the least zooming setting but it didn&#x27;t feel like a normal mirror to me. To be fair, it has good zooming for the ones who likes it.     I hope this helps.    PS. I apologize for any language structure or grammatical error cause I am not a native speaker.</li>
    <li> Total piece of junk!  Never used once, put in trash!  Nothing right with this product!  I would give zero stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Overall the product is OK... the magnifier aspect is non existing. Otherwise the product is OK. If magnification is really important I would pass on this product.</li>
    <li> When it came in the mail the mirror was off and I had to glue it on. It then fell off the wall after a day or so. Went and bought another brand at a local store. The original one in a landfill somewhere by now.</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror from Zadro is the second one i had purchased in the 11 years in the present house. It would not have been necessary had we not remodeled the Master shower. My only regret was that i didn&#x27;t order it with a light. The mirror is easy to mount and sturdy enough to hold tooth brushes, razor and shaving cream, all the items needed in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to see a cheap looking mirror when I opened the box. The mirror was made of cheap a plastic. The reflected image (my face...) was totally distorted. The supplied 2-sided sticker could not hold the mirror on the tiles and I had to use RTV in order to attach it to the shower wall.  After couple of weeks the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror became covered with fog the moment I opened the hot water in the shower. The whole mirror surface became quite \\&quot;matte\\&quot; after some time, and \\&quot;mirror stains\\&quot; (or peelings) appeared on the mirror edges and the plastic holder.    Why 2 start and not 1? - Because for over 2 years I am spraying anti-fog spray on the mirror before I start shaving, and so I manage to do the job. But now I had it, and I am looking for a different mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one of those types who writes terrible reviews for fun and picks apart the tiniest insignificant details of every product.  But this product absolutely fell apart, so I can&#x27;t help but warn others!  First of all, unless you have a perfectly smooth, plastic shower surround, the suction cups will never work.  I have a smooth tile shower and they don&#x27;t even work on mine.  So I bought this mirror because it was one of the few that came with this \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; sticky tape.  That fell off too.  I finally just bought some Gorilla glue and that held the mirror to the wall.  Then a few days later, the mirror itself came unstuck from the frame.  And guess what!  It was just more of this waterproof tape holding the mirror on.  No wonder it failed.  Because this was a Christmas gift and the box was thrown out on Christmas day, I couldn&#x27;t get a refund from J&amp;R.  They&#x27;re sending me a replacement, which I&#x27;m hoping will not fall apart as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband so that he could shave in the shower, however; it keeps falling off the wall.  Originally we thought it was because he had his razor and lotion on it, but he stopped doing that and it still falls off the wall.  The good news is it is very durable.  For as many times that it has fallen the mirror is still intact and it does not fog up while he is in the shower.</li>
    <li> There is a black dot (imperfection) on the glass small but noticeable. It does not warrant replacement as long as it does not get any larger, otherwise it works great</li>
    <li> I researched several Fogless mirrors on Amazon before deciding on this one.  I went with this one based mostly on the positive reviews.  I have had this mirror now for several months and can say that it does what I expected.  It does not fog up very easily.  When it does I just splash some water on the mirror and the problem is solved.  The suction cups work sufficiently enough, but the mirror will fall if I do not reapply pressure to the suctions every two weeks or so.  This hasn&#x27;t really been that big of a nuisance as I am in the shower more often than that.  The first time gave me a real start, though, as it came crashing down in the middle of night while I was sleeping.  They do provide a sticky patch alternative with the packaging if you so choose to use it.    Overall, pleased with the product.  Really enjoy having a mirror in the shower.  I would definitely purchase this same product again.  Although, maybe next time I will buy a model with a light built in.</li>
    <li> After a mix up and the first one getting lost in transit. It came after Christmas (it was a gift) it was a bit disheartening, but the product its self is great!! So Far so good. It does fog but splashing water on it solves the problem. The shelf is great for storing all of his shaving things!!</li>
