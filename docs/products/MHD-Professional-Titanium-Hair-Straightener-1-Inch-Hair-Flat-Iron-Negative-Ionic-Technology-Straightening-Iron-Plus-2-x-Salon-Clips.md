<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Shiny, silky straight hair at last!I purchased this iron based on the reviews I read and Before I bought this one I had spent soooo much money on different ones trying to find the PERFECT one. I was pleasantly surprised!I love how it heats up super fast and I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same strands of hair over and over again. the floating plate are well,it didn&#x27;t burn the hair, and I didn&#x27;t see residue from the product.The adjustable heat is perfect for different hair types,and is easy to handle. My hair looks AMAZING and several people have noticed a positive difference and gave me compliments! Enjoy the product!</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than expected! Excellent quality and price! I have thick and curly hair, it made them straight just a few seconds n stand for whole day! It is much better quality than a ceramic one I&#x27;m using before.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This straightener does its job, the only concern I have is that it started making a creaking noise on the second day when I turned it on. Hopefully this doesn&#x27;t give me issues in the future.</li>
    <li> I have stubborn hair that doesn&#x27;t like to straighten unless the tool is REALLY hot. This works perfectly and love that it has an automatic shut off. If I think I forgot to turn it off before I leave I don&#x27;t have to panic about it.</li>
    <li> This product does not offer what it advertises. When straightening my hair it pulls the hair and it hurts. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even straighten my hair at all. i dont even hair curly hair, i hair thick frizzy hair. The lock does not even work. I was very disappointed with this product. For the time being I will be sticking with my older ceramic iron. In this case you definitely get what you pay for. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> As expected but lock button is lose. It kept opening up when I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
    <li> Works great, it is a very good price for a good product. These normally are at least double the price and usually more. Fast shipping. No Complaints so far, I have had it less than a week. After some time if it remains reliable I may bump it up to 5 stars..</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great just as it was described. Only two passes on my natural hair texture, made it straight and silky. Always wondered why my hair didn&#x27;t get as straight or always turned frizzy after using my ceramic iron. Of course people always said titanium is better. I never even thought to buy a titanium because I thought they were all expensive, but I also wanted my hair to be healthy as well. So when I stumbled across this on Amazon, not only was it a titanium but it was inexpensive and had good reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to just talk about how good this flat iron is, I wanted to show how good it is. From fresh washed and blow dried hair, to flat iron hair with heat protectant. The delivery was also quick. Look no further!</li>
    <li> Very expensive for the price I paid. I would order again!</li>
    <li> Its okay. I liked it at first, but my hair won&#x27;t stay straight. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, definately made cheaply</li>
    <li> This iron had great reviews so I purchased it. Wrong. Plates appeared cracked and it made a ticking noise when on. Sent it back</li>
    <li> Great product so far!! Surprised by how long &amp; thick the cord is! The hair clips are a plus, along with the lock feature.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Great Iron. Straightens well and very fast. Cord is also nice and doesn&#x27;t tangle up easily. Highly Reccomend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this iron! It is so light smooth and the titanium plates are great, absolutely no snagging!Does not pull hair AND even has a heat adjust. . This flat iron is quick and gives my hair an effortless sheen,makes my hair look as though I just had it done at a salon.it is best of all my flat irons.If you are considering purchasing this iron, do not second guess yourself and simply go through with it.</li>
    <li> For the $ it gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My beautician recommended a titanium flat iron- saying they are better for hair than ceramic ones so I seen this one and I love it- heats up super fast(turns green when ready) - no need to put it on highest setting either- auto shut off- great price</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Heat fast, my hair look good and smooth and is easy to use. The 2 clips is a extra. The lock is very convenient for travel or save space. Really I bought for the review and I don&#x27;t have any complain</li>
    <li> Great value for a straightener! I&#x27;ve had it for about two months now, and I am happy with the product so far. I gave 4 stars because you can tell it is made KINDA cheaply - but that reflects the price to the consumer. I have had NO problems with this product, and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this last week after the Cricket Titanium I purchases last July died.  Purchased based on the reviews.  It&#x27;s doing the job of making my think wavy hair straight but I loved the last one I had better.</li>
    <li> Great Flat Iron. I have wavy coarse Asian hair. Have used the chi and 2 baby bliss. I really like this one better for my hair. does the job in 1 pass!  Smooth, straight hair that stays till the next shampoo. I live in the Deeeep south where the humidity is High.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this. I don&#x27;t even use it I use my old one I have to my Daughter and that&#x27;s the reason I bought another one was to give her her own. It was a waste of money! ;(</li>
    <li> I bought and returned five straight irons at ULTA before finally finding this one. This iron is awesome for my hair. I paid between $50 - $179 for those others and never got the results I wanted. Would highly recommend this iron to anybody.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t seem to get all that hot. Be careful not to burn the cord as I did  the first time i used it. A neat feature is the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; switch that keeps it closed while heating.</li>
    <li> It was the first time that I was purchasing a hair straightener. But I got lucky, I absolutely adore it!This straightener arrived just as described.  It has lock for easy storing, different levels of temperature, 360 degrees turning cor....I have thick, curly，long brown hair I&#x27;m done in just a couple minutes at the lowest heat setting.Not sure how it would work for someone with curlier hair. Does the trick for me, though.</li>
    <li> My hair is silky smooth and my first day back in the school after using someone said your hair looks longer and really straight. It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair and I do see an increase in shine when using it.This is the best flat iron I have ever owned and perfect for my hair type.  I use it every week and it gets the job done. I&#x27;d still recommend it for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron it slides through your hair effortlessly and it keeps it straight for hours on end . if your on the fence about buying it don&#x27;t be because this is a great straightener for a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> This was very inexpensive and i love it ! t glides very easy throughout my African American hair. And leaves it soft and silky with body.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like it. The titaniums put off a weird smell when hot though. It does get my course, naturally curly hair fairly sleek. It&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations! My hair is so shiny after my use. I definitely believe this iron is worth more than $20 something dollars and this is a great deal , for a good iron .Besides the iron, it came with two clips for parting the hair. Shipping was prompt and the merchandise is perfect. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short curly hair. This iron easily flattens my hair in 5-10 minutes. Best used on dry hair when short.</li>
    <li> I wanted a titanium hair straightener. Most run in between $90 and $200- so when I came across this one for under $40, I was skeptical. It had great reviews &amp; even though they all sounded alike- decided to chance it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. It heats up, fast- it straightens my hair, fast- has an automatic, shut-off and the device itself, can lock. It&#x27;s a good, sturdy straightener &amp; am very happy with it. In case you&#x27;re wondering (because you&#x27;re savvy &amp; googled it (like me))- this DOES have an American plug on it- if you&#x27;re traveling abroad, you&#x27;ll need an adapter.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I have thick curly hair so my hot-iron must have a high heat to truly straighten but still protect my hair from over burn. This one does both! And the &amp;#34;anti-static&amp;#34; feature is an added bonus. It leaves my hair shiny and straight that lasts until my next wash! This is my best hot-iron find by far!</li>
    <li> great daily contribution with fantastic looks!</li>
    <li> The great flat iron I have ever had. I highly recommend it.</li>
