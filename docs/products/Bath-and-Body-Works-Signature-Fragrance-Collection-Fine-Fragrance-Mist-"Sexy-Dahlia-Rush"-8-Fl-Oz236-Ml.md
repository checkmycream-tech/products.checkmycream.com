    <li> What an addictive and alluring scent! I fell in love with this fragrance after testing MANY others in a Bath &amp; Body Works shop, and after consuming the small bottle I bought there, knew I wanted more. What a lovely discovery, finding such a great deal on a much larger size on Amazon!

    <li> I Love it!!! I want more! I wish that bath &amp; body works would sell it again... but i think the pricing is a little too high for the spray and lotion.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this spray &amp; of course it was only in the stores for a short period of time. So I got lucky &amp; find it at Amazon &amp; ordered her some up for Christmas.</li>
