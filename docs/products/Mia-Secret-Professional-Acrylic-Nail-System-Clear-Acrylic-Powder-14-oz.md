### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>does a wonderful job.</li>
      <li>Product was great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the item</li>
      <li>LOVED IT.</li>
      <li>but once you file, shape and put clear polish on the nail, it looks good :D</li>
      <li>I recommend this to everyone this the best acrylic powder I tried so far</li>
      <li>(better off buying elsewhere, in my opinion.)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
      <li>LOVE this acrylic.</li>
      <li>Make sure you pay attention to how many ounces a product is because I didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Although it takes a bit time to dry &amp; am very happy with it because it gives me the option of perfection.  </li>
      <li>Lol shipping was fast and at a decent price.</li>
      <li>I ordered the small one and it worked great!</li>
      <li>the bottle is small but it&#x27;s great doesn&#x27;t clump up if you know what your doing it goes on smoothe</li>
      <li>Still a good product, just a little overpriced.</li>
      <li>works ok, one ounce is a lot smaller than I thought it would be though.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s smooth as long as you apply it correctly.</li>
      <li>and this is literally enough to do one full set.</li>
      <li>i consider this a total rip off, the information that was shown was NOT clear on the size of the jar, the product itself however isn&#x27;t any better than the Kiss kit powder</li>
      <li>Only available acrylic I could find on amazon (purchased for my sister) not indicative of the actual price per quantity.</li>
      <li>Does tend to lift around the edges near time to redo.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues so far</li>
</ol>

<li> Even though the jar is 1/4oz, it will last me for a long while!</li>
<li> Was a lot smaller than expected but arrived on time.</li>
<li> i paid $6 for this tiny little jar, if you have ever bought the &#x27;acrylic kit&#x27; from Walmart or etc</li>
<li> then I expected.</li>
<li> At first i was skeptical because in the past i had a bad experience with inexpensive acrylic (Ez Flow), but the reviews for the full sized jar of this acrylic looked promising (even though there wasn&#x27;t a lot of reviews.)</li>
<li> &amp; since this jar was only $4.95  I figured i would take the risk &amp; buy the small jar first before i decided if i wanted to buy the big jar or not (Because i would of hated to of bought the big jar in the beginning, then end up hating it.)</li>

    <li> The product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It does a wonderful job. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues so far</li>
    <li> Was a lot smaller than expected but arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it was allot smaller then I expected. I guess I should of figured the weight and the price.</li>
    <li> LOVE this acrylic. At first i was skeptical because in the past i had a bad experience with inexpensive acrylic (Ez Flow), but the reviews for the full sized jar of this acrylic looked promising (even though there wasn&#x27;t a lot of reviews.) &amp; since this jar was only $4.95  I figured i would take the risk &amp; buy the small jar first before i decided if i wanted to buy the big jar or not (Because i would of hated to of bought the big jar in the beginning, then end up hating it.) So i bought this one just to test out. LOVED IT. Does go on cloudy and dries cloudy but once you file, shape and put clear polish on the nail, it looks good :D Even though the jar is 1/4oz, it will last me for a long while! In the future i will certainly be purchasing the bigger jar, &amp; some little jars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the item</li>
    <li> Although it takes a bit time to dry &amp; am very happy with it because it gives me the option of perfection.  Thank you &amp; I will soon order the bigger jar.</li>
    <li> Make sure you pay attention to how many ounces a product is because I didn&#x27;t and this is literally enough to do one full set.</li>
    <li> i paid $6 for this tiny little jar, if you have ever bought the &#x27;acrylic kit&#x27; from Walmart or etc this jar is literally the size of the jar in that package, considering i paid $6 for this jar by itself and the kit cost approx $7-$8 and comes with liquid nail tips a file and a brush i consider this a total rip off, the information that was shown was NOT clear on the size of the jar, the product itself however isn&#x27;t any better than the Kiss kit powder</li>
    <li> Product was great. Wish I had gotten the larger size. Lol shipping was fast and at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I ordered the small one and it worked great! I&#x27;m going to get the larger size. It doesn&#x27;t clunk up or anything like that and it&#x27;s smooth as long as you apply it correctly. It isn&#x27;t runny either.</li>
