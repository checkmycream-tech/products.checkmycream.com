### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Thank you for this perfect cleanser Garnier !</li>
      <li>but I happen to think this is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Which is best since I use acne face washs,toners and the L&#x27;Oreal Texture Prefector that all have salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>It smells great too!</li>
      <li>Excellent,, this product is superb..</li>
      <li>The best face cleanser I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Great cleanser for combo skin, Not greasy films after washing and great value!</li>
      <li>It does a great job removing dirt and make up.  </li>

      <li>skin nice and bright!</li>

      <li>but there&#x27;s nothing exceptional about it.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Despite that, it cleans very good, and I have a fresh feeling afterwards</li>
      <li>I feel that it kind of dries my skin out.</li>
      <li>If it has more hydration, that would be good.</li>

      <li>I HAVE BOUGHT SO MANY BY RECOMENDATION AND BEEN DISAPOINTED.</li>

      <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>

      <li>I notice my face gets radiant and bright looking,it does renew the skin by that it makes your first layer of skin peel away.</li>
      <li>Has a nice fresh clean scent.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
      <li>3-Way.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier products are a fine product.</li>
      <li>It feels  really smooth when you rub it in your hands.  </li>
      <li>very clean gel unlike soap, rinses off with a fresh feel.</li>
      <li>But for clean, yes.</li>
      <li>After washing with it, I did not feel any special.</li>
      <li>The cleaning gelee is ok and gentle.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really cool...</li>
      <li>This product is by far my favorite face wash.  </li>
      <li>After using this cleanser, my face feels fresh</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling fresh, not overdried.</li>
      <li>My skin feels silky and fresh.</li>
      <li>,I love how this cleanser feels like a pillowy soft gel when you move it around your face.</li>
      <li>, so far it&#x27;s a winning combination, my laugh lines are still here, what can I say I laugh a lot</li>
      <li>I use many of the other Garnier products and love them.</li>
      <li>Right now my routine is the 2 in 1 serum in the mornings and at night I use Lancome&#x27;s Genifique serum and then the Garnier night cream</li>
      <li>The price is right too.</li>
      <li>VERY MUCH.</li>
      <li>Gives a soft clean effect and for the price it is worth it, so don&#x27;t  hesitate to buy it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>Pretty soon, I&#x27;m going to be washing my face with rust.  </li>
      <li>It does work pretty well</li>
      <li>This is my favorite facial cleanser</li>
      <li>- really, products that we wash our faces and bodies with do not have enough time on the skin to warrant these claims, but, over all it&#x27;s a nice cleanser, particularly for warmer months</li>
      <li>It is very thick but it lathers wonderfully leaving a soft skin.</li>
      <li>I like the scent and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh, and the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; lathers up well enough  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m paying attention to my newly acquired laugh lines, so</li>
      <li>It foams up easily and cleanses deeply while taking off all of my make up in seconds.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>No matter how much make up</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and this product worked really well addressing my issues.</li>
      <li>The Garnier goes on smoother and emulsifies far more quickly, but the lather isn&#x27;t so heavy that it takes you longer to rinse it off.  </li>
      <li>, it leaves my face clean and make-up free without it being squeaky clean or leaving a film behind.  </li>
      <li>it also offers a very soothing lather WITHOUT over-DRYING MY SKIN!</li>
      <li>I THOUGHT WITH THE OLDER</li>
      <li>and I have a nice glow to my usually dull</li>
      <li>I AM A COMBO NORMAL TO OILY SKIN.</li>
      <li>i love how it kinda exfoliates my skin too,while also getting rid of all the dead skin cells and stuff.</li>
      <li>The bottle is bigger than most, it will last a long time.</li>
      <li>It definitely makes my skin feel clean, but without feeling dry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing it is completely removed in one wash,, not to mention my skin looks radiant</li>
      <li>i really like this facial soap</li>
      <li>far as for &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>So far as the radiance claim goes, I&#x27;m not so convinced.  </li>
      <li>and then it was just natural for me to try the renewing cleanser</li>
      <li>Will avoid purchasing facial products with Sodium Laureth Sulfate (read: shampoo) as one of first ingredients in the future.</li>
      <li>FEELING CLEAN AND NOT DRY AND TIGHT.</li>
      <li>I tell people I&#x27;m allergic to sugar because sugar added to my coffee or baked in anthing or candy of any kind gives me pimples and after they&#x27;re gone I&#x27;m left with the dark spot, out comes the Ambi fading cream and that makes a difference nevertheless a dark spot remains, needless to say I had MANY spots!  </li>
      <li>I see a trip to the container store in my future, to get a new pump bottle.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is so silky and gentle and would not leave your skin dry.</li>
      <li>; that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry, and as well, is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my slightly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I keep it on a shelf where it doesn&#x27;t get direct water, but last week I noticed some brown gunk on the pump neck and inside the bottle.</li>
      <li>The cleansing is good, but the texture feels weird and it left a residue that requires extra rinsing off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for some time. When I couldn&#x27;t find it locally I ordered it online and it arrived promptly. I like the scent and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many years  still love it</li>
    <li> I tell people I&#x27;m allergic to sugar because sugar added to my coffee or baked in anthing or candy of any kind gives me pimples and after they&#x27;re gone I&#x27;m left with the dark spot, out comes the Ambi fading cream and that makes a difference nevertheless a dark spot remains, needless to say I had MANY spots!  Then I turned 40 so I&#x27;m paying attention to my newly acquired laugh lines, so I&#x27;ve been really testing out different products and giving them at least 3 months to see if they make any difference in my skin in the spots and the wrinkles.  I tried the Olay Regenerist line (the night cream is good), I tried Roc, I tried Kiehl&#x27;s and Lancome&#x27;s Genifique and they were all meh! Finally I tried the Garnier 2 in 1 Wrinkle Reducer and after about a month my Mother (who never pays anyone a compliment) asked me what was I doing to my face and whatever I was doing to keep it up, after I finished blubbering from the shock of the compliment I told her about the product and then it was just natural for me to try the renewing cleanser, it leaves my face clean and make-up free without it being squeaky clean or leaving a film behind.  Right now my routine is the 2 in 1 serum in the mornings and at night I use Lancome&#x27;s Genifique serum and then the Garnier night cream, so far it&#x27;s a winning combination, my laugh lines are still here, what can I say I laugh a lot but my skin is clear and glowing and seriously foundation is now an option for me and of course no sugar!</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a very nice, clean, mild, citrusy smell. It is very thick but it lathers wonderfully leaving a soft skin. The bottle is bigger than most, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin feels silky and fresh.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is wonderful.  It&#x27;s not in stores(at least not that I found)  Makes you face sort of glow, cleans but doesn&#x27;t strip</li>
    <li> I AM A COMBO NORMAL TO OILY SKIN. I THOUGHT WITH THE OLDER I GOT THE LESS OILY I WOULD BE, NOT THE CASE. I LIKE THIS CLEANSER VERY MUCH. I THINK IT IS HELPING WITH THE PORES AND IT LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING CLEAN AND NOT DRY AND TIGHT. I HAVE BOUGHT SO MANY BY RECOMENDATION AND BEEN DISAPOINTED. I READ ABOUT THIS ONE ON LINE AS WELL AND WILL BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> The cleaning gelee is ok and gentle. After washing with it, I did not feel any special. If it has more hydration, that would be good.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews. I was not happy at all. It dried my face terribly. I gave it to my daughter who has acne and oily skin because she&#x27;s always looking for something to dry up the oil.</li>
    <li> I like it but there&#x27;s nothing exceptional about it.  It is a deep cleaning cleanser and removes all my makeup thoroughly.  It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves skin a tad on the dry side but I immediately add my serums and moisturizer and it&#x27;s just fine.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements on my skin and been using it for a couple weeks.  I use many of the other Garnier products and love them.</li>
    <li> I feel that it kind of dries my skin out. It feels a little too tight considering that I have a naturally oily skin. I don&#x27;t like that. Despite that, it cleans very good, and I have a fresh feeling afterwards</li>
    <li> This cleanser is the bomb. It cleans my face well and it does not leave it terribly dry. Smells great. The price is right too.</li>
    <li> I keep this &amp;#34;on stock&amp;#34; at my house. My favorite face wash.  Prevents breakputs, but not drying . Great price too.</li>
    <li> Freshens skin, does not cause irriation but does leave it feeling tight.  Will avoid purchasing facial products with Sodium Laureth Sulfate (read: shampoo) as one of first ingredients in the future.</li>
    <li> The price is great, but the product itself ...not so much.  The smell is fresh and pleasant.  The cleansing is good, but the texture feels weird and it left a residue that requires extra rinsing off.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser it works wonders and leaves my face nice and refreshed!</li>
    <li> Excellent,, this product is superb.. No matter how much make up I&#x27;m wearing it is completely removed in one wash,, not to mention my skin looks radiant</li>
    <li> This stuff is really cool... i love how it kinda exfoliates my skin too,while also getting rid of all the dead skin cells and stuff. it also offers a very soothing lather WITHOUT over-DRYING MY SKIN! Ahh! im in love. Thank you for this perfect cleanser Garnier ! 6/5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cleanser!!  I have normal skin and wear makeup almost everyday, so I use this daily.  It removes all makeup, even waterproof eyeliner, in one go - I tested with a makeup remover wipe afterwards - and never leaves my skin feeling tight or dry.  I use it in conjunction with the Skin Renew products and have actually seen an improvement of dark spots on my skin.</li>
    <li> age: 57&lt;br /&gt;skin: combination, slightly sensitive, with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice light cleansing &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry, and as well, is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my slightly sensitive skin. The scent is light and fresh, and the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; lathers up well enough  - I use it with my clarisonic if I want a bit of extra deep cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as for &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; - really, products that we wash our faces and bodies with do not have enough time on the skin to warrant these claims, but, over all it&#x27;s a nice cleanser, particularly for warmer months or when I am sweaty from a workout, as it is slightly &amp;#34;astringent&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I got mine from Walgreens and I have bad achne and it clears up in a week!!!</li>
    <li> i really like this facial soap</li>
    <li> This this product for washing my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I can never find it in stores</li>
    <li> The best face cleanser I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for combo skin, Not greasy films after washing and great value!</li>
    <li> The Gelee is excellent in itself, but would be a five star in combination with the Ultimate Cleanser 3-Way.&lt;br /&gt;Garnier products are a fine product.</li>
    <li> This actually makes my skin look brighter. I&#x27;ve been using for about a year and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product is by far my favorite face wash.  It foams up easily and cleanses deeply while taking off all of my make up in seconds.  The make up I wear daily is waterproof and I used to spend triple the amount of time to scrub mascara and eyebrow pencil off my face. After using this cleanser, my face feels fresh and I have a nice glow to my usually dull skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product hasn&#x27;t been sold in my local Ulta, Target, or Walmart, in months so I was thrilled to find it on amazon with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen several complaints about this product being difficult to wash off but I have never had an issue.  Every time I was my face I only use a small pump about the size of one or two peas because it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Has fresh scent and good cleansing effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this helps reducing sebum and preventing low/mild acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it less harsh than other acne products which have 2% salicylic acid.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling fresh, not overdried.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon I bought this at Walmart.It does work pretty well,I love how this cleanser feels like a pillowy soft gel when you move it around your face.I use it with a facial complexion brush as a daily exfoliating routine but it works well by itself too.But my favorite thing about this gel cleanser is it works.I notice my face gets radiant and bright looking,it does renew the skin by that it makes your first layer of skin peel away.Which is best since I use acne face washs,toners and the L&#x27;Oreal Texture Prefector that all have salicylic acid.So I&#x27;m use to peeling anyway.I would recommend it to anyone who has dull lifeless looking skin or dealing with acne.I would definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It does a great job removing dirt and make up.  Has a nice fresh clean scent.  I have bought this over&lt;br /&gt;and over and will do so again.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is so silky and gentle and would not leave your skin dry. Gives a soft clean effect and for the price it is worth it, so don&#x27;t  hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> It does what it promises.  My skin is glowing and youthful looking.  I loved it so much I bought 2 more bottles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 6 weeks, alternating it with Olay Regenerist cleanser and Boots No 7 age-defense balm.  The Garnier goes on smoother and emulsifies far more quickly, but the lather isn&#x27;t so heavy that it takes you longer to rinse it off.  It definitely makes my skin feel clean, but without feeling dry.  So far as the radiance claim goes, I&#x27;m not so convinced.  But for clean, yes.</li>
    <li> The facewash works well enough, although I don&#x27;t feel a drastic improvement in my skin. But I&#x27;m guessing this bottle wasn&#x27;t meant to be kept in the shower. I keep it on a shelf where it doesn&#x27;t get direct water, but last week I noticed some brown gunk on the pump neck and inside the bottle. I opened it up to see what was going on - It turns out the spring that they used for the pump is RUSTING. So the rust forms inside the bottle, and leaks down into the product! Pretty soon, I&#x27;m going to be washing my face with rust.  I see a trip to the container store in my future, to get a new pump bottle. What a mess!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this facial cleanser. It seems Amazon is the only place you can purchase it to my knowledge. It has been taken off the shelves in the stores and they changed it drastically. But this item removes makeup and is so nice on your skin. Why Garnier doesn&#x27;t know that is unfortunate. It smells great too! Everyone is different, of course, not eveyone who uses this is going to agree...but I happen to think this is a wonderful product. At least give it a try, but if you like it don&#x27;t look on the shelves for it, go to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my face and i combine the use of this with my cereve face wash. NOTHING else works so when the local stores took this off the shelves I was devastated. Thank Goodness I found it on trusty amazon</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this product worked really well addressing my issues. It didn&#x27;t over dry me and it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily. I got lots of compliments on my skin after only a few weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I have very oily skin and when I use this stuff my skin gets much less greasy than when I have tried other cleansers.  It feels  really smooth when you rub it in your hands.  It doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of all moisture like some face washes can.  I have noticed I have less breakouts when I use this.</li>
    <li> best facial wash ever. very clean gel unlike soap, rinses off with a fresh feel. never drying,&lt;br /&gt;leaves skin nice and bright! I wish they didn&#x27;t take this off the market just to put newer products&lt;br /&gt;out. that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
