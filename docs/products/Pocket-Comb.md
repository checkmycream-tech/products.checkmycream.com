### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great job, Fromm Intl !....</li>
      <li>This comb is excellent.</li>
      <li>This is a great comb.</li>
      <li>Works great for beards and mustaches, too.</li>
      <li>This is a great comb.  </li>
      <li>but he was so happy to get them and remarks on them when he pulls it out of his pocket unbroken.</li>
      <li>Good times.</li>
      <li>Good by ACE</li>
      <li>LOOKS GOOD,</li>
      <li>Good comb.</li>
      <li>The teeth are nicely rounded on the ends and won&#x27;t dig into the scalp.</li>
      <li>It is perfect and feels very sturdy.</li>
      <li>The Clipper-mate Pocket Comb is superior because the teeth ends are well rounded and easy on the scalp.</li>
      <li>I remember that it had rounded teeth and was very comfortable on the scalp.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if they made a combo comb with the fine and medium teeth.</li>
      <li>He loves his comb and was so pleased to get it.</li>
      <li>I would buy it again, but only because it&#x27;s better than the others, not because I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>I love this comb.</li>
      <li>It is too cheap to order on its own</li>
      <li>I bought 5 more.</li>
      <li>The price is way better too: 89 cents for one, not $4.</li>
      <li>Comb ok, but overpriced.</li>
      <li>glad I bought another as a matter of fact</li>
      <li>Mine have lasted 10 years or more.</li>
      <li>Make sure you measure 5&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Much better than the ones Ace sells.</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s better than the others I&#x27;ve tried with fine teeth, which are so flimsy</li>
      <li>I needed a comb that has all fine teeth and won&#x27;t break.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been having luck finding fine tooth pocket combs, so I ordered this one.</li>
      <li>I ordered three of these combs because they were advertised as \\&quot;All Fine Teeth.\\&quot; They aren&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Grandmother wanted a fine toothed comb.</li>
      <li>I Googled up this company and ordered what I hope to be a lifetime supply of 5\\&quot; all fine tooth combs.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t look pretty and doesn&#x27;t come in any fancy packaging, but it fits in the back pocket of a pair of Levi&#x27;s perfectly.</li>
      <li>Said it works fine.</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>you sold us out for the cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>It was quite cheap</li>
      <li>This seems to fit that request.</li>
      <li>but I would have been better off purchasing higher quality comb elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I had to insist on a full refund, which they graciously gave me AFTER I returned the combs.</li>
      <li>They still seem to be of better quality than the new Ace pocket combs made in China though.</li>
      <li>Both have that nice  strong rubbery feel to them with the ACE slightly more dull teeth(but</li>
      <li>But they are worth it.</li>
      <li>other reviewers have noted, it goes against the grain to buy an item where the shipping is more than the price of what you&#x27;re buying, but I wasn&#x27;t able to find these combs in any store, so I bit the bullet and paid.</li>
      <li>The price was too high for the Clipper-mate Pocket Comb 5\\&quot; All Fine Teeth.</li>
      <li>Most of the combs I was able to find in stores had the traditional fine and coarse sections</li>
      <li>Works as intended what more can you ask for also very sturdy and seems to hold up so far have had it for almost a year now.</li>
      <li>is the first time I have found anything like it in fifty years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>only complaint I have with this is that is creates static and makes my hair stand up lol</li>
      <li>Ok enough.</li>
      <li>So I went to Amazon and googled unbreakable comb and sure enough they had some.</li>
      <li>; first before ordering so you know what you will be getting.</li>
      <li>I bought several of these combs in one purchase, after using ACE pocket combs for many years.</li>
      <li>The quality, size and all teeth being \\&quot;fine\\&quot; is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
      <li>But I got this one and the first run across my head hurt like hell.</li>
      <li>Has lasted years in my pocket while most &#x27;unbreakable&#x27; combs break in short order.</li>
      <li>It is fine for spreading pomade or paste through the hair due to the fine teeth, but care must be taken to avoid contact with scalp.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty nice little comb, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it unbreakable.  </li>
      <li>but I prefer only fine teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I have had it for two months in my pocket, styling it with pomade constantly and not cleaning it, and it is still flexible and truly worthy of the Unbreakable claim other combs flaunt, but shouldn&#x27;t; just as good as the old Clipper-Mates before they &amp;#34;sold out&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Small, compact for the pocket, easy of the scalp, all fine teeth comb with UNBREAKABLE written on it.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I found some Ace combs at my local Vons</li>
      <li>detailed and specific.</li>
      <li>then again, I will be using this for a while as it is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s nothing else to really complain about.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to break it yet, so it&#x27;s living up to the claims of not being able to be broken.</li>
      <li>These are narrow and a bit longer then I had hoped to have, but they will do nicely.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied and, if you are as hard to please as I am, you will be also.</li>
      <li>I have paid less for less and more for an ok product, but this one is \\&quot;just right\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I will be buying a half a dozen more.</li>
      <li>You would do much more business if you were less greedy in overcharging shipping.</li>
      <li>Its good, does not break (at least it has not thus far after about six months).  </li>
      <li>This comb is just what I wanted, while the shipping cost was high I could not get this comb anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>I would highly reccomend this company.</li>
      <li>Well made and simple - the old-school Unbreakable comb - not at all flimsy or rubbery - exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>It is advertised as unbreakable and in my opinion there is no way this would ever break under normal use.</li>
      <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive price, good quality, but &#x27;standard&#x27; shipping rate makes it not-so-inexpensive in small quantities.</li>
      <li>you want a comb that will last until you lose it -- and prefer only fine teeth -- this is what you want.</li>
      <li>I needed a comb that had only fine teeth and finally came upon this one.</li>
      <li>I have been dissuaded many times from buying something because of the excessive shipping charges.</li>
      <li>You have to figure out a better and less expensive way, and your probablility for more business will increase significantly in many other items.</li>
      <li>The main reason i do not like this comb is because it is not gentle on the scalp like many other combs being manufactured these days.</li>
      <li>The only way I could get them locally in America&#x27;s largest retail store was to buy a huge bag of assorted combs with only one like I wanted.</li>
      <li>Shipping expensive, buy lots, good presents.</li>
      <li>I had one of these combs for years without ever realizing how significant that little word \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; on the spine is.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to use and very durable; no problems so far with broken teeth</li>
      <li>Comb teeth are pretty sharp too.  </li>
      <li>The teeth on it are sharp and scratch the head, which causes dandruff btw, and it is nothing like the classic ones made back in the day (is anything, really?).</li>
      <li>It is a crying shame that a customer even has to resort to the internet to buy such a simple item as an \\&quot;all fine tooth comb\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Then they offered me a \\&quot;reasonable partial refund.</li>
      <li>Wish someone would bring back the old durable combs.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t blame them for a product that is better then some but not great.</li>
      <li>They are half fine teeth and half not-fine teeth.</li>
      <li>Not as bad as some but not as good as the the old rubber mixed type.</li>
      <li>I have very thick and fine hair.</li>
      <li>However, I found another little black comb purely by accident at my local Sally Beauty Supply shop by a company called &amp;#34;Mebco&amp;#34; that is much better quality: thick, rounded teeth that glide through the hair without pulling and scratching and</li>
      <li>It is too much trouble to return the comb, but I certainly would not buy it again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These combs work and do not break ever.  I have bought other types and that is not the case. Ok enough.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for several years for this comb with no luck. I have one but wanted another for a spare if needed. This comb is just what I wanted, while the shipping cost was high I could not get this comb anywhere else.  glad I bought another as a matter of fact I bought 5 more.</li>
    <li> Teeth were sharp on my scalp, sandpaper made it work well                                           staiju</li>
    <li> The quality, size and all teeth being \\&quot;fine\\&quot; is exactly what I have been looking for. I have paid less for less and more for an ok product, but this one is \\&quot;just right\\&quot;. I am very satisfied and, if you are as hard to please as I am, you will be also.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb.  I&#x27;ve tried the ACE ones, but they break in my pocket.  This one doesn&#x27;t, and the teeth don&#x27;t feel sharp like the ACE either.</li>
    <li> Well made and simple - the old-school Unbreakable comb - not at all flimsy or rubbery - exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been having luck finding fine tooth pocket combs, so I ordered this one. It&#x27;s like a hard rubber comb; nothing like the stronger plastic ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. Fortunately, I found some Ace combs at my local Vons so I stocked up on some of those. This one&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> If you keep your comb in your pocket like me, this is the only comb that won&#x27;t break. Mine have lasted 10 years or more. I only have had to replace them when I have lost them. They are so tough they are almost impossible to break. Forget Ace or other combs as they will break in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These combs have become really hard to find anywhere, in stores or online, probably because they are a little more expensive. But they are worth it. Stock up in case this vendor stops carrying them too.</li>
    <li> Works as intended what more can you ask for also very sturdy and seems to hold up so far have had it for almost a year now.</li>
    <li> I had one of these combs for years without ever realizing how significant that little word \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; on the spine is. When I lost mine I tried a wide variety of other \\&quot;break resistant\\&quot; combs but they all snapped or lost teeth within a month or two. Most of the combs I was able to find in stores had the traditional fine and coarse sections but I prefer only fine teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, it goes against the grain to buy an item where the shipping is more than the price of what you&#x27;re buying, but I wasn&#x27;t able to find these combs in any store, so I bit the bullet and paid. Now I feel that in some small way my world has gone back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a comb that will last until you lose it -- and prefer only fine teeth -- this is what you want.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and fine hair. I needed a comb that had only fine teeth and finally came upon this one. It is perfect and feels very sturdy. It is advertised as unbreakable and in my opinion there is no way this would ever break under normal use. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb because it is advertised as UNBREAKABLE.  I have had it for about a month, and so far it hasn&#x27;t broken.  Previous combs would break in my hip pocket when I sit on them.  If this performance continues, I&#x27;ll give it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a basic comb. I haven&#x27;t been able to break it yet, so it&#x27;s living up to the claims of not being able to be broken. I use it to comb my hair!</li>
    <li> LOOKS GOOD, MADE WELL AND LOOKS LIKE IT WILL LAST AWHILE.  CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SEE HOW IT HOLDS UP .IT FITS MY POCKET WELL.</li>
    <li> Its good, does not break (at least it has not thus far after about six months).  It would be nice if they made a combo comb with the fine and medium teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the same time I bought a Kent comb, both as stocking stuffers for my husband. This doesn&#x27;t look pretty and doesn&#x27;t come in any fancy packaging, but it fits in the back pocket of a pair of Levi&#x27;s perfectly. The Kent combs are either too small for my husband&#x27;s hands or too long for a back pocket. It does seem to be sturdier than the Conair and Revlon combs that keep breaking in his pocket and will save me money in the long run, as long as he doesn&#x27;t lose it.</li>
    <li> It is a crying shame that a customer even has to resort to the internet to buy such a simple item as an \\&quot;all fine tooth comb\\&quot;. The only way I could get them locally in America&#x27;s largest retail store was to buy a huge bag of assorted combs with only one like I wanted. &lt;br /&gt; I Googled up this company and ordered what I hope to be a lifetime supply of 5\\&quot; all fine tooth combs. The product is just what I wanted and order was shipped promptly. I would highly reccomend this company.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive price, good quality, but &#x27;standard&#x27; shipping rate makes it not-so-inexpensive in small quantities.</li>
    <li> I have used this comb for several weeks. I like and keep it in its white sheath so that it has now virtually no chance of being hooked by my keys and lost as a result, which is what happened with a couple of earlier combs. It is comfortable to use and very durable; no problems so far with broken teeth and I don&#x27;t anticipate this happening.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I ordered these at the same time as a few of the Kent combs.  There&#x27;s no comparison in quality.  They still seem to be of better quality than the new Ace pocket combs made in China though.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic. Not as bad as some but not as good as the the old rubber mixed type. Teeth have broken for being in my back pocket behind my wallet. Wish someone would bring back the old durable combs. The company did meet five stars on delivery.  Can&#x27;t blame them for a product that is better then some but not great.</li>
    <li> My husband was constantly breaking his comb. So I went to Amazon and googled unbreakable comb and sure enough they had some. They are indeed unbreakable to date. He loves his comb and was so pleased to get it. He tried to buy it in local stores but could never find one. I think this is a man thing. I don&#x27;t want one but he was so happy to get them and remarks on them when he pulls it out of his pocket unbroken. Oh only problem is you can&#x27;t order the comb without some other products. It is too cheap to order on its own so when you have some things you are buying from Amazon, just add the comb.</li>
    <li> All combs placed in your back pocket that the guys use will break someday. This one doesn&#x27;t break and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> Yeah, this is the little guy that started it all, the classic. Make no exceptions. Works like a Comb. Comb while you work. Brando had one. Elvis had one. Kojak wanted one. Works well in grease, or in dandruff. I use it as a toothpick also.</li>
    <li> The Clipper-mate Pocket Comb is superior because the teeth ends are well rounded and easy on the scalp.</li>
    <li> This comb is very small.  Make sure you measure 5&amp;#34; first before ordering so you know what you will be getting.</li>
    <li> I mean, for the price it is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have with this is that is creates static and makes my hair stand up lol&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s my hair. I have somewhat dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing else to really complain about.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a comb!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy something not plasticky in the future though..&lt;br /&gt;But then again, I will be using this for a while as it is very sturdy.</li>
    <li> The main reason i do not like this comb is because it is not gentle on the scalp like many other combs being manufactured these days. It is fine for spreading pomade or paste through the hair due to the fine teeth, but care must be taken to avoid contact with scalp. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it even if it is unbreakable.</li>
    <li> The price was too high for the Clipper-mate Pocket Comb 5\\&quot; All Fine Teeth. My husband combed his hair with this comb and thought it was an inferior product.  It is too much trouble to return the comb, but I certainly would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This comb has very sharp teeth due to its low quality. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all. The seem from the plastic that goes around is what gives the comb this characteristic. It was quite cheap but I would have been better off purchasing higher quality comb elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The only problem is the very ridiculous shipping and handling costs... You would do much more business if you were less greedy in overcharging shipping. You have to figure out a better and less expensive way, and your probablility for more business will increase significantly in many other items. I have been dissuaded many times from buying something because of the excessive shipping charges.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these combs in one purchase, after using ACE pocket combs for many years. The ACE combs seemed to get worse each time I bought a new one, with teeth breaking shortly into their life. These combs have no such problem. Haven&#x27;t broken a tooth yet - the only reason I&#x27;ve had to use a new one is because I lost the one I was using!</li>
    <li> Totally tired of the plastic or hard rubber junk available locally.  This one seems indestructible (and I&#x27;m an expert at that skill !)&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest -- if the chemistry is possible -- that you make these combs in various colors.  BLACK is very difficult to find if one misplaces it.  Other than that... great job, Fromm Intl !....</li>
    <li> I ordered three of these combs because they were advertised as \\&quot;All Fine Teeth.\\&quot; They aren&#x27;t. They are half fine teeth and half not-fine teeth. When I contacted the seller, so-called \\&quot;BeatBargains,\\&quot; I got the ridiculous excuse that \\&quot;other sellers in amazon have and can change the item listing info... Unfortunetly we dont carry the item you specificly want so that puts us in a bad situation.\\&quot; (Spelling errors replicated as received.) Then they offered me a \\&quot;reasonable partial refund. I can do this to show you how sorry we are.\\&quot; Uh huh. I had to insist on a full refund, which they graciously gave me AFTER I returned the combs.</li>
    <li> Just bought a half dozen of these combs at Walgreens for 59 cents each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?&lt;br /&gt;Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.</li>
    <li> I needed a comb that has all fine teeth and won&#x27;t break. This seems to fit that request. These are not available at the big box stores.</li>
    <li> Small, compact for the pocket, easy of the scalp, all fine teeth comb with UNBREAKABLE written on it. I will be buying a half a dozen more. Just slightly longer than the old Ace hard rubber, and slightly slimmer. Both have that nice  strong rubbery feel to them with the ACE slightly more dull teeth(but that might be caused by using it for 10 years!) The spines are about equally as stiff and strong.&lt;br /&gt;  Why oh why did ACE give up on their terrific combs for those hard plastic, sharp, uncomfortable combs?&lt;br /&gt;  For now, this is the one to buy. Shipping expensive, buy lots, good presents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adequate, but not more. :-(  OTOH, some other similar combs just break or cut my scalp!</li>
    <li> This comb is excellent. Much better than the ones Ace sells.</li>
    <li> Like the idea that it&#x27;s unbreakable (I hope), but the teeth are too sharp.</li>
    <li> Yeah, this is the little guy that started it all, the classic. Make no exceptions. Works like a Comb. Comb while you work.  Brando had one.  Elvis had one.  Kojak wanted one.  Works well in grease, or in dandruff.  I use it as a toothpick also.</li>
    <li> I had a nylon comb when I was a youth.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have found anything like it in fifty years.&lt;br /&gt;I bought fifteen of them to compensate for all I may lose during what is left of my life.</li>
    <li> Lasted longer than the $0.99 Ace combs, BUT NOT UNBREAKABLE. Purchased Feb. 2014, broke Dec. 2014. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb. Not like an ACE that is made of plastic and break in less than a month of carry in the back pocket. This comb is made of hard rubber like the ACE combs of the past and from now on I will only buy this brand. Good by ACE you sold us out for the cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> Works great for beards and mustaches, too. I love this comb.</li>
    <li> I bought this Clipper-Mate comb because I had one when I was younger that lasted years. I remember that it had rounded teeth and was very comfortable on the scalp. Good times. But I got this one and the first run across my head hurt like hell. The teeth on it are sharp and scratch the head, which causes dandruff btw, and it is nothing like the classic ones made back in the day (is anything, really?). Incidentally, it also broke within a week which went against the &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34; lettering scrawled on it. I was very upset, to say the least. However, I found another little black comb purely by accident at my local Sally Beauty Supply shop by a company called &amp;#34;Mebco&amp;#34; that is much better quality: thick, rounded teeth that glide through the hair without pulling and scratching and it is tough as nails (I have had it for two months in my pocket, styling it with pomade constantly and not cleaning it, and it is still flexible and truly worthy of the Unbreakable claim other combs flaunt, but shouldn&#x27;t; just as good as the old Clipper-Mates before they &amp;#34;sold out&amp;#34;. The price is way better too: 89 cents for one, not $4. My suggestion: head over to your closest Sally Beauty Supply and get their Mebco pocket comb. In fact, get lots of them and stock up! If you don&#x27;t have a Sally Beauty by you, go on their website and order one from there. Just don&#x27;t buy this Clipper-Mate impostor and be deceived like I was.</li>
    <li> One of the last few truly unbreakable combs made. Has lasted years in my pocket while most &#x27;unbreakable&#x27; combs break in short order. Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> These are narrow and a bit longer then I had hoped to have, but they will do nicely.  The teeth are nicely rounded on the ends and won&#x27;t dig into the scalp.</li>
    <li> Grandmother wanted a fine toothed comb. She likes this one and uses it daily. Said it works fine. Good comb.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice little comb, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it unbreakable.  I regularly break the teeth in my hair, which I find a little aggravating, considering I paid $3 for a pocket-sized COMB.  But, it&#x27;s better than the others I&#x27;ve tried with fine teeth, which are so flimsy it&#x27;s ridiculous.  I would buy it again, but only because it&#x27;s better than the others, not because I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> $5 for one small comb?  Yikes, I should have read the small print - thought I was getting a package of combs.  Comb teeth are pretty sharp too.  I returned this mostly due to unreasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Comb ok, but overpriced.</li>
