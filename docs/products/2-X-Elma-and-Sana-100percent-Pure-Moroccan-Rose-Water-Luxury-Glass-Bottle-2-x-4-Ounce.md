<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The scent is nice and strong, it lasts. My sister bought another rose water, and said mine smells much nicer and is more potent than hers.</li>
    <li> I used this with the ghassoul clay. Excellent product and quality.</li>
    <li> The product bottle arrived with crack on it so the bottle was only 2/3 full.  I found small glasses in the wrapper so I had to find another container to put the rest rose water.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet so no comment on the product itself.</li>
    <li> It smells so nice! But the bottle was smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> The cap was broken on the bottle...</li>
    <li> Love this, it smells great and makes me smell great!  The bottle is cute too.  I will purchase again when I run out!  The price was good.  I hear it is supposed to help prevent blemishes with skin, and I think it has, although I&#x27;m not exactly following any scientific process to test it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love every one of them</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My skin feels smother from using it and I love the way it smells. I use it in conjunction with Vitamin-C serum and it works great.</li>
    <li> Lovely comforting scent</li>
    <li> Arrived shattered. Was unable to use product.</li>
    <li> I fine rose water to be the best product for any skin type, its the perfect astringent and king of all flowers. In put it in a spray bottle and spray it all over my body including into my eyes too.</li>
    <li> The product is great. However, when shipped to me, the lid was cracked in three places and crumbled when taken out of the box. I now have no lid for this product. I am sure the product is great but it is disappointing to see an insufficient amount of bubble wrap used and how damaged the container was.</li>
    <li> Good quality rose water. Arrived promptly, packaged well. The rose scent is lovely, fresh and soft.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Elma and Sana clay mask - it&#x27;s divine!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I mix it with witch hazel and Distilled water and it&#x27;s replaced my pricey Lancôme. The aroma lingers for hours. I&#x27;m ordering more to make gifts for my friends.</li>
    <li> I love rose water and mainly used to use it as a facial toner/moisturizer. This is by far my favorite rose water I&#x27;ve bought, just because it smells genuine and not too in your face. But I do realize now that rose water breaks me out. So I&#x27;ll figure out another use for this.</li>
    <li> This smells HEAVENLY!! I put some on my face with a little Vitamin E oil &amp; my skin is soft &amp; glowing &amp; smells so good!</li>
    <li> I use this as toner for my face. Love the scent and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> 5 stars, great quality product, thank you, the product plus the shipping is very expensive, but the product is great!</li>
    <li> Lovely product. I love it, very refreshing and works great for my skin between washes. I just wish they&#x27;d make BIGGER BOTTLES!! i have to buy like 3-4 of these at a time just to last a month. A little too pricey for the amount you get and the size is pretty inconvenient. I cannot find another pure rose water that is better though</li>
    <li> This rose water is pure enough to use on pink eye and for dry eye. I also use it in beauty products.</li>
    <li> After cleaning my face from makeup..I spritz this Elma and Sana 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water&lt;br /&gt;on my face..Its part of my regimend of taing excellent care of my skin.  Feels fantastic..The rose water fragrance&lt;br /&gt;does not linger long.</li>
    <li> The most amazing rose water. Just the smell alone makes it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> I RAN OUT AND ABOUT CRIED!  I LOVE THIS TONER.  I JUST ORDERED MORE!</li>
    <li> So glad I decided to try this!  It leaves my face very soft and lightly moisturized and prepped for my daily moisturizer/sunscreen.  I can see almost not needing anything in the warmer weather as my skin changes from being very dry in the cold and  very oily in the hot/warm.  I use it twice a day: once in the morning and once at night, after I wash my face and get ready for bed.  Delicate scent - not too much rose which would have been a turn-off.  Really lovely product that has found a new home in my skincare aresenal.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. My first purchase great and the product in tact and was great on my skin. My second experience was much different. The packaging was very secure upon arrival but the bottle was leaking. I am questioning the contents it appears that it could have been opened a filled with something else maybe watered-down on a lower grade. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell,  I use as a hair rinse and astringent. Still haven&#x27;t cooked with it. But I think the aroma would be perfect with strawberries.</li>
    <li> fast shipping works welll</li>
    <li> This is the only rose water that I will ever buy. The bottle is small and never lasts me more than a week, because I use it to remove my makeup everynight. I wish they do away with the cute bottle and actually give more of the product. I HATE THAT THE BOTTLE IS SO TINY!!!!!.for the price you pay. But what can you say.</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles for my Daughter in Law and myself ! Great product !! Thank You</li>
    <li> Love the smell and works great under my makeup and a night.</li>
    <li> Got it for all of the benefits listed and the fact it&#x27;s natural. Love it, a luxury you need. Great quality. Skin feels clean and refreshed. Working wonders.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a toner after I cleanse my face , I only been using it for a week now&lt;br /&gt;... I&#x27;ll update my review in a month</li>
    <li> Really strong smelling. Not like my other organic rose water. This however was much cheaper than my go to brand. I had a allergic reaction to this one which confused me because I been using rosewater for a year and if they are both pure rosewater why was I allergic to this one??? My face got puffy and numb and started to droop.  May be a fluke but I wouldn&#x27;t use it again</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I spritz it on my face morning and night as a toner after cleansing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and my skin has never been clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise: you may breakout for for a few days after you begin use. My sister is a esthetician and assured me that this is just the rosewater working. For the first few days all that dirt and gunk is just bubbling up to the surface and will dissipate soon. She was right!</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells wonderful and moisturizes</li>
    <li> This is the most pure, fresh, rosewater I&#x27;ve used. I have sensitive skin, with redness, dryness and mild rosacea. I use this as a toner after washing my face and after sun exposure. I love the light fresh rose scent. Great product!</li>
    <li> I totally love this morrocon rose water!! I love the smell of roses. I don&#x27;t understand why there r customers that complain about the odor. Its wonderful just like roses. I look forward to pampering my face with this rose water I love it! please keep supplying this product!! I recommend this rose water( I use this twice a day as a toner)</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of research on Rose Water..this is definitely top of the line for the price! I have extremely sensitive skin so i have to be very careful with what I use. I put this in a misting spray bottle and spray on my face throughout the whole day or on a cotton ball then dab lightly all over my face! My face feels so soothed every day! Please give this a try! You wont be disappointed. Also try their Pure Argan Oil! I use that daily as a moisturizer. Since i have been using both of these products my acne has disappeared! I am now On my 3rd bottle of each!</li>
    <li> I use these to tone my skin, lovely smell. I am a big fan of rose and jasmine for older skin, but only the real thing.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on the skin with a great fragrance!</li>
    <li> I tried buying &#x27;rose water&#x27; at a local store, and it wasn&#x27;t natural at all. This rose water is in a whole different class!  The scent is amazing and not synthetic at all. I&#x27;ve been using it in facial masks with various clays, and it is so soothing and calming. The scent is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am a 46 years old woman. I share that to say my skin needs extra TLC as I age. I researched Rose Water and found that it&#x27;s a great skin tonic and toner. This brand is better than most. Try it!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It goes on so smooth with no residue left on the skin, plus, you don&#x27;t have the harmful ingredients contained in most skin products.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water! I have just received my second bottle and am very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what people are smelling when they say it smells bad, I think the smell is a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;scent of roses and I love the way it feels on my face. I will continue to order this rose water!!</li>
    <li> Very nice rose scent, not over powering, smells just like a beautiful old world rose.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This arrived yesterday and when I opened it I was very disappointed.  It does not smell at all like roses and the odor it does emit stinks.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells beautiful,it gets the excess dirt off after washing and leaves the skin silky soft, good stuff</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WATER!! My face feels soo hydrated and then I follow it up with vitamin C serum and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling rose water I have found so far. I have oily skin and it turns red easily. The rose water helps to soothe and calm the skin and the rose aroma is great. I put it on a spritzer and leave it in the refrigerator. Stays fresher and floral that way. Avoid too much light. The service of Elma and Sana is remarkable. They send you a thank you note and tell you about their story and how their products are made. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see why this product is getting all these great reviews (I bought it based on them..). It doesn&#x27;t do anything noticeable to my skin.. it does clean it I guess.. &amp; even tho it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, it kind of feels like it does when I use it, because my face feels a little tight &amp; dry after it.. between that &amp; a REALLY strong smell, its a little intense..</li>
    <li> use w/ mud mask powder for an amazing, brightening mask</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun making my own lotions and lip balms and the rose water was a listed ingredient for a lotion that I had yet to try. I&#x27;ve not bought any other brands of rose water, so can&#x27;t compare against other brands. However, I can tell you this was a beautiful rose water and perfectly scented. Some flower waters can be overwhelming. so whether you&#x27;re making lotions or just using as a toner, you can be confident that you will not be suffocating in an overwhelming aroma of roses.</li>
    <li> This smells nice as I&#x27;m putting it on, but as it dries I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  It just stops smelling fresh and rosy and starts having this odd unpleasant odor that I just have to wash off.  It&#x27;s such a bummer because I love the pretty little jar.</li>
    <li> I have never used another brand of this, so I have nothing to compare to. I like it.</li>
    <li> The bottle looks bigger on the picture, but overall I like the smell.. I will see how well it works with my other product to see if I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great rosewater which I use as a toner. Perfect to keep the face hydrated. I only use this and argon oil as daily face products with excellent results. Smooth youthful and healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I buy several Elma and Sana products and have loved them all! This Rose Water is truely rose water, not chemical water with a rose scent like so many others. I have sensitive skin, Im allergic to aloe, lots of creams/lotions and sensitive to smells. But this water is a great toner that does not dry out</li>
    <li> I used this to make a simple non-soap cleanser for my skin. I added a few drops of tea tree oil to the entire bottle of my rose water and then applied to my face with cotton ball (after a gently scrub with baking soda). Simple, inexpensive and works well for me. My skin is now neither too dry nor too oily.</li>
    <li> This really smells soft, clean, very pronounced odor of roses. I will purchase again. I am looking for other uses because the smell is so pleasant.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with tea tree oil and witch hazel to use as a toner.  I barely used any, and I still smell like roses.  Excellent quality product.</li>
    <li> I love using rose water as a toner. This stuff was nice but the quantity was so little and it didn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;ve since then begun using Thayers alcohol free witch hazel with rose water, and I absolutely love it. Can buy in large quantities for a fair price and my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is amazing! I purchased this to add to Moroccan clay to make a mask and it works well for that. I havnet used it for anything else...except opening the bottle occasionally to take a whiff! :-)</li>
    <li> This smells like you&#x27;re walking through a rose garden. It has the scent of real roses not the cheap, chemical rose scent of most perfumes, because this is distilled rose water. I learned that distilled rose water is the best, it&#x27;s made from steaming rose petals and is a difficult process so a lot of rose waters are made just by adding rose oil to water... that&#x27;s not the kind that is good for your skin. If you&#x27;re buying this to use cosmetically, make sure to buy distilled. I totally understand now that I&#x27;ve bought this brand, it&#x27;s completely different from rose oil.... and the price is really great too.</li>
    <li> I soak a cotton round and swipe my face with this twice a day after washing my face. I&#x27;m not sure if the rose water or the change in face wash has cleared up my face, but I have struggled with adult acne and medication induced acne since 2000 and my face has cleared up!  Not only that it is wonderful to go to bed smelling like roses. My husband loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I changed my face regimen and only wish I&#x27;d done it sooner. I&#x27;ve tried everything and finally feel &#x27;pretty&#x27; and can go without make-up whenever I want to. So nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue buying this and only hope that it continue&#x27;s to be available.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use the oil cleansing method about 4 times a week and in between I use this stuff to tone and cleanse my skin. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, it just makes my skin look bright and clean. It doesn&#x27;t break me out- in fact, I think it actually shrinks pimples. And I swear it helps with my dark under eye circles. Yes it does make me smell like a grandma, but it does such great things to my skin I don&#x27;t even care.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had run out of my previous rose water. I wanted to find something a little more affordable than the$40/bottle I had previously paid for. You get what you pay for. This smells AWFUL! Honestly, I am not a person that  has a sensitive nose, but I almost threw up. It was old lady mixed with dirty laundry then sprinkled with rose petals. I honestly couldn&#x27;t even leave the house. I had to go back up and wash it off. Maybe (hopefully) it was just my bottle, but honestly this was gross.</li>
    <li> Best rose water I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water, until I found $1 or $2 rose water at a local international market/grocery store.  Go to the international markets, spices, rose water, and many other things there are way cheaper :)</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!  Feels so lovely on my skin. Tightens up my face &amp; leaves it feeling soft &amp; radiant! Will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> use this with red clay in a mask as well as by itself for a toner.  smellls great.</li>
    <li> The best rose water I&#x27;ve found. Smells so fresh and pure. Can be used for many things. I want to bathe in it! Good price for the amount and quality!</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like @$$. Read the 1 star reviews and buyer beware. I think the bottle I got was rancid? My husband said it was him or that nasty bottle of &amp;#34;rose scented dog crap&amp;#34;. Ended up pouring down the toilet and recycling the bottle. What a waste of $$. Look elsewhere for quality rose water.</li>
    <li> I use this after my cleanser every evening to make sure all the makeup is removed and for the added benefits of rose water. It smells just like roses. It was delivered fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> The best ever, pure and perfect at a great price</li>
    <li> Im a rose water addict! It is the best stuff for skin! Cleopatra made it part of her beauty regimen for a reason. This rose water is a fraction of the price and is too quality!</li>
    <li> I love it. I put this in masks, use to remove makeup, as a toner. It smells wonderful, and a little goes a long way I really like the bottle also.</li>
    <li> This rosewater is really nice.  I almost didn&#x27;t buy it though because a couple of the reviews said something about the scent being off.  But the scent is lovely.  Like most natural scents, it&#x27;s nice when it hits the air and doesn&#x27;t linger.  I use rosewater as an every day toner and as a ph balancer after a light home peel.  This is a good product, the price seems fair and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very wonderful product I use it daily on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a number of times in homemade body care products, and even purely by itself. It is refreshing, cleansing, and gentle. This has great quality, and the small bottle has lasted me a long time. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, this has not irritated my skin. I spritz it on in the morning , smells fresh for hours.</li>
    <li> I first started looking for this after a spa visit and their use of rose water…..This is a much better value!</li>
    <li> I use this product in my hair and I was disappointed that it was only 4 oz because I can definitely use more. Smells great but doesn&#x27;t lasts.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural toner and a friend told me about this. It is so cooling to my face and removes any makeup my cleanser doesn&#x27;t get. To top it all off, it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Feels so good on my skin. I love to wash my face after a long day and then apply this with a cotton ball. IT SMELLS SO GOOD!! Your face feels amazing after using it and you end up smelling like a garden of fresh roses. Not sure how it works as far as clearing up acne because I use other products for that but this stuff is extremely gentle and goes very well with my oily combination skin.</li>
    <li> stunning scent.  i am keeping it in the refrigerator.  i feel happy every time i see the bottle in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i repurchased this item on 8/7/15, and it may be my imagination but the scent isn&#x27;t quite as wonderful as the last bottle.  it&#x27;s nice, but not luscious.  of course, there is always random variation in plants, so assuming this product is made from real roses, there will be differences from batch to batch.  it still smells nice, but i am lowering the stars to four.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of rosewaters, which I like to use on my massage clients. This may be the loveliest rosewater ever.</li>
    <li> Smell great! A sweet and fine product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I&#x27;m pregnant right now and all the products I was using before are either unsafe or are making my skin even worse, causing me to look like an adolescent teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rose water smells divine and is working wonders already within one application&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> not as strong as I have had before</li>
    <li> Good product and the smell is pretty similar to the other organic products of the like out there. Only thing is, last time I saw the stock photo, the label and bottle looked different than what I got. Originally, I purchased cause the glass bottle looked cute and could be used as decor also. What I received looked slightly different. My label was a darker pink/rose color with different color writing. The cap of the one I received was plastic and black, NOT metal like the one advertised. A bit disappointing but it&#x27;s not the end of the world.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my Shea Terra rose water and decided to give this one a try because it was a tad cheaper. I put it in a brand new mister. I really do not care for the smell. It smells musty with a hint of rose. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> Received both bottles in perfect condition, very securely packed.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and definitely recommend this Rose Water.  I did transfer the contents to a small spray bottle, as I typically spritz this on my face and on my legs after shaving.  Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Based on the good rating, i purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;It did actually moisturize my skin. But the reason i gave 3 stars is that i cannot stand the smell. Kind of strong.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my mother-in-law. She loves it. She even likes the smells. So it was only me who do not like this particular scent.</li>
    <li> Elma and Sana Moroccan Rose Water. Lovely.  Refreshing toner.  Wonderful smell.  Very pleased. Will definitely be ordering again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The best!! Heard forever about rose water benefits and finally decided to give it a try. I ordered three brands and this was by far the best one. It smells SO good without being overwhelming and I put it into a spray bottle and it works wonders. I use it as a toner, make up remover, light moisturizer, and for a fresh over make up during the day. I have since bought 3 more bottles. Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this!! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It smells beautiful and keeps my face smooth and hydrated!  No more dry spots! Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Heritage Rose Water, and it works well, but I thought I&#x27;d try this. It did NOTHING for my hair. Since it&#x27;s at least twice as costly, I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin feel amazing, and it&#x27;s clearer now too. The fragrance is also lovely. Stocking up for sure.</li>
    <li> I really liked how this rose water softened my skin overall and toned my pores but my husband thought it smelled funny.  It does have that old fashioned rose smell but I liked it and it didn&#x27;t make me smell like it during the day after using moisturizer and makeup.  He thought it made me smell like an old lady when I used it before bed.  So,  I&#x27;m forced to search for something else.  If you&#x27;re not put off by the smell then it was a great product and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles. One for my best friend who is African American with sensitive skin and myself with oily acne prone skin. My bff loves it and swears that her skin feels petal soft. I use a mixture of 1/2 rose water mixed with 1/2 &amp;#34;bragg organic apple cider vinegar with the mother raw-unfiltered&amp;#34; as a toner. I have noticed a great difference in my acne prone skin since I started mixing the two. This stuff is yummy to my skin! Thanks for making a great dependable product.</li>
    <li> I like the product,but the cap broke for some reason and half of the product spilled.Amazon was very good about it they credited the amount of the purchase to my account.Also if I order a new one they won&#x27;t charge shipping.</li>
    <li> It is great product... smells beautiful and makes my face feel smooth and hydrated! I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Refreshing spritzed on your face or hair, no surprise but it smells like roses. I did get some of the spray on my hoodie and think it was responsible for a strange smell a couple days later. Would be interested to know if other people have experienced this.</li>
    <li> Just love this, smells wonderful too!M</li>
    <li> I LOVE this rosewater.  The smell is heavenly and really makes a difference for my skin.  I use it for cleaning my face as I use a homemade facial cleanser from &amp;#34;Absolute Beauty&amp;#34; by Pratima Raichur.  Since using Pratima&#x27;s recipes and this rose water, my skin now glows and for the first time in my life, I have beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that I would like it to come in a larger size.  It would also be great if it came with a dropper or even a spray nozzle because I end up transferring it to a smaller dropper bottle so that I can mix it into my cleanser.  Maybe it is just me, but I ended up losing a lot of water the first time I tried pouring a small amount into my hand.  Other than that, I love the actual rose water.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best  rose waters I have ever tried..  Try it you will love it</li>
    <li> Rose water is a bit smelly but it seems like a good quality. I&#x27;ve only purchased rose water one other time so I&#x27;m not sure what to compare it to.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve only used it a few days after cleansing with NOW Foods Almond oil. I have combination skin that get oily during the days, but using this my skin is smooth, hydrated and not greasy! It smells light and sweet too. It also soothes my skin, which gets red a lot, and is also minimizing my dark acne spots. Overall, great product. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of rose water and this brand has met my expectations. I use it as a toner or mix with powder mask instead of water. The bottle is wrapped in plastic so there is no spillage. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This has a lovely scent which is not overpowering at all, more of a subtle sweet smell.  I am super sensitive to fake scents but this is really natural.  I also like how it makes my skin look and feel; soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I use Rose Water for an organic facial mixture. This Brand is the best I have used to date! Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful product for soothing your tired, puffy eyes.  Put it on a cotton ball or cotton pad and then, put it on your eyes and relax.  It&#x27;s cool and soothing.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they just are not as good.  I have only been able to find Elma and Sana Moroccan Rose Water on Amazon, not in a store.</li>
    <li> A great, amazing-smelling product!</li>
    <li> Great product...You can feel it moisturizing instantly. Smells pretty good! Expensive for what you get, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a facial toner for several months and absolutely love it. My skin feels good, and it feels truly luxurious to put this on every morning. I&#x27;m not usually a huge fan of rose scented products, so I am surprised by how much I like this.  Perhaps it is because it smells like real roses, not fake purfumey roses.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my boys hair, they have natural curls and it give they hair a soft feel and easy to comb, curls can be hard to comb with out water, and this product and a softness to my boys hair</li>
    <li> i love this product. it seems to be the best as far as natural. i use in in conduction with other things for a face toner.</li>
    <li> A wonderful scent and beautifully packaged.  Fragrance is light and clean with a heady rose essence. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as a toner every morning and night for the past few months and can see great results. Very refreshing and it feels like my pores are smaller and skin looks healthier. It smells great too! I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin &amp; acne problems. I was already familar with their argan oil product &amp; found all the benefits of rose water. I poured my rose water into a smsll travel size spray bottle &amp; just spray all over my face after washing it. Ive been using it for 2 weeks consistently now and my skin looks SO CLEAR! I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> It smells good. But I don&#x27;t like the design of the bottle. It&#x27;s very easy to spoil it.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice product.</li>
    <li> lovely! i&#x27;ve used this product daily for 6 months now... and always purchased from the same co. fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very refeshing scent.</li>
    <li> Omg, this smells heavenly and I LOVE how my skin feels after I rub it on with a cotton ball!</li>
    <li> Lovely rose scent, I used this in a mixture for a toner. It can be used on it&#x27;s own though if you prefer</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
    <li> great for applying pigments</li>
    <li> This did not smell like roses to me.  It had a heavy, dank smell to it.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m extremely fond of the Thayer Original Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera and find that it does beautifully on my sensitive skin, I recently ordered this pure Moroccan Rose Water to see if it lives up to its hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I like it every bit as much or possibly even slightly more than the Witch Hazel.  It calms and soothes my sensitive skin, keeps my combination skin from becoming either too dry or too oily and appears to even help tighten the pores.  It also has a natural, rosy scent which I just adore.  I wear it either alone or under moisturizer, which might also be under makeup.  I also apply it at night after I remove my makeup or simply before bedtime.  No matter how or when I use it, my skin appreciates it.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily as a toner and I receive radiant results. My face feels refreshed and there is no stinging! The suppliers have been consistent in the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Good on its own as a toner. Smells lovely. I also mixed it with the Elma and Sana Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Powder to make a mask. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Everything it lists to be with a beautiful, uplifting natural floral scent.</li>
    <li> I love love love this rose water. It is perfect. The fragrance is so beautiful. I use is daily as a toner. I will be ordering again soon. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love the idea, hate the smell!!</li>
    <li> Good quality rosewater.</li>
    <li> This stuff MAY work great on your face, but i cannot get past the smell that my bottle had.  I may have had a bad batch or an expired bottle, i am not sure...but mine smelled kinda like pickle juice with a hint of rose undertones. It was so bad I had to wash it off my face b/c I just couldn&#x27;t stand it Based on all the other terrific reviews on the scent, the only thing I can fathom is that i got an expired or bad batch. I think the bottle is pretty and it looks nice on my counter...that&#x27;s about it!!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly as a toner and I also added this to my homemade facial cream.  This rose water helped give the creamy feel and the nice smell plus the benefits of the Moroccan rose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin. I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation. After using it, my skin felt moist and clean. I wish it was in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> smell so good！ love it</li>
    <li> I dont usually give any online reviews but I wanted to post a riview for this because I was not happy with the shipping of it.  When I opened the box and removed the bubble wrap I noticed that the bottle was not completely full and the bubble wrap was wet. The cap was not properly closed, so a lot of the product was spilled over during shipping. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rating it with 3 stars. The product itself is wonderful.  I love the smell</li>
    <li> The smell of the product is off. It smells like the roses were starting to go bad before they bottled. It isn&#x27;t a horrid or completely rancid smell, but something definitely went awry during the process. I do not feel confident in the quality especially for facial use.</li>
    <li> This rose water is lovely.  I dilute it with distilled water to make a refeshing face spray after washing my face.</li>
    <li> Received my order quickly, and I am very happy with the product itself. The smell is light and has helped to balance my oily skin! Great price for what you get!</li>
    <li> Expensive but smells great!</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly!  And makes my face feel great!</li>
    <li> Great toner,smells amazing</li>
    <li> I use it in facial spritzers and linen spray. Whenever I need volume versus drops of expensive oil. Good value.</li>
    <li> I love the glass bottle and have used rosewater on my face as a toner for the last 6 months.  I used to use Burts Bees Rosewater but can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  This brand has an intense rose smell to it at first but goes away after a few minutes (or you just get used to it and don&#x27;t notice)&lt;br /&gt;but no one around me has ever said anything.... I bet its nice to smell like roses :)  I did give it a 3 star because it may be causing me to break out - but it could also be other hormonal factors (I had a baby almost a year ago and am still getting back to normal)</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this rose water than the other cheap one</li>
    <li> I use this periodically as a toner and a facial mist. I compare this to La Mer &amp;#34;The Mist&amp;#34; (which I still use as well). This is 100% pure with no additives. Gives your skin a great dewy look after a quick spay in the middle of the afternoon. Love! Delivery was super fast too!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product and service</li>
    <li> I like this brand enough to give up my higher-end brand that I&#x27;ve spent a lot more money on!  I am glad I tried this brand because it has an amazing scent and is as good as or better than the higher end product I&#x27;ve used.  I love how it makes my face feel so soft. Sometimes I work in a hot environment and taking a few minutes to wipe my face with this rose water is so refreshing!  It is an excellent toner, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product and will be purchasing more for friends of mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would say that the smell is &amp;#34;horrible.&amp;#34; It smells 100% like fresh roses and this is ROSE water. It is a very high quality, wonderful product. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of roses, however, don&#x27;t expect to like the smell of it. I personally love it. It is a great natural toner. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This rose water is amazingly fragrant, just like a rose garden&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it because I wanted to make a facial tonic, which I did and it feels good on your skin and is chemical free, always a bonus</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! My esthetician recommended this to help my acne and so far it&#x27;s really improved my skin.  This is a high quality rose water that smells amazing but isn&#x27;t overpowering. I also appreciate how quickly it arrives everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically I put it in a little spray bottle and spritz my face with it twice a day. I highly recommend this stuff--thanks for making a natural rose water that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. You&#x27;ve got a customer for life!</li>
    <li> This has a very strong rose smell.  I am thinking it is probably the best you can buy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells amazing</li>
    <li> Was using a Lancome toner, loved the smell BUT it had alcohol in it, I didn&#x27;t like how it was stinging my face each time I used it, so I decided to look for something without alcohol. Came across this while shipping on Amazon, people had nothing but positive things to say about this so I decided to try it out. It arrived a week later and luckily the bottle didn&#x27;t leak like how some others mentioned in the review. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days but sui far I like it. It doesn&#x27;t sting my face at all, I&#x27;m update later if I notice any positive or negative changes on my face. The smell is ok...not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not too bad either.</li>
    <li> In love this stuff!! It&#x27;s great for hair and body. I use it every day in a spritz bottle as a finishing spray for my makeup. Ii holds off shine and sets makeup.</li>
    <li> Seems to be just as good of rose water as what I bought for a lot more in a store.  I will be buying from here now instead.  Smells like roses and it hydrating too.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems fine. I&#x27;ve never used rose water before so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if I notice any changes in my skin, as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m upset because the cap on my bottle is black plastic (unlike what is shown in the picture), and the first time I opened it about 1/4 of the cap broke off. Every time I open it more chunks of the cap come off! I&#x27;m left with about 1/4 of the cap now so it won&#x27;t screw on.</li>
    <li> Love this product, the smell is so light and amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosewater for years, but the brand I normally use was out of stock. I got this one and it&#x27;s the best. I will be ordering more. the scent is a bit stronger than some of the other brands, but I love it. the scent is calming and it leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I think the quality control for this product is very poor. The first bottle I bought had a cracked lid. The way the tape was applied over the lid made it seem like they knew it was cracked before sending it out, and taped it enough to hold together for shipping. The smell was very nice, and I like the results of using this on my skin at night. It&#x27;s great at removing make up (including eye make up) with no stinging or drying of my extremely sensitive skin. (Since sensitivity is very personal, I don&#x27;t feel that I can guarantee that rosewater will be wonderful for your sensitive skin, but it might be worth a try.) I bought a second bottle, along with a much cheaper version (less than 10 dollars for 8 ounces) of another brand of rosewater. I&#x27;m so glad I did, because this batch had evidently gone off. The smell was very sour and unpleasant. The cap was intact, however, so I put the cap on the old bottle, put the cheap rosewater in the bottle, and it turns out the cheap rosewater worked just as well as this more expensive version. I have purchased this product twice, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My first time to use use  rose water, thus the smell was overwhelming at first.Not the sellers fault. Thus the effect of the product is remarkable to the skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> I think the reviews stating that this smells good are lies. This smells anything but rosy. It almost smells like vinegar, and it is so strong that my husband could smell it on me across the room. And he hated it. I tried diluting it with one part water and one part rose water and it hardly made the difference. Still smelt horrible. I cant use it</li>
    <li> I love this rose water I use it as a toner for my face fells so nice after I apply it and love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> This rosewater smells lovely and feels wonderful on the skin. I decant 1oz -2oz into a smaller bottle and add an inch stigma/thread of saffron and use as my facial toner. I also mist my face with rose water for a pick-me-up or just to add moisture.</li>
    <li> Somewhere on &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; I had read that one should use rose water toner prior to hyaluronic/C-serum, so I had bought a bottle of another brand. I really liked the effect on my face too, but using as a toner a 4 oz. doesn&#x27;t last very long compared to all the other products in my current daily regimen. So, I searched for alternative brands, found this one, and as it was dollars cheaper I took a chance..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any significant difference between this water and the one I bought previously. Fragrance to me is identical, as are the effects. Dries to a very smooth feel and is kind of &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since bought 3 more bottles, if I remember right they are about $3. cheaper than the first brand I tried, and way, WAY more economical than any other brands I saw on &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m a guy, so though I do like the results of these waters, I&#x27;m not crazy about the odor, but I suppose women generally would like it okay...</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and we have re-ordered.</li>
    <li> I bought this rose water as an ingredient for my deodorant recipe.  I mix it with milk of magnesia in a 2:1 ratio, apply to pits and it works great!.  The rose scent doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it&#x27;s still nice to have a light scent.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a mix for rhassoul clay and my hair loves it!  I previously used bentonite clay mixed with distilled water and I see a huge difference with the new clay and the rose water.  My hair feels like silk aftwards.  I am African American with type 4c low porosity hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the high reviews. Have used it only a couple of times, felt like it is drying my skin. Also, my husband hates the smell, so I can&#x27;t use it anymore. I am not a big fan of the smell ever, too strong, overpowers everything.</li>
    <li> Very calming for the face and skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, smells great! I use it on my hair in a spray botttle to make it smell like roses:]</li>
    <li> Love this product, have bought several and told family and friends about it also.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel amazing and smells like heaven! I would recommend it for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insider Tip: Mix it with Elma &amp; Sana Ghassoul Clay and use the mixture as a hair mask - simply apply, let sit for 5-15 minutes (longer for oilier hair) and rinse for fabulous body and shine!</li>
    <li> Love it! Bought if for a face spritzer.. Nice natural smell, not overwhelming like some of the other Rose Water product I have smelled.  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this rose water. Smells very fresh. I like to dilute it, and spray it on my face and hair right before I straighten it. I will repurchase this!</li>
    <li> Heavenly smell! Wonderful quality product. I love the glass bottle it came in. Only complaint, it had leaked a little bit in the package.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!  Its soothing,aromatic,organic &amp; distilled properties make it the best rosewater I have ever used!!&lt;br /&gt;Will deifinitely buy agin &amp; again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Pure rose water, smells very rosy. Not sure what the other reviewer was saying about it having no scent or that it stinks, maybe she had a bad batch. This stuff smells great. I will pat some on my face in the morning before putting on powder and it leaves my skin super smooth and brightens my complexion. Fyi, I am an herbalist and the properties of roses helps to brighten the skin, removes dark eye circles (and dark brown aging spots, however this will take some time to see the difference so be really diligent), and improves blood circulation. Yay, no more dry spots! This is a regular part of my facial care routine now, along with the line from Golden Sundrops. You don&#x27;t need those expensive La Mer or Shiseido stuff, and full of chemicals too!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s great for my really sensitive skin and removes left over cream cleanser, smells wonderful too. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it leaking on arrival, it had a plastic seal around the top; I do wish the bottle was larger for the cost, I&#x27;m sure you can buy a much larger bottle of pure rose water in a middle eastern store for a similar price.</li>
    <li> The most delicious rosewater imaginable.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SOFT SCENT AND IT WORKS AMAZINGLY ON SENSITIVE BODY PARTS.  THE BEST PURCHASE EVER! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for your skin.. I use it on my face and my skin is so much clearer and pores much smaller. Love it, will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and really tightens my skin. The longer I use it the more I like it.</li>
    <li> I have never used Rose Water before but have heard so many good things about the benefits it can do to your skin. After the first time of using my skin was so amazingly soft just like the petals of an actual rose. My face looked dewey and fresh. Nothing bad I could say about this product. I use it as a toner after I cleanse my face each morning. It&#x27;s a great way of waking up. Not to mention the smell is absolutely divine. I love it!</li>
    <li> The smell of this water is so mesmerizing and soothing to the mind! Great texture. I just wish the bottle was a bit bigger for the price.</li>
    <li> Some of the bottles are rancid. I got one and returned it. You didn&#x27;t even have to open it to smell it. This is an organic product that has a shelf life. It can, and some of it has gone BAD.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing... not like any other rose water I have used. I do question the price. I don&#x27;t use rose water often so I don&#x27;t mind paying for it - but if I used it daily - I would not be buying it because of the cost.</li>
    <li> received quickly. like product</li>
    <li> It never occurred to me to use rosewater. I only stumbled upon it because I bought toner but didn&#x27;t notice it contained alcohol. So when I researched what people were saying, I found many suggesting rosewater if alcoholic toner is too rough. My boyfriend&#x27;s face gets a bit red and irritated after a Bentonite (Aztec) clay mask but a few spritz of this and it&#x27;s back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a fresh bouquet.. concentrated. I bought a small fine mist spray bottle and dilute 1:3 with water. It still retains the rosy smell and makes my skin look dewy. I hate looking cakey after using my MAC studio fix. This helps that loose powder absorb flush with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that you store it in the fridge. The one time I left it at room temperature (away from sunlight), it smelled vinegar-y. Plus it makes it that much more refreshing to spray/dab on cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint - I&#x27;ve ordered this twice for me, once for my brother. 2/3 times, it came with the bottle slightly wet. The bottle wasn&#x27;t cracked each time, it&#x27;s just the top was a little loose so it leaked maybe 10 drops so no biggie. (Update- I&#x27;ve now ordered it about 6 times and the latest ones have not leaked)</li>
    <li> Look no further, this is the real deal! As soon as I applied with cotton on my face my skin imediatly absorbed the liquid and felt really hydrated and sooo soothing! Smells amazing too. Just like a bouquet of fresh roses leaves your skin perfumed. I got it today and it was appropriate packed , no leaks,cracks etc. I&#x27;m  very satisfied with this product already,  I&#x27;ll write more about how it improved my skin in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The packaging was good, no spills, no leaks, completely intact.  I have gone completely natural with my hair and after much trial and error, I have finally formulated my own concoction and this product was just what I needed to complete what I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve.  The product smells fan-tabulous and as soon as I began to use it, I could literally feel it working.  As finances allow, I will be ordering this again.  Just wish it came in larger portions.</li>
    <li> I use to use the heritage spray, but they&#x27;ve changed their product about 2 yrs ago and now it stings. I Decided to give this a try and Absolutely LOVE IT!.  It smell wonderful, but not overpowering and cools my dry skin.  My face gets parched during winter months and this is nice in setting my makeup if I&#x27;m a little flaky on my cheeks.  I&#x27;ve used different rose water sprays, mists and you name it. From expensive to affordable.  This is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s supposed to smell a bit odd..also the packaging wasn&#x27;t great...the bottle was all wet. Does smooth and tone my skin... Bit stinky though..</li>
    <li> I usually mix my morrocan red clay with distilled water. I mixed my clay with this rose water without diluting it, and when I peeled the dry clay off my skin, I could see the tiny stuff pulled out of my pores. It was disgusting but cool at the same time. Now, I know this rose water really helps makes my clay masks much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose water smells like heaven. I would purchase this again! But, the problem I had with this brand was that once it arrived to my home, the bottle was leaking. They should use more bubble wraps to protect the bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this item looking for a natural toner. The first bottle that arrived had leaked, but they promptly sent another. The packaging is beautiful and the frosted glass bottle looks lovely in your bathroom. The water itself had a light rose scent and is quite pleasant. My skin loves this water and looks amazing. I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles and each one is excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I like the smell it&#x27;s very soft. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times definitely love the smell of flowers.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing.  Gives my skin a soft dewy feel that I can&#x27;t remember having for a long time. I love the smell. It&#x27;s very feminine and natural.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for what I need . Which is making facial cream.</li>
    <li> great for hydrating the face, part of my morning and night ritual</li>
    <li> This Moroccan rose water smells wonderful! This smells exactly like roses and my husband loves the smell of it on me. I put it on every night and he thinks it smells better than any perfume :)</li>
    <li> This is the real deal!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant and the rose water exquisite.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Used on the eyes-it has a calming effect</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful, very soothing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle of this stuff.  I absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> Could it be I am so used to the artificial smell of roses? Maybe. I tried this a few times on my face and eyes after reading the many benefits of rose water, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell of rotten flowers.  If you&#x27;ve ever gotten flowers, and left them until they are dead and dried in yucky water then that&#x27;s the smell in this bottle.</li>
    <li> I have ordered other rose waters and this one is by far the strongest scented one I&#x27;ve gotten. It really dries me out too.</li>
    <li> smells like the roses used were dead.</li>
    <li> SOOO strong of a smell. Its nice but kind of overbearing. Doesn&#x27;t fade away either. It does make my skin feel nice &amp; i do like it.. I just have to be in the mood to tolerate smelling like super strong roses allll day when I want to use this stuff</li>
    <li> Best price for the highest quality. I use rose water regularly instead of facial toner and I have been very happy with Elma and Sana. (I thought the bottle was plastic from the picture, but it is actually glass.)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells so great and is so refreshing on my inflamed, acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I applied the rose water to my face each morning. I was so refreshing. I really loved it. I have used it all, 4 oz is not very much. I may order it again, not sure as it is expensive.</li>
    <li> not worth your money. It has a pleasant fragrance but that&#x27;s it. Nothing more than a regular water mist that you can get from anywhere.</li>
    <li> Daughter bought it, daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Nice product;  cleans without drying;  has a nice fragrance.  Would probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is perfect and well-priced. I spray my face with it all the time; it&#x27;s so soothing and smells so wonderful! I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> Bought this for setting my makeup. Unfortunately, it smelled horrible! I tried watering it down, but it still smelled very strong and gross. Unusable.</li>
    <li> Great calming skin toner. I use it mainly around my eyes to help combat puffiness in the morning, works ok but overall good on my skin.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is heavenly. Combined with African black soap, the OCM and spirolactone my acne prone skin is FINALLY clear!</li>
    <li> Came very quickly,  I love this sruff I use it to purify my crystals after charging them in the sun. I also use&lt;br /&gt;It in my bath water and as a skin softing method. This stuff smells awesome leaves your body feeling&lt;br /&gt;Refreshed and it has a beautiful smell. I will order again and I am also getting a bottle for my god daughter&lt;br /&gt;She is in love with the smell also. Great work guys awesome product highly recommend this universal product</li>
    <li> This rose water smells lovely in my homemade lotions. Delivered when promised and carefully packaged so glass bottle won&#x27;t break. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for rose water to use for face hydration. The characteristics of Elma and Sana Pure Moroccan Rose water fit my requirements. However, I had to return this item, due to an overwhelming musky smell that lingers all day until you wash it off. This heavy smell was a deal breaker for me. After all, who wants to smell like grandma? Instead, I ordered the &amp;#34;Heritage Store - Flower Waters, Rosewater&amp;#34; which not only smells fresh, but comes in a spray. Oh and it is cheaper, too. I do feel thought, that the Moroccan Rose water provides better hydration for my skin. I just could not get over the unpleasant (to me) aroma.</li>
    <li> Great when coupled with the  ELMA&amp;SANA® Moroccan (Rhassoul) Ghassoul Lava Clay Powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use it as a toner the benefits are noticable.  Initally it made my face kind of red but after a few minutes the redness went away.  After continued consistent use, this toner made my complexion even and clear.</li>
    <li> unfortunately this was delivered by the US mail when our temperatures were single digits, when I arrived home and opened the package the liquid was frozen and the glass vile was broken and the fluid leaked all over the packaging so I had to throw everything out because of shards of glass were in the fluid when it thawed.  Don&#x27;t order in the winter if it will sit in your mail box</li>
    <li> Pleasant smelling rose water.  I can use it for multiple things but mostly for scenting hands and petals. Glass bottle was packed well, and arrived safely.</li>
    <li> this product is perfect for what my son need it for. he hasn&#x27;t complain at all thank you thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using rose water for my face with two different brands. After reading the positive reviews, I decided to give ELMA &amp; SANA a try. As one reviewer said, it got a really strong fragrance that smells like rotten roses. The smell would linger for several hours. So, no more this product. I&#x27;m looking for a different one!</li>
    <li> Never bought Rose Water before so have nothing to compare it to but this smells wonderful and makes your skin feel like velvet!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to calm down my red skin.  It is a small size then I expected.  It is very strong&lt;br /&gt;scent.  I add water and put it in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Love using it with my facials. Very refreshing and leaves my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING.  Very refreshing, and a great price</li>
    <li> My skin gets red at a snap of a finger. I&#x27;ve been looking around for a toner that wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on my skin and a few of my co workers told me about rose water. I looked around and I found this one from Elma and Sana. I really love the smell! After I washed my face this morning, my skin was RED. I put some of this rose water on it and it felt like a huge relief. The redness reduced and my skin smells and feels nice! I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, but I&#x27;m hoping the long term effect is better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My face really seems to be more clear after using rose water on it in the evenings.</li>
    <li> Delivery - Excellent (5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;Product - Good (3 stars).  Fantastic rose fragrance.  However, the benefit stops there.  The product didn&#x27;t do more, didn&#x27;t do less.&lt;br /&gt;Pricing - Fair (2 stars).  A little pricey but I bought it on the curiosity based on a user&#x27;s description that this product smells &#x27;heavenly&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and texture.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and my skin looking much more radiant.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a healer for my son&#x27;s facial rush, but I ended up using it every day as a toner; it is so good for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;Twice a day, it does the work for me; before I retire at night, I clean my face with Elma and Sana Rose Water and finish with VoilaVe Organic Rosehip Oil. The next day, my skin feels like a new skin and after cleaning it, literally, the skin is much clearer and soft. I need to buy another bottle to keep it for myself as my son and I are fighting to keep it. It takes a while, though, to see the results -persistence and patience works for end results and it means, the product is good! I do not like instant gratification products that at the end do not provide the desired result.</li>
    <li> smells great had no adverse reactions to placing it directly on the skin and I can easily turn red and feel a burning sensation from many lotions and facial products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and I&#x27;m not quite sure if I&#x27;ve seen any difference in my skin with this product but I&#x27;m still hopeful and will continue using it. I use it every morning before my makeup application and every night after I was my face before bed. It has a pleasantly light rose scent and leaves my skin refreshed and clean!</li>
    <li> smells nice! and works really well in home made beauty products.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and my skin cleared up.</li>
    <li> What a great smelling rose sent !! Used it to mix with the Aztec clay powder I purchased as recommended by others. Great to use just as an astringent on any skin type ( I&#x27;m sensitive ) . I&#x27;m thinking of giving this as Christmas gifts to some Girl friends!! Great price !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this Rose water for 2 times so far &amp; will order it again! I use as a toner after facial scrub every morning. It&#x27;s non-greasy &amp; smells nice. Also, it&#x27;s perfect to refresh the face in this heat...</li>
    <li> An amazing toner and great as eyedrops as well.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the purchase. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Great for refreshing your skin on a hot day. Light scent does not linger. I use it as a toner after mud masks or on hot days.</li>
    <li> When I use this as a toner all I can smell is rose water all day.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, light, uplifting, all words I would normally associate with rose water. Cloying, overpowering, putrid, words I would use to describe this rose water.&lt;br /&gt;My husband hates the smell so much that he doesn&#x27;t want me to use it in the house, it makes him want to vomit. I thought he was being overly dramatic and I used it one night right before getting in a cab, even though it was pretty chilly the driver cracked his window, I assume so he didn&#x27;t have to smell me. Very embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this product again and I don&#x27;t recommend you do either.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.  The scent is so wonderful and it lasts.  I use this on my face to hydrate, cool, and calm I have highly sensitive skin and find it soothes and runs off the redness should I use something that irritates.  After I cleanse my face in the morning I use this as a toner as it doesn&#x27;t irritate like alcohol containing toners. I also use this in my hair as a freshener after a long walk in the heat or after I have leaving mothers house because she&#x27;s always cooking my hair smells of her latest meal. &amp;#34;/ So in a pinch when you can&#x27;t wash again right away this is a must have.  This product has a beautiful lasting scent that I find soothes me as well as the other uses.  Sometimes I just give a couple mists after an unpleasant frustration, and the scent really does help to calm me.  It lasts me about 3 weeks with a misting cap I purchased as I couldn&#x27;t stand to lose it to a cotton round.  I wish they would provide the mister cap that&#x27;s my only complaint.  Won&#x27;t be without this.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water.  I&#x27;ve used it for moisturizing, and also have blended it with water and clove oil as an air and fabric freshener.  It leaves my house and clothing smelling wonderful without the overly-chemical feeling of most products.</li>
    <li> It smells bad, but it could be because it is made overseas and the water could make a difference in the distillation of the rose petals.  I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> They shipped this product with a few other things I had ordered I think my box must have frozen at some point as we were having a polar vortex with temps well below 0. When I opened my box I noticed the wonderful aroma from the product then realized it got frozen and the bottle had a little less then half in it .i will be ordering this product again but im thinking I will order in warm weather. The product was still sealed but could see how it leaked threw the plastic protective seal wait til warmer weather to order is my only suggestion other then that its a lovely product</li>
    <li> I use this as a toner and I love it. Keeps me feeling fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so intrigued by this product. I put it in my bath, I put it on my face has a toner, I also put it on after shower. This product does not make my skin sticky. I recommend this product!!! This product will be one of my continuous products I will be ordering. It&#x27;s great for toner, skin softening. This ROSE WATER is not overpowering it&#x27;s very subtle. You can also use it as a lite fragrance when stepping out, or just having that cuddle time. Put this product in a spay bottle and use it as a linen spray, also your shoes and your lingerie drawer. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I should say I really liked this rosewater so much that I keep putting it on my face (with a cotton swab)whenever I feel my skin is dry and tight. It moisturize well and left a pleasant rose scent. Great product! And I also like the Elma&amp;Sana Argon oil which works perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use as a skin toner and I must say I am very impressed.  Since using this product for about a month my complexion has improved and my pores are now smooth and not nearly as visible as they were.  The scent is nice...not overbearing and just aesthetically speaking the frosted bottle is beautiful.  It makes me feel fancy...lol.</li>
    <li> The smell is good. But it is very easy to splash everywhere when I use it.</li>
    <li> The Rose water is very light and I use it throughout the day when I feel like my skin is dry (and this winter has been bad!)  I only wish it came with a spritz top.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! Its a little pricey for the quantity you get but overall i really like it. Will probably look for a more economical solution in the future, as I use this is my massage practice for a pick me up facial at the end of a massage and i dont get very many uses out of it.</li>
    <li> It was nice at first to use as makeup remover but then began to have a musty or mildewy smell to it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how soft it makes your skin.</li>
    <li> This rose water has such a refreshing &amp; lovely smell.  I spray it on after washing my face in the evening &amp; again in the morning to help wake me up before putting make-up on for the day. I consider this a pampering item for me &amp; really enjoy it each time I use it.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I like this rose water, however it is very strong, and the bottle says for external use only, so it makes me wonder. I have used and prefer the Alteya Organics Bulgarian Rose Water, as it is lighter and is both organic and gmo free, and can be used as a food additive. It also seems to leave my skin softer than the Elma and Sana.  I will still use the Elma and Sana, but for a scented spray and room freshener instead of on my face.</li>
    <li> Close your eyes and take a whiff...smells just like summer roses! I bought this to mix with some homemade lotions as well as ghassoul clay powder. I love it! it is divine and feels amazing on your skin. You&#x27;ll be trying to smell your own face all day!</li>
    <li> Smells geat and feels lovely.</li>
    <li> Why pay alot for a toner filled with chemicals when you can have this one! It&#x27;s effective, smells nice, and it&#x27;s only rosewater. I am loving this product.</li>
    <li> This has officially and successfully replaced the need for lotion. This leaves my face perfect moisturizer without a trace of oil or shine. This is my second bottle!!</li>
    <li> I just cann&#x27;t say enough about this rose water. The aroma is fantastic and I use it to make a clay mask using Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s clay powder, which had an amazing result of removing blackheads. I plan to use rose water, distilled water, and lavender/frankincense to create my own facial toner later on. I highly recommend this rose water for any of your hair/skin needs.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful light rose scent. I put it into a small glass spray bottle so I can mist my face and hair with it. It is not overpowering at all &amp; it comes in a cute little glass bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the very highest quality of rose water and I should know, I was a practicing esthetician (licensed skin care practitioner in salon) for 15 years, specializing in aromatherapy and the use of essential oils and natural products - and with my dry, sensitive skin, rose oil and rose water are mainstays of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reluctant to buy anything but my usual Aveda rosewater-based toning mist because I usually find anything else to be a disappointment. Theirs contains many other ingredients to nourish the skin. But over Christmas I ran out, and my skin was becoming dry &amp; itchy, and their website said they would be closed for a few extra days; so I turned to trusty Amazon for a solution and found this rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t have the extra skin-care ingredients my regular toner has and so won&#x27;t replace it, this is the best PURE rosewater I&#x27;ve ever used. It clearly comes from high quality ingredients made with care &amp; purity, and is extremely soothing to red, itchy skin. It can be poured into a spray bottle and misted on, or applied with cotton to cleanse &amp; soothe. I even found I could apply it with cotton over my eyes which also get itchy and red skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking at the various rose waters for offer on Amazon, you can buy this one with confidence. This may sound like an ad for the product, but I know there were negative reviews I wanted to counter, plus I just like to leave positive reviews for things that are truly excellent.</li>
    <li> This rose water has a great, fresh smell and it&#x27;s good for refreshing the skin especially in a dry climate or after removing makeup. Seems to be brightening and toning my skin very well, especially the eye area.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great! No additives! Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff for your skin.  Leaves skin feeling hydrating, but not oily.  Mix with lemon juice and sandalwood powder for a nice mask to revitalize your skin after long hours in the sun.</li>
    <li> Smells delectable.  Used this in making home made beauty products for a nice fresh smell!  It is very refreshing on the face.  Only wish is that it came with some way of getting it out easier.</li>
    <li> I apply it on my damp hair after the shower together with organic Jojoba oil and can feel the smell of the rose for a few hours, but then the smell is gone. For an organic rose water, I would expect the smell to last longer. Also, I wish it came with a spray, as when pouring the water on my hand, I always get a few drops of spills.</li>
    <li> Bottle doesn&#x27;t seem like 4 ounces. Decent quality however</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S TOO MUCH.  I PREFER A SMALLER AMOUNT.BUT I DON&#x27;T USE IT - JUST THAT ONE TIME.</li>
    <li> Just love the scent of rose water and this makes my skin feel soft and velvety.</li>
    <li> I have avoided buying this rosewater for almost two years now simply because I thought it couldn&#x27;t be of great quality with an affordable price as such, but this rosewater is absolutely amazing and affordable! I love the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s certified organic by Ecocert. I will definitely be purchasing again. I was originally buying the Shea Terra Organics, but it&#x27;s too expensive and it smells and works exactly the same as Elma and Sana. So glad I switched up!</li>
    <li> It smells really nice</li>
    <li> this feels so good on your skin</li>
    <li> I use this in a spray bottle to freshen up my face when my makeup starts to look tired, as a toner, and in my hair when I just want it to smell nice. The scent is lovely and lasts for hours. The bottle is really pretty and looks nice on my sink. Overall, this is just a luxurious little indulgence that makes me feel girly, and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase, and I have not been dissapointed. I am glad I found this. I will be purchasing more....</li>
    <li> I love rose water - I would have given this 5 stars but the smell is just a bit off for me, however the product is really good. Just a little on a cotton ball, swipe over clean skin and it refreshes and softens your skin. For me it preps my skin for my other products by softening my skin, which tends to get really dry fast after washing - this keeps my skin supple so it accepts my other skin care better.</li>
    <li> I swear by this for a clear face!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product.  The fragrance is light of lovely roses, the water is refreshing and nurturing, I am using it daily.  The product came right on time.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I do love using this product, but it is pricey since I wash my face at least 3 times a day.  I use this after every wash and I have my teenage son using it too.  It is just a must have for face and body.  I would greatly reccomend this product for your daily cleansing.  I can say I have not noticed that dark age spots have gone away or diminished, but it does make my face feel wonderful and seems to help out with blackheads.  I have noticed that they have been cut in have in the last month.  I have a very dirty, hot and greasy job and tend to have blackheads on my face because of this.  Using this 3 times a day after cleansing has cut them down and I do appreciate that.  I keep it in the frig. and it is a great feel when applied with a cotton pad.</li>
    <li> Excellent for a face spray to set make-up!</li>
    <li> Good product. Love it.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly how it is described -- pure rose water.  I am very happy with it and glad I found it.</li>
    <li> This rose water is great. I use it as a toner of sorts in the morning and at night. It smells heavenly, and the smell lasts a surprisingly long time on my skin. If I get my face wet hours later I will notice the sweet fragrance of the rosewater again. Love this stuff, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results on my skin, I use it after washing my face to help with breakouts, and though my skin still isn&#x27;t perfect, it does seem to be helping more than other skin products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly switching to natural products when it comes to skin care. Rose water seems to be used in a variety of cultures (and for generations, too). I&#x27;ve heard good things about it, so I thought I would try it out. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this wonderful product. It does smell like roses, but a little more concentrated. I find it pleasant. I do love roses and it is really hard to find any scent that smells like a real rose. This does the job. I like to use a little bit on the face in the morning  (even now, a few hours after I have left the house to go to work, my skin has a very, very faint scent of roses) and a bit at night. I also use as an ingredient in a facial mask (rose water, besan/gram/chick pea flour, lemon, milk, and turmeric) that is supposed to help with slowly getting rid of a tan &amp; restoring your natural skin colour. (I&#x27;m naturally fair but where I live - southwest USA - the Sun burns/tans the skin. Not good!) So far, I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week and it makes my skin soft. It feels good after a shower or washing the face.</li>
    <li> I believe i got a rancid bottle of this rosewater. I was disappointed :( It does smell rotten. Too bad</li>
    <li> A sweet light scent that is nice to put on your face after a warm shower.</li>
    <li> Great quality,  smells great</li>
    <li> Love this! Works excellent as an astringent/makeup remover and smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about halfway done with my second bottle and have come to love rose water. I was previously using witch hazel but it included alcohol and was irritating to my dry, sensitive, rosacea prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I find this rose water to be of high quality, I can use around my eye area with no problems. It is cleansing yet soothing. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> odor of this product is not as pleasant as what I have previously used. not sure I will even be able to use. Plus, one of the bottles leaked even though the seal was still on it. leaked about an eighth to a fourth of an inch as compared to the other bottle.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter loves it! It helps clears her skin and smells awesome !</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, many uses!</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected when I got it in the mail, but the amount is substantial. I would say it will last you over 2 months if you exclusively use it as a toner, and perhaps a little over a month for multi-purpose use (like me) I recommend transferring the product to a spray bottle for convenient and maximal application as a toner or after-shower/after-bathe spray. The scent is refreshing and it&#x27;s great for my oily skin. It&#x27;s also an effective mixer for the Ghassoul clay that I ordered with it. I also love that it&#x27;s all-natural and the company does not test on animals. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My daily skin routine had to be changed because of pregnancy. Previously, I was using moisturizers &amp; face oils containing retinol, which should be avoided during pregnancy. After careful reading of labels, I was able to find a gentle face cleanser &amp; this wonderful rose water! I have been using it 2x a day for a week now, &amp; I just love it! It leaves my skin soft &amp; has a nice rose scent to it. I see myself continuing to use this in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle is glass but it was carefully taped &amp; bubble wrapped which I appreciate!</li>
    <li> Works very well, and love the rose smell it has.  Very good, and will be ordering more soon</li>
    <li> I love making my own products. Soaps, shampoos, lotions, balms, cleaners and detergents for the home, this is a lovely addition. Wonderful toner. This lovely rose scent is affordable with the add on and prime. I put some in a tiny spray bottle to keep with me as a nice little facial refresher as needed or scent a personal space. Although, Scent of Samadhi and orange blossom water will stay my personal favorite scents, I&#x27;ll keep this on my shelf and use it often.</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater. It really cleanses &amp; refreshes the skin. Very good for sensitive skin. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and is great as a cleanser and toner!</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED  THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE GOING IN I KNEW WHAT I WANTING FOR THE PURPOSE OF USING IT FOR DIFFERENT OCCATION(S).</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! This is so refreshing applied as a toner after cleansing. It has a beautiful, light scent and feels so gentle. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel of this product. Added it to the skincare products I have made my self. A really lovely product. I will be back when I need more.</li>
    <li> Wish the size was bigger</li>
    <li> Simply the best! Makes your skin feel cleansed and treated! It will always be one of my staples</li>
    <li> Wonderful soft aroma that dissipates quickly. I keep in a small spritzer bottle in the refrigerator to use as a spray on skin toner. I also spritz in my hair to add moisture. It does not leave an oily residue.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever purchase of Rose water , it seems to be doing everything my friend , the make up expert tells me i need Rose water for , applying my make up , and cle3aning my brushes .</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, as i have used Rose water for over 15 years as part of my beauty routine. This however, smells nothing like roses! it smells terrible, like raw tomatoes and insecticide. I could not stand to have it on my face and had to wash it off. Ill stick to my usual Thayers Rose Water infused Witch Hazel, which is wonderful and smells just like a lovely rose.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have been using it as a toner for a few weeks and my skin has stayed soft, less oily and no dryness.</li>
    <li> smells great and natural!</li>
    <li> I used this to create my own botanical skin toner. I love the clean tingly soothing feeling it gives. It also smells great. Wish the price would drop but overall not a bad deal for a product that&#x27;s very difficult to find in a store.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful, but I do not think that it does anything for my face other than making it smell nice.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go too wrong with rose water. Satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for babies that have sensitive skin. My daughter is one month old and gets a heat rash. This truly helps clear it up! Oh, it smells great!</li>
    <li> I read a review saying Instead of using water to mix my Moroccan clay use rose water. I only been using it a few days but within those few days my problem area, my chin, broke out. I have very sensitive skun. Idk if its the rosewater or just a coincidence</li>
    <li> So wonderful. One of the most divine things Ive smelled. True Rose water. It smells like &amp;#34;Flowers&amp;#34; honestly, this has a very sweet fresh flowery scent to it, and Rosy aswell, but it smells incredible and not organic, or gross at all. Like actually smelling a flower in Spring, seriously. (altho I use it as a toner and my skin is glowing). Very Authentic. Ive used perfume oils/attars from Morocco aswell and they are masters at scent, and essences extracts.</li>
    <li> Really makesones skin feel rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I use it as a toner</li>
    <li> This rose water is amazing! It smells beautiful like roses, but very light and finishes off like baby powder. I have combination skin with occasional monthly flareups and this rose water is very soothing. I split some into a little spritzer bottle to spray onto my face after am/pm cleansing and even as a setter after applying makeup. It just smells and feels so good! Some nights I would moisten a cotton ball with the rose water and tone my face with it, leaving my skin squeaky clean without feeling stripped or dried out. This is a terrific beauty bonus to add into your routine. Customer service is great too. I&#x27;m on my second bottle which changed from a pretty frosted glass to a clear glass bottle, but the rose water is still 100% fabulously luxurious!</li>
