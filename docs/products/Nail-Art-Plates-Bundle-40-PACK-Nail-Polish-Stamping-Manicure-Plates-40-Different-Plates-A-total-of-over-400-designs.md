      <li>This is great to use for holidays or  special event!</li>
      <li>Good quality but too many duplicate stamps</li>
      <li>Many choices, I wish Merry Christmas was spelt correctly after all it is popular around the holidays.  </li>
      <li>There were some good flowers, and some nice ferret foot prints, but it did  have alot of misspelled words and impossibly large designs.</li>
      <li>so if you order you may have better luck than I did.</li>
      <li>Could have been packed better</li>
      <li>I would of given a better review.  </li>
      <li>Much better than paying the Konad price.</li>
      <li>There is even an &amp;#34;I love Konad&amp;#34; stamp.</li>
      <li>lay to make more intricate.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d love to get the folio book I&#x27;ve seen to hold them all.</li>
      <li>Just one stamp is miss spelled but other then that everything is great!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and safely.</li>
      <li>But overall this was a great buy.  </li>
      <li>Even with the bugs these are 100% worth every penny and more considering the plates from konad are ~$650.</li>
      <li>Love it thanks!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any trouble with most of the images.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, a great buy.</li>
      <li>If you can handle sharp edges, these are great for the money.</li>
      <li>Even with all the stamps that I won&#x27;t be using, it was worth it.</li>
      <li>They all work great with the exception of misspelled merr0y christm0as and a horse that has too thin of lines to tell what it is I love them.</li>
      <li>The patterns are fun and everyone I show them too finds something they like.</li>
      <li>For the price of all these plates and the speed of shipping, it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>it has many different options to choose from and alot of  images over 400 designs for 20 dollars great price other than the merry christmas</li>
      <li>Really makes your nails stand out and everyone will notice them!</li>
      <li>was very decent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
      <li>Great price for such a wide variety.  </li>
      <li>They stamp good and you can find a little bit of everything in this bundle!</li>
      <li>There are a few that seem that they weren&#x27;t cut very well or that might be hard to stamp but almost all of the images are perfect.  </li>
      <li>Some images are too small for whole nail art, but overall these plates stamp great so far!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Matt\\&quot; was very helpful and sent me out a new order that did not have any repeats.  </li>
      <li>The full cover stamps are too small to fit an adult.</li>
      <li>designs stamp fine and others are seemingly not deep enough to keep the polish in.  </li>
      <li>all the images work well as far as picking up images on the stamper</li>
      <li>but I believe they have fixed that.</li>
      <li>This is as described and the plates are fine but they came in a small box all dumped out.  </li>
      <li>This purchase was a gift for my sister and I am mad that I did buy most of the original Konad plates years ago.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of stamps that I wouldn&#x27;t use such as the misspelled ones, the robotic Chinese cartoons, tiny unusable ones and the many astrological signs.</li>
      <li>Thesent are a little more simple  than expected  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I only saw one image error so far ... the &amp;#34;Merry Christmas&amp;#34; was misspelled.</li>
      <li>There are other stamps are the right size and they seem to be deep enough to work.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t stack your plates on top of each other without protection or they are going to get seriously scratched up.  </li>

<li> There are very few plates with damages; for example, the Christmmas plate has the phrase &amp;#34;Merry Christmas &amp;#34; printed wrong.  </li>
<li> Reason for not 5 stars was because, packaging was bad, all the plates were out of the package.</li>

    <li> There are a lot of stamps that I wouldn&#x27;t use such as the misspelled ones, the robotic Chinese cartoons, tiny unusable ones and the many astrological signs. The full cover stamps are too small to fit an adult. There are other stamps are the right size and they seem to be deep enough to work. Much better than paying the Konad price. There is even an &amp;#34;I love Konad&amp;#34; stamp. Even with all the stamps that I won&#x27;t be using, it was worth it.</li>

    <li> This is great to use for holidays or  special event! Really makes your nails stand out and everyone will notice them! you get designer looks without the cost!</li>
    <li> Many choices, I wish Merry Christmas was spelt correctly after all it is popular around the holidays.  It takes practice to learn to stamp without missing or smeared details.</li>
    <li> These are the best for getting konad style plates for a fraction of the cost. They all work great with the exception of misspelled merr0y christm0as and a horse that has too thin of lines to tell what it is I love them. The patterns are fun and everyone I show them too finds something they like. The only caution I have is that I was sold plates 1-60 and got 1-40 and 51-70. 51-70 did not match the picture of the overlapping plates but I believe they have fixed that. Even with the bugs these are 100% worth every penny and more considering the plates from konad are ~$650.</li>

My only real complaint is that the back of the disks is VERY sharp.  Don&#x27;t stack your plates on top of each other without protection or they are going to get seriously scratched up.  I&#x27;ve been storing mine with post-its between them but I&#x27;d love to get the folio book I&#x27;ve seen to hold them all.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and safely. Love it thanks!</li>
    <li> all the images work well as far as picking up images on the stamper it has many different options to choose from and alot of  images over 400 designs for 20 dollars great price other than the merry christmas was spelled extra wrong the still have other christmas designs any way would deffently recomend</li>
    <li> Reason for not 5 stars was because, packaging was bad, all the plates were out of the package. I do think that a stronger packet for plates are needed. But all plates were in their.</li>
    <li> At first when I received the item I was unhappy because there were a bunch of repeat designs.  When I contacted the company I spoke to two different ppl.  \\&quot;Matt\\&quot; was very helpful and sent me out a new order that did not have any repeats.  The other person I spoke to was very rude and unwilling to help me out with my problem with the order.  Had I only dealt with Matt I would of given a better review.  I will not use this company again.  Please keep in mind I did finally get the correct product so if you order you may have better luck than I did.</li>
    <li> This is as described and the plates are fine but they came in a small box all dumped out.  Could have been packed better and then they would not come open and dump during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Some designs stamp fine and others are seemingly not deep enough to keep the polish in.  But overall this was a great buy.  Price paid for number of plates was very decent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good quality but too many duplicate stamps</li>

    <li> Some images are too small for whole nail art, but overall these plates stamp great so far!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! No problems at all received on time with no delays. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> These designs are the same as the M series of Konad. However, they do not have a backing on them, so the edges are a little sharp. If you can handle sharp edges, these are great for the money. The images transfer nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only saw one image error so far ... the &amp;#34;Merry Christmas&amp;#34; was misspelled. However, considering all the images you get for the price, I can overlook that!</li>
    <li> There were some good flowers, and some nice ferret foot prints, but it did  have alot of misspelled words and impossibly large designs.</li>
    <li> Thesent are a little more simple  than expected  but work great and can over lay to make more intricate.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this item to all my friends. I paid 19.99 and the quality can not beat the price. All pieces stamp great. Just one stamp is miss spelled but other then that everything is great!</li>
