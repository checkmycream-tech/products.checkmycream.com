      <li>Very nice darker red and as usual a quality product from OPI.</li>
      <li>I love this deep red color.</li>
      <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Very long lasting, Doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
      <li>This is the color I wanted it to be, a deep dark rich red.</li>
      <li>Bought some of these for the Wife, apparently OPI is the &#x27;crème de la crème&#x27; of nail varnishes</li>
      <li>It is indeed a classic dark wine - but not so dark the color is not immediately evident and identifiable as &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I ordered other colors and this is the one I will use for Christmas and new years.</li>
