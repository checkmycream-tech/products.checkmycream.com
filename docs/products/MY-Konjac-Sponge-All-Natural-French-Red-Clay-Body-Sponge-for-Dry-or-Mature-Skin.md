<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love my konjac konjac sponge. It is gentle yet effective and very little product is needed when using this sponge. It makes my skin look and feel wonderful! I plan on purchasing more in the future for myself,family, and friends.</li>
    <li> This was nothing more than a regular sponge.  I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling as others have said.  It DEFINITELY isn&#x27;t an exfoliator.  (To be fair, I usually exfoliate a few times a week.)  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with my pores.  My skin did feel clean afterwards though, so I believe that is is getting my skin clean.  I really can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a family member and she loves it.  Her skin is smooth and the sponge is very gentle</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference using this product. I was using the Charcoal Konjac sponge for my face and felt it was going a great job clearing up my skin and I hoped this product would do the same for my body. It didn&#x27;t irritate me but it also didn&#x27;t do anything to make my skin better, so I don&#x27;t plan on reordering.</li>
    <li> i like the sponge, still going strong after 2 months.. dries every night. no complaints</li>
    <li> Good sponges - I like them. They are especially helpful if you have dry, flaky winter skin.</li>
    <li> Nice sponge but a bit too small</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, though overpriced and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference using it.</li>
    <li> this is the best bath sponge i have ever used, I have extremely dry skin that has  vastly improved using this sponge, I no longer have to use huge enormous  amounts of moisturizer after a shower, I recommend trying this item, I will never use anything else</li>
    <li> lovely product. Great for skin conditions. I have THREE. Where one product helps one condition it is liable to irritate one of the other two and this does not. It is not a cure but it certainly helps. It leaves skin baby soft. It has helped tone down my skin conditions considerably making them more manageable. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have mature skin and live in a very dry climate. This is perfect for gentle exfoliating.  My skin feels soft and smooth and the lotions I use seem to moisturize better.  No more itchy patches.  And the soft texture of the sponge is sensuous and addictive!  Look forward to my showers!</li>
    <li> I love the Konjac sponges. I&#x27;ve found a real difference using the Konjac sponge for my face. My acne has cleared up. My skin looks and amazing. I am very pleased with this purchase. I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have no complaint about this sponge. It is gentle on my skin. I gave it 4 stars because my hope was this sponge had a tad bit more firmness to it. It really is an ideal sponge for sensitive skin and most likely wonderful for a baby&#x27;s skin - for that I would highly recommend purchasing this product. It lathers beautifully and seems to rinse well. No complaints - just wanted something with a little more &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; affect.</li>
    <li> I love the facial sponges, the black and pink ones.  Very soft and easy for cleaning around the fragile eye tissue.  Body sponge is just lie it.  Would be nice to be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin, but it&#x27;s soft and more absorbent than a loofah.</li>
    <li> Very much looked forward to trying konjac for the first time, just couldn&#x27;t wait to get it!  Unpacked it, ran water over it until it had no more dry spots, and used it on my face which had just had a homemade acid peel on it about an hour before.  Because I had not yet put any moisturizer on my face after washing the fruit acids off, my face was unusually dry - not flaky dry, but stripped of oils dry.  I ran this sponge over my face... and by the time I had put it away and walked out of the bathroom, I reached up and touched my face and stopped dead in my tracks.  My face felt like I had just used the best moisturizer ever!  Soft, hydrated, smooth, but absolutely no grease or slippery residue to deal with.  LOVING IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hours later I decided I really wanted to try it out on my body, and didn&#x27;t want to wait till the morning.  Sadly, the results on my body were not as impressive as on my face - but this could be partially because I haven&#x27;t concentrated on the body skin condition enough in the past few years as compared to the attention I pay my facial skin - hence my desire to buy the body sponge rather than the facial sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use cleanser with it, and did feel cleaner than if I had used a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sponge with no cleanser.  But, as I did my final rinse off, I noticed that upper chest area was NOT fully exfoliated - skin cells were balling up as I rubbed for rinsing, like I hadn&#x27;t showered or exfoliated in days.  I ended up having to use my shower puff on my chest area to get it done.  This area is one area I  do have a history of having to pay extra attention to for exfoliation, so it wasn&#x27;t some weird out of the blue thing to have this happen, but I was a little disappointed that the results on my body were far less spectacular and immediately noticeable as my face had been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, on the other hand, it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, didn&#x27;t leave it feeling over-oiled or leave a residue behind, and was very very simple and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I do intend to continue using this sponge.  But when it is at the end of its life, I will most likely buy one for the face, as they are slightly cheaper (albeit slightly smaller as well).</li>
    <li> I love this.  Nothing wrong with it.used it at least a month with no decay.  It dries out overnight but springs back to life with water.</li>
    <li> The sponge is a bit small in my large hands, but it gently exfoliates without causing dryness. I like it.</li>
    <li> it works really well and really lathers up a large amount of foam even with just a tiny amount of body wash.  I&#x27;ve been buying this product for almost two years now I believe, and I can&#x27;t really imagine using anything else.</li>
    <li> I am pretty pleased with the size of this. I had been using smaller konjac&#x27;s for my face and liked the feel of my skin after. I decided to try the body one out and I am glad I did. My skin feels nice after using it. It get&#x27;s soft fairly quickly after exposure to water. I gently compress the sponge and place it up on the shower shelf to dry out. I can say goodbye to loofah sponges and those nylon puffs in favor of this - no contest!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and hope it&#x27;s does all its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> After using the My Konjac facial sponges for a couple of years now, I decided it was time to start using the body ones as well. This works just as awesome as the facial sponges do, but I do think they don&#x27;t last quite as long. I noticed that they start to break down a little bit faster than the one for my face and I think it&#x27;s because of the ridges in this one (it just breaks apart faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does just as great of a job as the face sponges do, the product just doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much integrity (again, this has more to do with the design than it does the actual product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one tip--you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s time to get a new sponge when your face stops feeling quite as smooth as it did when you initially purchased your sponge. Mine usually last anywhere from 3-4 months. I clean them once or twice during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are well worth the price though. I&#x27;ve had virtually no break outs and my black heads are practically gone. The only thing I use with this sponge is my aveeno face wash, but when I used that alone I didn&#x27;t have the same results that I do now that I use these sponges.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, I will be ordering again. Not sure how long it will last but I am very pleased with the results.  You use very little body wash for tons of lather.  My skin feels softer.  I use the smaller one for my face and I will continue to use this product.  Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> these sponges are a total waste of money</li>
    <li> Suds up nicely, silky on the skin.  I like it.</li>
    <li> ***Update, bought another one when the first wore out, still happy with it*** Loving this sponge! I have very sensitive and dry skin, and this sponge does not agitate it. Plus, it does well in our terribly hard water. My body wash lathers up well, and the ridges in the sponge match with my shower rack, lol. (So it nests on the little shelf and dries nicely).  Overall, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I guess I just don&#x27;t see what the big deal is. The high reviews had me hopeful that it would be a good for exfoliating, etc. but it works like any old regular loofah, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for it so much, not worth the $10+, not dense enough like the Dew Puff Konjac Sponge, so torn and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Wonderful item-have tried many of the Konjac sponges, love them all</li>
    <li> This is a well  made sponge; should last.</li>
    <li> These sponges are a miracle - It&#x27;s just amazing how smooth your skin feels after using, I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;Love them - will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i needed for my homemade Coconut Oil body wash, holds the soap really well. A little small but great. A++ shipping and contact</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product I have bought in a long time. I have rosacea and I have tried a lot of different products like lotions and ointments to help. I have even gone to a doctor and used prescription pads for it and nothing really made a difference. I started using Meaningful Beauty and that helped, but this sponge has just about cleared it up completely. It is far less noticeable and when it flares up at all like after working outside , I use the sponge and it calms right down. I wish I had found this sooner!</li>
    <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
    <li> Great for the environment good for your skin, this one doesn&#x27;t have a string to hang it with, super soft, will totally repurchase (great for gifts)</li>
    <li> Really like to use this in my shower.</li>
    <li> I love it! Usually when I dry off after a shower my skin is still very dry. Not anymore!! This sponge is amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3-4 times and it is splitting In half.  I see no difference in my skin as of yet.</li>
    <li> I love it so much..  Its makes my skin smoother than when use scraping gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i didn&#x27;t love about this sponge, when u put it in the water it&#x27;s became very soft that it can be hard to massaging your body with it! I have to hold it tight so it will not skips from my hands du to it&#x27;s softness</li>
    <li> This is a nice size sponge. There is only one thing I would change. I would put a string on it, so it would dry more easily.</li>
    <li> Good exfoliating sponge. Gets in all the corners well. I have not really noticed a difference between the colors. They are each supposed to do something different, but I don&#x27;t notice it. I have tried four different ones. A little expensive, but they last a long time.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. After one month of use (and coincidentally, a couple of days past when it would have been eligible for a return), this sponge tore apart. I have rinsed, and rinsed, and rinsed this sponge out each and every time I used it. Very surprised that the material started cracking and tearing apart after just one month. Guess I&#x27;ll go back to the sea sponges, as they are a proven product and at least will last me for a few months.</li>
    <li> Super gentle, only need a fraction of my usual amount of cleanser. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Not great. Like, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m missing something, but this sponge is just a sponge, and not a very good one at that. The dang thing dried itself out so hard that it ripped a hole in the middle, so now any time I use it I get little bits of sponge everywhere. This is after less than a month of use. Kind of a waste. Buy a normal sponge or a loofa, I guess. At least a loofa doesn&#x27;t self-destruct after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This fell apart after one use....</li>
    <li> I bought the red clay version because it is for mature skin and it works!  I have used other Konjac sponges before and I like the feel and their durability when compared to other items I have tried over the past few years.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and soaps up my body easily.</li>
    <li> I thought that these were to exfoliate as you used them.  But they are so soft that I am not sure they are doing anything.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. It really helped with an area with dry,slightly bumpy skin.  Makes you skin feels smooth and silky right away.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sisters Christmas present. She absolutely swears by Konjac sponges. They&#x27;ve done wonders for her complexion. It shipped fast and was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sponge! It feels like it&#x27;s deep-cleaning my skin, but there&#x27;s no scratchiness like you get with many (if not most) other similar products. It suds up very easily, so I foresee using my pricey soaps at a much slower rate. Perhaps best of all, it leaves my skin looking invigorated and fresh, which is no small feat for someone my age. (Older than dirt) I plan to order others for gifts and backups for the one I have now -- I don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> This is such a great sponge. I love it because I can use my soap bars with it, it helps them to lather quickly, and it hold the lather so well. I do have eczema and this one was the one recommended for eczema and it&#x27;s very gentle! I really like it. The only thing i would recommend is renewing it more than every three months, if you use it every day (which I do, sometimes even twice a day). It says you can keep them that long and you probably CAN, however it IS a sponge, at the end of the day. With same day delivery, renewing it won&#x27;t be a problem so I&#x27;ll renew mine, say, every month or month in a half AT THE MOST, like any other sponge, because they&#x27;re not too expensive and hygiene is important. &amp;#60;3 I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a version for face and body as well!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she can&#x27;t stop raving about it. She says her skin has not felt this nourished in years, and it really moisturized her dry skin. She likes it so much, she got the facial sponge too. Thanks to all the great people and My Konjac Sponge, she got her order along with the rest of the Prime orders that came that day. This is the only sponge she will ever buy from now on!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Along with installing a shower water filter &amp; switching to mostly natural products, this helps keep my skin clean &amp; soft with or without soap.  It&#x27;s been about a month of use so far; will try out one of their other versions when this one gives out.</li>
    <li> Does not scrub does not moisturize!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I have a Konjac sponge for my face and am really happy with that so I thought I would try a body sponge. It lathers with a minimal amount of body wash and leaves my skin feeling soft. I have dry skin so I am careful about the products I use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best (and most eco friendly) sponge yet!</li>
    <li> I get extremely itchy skin after a shower.  Using a natural, gentle soap helps a great deal, but nearly every body sponge I&#x27;ve tried still results in itching.  This is the first body sponge I&#x27;ve used that does not make me itchy after a shower, and I still get the exfoliating benefits.  This will be my go-to sponge from now on.</li>
    <li> Best bath sponge i  ever  used. My skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> Had terrible allergic reaction to this konjac and/or an additional konjac  sponge I ordered at the same time.  Ended up in the Emergency Room with a severe rash and intense itching and watching ti spread all over my body.  Only used the sponges for 2 days, skin felt &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; and rash appeared even through I stopped.  I searched online for adverse reactions from these sponges and it appears no one else on earth is allergic but me.  So my reaction is probably mine alone. The rash caused intense itching,preventing sleep, causing lost time and work, requiring prescription steroids which initiate  a separate problem for me and spent a fortune on prescription and OTC medications.  Hope no one else has a problem.  Was in ER 5 days ago and still battling the rash, although it is on the mend. To be fair, I have sensitive skin, but product description and reviewers made it sound to terrific!  Darn.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely even with my low-suds body washes for superdry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of skin issues, have eczema and psoriasis both, and have extremely fair and reactive skin.  With this sponge I&#x27;ve been able to very gently exfoliate dry areas  - so far without the subsequent irritation I&#x27;ve had with other sponges/mitts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it daily, and within a few days I could feel more smoothness in dry rough areas of my skine, apparently letting my coconut oil do a better job of rehydrating and protecting the new skin.&lt;br /&gt;Have not been using it long, so maybe I&#x27;ll eventually have to back away from using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;So far, very pleased</li>
    <li> Great sponge, leaves my legs so much smoother!</li>
    <li> Lovely soft sponge, perfect for gentle cleaning and removing flaky dry winter skin. I use a thin layer of avocado oil on damp skin after showering, soaks in quickly - combination keeps my skin moisturized, soft, and smooth.</li>
    <li> Like better than a scratchy fiber mesh scrubber.  It is good size for my med. female hand.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and so was looking forward to using this sponge.  It arrived quickly and was at a good price for something that I should get 2 to 3 months use out of. I have only used it a few times but it leaves my skin soft and smooth. Unexpectedly, my skin glows a bit, with fewer imperfections. I love it and have noticed a decrease in itching without having to use a cortisone product. I love it and will definitely purchase again from this seller</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom who has eczema and dry skin generally... she seems to like it; says she doesn&#x27;t need to put on lotion after using but at the same time, does not seem to do more than what the lotion had done.  I will purchase one for myself and try it.</li>
    <li> Soft sponge, dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smell funny. Easily lathers up and while soft, still exfoliates.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;cruelty free&amp;#34; product; that&#x27;s what gave it the winning edge in my product comparisons. It&#x27;s lovely, soft, and because it&#x27;s larger, I was able to cut it in half to use it for my face, where it smooths skin and shrinks pores to beat the band! Just what I wanted. Frugal me.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love my new sponges. My skin has never felt to so soft. Just wish they were a little bigger. Will definitely be buying more when these wear out. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I keep forgetting to use this sponge.  I do like it.  I do like the way it moisterizes my skin.  I did not notice any improvement with circulation and that is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well.  My skin actually looks less dry and healthier!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  It&#x27;s so gentle and soft, that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m exfoliating at all, yet when I rinse away the soap, my skin is super soft.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine. I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive. I also have an uneven skin tone.For awhile now I have been using this routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel for a facial toner&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees Radiance Day Cream as a daytime moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil for a night time moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use an Aztec Clay Mask once a week for a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil for an overall body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;And I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine. And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is I already owned he Burts Bees Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Black Soap is a castile soap. I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft. The smell is okay. It smells like...well, soap. It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that. I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products. It can also be used to wash your hair, but I have yet to try that. I have however tried it as a cleaner while doing the dishes and I found it worked well as a household cleaner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel. It is a great toner. It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used. But it is better as I feel a sense of joy everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it. If you don’t use toners, I highly recommend it. There are plenty of websites out there that show all the benefits of using a toner between a cleanser and a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burts Bees Day Cream. I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it. I am a big fan of most ofthe Burts Bees products so it makes sense that I like this too. I will however attempt to just use rosehip oil as a moisturizer once this cream is gone, simply because it would be more simplistic to just have 1 and it will save me some money. If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products. It has recently gained popularity when model Miranda Kerr admitted to using it nightly on her skin. The smell isn’t good or bad. Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product. If you don’t like the smell of it, don’t worry. It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does. It makes my skin so SMOOTH! And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love. I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face. SO it will last quite awhile. I also love all the benefits it has. Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil. It makes a fantastic lotion. My skin has never been more smooth in my life. The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does. So I usually put this on first and let it start to work and then do the rest of my routine( hair, brush teeth, face, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aztec Clay Mask is such a simplistic face mask, yet it works better than any I have every used. It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne. I simply mix it with some Apple Cider Vinegar and put it on. I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry. I wash it off in the shower. Some don’t prefer to do this, but I haven’t had any problems doing so and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion. I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine. They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient. They are expected to last around 3 months. Even longer if you take better care of them. They are so soft! And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth. I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more. I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning. The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone. There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin. I then use the red clay body sponge for the same reasons. I have really dry skin and these help. I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this has helped if you are like me and looking to lessen the amount of chemicals you put on your skin. Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges are just the best for daily cleansing. No soap needed! My skin stays soft, even with keratosis pilaris.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive because of severe rosacea.  Using an ordinary wash cloth or sponge is too abrasive, but with the Konjac sponge I can clean it without irritation.  I plan on ordering more of these sponges.</li>
    <li> Great product with just the right texture and feel.  Through away the loofas and buff pads and go Konjac</li>
    <li> not the right cleaning tool for me, I feel like i am rubbing a piece of organ meat against my skin. weird is not a bad thing, and that is how this sponge feels. wrong is the correct term. after using for a few weeks, i threw it away. it just was taking up space in the shower caddy. i have no special skin conditions, just grime from hard work, and that was not removed.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is soft and smooth an lathers beautifully with a body wash. Much nicer than a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I have rosecea so exfoliating is an issue.  I bought the sponge for that reason and it has helped get rid of the dry skin on my face within 3 washings.  I did suffer a little bit more redness then usual after using the sponge but I think if I use it once or twice a week it will really make a difference in my skin tone.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a cleansing sponge to exfoliate your skin during the drier months this is a good option. You will wonder how something so soft can make your skin so clean and fresh but it is true. I&#x27;ve been using Konjac Sponges for a few months now and totally love them. I can&#x27;t see living without them. I use this sponge with [[ASIN:B00AJZOIZY Jason Pure Natural Body Wash with Soothing Aloe Vera]]. I mix the body wash with various essential oils. Right now I&#x27;m using balsam fir. You only need a few drops of essential oil in the body wash for a fun aromatherapy experience. These sponges don&#x27;t seem to break down quickly and last for months. I love this sponge and I think you will agree with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free sponge to review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It does make a big difference using these products. It is definitely bettey than a wash cloth or lufa. It does not harm your skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Super gentle and high quality product from Korea!!</li>
    <li> I have several sponges and they are all 5 stars!  I especially like the French Red Clay Sponge for showering...  I am over 65 and it is wonderful on mature skin!  Leaves it soft and moisturized!  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I really love the softness!  I feel so clean after using this sponge and like that it is made for mature skin.  I will continue buying this sponge, as it&#x27;s the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love the feel on my skin and the results of cleaner, more moist skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it but the quality isn&#x27;t there. My sponge fell apart but when it was new i loved how smooth it made my skin feel. I had to return this product due to that.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice big difference, still a nice sponge though.</li>
    <li> Works great, a little softer than the type of konjac sponge I use on my face but it&#x27;s wonderful and gentle!</li>
    <li> Love it get one you won&#x27;t find another one out there like this!!</li>
    <li> I love how soft this sponge is but sadly i only give four stars because it will not hold up for as long as it says it will</li>
    <li> Have used for one week and can already feel a difference.  My skin feels smoother</li>
    <li> I love my konjac sponges!!!!</li>
    <li> This was my second time ordering this sponge as it has been great for gentle cleansing for my sensitive skin. The first sponge I bought lasted nearly 3 months before it started falling apart and needed replaced. Unfortunately, the second time around the sponge only made it through 4-5 uses before it started falling apart. I contacted the seller and they promptly sent me not one, but two replacements for free, the next day. Service doesn&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice sponge, and I feel much better about using it than the cheap plastic loofahs from Wal-Mart or Bath and Body Works.  It&#x27;s much easier and softer on the skin which is great, I think that&#x27;s definitely what my skin needed was a gentler washing routine.  I love it, and so far it seems to rinse and dry fine and doesn&#x27;t ever smell weird or anything, which is more than I can say for the plastic loofahs I&#x27;ve had in the past.  The only things I think I&#x27;d change are the size and maybe the design.  This sponge is not very large, it fits in my open hand across palm and fingers.  It is also sometimes hard to hold, as when you add soap it obviously becomes slippery and doesn&#x27;t have much going on in the way of someplace to grip it.  It also does not have a string or anything to hang it with, but I don&#x27;t find that problematic, as I have a corner shower caddy with open grids in the shelves allowing the sponge to dry thoroughly between showers.  I came back and just bought the same brand and type for the smaller face-size and I can&#x27;t wait to get it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly like the &amp;#34;Boscia Konjac Cleansing Sponge With Deep Hydrating Clay&amp;#34; only this one is 3-times the size for less money.  Same texture, same color, same strength, same everything.  (I have a Boscia one hanging next to this one right now, but in the future I&#x27;m buying this one.)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with a hanging-string on it, but I fixed that with a needle and my own piece of string.  You could cut this sponge in half and have two nice-sized Konjac facial sponges.  I&#x27;ve been using this one on my body in the bath.  It seems to hold up as well as any Konjac will.  FYI: Konjac is a soft, last step, skin polishing sponge; not a rough, grime-removing loofa type sponge.  If you like Konjac, this is a great one.</li>
    <li> The sponge is amazing - my skin looks and feels clean and bright. However, it is a bit small, so it&#x27;s not easy to reach some places. Attach it to your loofa stick and all is well in the world.</li>
    <li> I have never used a Konjac sponge before. I was slightly reluctant to give it a try, but my skin was so flaky by mid afternoon no matter what kind of lotion I made or bought. Well that situation is a thing of the best. My legs are so smooth and soft now. I wish I would have tried it sooner. My order was processed and delivered with in two days and I have yet to see a lower price. Great person to deal with.</li>
    <li> I thought I loved this sponge but it wasn&#x27;t meant to be.&lt;br /&gt; I loved this sponge after using it once but the second time I thought something was wrong with the center of the thing because it seemed to have hollow areas and after using it (without soaps or anything other than warm water) it started to fall apart.  For the price I expect it to last more than a week!&lt;br /&gt;I have a small circular konjac sponge that I use on my face daily &amp; it hasn&#x27;t hd any problems. I wish this had worked out!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c4130d1a476615906d58ca68c309cbad]] I like using sponges to wash my face as well as my body. The sponges I use on regular basis are made from cellulose (i.e. wood pulp). Konjac sponge is made from the root of the Konjac plant (which is a potato-like plant). By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient. I included a photo of the Konjac sponge next to the cellulose sponge in my video, you can see the difference just by looking at them side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body sponge has a square shape and is larger than the other Konjac sponges. I found it to be a good size to use in the shower, The Konjac sponge feels very soft when wet and very hard when totally dry. It absorbs quite a lot of water. It suds up fairly well. It takes quite a long time to dry. Out of curious I left one sponge to dry without using it for several days and it took 3 days to totally dry. Each sponge has a string loop that allows you to hang it to dry, which helps to dry it on all sides. Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span. Based on what I read I expect to get 3 months out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different sponges to compare them to each other as it was not clear if they would feel significantly different from each other. I they feel quite similar to each other in terms of softness and resilience. I was happy to see that none of them had a scent. The difference in color comes from what the sponges were injected with, but none of them bleed any colors. The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Red Clay Sponge improves elasticity and texture of the skin.

Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using two sponges on regular basis for about 2 weeks now. I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges feel pleasant and soft. I like how my face feels after using them. If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively. Does it reduce the appearance of the pores? I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation. If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling. It is very gentle and soft. I think some of the marketing is just marketing (i.e. is a bit exaggerated).

    <li> Awesome awesome awesome...this sponge is just fabulous and shipment was just super fast.</li>
    <li> It is a nice sponge. It feel very nicely on my skin.  Somehow after I used for 2 weeks, I started to see a small little tear on the middle of the bar.  I have a feeling after couple more weeks of usage. It will tear apart.</li>
    <li> Bought this in my ongoing quest to avoid applying chemicals to my flesh. I&#x27;m using it straight from the package, as is, no cleanser. I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;m getting any LESS clean than if I were using a cleanser on a wash cloth. I like that I don&#x27;t have any phony fragrance about me. Will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that now my teen age granddaughter wants her own! Lol</li>
    <li> This sponge is wonderful for winter skin dryness. It has made such a difference in my winter time skin, no more itching and soft smooth skin! Where have these sponges been? Unlike loofa, which can be scratchy and harsh, this sponge is so soft you will think it can&#x27;t be doing anything. I have sensitive skin and was skeptical. Much to my surprise it worked like magic for me. I will continue to use Konjac sponges and promote its use.</li>
