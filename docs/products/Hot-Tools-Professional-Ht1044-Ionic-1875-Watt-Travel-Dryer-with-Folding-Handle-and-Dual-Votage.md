      <li>Nice size for travel, and dries ok.</li>
      <li>I love this blow dryer , its compact , powerful, flexible , works great and recommend it to others .</li>
      <li>, one more thing: when searching Amazon for &amp;#34;220V hair drier&amp;#34;, be very attentive to the results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d look for something more reliable if you are looking for a blow dryer to take on trips out of the US, though.</li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>Has plenty of power for a lightweight :)</li>
      <li>I love the attachments and can style my hair while drying it.</li>
      <li>and I love that it folds for storage.  </li>
      <li>Many will just swap out the malfunctioning product for you.  </li>
      <li>I searched on multiple websites trying to find the best combination of size and power.  </li>
      <li>It was lighter and more compact.</li>
      <li>Glad I got this travel size.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s ionic, it seems to make my hair softer and it gives it more volume.</li>
      <li>Was able to borrow another hair dryer the rest of the trip but couldn&#x27;t wait to get on Amazon and order a replacement, which is what I just did.  </li>
      <li>The heat and power are ok.</li>
      <li>and I think you will love it too.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is compact and lightweight.</li>
      <li>So glad I made this choice, give it a try</li>
      <li>I bought this dryer because I will be going to Europe this fall, well the dryer is just OK.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer and can&#x27;t wait to take it on my trip, but you can use it here in the USA as well.</li>
      <li>air power could have been better, but it&#x27;s not terrible</li>
      <li>It was perfect for my recent trip to Germany...</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m sure where ever you do go (hotel, motel, hostel, friend&#x27;s house) will already have on in the room.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and had been using hairdryers with diffuser for many years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an awesome dryer especially for the price!</li>
      <li>The airflow on high is good and strong and generates really good heat.  </li>
      <li>Very unique.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s much lighter in weight, has great power, comes with attatchments, and folds to make it so easy to pack.</li>
      <li>It is very light and easy to hod and maneuver around my head without the cord getting tangled up on the way.</li>
      <li>In my first year of owning this hair dryer, I loved everything about it.</li>
      <li>I have had this blow dryer for probably 2 years and its still SO powerful!!</li>
      <li>Loved this hair dryer so much that I began using it every day even after my trip.  </li>
      <li>I compacts very easily and  quickly for traveling.</li>
      <li>Works as well as a full size dryer yet much more compact.  </li>
      <li>It was light and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair and anything else</li>
      <li>And it folds and is light</li>
      <li>The light turned on but the air did not come out.</li>
      <li>I used it in S. Korea and also used it with my Conair converter &amp; sometimes without the converter but used just the adapter so it would fit into the plug outlets there.</li>
      <li>It does a great job on my short hair.</li>
      <li>- it will fit well in my roller board for business trips.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s also very powerful which is important for me.  </li>
      <li>It does not have a separate temp and volume control - you either get high (airflow and heat) or low - which is the perfect temp and flow for shorter hair.</li>
      <li>This dryer is a pretty color, a great medium size, has a diffuser included, for my natural curly hair, and dual voltage for my trip to Europe.  </li>
      <li>Strong motor dries hair quickly and leaves hair shiny.  </li>
      <li>Awesome finger diffuser in a small travel hairdryer.</li>
      <li>Very light, great for traveling or for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>Great little blowdryer :)</li>
      <li>Might be a little too powerful, but my hair rarely looks perfect when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>you can push the cool off button (trigger-like).However, it is a carpal tunnel syndrom in the making, trying to keep this button pushed while moving the fan around your head.</li>
      <li>The hair dryer is powerful, lightweight, comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I use the diffuser and it&#x27;s not as good as my big home diffuser</li>
      <li>If that is important to you, there are much lighter dryers available from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Super lite.</li>
      <li>As always, Amazon Prime got it to me quickly...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this one before, but this time there just isn&#x27;t enough heat coming out.</li>
    <li> too big for a travel dryer</li>
    <li> In my first year of owning this hair dryer, I loved everything about it. It was light and easy to use. The air flow was just right; I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was being blown all over the place. But after owning it for about a year and a half, I turned it on one morning and heard a loud popping noise.  The dryer died, flipping the breaker to the bathroom in the process. I hit the red reset button on the dryer, but only the light came on.  No hot air came out. I looked into repair costs, but since the dryer was barely out of warranty, Hot Tools would&#x27;ve charged me $46 (nearly double what I originally paid for it). I would re-purchase it, but premature death seems to be a chronic issue with this dryer. That&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair and this drys it in half the time of my other dryers&lt;br /&gt;Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for my travel bag too!!</li>
    <li> This dryer is a really great travel dryer(with dual voltage to boot!)  The airflow on high is good and strong and generates really good heat.  The low setting is also an appropriate styling airflow speed and a nice, slightly less hot temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef with this dryer is that its \\&quot;cool off\\&quot; button makes the airflow slow down dramatically and only makes the air temp slightly cooler.  If the \\&quot;cool off\\&quot; button kept the airflow strong while making the air temp cold, I would have given this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It definitely does its job... price was pretty adequate as well. Not a fan of the tacky purple color though. xD I didn&#x27;t really have a choice. Otherwise, a good average priced hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this since it was the only travel dryer with a finger-style diffuser attachment (my current travel dryer won&#x27;t take a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; one). But the diffuser attachment of this dryer is so open that it doesn&#x27;t diffuse at all. The air flow seems the same with or without the attachment, meaning it just frizzes out curly hair. It&#x27;s also not all that small for a travel dryer, nor very light. There are better travel dryer options on the market, and the diffuser is pretty pointless on this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a 3 week trip to Europe, but never actually needed to use it as all hotels had their own blow dryers.  However, it is now my go to blow dryer for at home! It dries my hair quicker than any other blow dryer I have ever owned, folds in half for easier storage, and is easy to hold in my hand.  I think it is too heavy for a travel dryer though.  It took up more room than others I have owned in the past, and weighed more as well.  If you want a good at home dryer, this one is great.  As far as travel goes, I would probably look for something else.</li>
    <li> Awesome finger diffuser in a small travel hairdryer. Very unique.</li>
    <li> Excellent and lightweight dryer,doesnt have as strong wind stream as most.But it amazingly dries hair fast without the high wind stream.I&#x27;m impressed and glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Though this has good heat for an 1875-watt dryer and is less noisy than other models, it broke down fairly quickly. Used 10-15 times in Europe on 220v, a few more than that in the US. After about 7 months, I started intermittently noticing a burning smell and got low power/heat when switching it on high (on 120v). Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I had been using another brand, a regular-sized portable  hair dryer with the same type of plug this has. It is the large plug end with two controls. One is for testing and I used that quite often on the original one which was irritating. When I bought this one and saw it had the same type of plug I was concerned. Well, I needn&#x27;t have been. I only had to push the test control in once and that was when I moved from one unit to another. Otherwise, when I press the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch, it comes on. I can push the upper one for high speed and the lower one for slow speed. Either way, my hair gets dry in the time it takes for me to sing one song. I don&#x27;t mean the hair is completely dry, but dry enough to let the air finish the job. It is very light and easy to hod and maneuver around my head without the cord getting tangled up on the way. I do not use either attachment that came with it as all I wanted was something to dry my hair with and I am not very particular on how I do that as long as it gets my hair dry. It does not seem to damage my hair any but then I never go to a salon so it is just my own opinion. I would not hesitate to buy another should the one I bought stop working, but so far it is performing as if it were new.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer , its compact , powerful, flexible , works great and recommend it to others . Great price as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from an Ulta store and the regular price of the item was 39.99 so I&#x27;m not really sure why it says on here that the original price is 99.99 but it&#x27;s listed for 24.50. Strange. But anyway..    I bought this dryer because I will be going to Europe this fall, well the dryer is just OK. It is pretty powerful considering its smaller size and the fact that it only has a DC motor as opposed to a more professional AC motor, it dried my hair OK but it made it kind of frizzy or unruly, the dryer is pretty loud, and the hinge where the handle folds kept snagging my hair while drying it.     The biggest reason why I returned it though is because while I was reading the dual voltage instructions, I saw that it said while using it on the 220v setting you can only use the dryer in LOW. I have really long hair and if I were to do that it would take WAY too long to dry.    So I decided to return it and I will just buy an inexpensive dryer once I get to Europe. Plus I&#x27;ll save some room and weight in my luggage.</li>
    <li> I ordered this dryer to go overseas with me. I ususally use a tourmaline, ionic, SpeedFreak dryer at home. I have fine curly hair and anything else will damage my hair and dry it out. This dryer was perfect! I had no problem with it adapting to outlets, it&#x27;s much lighter in weight, has great power, comes with attatchments, and folds to make it so easy to pack. Besides jeans and boots, my hair dryers have always been a pain to travel with. Now I never have to worry about it again! Do realize it&#x27;s not as small as a hotel dryer though, and that&#x27;s why it still has the power a good dryer needs, but it folds and the attatchments are small. It&#x27;s an awesome dryer especially for the price! I think I will have to buy some for Christmas gifts next year :)</li>
    <li> I can only recommend this travel hair dryer. I do like the defuser works well, and works well for 240V. Great product and I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted:  a travel hairdryer with dual voltage and a diffuser attachment!  I have yet to use it so I can&#x27;t comment on its functioning capability.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is listed as 11 oz, so I bought it for my trip to Europe, but I got it and it felt heavy so I weighed it on my kitchen scale and it is actually 18 oz. Buyer beware if the 11oz is essential to you.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer rivals my much more expensive home dryer.  Do not hesitate with this one, it works great and I am very picky about hairdryers.</li>
    <li> my roommate had this one and the power from hers was a lot stronger than mine! why?? it&#x27;s the same one! air power could have been better, but it&#x27;s not terrible</li>
    <li> Really like it, a little heavier than I expected.</li>
    <li> I only used it for about 8 times with computers locations when it finally broke down on a trip!!! Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this after her last hair dryer died. Need it for travel abroad where the hotels don&#x27;t always have a hair dryer in the room. Works well!</li>
    <li> This travel dryer does the job well!  Strong motor dries hair quickly and leaves hair shiny.  It works as well as my dryer at home.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you.  I&#x27;ve had one for over two years and never lost its power or heat.  I finally dropped it once to many times on my marble bathroom floor.  It still works but doesn&#x27;t fold for travel.</li>
    <li> Great little blowdryer :)</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and this travel dryer rivals my regular dryer in both performance and power. The diffuser is a little small, so it takes a little more time, but it&#x27;s worth it to have more space in my luggage. No more crappy hair on trips AND I can pack an extra pair of shoes!</li>
    <li> Had no issue after altering the voltage and using this dryer in Ireland with an adaptor . Not a lot of high heat drying power for my long thick hair, but good for what it was, and much better than the hotel dryers. I followed the recommendation however NOT to use on high power when operating under the 120V setting.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. I have very thick hair and it is long. It dries in no time with this! I am very pleased with the purchase. I use it on a regular basis, not only for travel (yes, it&#x27;s that great).</li>
    <li> When my old hair dryer stopped working (same exact make and model - 2 years old but I use it every day), I knew I wanted the same dryer again. It works beautifully, whether at home or away. Because it&#x27;s ionic, it seems to make my hair softer and it gives it more volume. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have alot of hair, that takes a long time to style.  This dryer is like my professional one, in a travel size. ( I am a professional hair stylist)  Don&#x27;t care if they have blowdryers in the hotel---this one is going with me.</li>
    <li> great hairdryer.  I purchased it for my trip to europe.  It worked perfectly and i like that it folds and doesn&#x27;t take much room in my suitcase.  But it&#x27;s also very powerful which is important for me.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This dryer is a pretty color, a great medium size, has a diffuser included, for my natural curly hair, and dual voltage for my trip to Europe.  It&#x27;s got plenty of power. I love this hair dryer and can&#x27;t wait to take it on my trip, but you can use it here in the USA as well. Hot tools is a quality brand and as a retired hairdresser I have other Hot tool products and they are very well made. So glad I made this choice, give it a try and I think you will love it too.</li>
    <li> Was just as advertised.  Perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all when I got it. D</li>
    <li> one of the best hair dryers I have. still working efficiently. excellent product</li>
    <li> We bought this travel hair dryer from Ulta. $40+ ! The Hot Tools people NEVER once answered my plea of the cool shot button function not working correctly.  It&#x27;s less than the year old for warranty coverage.  I sent four website form e-mail messages. Three, four days later I called their phone number.  I spoke with their customer non-service folks.  I told them the issue.  They won&#x27;t do a damn thing without any proof of purchase.  i.e. receipt, bank statement or credit card statement.  You want to do business with people like this?  That&#x27;s the last I&#x27;ll ever buy anything from them.  In this day and age of far better service than these morons, why do you want to waste your valuable money and time?  Many will just swap out the malfunctioning product for you.  Not Hot Tools.</li>
    <li> This is the third hairdryer I&#x27;ve bought only because everyone who uses it has taken it home with them.  I bought this hairdryer solely for when I travel for work.  However, it is so good I use it in place of my bigger (Baybliss) hair dryer.  Excellent value for money.</li>
    <li> This has been a great hair dryer. I used it in S. Korea and also used it with my Conair converter &amp; sometimes without the converter but used just the adapter so it would fit into the plug outlets there. I just changed the voltage accordingly and did not have any problems. It&#x27;s very powerful for a little dryer. Still using it now that I&#x27;m back in the US after changing back the voltage for US. HIGHLY recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> The heat and power are ok. However, the cool shot--which is very important to me--is not cool. It is warm, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was just what I needed for my trip to Europe this month.  It worked well both in Belgium and the UK.  It is a great size for carrying in a suitcase.  The dryer is relatively quiet and I appreciated the fact that it came with a diffuser.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Very light, great for traveling or for everyday use.  I chose this dryer to replace one that I had, and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I needed a dual voltage blow dryer with a diffuser for a trip to Italy and France.  My diffuser didn&#x27;t fit on the travel blow dryers I found locally, so I bought the Hot Tools one from Amazon.  As always, Amazon Prime got it to me quickly... no issues there.    However, the first time I tried to use it in Rome, I had it turned to the correct voltage, plugged it into my power adapter, and used it for about 30 seconds before it abruptly turned off.  Turns out it blew my power adapter.  We had used the power adapter for other items prior to the blow dryer with no issues, so I&#x27;m certain it was the blow dryer that fried it.  Since I paid $30 for it, I will keep it to use on domestic trips.  The small size does make it much easier to pack than my full-sized blow dryer.  I&#x27;d look for something more reliable if you are looking for a blow dryer to take on trips out of the US, though.</li>
    <li> Has plenty of power for a lightweight :)</li>
    <li> I have never wrote a review b before but i think this product deserves it. A great product, very powerful and still portable. I bought it for a two weeks trip to Europe after i had a bad hair time two months ago when i went to Denmark and i had to use the hotel hair dryer or my sweet 83 years old mother in law&#x27;s hairdryer. I use at home a professional hair dryer and I know how difficult it is to no to miss it when i travel however i decided to try this product after i spent many hours on-line trying to find a power converter powerful enough to use my hairdryer.  The best decision ever. It arrived promptly, i tried at  home and then i just switched to 220 once i arrived to Denmark and it performed great.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer for anyone on the go. I compacts very easily and  quickly for traveling. It is hot and the attachments fit and work very well!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and travel a lot for business.  I use a diffuser to blow dry my hair and never rely on hotels for a dryer.  Just got this in the mail to replace my old Conair dryer that I love but it&#x27;s cracked and is on it&#x27;s last legs after 5+ years.  This dryer works well - diffuser kept the curls, air flow was hot but not too hot, and it dried my hair quickly.  And it folds and is light - it will fit well in my roller board for business trips.  Well worth it if you are looking for a diffuser travel sized blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Used this in England and France. It was excellent. I have very thick hair and this made blow drying a breeze.</li>
    <li> This dryer seems to dry my old gray kinky hair faster than other dryers in this price range. I love the attachments and can style my hair while drying it. I would highly recommend this dryer for anyone!</li>
    <li> The only thing I was not happy with is that the low setting is too strong for drying with the defuser.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and very powerful.  I like that it came with multiple attachments and I love that it folds for storage.  The cool button works on both the high and low settings.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that there is no medium setting and it&#x27;s a little louder than my last dryer.</li>
    <li> I have long very curly hair that gets frizzy very easily so I invested in a Chi dryer which broke about 3 weeks ago.  While that is out being repaired I needed a replacement.  I am on the road 3-5 days per week and I always try to avoid checking a bag.  The chi (along with the diffuser) always took up a ton of space so I had been thinking about getting a travel size dryer for a while.  I searched on multiple websites trying to find the best combination of size and power.  I discovered that not many come with a travel size diffuser, which I absolutely have to have.  This one has it all.  I actually visited an Ulta to test 3 different dryers.  This one beat the others in several ways.  1) It was lighter and more compact. 2) It got hotter faster than any of the others 3) It was quieter and 4)The diffuser works well and actually does what it is supposed to do.  An added perk is it is dual voltage so when I go overseas I don&#x27;t have to take a converter for it.  All in all it has been doing the trick and I may not ever go back to the chi.</li>
    <li> this is a great hair tool to have.it folds up for easy loading into my bag. It is small but works like a big one. highly recommend</li>
    <li> Gives out great amount of heat and is compact just like it states. My only complaint is the cool shot button, when using takes the blow dry power down to practically nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about a year and a half ago to take on a trip to Europe.  Loved this hair dryer so much that I began using it every day even after my trip.  It is so light weight and dries my hair so fast.  I just brought it on another trip to Europe and forgot to turn the little dial for their wattage and burned it out in a few seconds.  Totally my fault.  Was able to borrow another hair dryer the rest of the trip but couldn&#x27;t wait to get on Amazon and order a replacement, which is what I just did.  I highly recommend this hair dryer both for travel and for every day use.  It may be a bit bigger for travel than some travel hair dryers but works so much better than any that I tried, one tiny Baby Bliss one that I tried previously burned out after the second use!  I leant my Hot Tools Travel hair dryer to my daughter in law when she and my son backpacked Europe last year and she felt it was small enough for that type of travel and she loved it as well.</li>
    <li> Great little portable hair dryer. I use the diffuser and it&#x27;s not as good as my big home diffuser but it does a great job for travelling.</li>
    <li> For travel or otherwise... this is a powerful and lightweight dryer. Easy to store, and complete with a diffuser!</li>
    <li> Although it is a bit bigger than I would have liked it to be because I wanted it to take up less space in my suitcase than my previous dryer, the dryer works so well that I am using it at home too. It dries my hair quickly on the low setting and it is quieter than my other dryer, Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I would order again it is small and the handle folds down for compact storage.  I recommend this for traveling.</li>
    <li> I used it about 5 times for less than 10 minutes each time. The next time i went to use it, it did not work. The light turned on but the air did not come out. It stopped working in less than a month.</li>
    <li> This was better than I expected.  Works as well as a full size dryer yet much more compact.  You could actually use it as you everyday dryer plus it has extra tools.</li>
    <li> It does a great job on my short hair. I love the fact that it is compact and lightweight. Has high, low, and cool burst setting. it folds to fit in a small drawer. It&#x27;s hard to find a dryer of this size with the 2 attachments.</li>
    <li> I used the hairdryer on vacation in Scotland.  I, of course, used it with a voltge adaptor.  It worked fine on low, but when I turned it to high, it burned out!!</li>
    <li> I have had this blow dryer for probably 2 years and its still SO powerful!! It dries probably 10 times as fast as my old Wal-Mart brand one.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this here in the US, but saving it for Europe as duel voltage.  I am sure it will work great as Hot Tools usually do.</li>
    <li> Returned the hairdryer without using it because the barrel is 7.5&amp;#34; long (not 6.5&amp;#34;); the handle and barrel together result in a height of 7.5&amp;#34; (not 5&amp;#34;) and, although I did not weigh it, I can attest that it is heavier than 11 oz, because it is heavier than my previous dryer, which weighs one pound. Another buyer had mentioned the weight -- I agree. If that is important to you, there are much lighter dryers available from Amazon.  will order a smaller dryer to replace it.</li>
    <li> Nice size for travel, and dries ok.Wish it blew harder.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this hair dryer. It was perfect for my recent trip to Germany...small, portable AND a diffuser! The first time I used it, I nearly burned my scalp it blew so hot. The only way I could use it was to constantly keep my finger on the cool shot button, which really wasn&#x27;t all that cool either. So disappointed. Returned.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It folds so fits nicely in suitcase</li>
    <li> Super lite. Girlfriend loves it. Pretty color to.</li>
    <li> Works great, good price, dries my long thick hair quickly (well, as quickly as long thick hair can be dried!), like the attachments. Not as small as I&#x27;d hoped but haven&#x27;t really found a truly small travel dryer that&#x27;s good quality. Would definitely purchase again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This dryer works like a regular big one.  I have long hair and rely soley on my dryer for a good look.  It has all the power needed to move long hair and I can&#x27;t believe the feature to switch over to European voltage.  Genius!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item In May 2014 for my trip to Scotland. Once it was plugged in and turned on I noticed sparks inside the air chamber. I shut it off and switched it back on then big sparks inside once again. The adapter and product voltage were both correct, needless to say I will NOT be using this item. If we had returned home in time I would have returned the hot tool ionic hairdryer immediately! My suggestion would be to buy the hairdryer when you get overseas. Also, I&#x27;m sure where ever you do go (hotel, motel, hostel, friend&#x27;s house) will already have on in the room. Unfortunately for me neither of those were an option.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this dual voltage blow dryer and it avoided any hair issues on our trip to Ireland.  Works well, compact size.  You will need a plug adapter though.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is awesome until it prematurely dies. My first one died within a 2 year period and my second one died in 7 months. So frustrating!!!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and had been using hairdryers with diffuser for many years. This is one of the worst hairdryer I&#x27;ve used. The heat from the air is way too hot even in the lower setting and the cold air button still emits hot air.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It fits well into my luggage and dries my hair pretty fast. Might be a little too powerful, but my hair rarely looks perfect when I&#x27;m traveling. Recommended for curly girls.</li>
    <li> Glad I got this travel size. It packs a lot of heat yet compact. Do consider it for its travel-friendly use.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a tirp to Russia. Used it for 2 weeks there. It did the job, but:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not have high enough air flow compared to US standard models&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not have a temperature adjustment and always blast on high heat. To lower the heat a bit (still quite warm) you can push the cool off button (trigger-like).However, it is a carpal tunnel syndrom in the making, trying to keep this button pushed while moving the fan around your head. There are simply not enough degrees of motion in your wrist joint to accomplish this:)&lt;br /&gt;3. Unless you have arms that can reach the floor while standing, forget about using those nozzle attachments. Or invite a good friend to service you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise packs well, no problem with voltage compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing: when searching Amazon for &amp;#34;220V hair drier&amp;#34;, be very attentive to the results. Some of the fans that come up in the search results are not 220V, but 110V (US). I acually bought one after this search because it had all the features I wanted, and regretfully had to return because there was no voltage switch. Moreover, the manual clearly said US.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is powerful, lightweight, comfortable to use. The attachment make it quite versatile.  The purple color makes it fun.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! Even though it&#x27;s a compact dryer its powerful enough for everyday use on my curly hair and when I travel I fold it up and take it with me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect! Bought it for traveling only, and use it evy day now. Bought a second one for my daughter. Great thing is it can be used overseas... Has the ability to change voltage. Really lightweight, so someone with difficulty holding up a big heavy blow dryer will find this to be Cy helpful.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is basic, compact and meets the everyday needs a person might have. It does not have a separate temp and volume control - you either get high (airflow and heat) or low - which is the perfect temp and flow for shorter hair. The screen cover on the back isn&#x27;t secured as well as it could be but this is also a minor item. The folding handle clicks firmly in position which I like. Overall, a solid feeling, well made little dryer. THAT SAID... I&#x27;m updating my review and downgrading by two stars because we&#x27;ve owned two of these handy little driers in the past 15 months and BOTH have had the power go out due to the electrical connection in the hinge of the folding handle. We use a wall hanger so we&#x27;re not constantly folding the handle either, maybe about three times per week max. I love this little drier but without working power, it&#x27;s just a pretty purple wall hanging...  Has anyone else had this problem or are we just unlucky twice in a row?</li>
    <li> This dryer works well. Plenty of air flow but very noisy. I like how the dryer folds to compact size for travel and works like big dryer but this dryer is also very noisy.</li>
