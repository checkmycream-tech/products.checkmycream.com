<li> The fragrance is lovely - a powdery floral with caramel and probably some vanilla, but was terribly disappointed by its performance.  </li>
<li> The product arrived only a day late, BUT, I just got them and all of the perfume leaked out of each of the little vials.  </li>
<li> Not sweet or fresh...not even vanilla scented.</li>
<li> It smells very odd.</li>

<li> Very disappointed after reading some positive reviews in magazines.  </li>

    <li> Very Sensuous, with sweet undertones.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments and I am very happy with the scent.</li>
    <li> The smell is very nice. The reason I ordered this was to sample both smells, but unfortunately I received to of same. That&#x27;s not what was advertised. There was supposed to have been the two Prada Candies with two different smells.</li>
    <li> did not smell like the one in the store</li>
    <li> Very disappointed after reading some positive reviews in magazines.  They were being kind. I can find&lt;br /&gt; Very little good to say&lt;br /&gt; About this product. It smells very odd. Not sweet or fresh...not even vanilla scented.</li>
    <li> I bought Prada Candy after sniffing a sample in a fashion magazine. The fragrance is lovely - a powdery floral with caramel and probably some vanilla, but was terribly disappointed by its performance.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I had to retouch it almost hourly.  I thought perhaps it was just my skin, but friends have the same experience. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love... One word that&#x27;s it. LOVE</li>
    <li> I was surprised that I recieved 2 fragrance scent samples .  The Prada Candy as well as Calvin Klein.  Both fragrances were very well liked.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect way for me to get to try this item without buying a full size, expensive bottle! The vials are not completely full (amount shown in pic description is about right)  But they do contain a good little bit &amp; since this is a stronger, longer lasting perfume, a little goes a long way! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I first saw this at one of the boutiques in Epcots Italy pavillion and loved it, I purchased the samples just so I could have a little reminder of my trip without getting the entire bottle. I find myself going to this one often so a larger purchase will definitely be in my future! It&#x27;s a great sweet (not too sweet) summer scent that can be worn day or night.</li>
    <li> Maybe I should of read the quantity that I was getting but 2 samples for 12 bucks.  Next time I will go to the store and get the samples for free instead of paying for it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived only a day late, BUT, I just got them and all of the perfume leaked out of each of the little vials.  Total waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> Came across this fragrance through a magazine sample.  Loved it and had to try it.  Soft, flowery and feminine.  Now I need to purchase a bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Calvin Klein devotee for years. I&#x27;m sorry Cal I&#x27;m switching to this Prada parfum. I L O V E this yummy! I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great way to try a perfume when you do not live by a big city without spending a fortune to see if you like it. Smells great!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells like heaven. It is so super feminine. Smells like a more grown up version of Pink Sugar by Aqualina.</li>
    <li> Twelve dollars is way to expensive for a free sample. I was under the impression this was travel size. Also item is not &amp;#34;eligible for returns&amp;#34;. bummer</li>
