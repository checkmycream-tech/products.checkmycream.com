    <li> Great price and service!</li>
    <li> I wear false a as part of my regular makeup. Only a few people know this. These are the best lashes I have found so far. I cook and bake a lot and the other brands melt from the heat of the oven. I can use the clear adhesive from the bottle, dip the tip and adhere and they last a couple days even after washing eye makeup off. These lashes are amazing!</li>
    <li> Best eye lashes ever ordered. Great price as well . love these</li>
    <li> Great bargain.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This product was excellent and they got it to me in a timely manor</li>
    <li> I regularly use lashes, so when I saw this deal I was concerned about the quality, cheap lashes can rip apart just trying to remove them from the tray. However, this was a great buy!</li>
    <li> Came very fast although in my set it was an flare long and an flare under so I was short to packs contacted customer care but overall excellent for price would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Love these for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Ordering them for a third time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these from cherish the look for over a year . I wear eyelashes everyday all day . To bed , in the shower , I wash my face , take off my makeup . I use regular Ardell glue and these stay on for weeks at a time with the occasional filling in . I love these eyelashes they feel good they look good nice and natural nothing super fake and trashy looking . In a little over a year of buying these I&#x27;ve only received one defective order and was refunded the same day . The product is great and the seller .</li>
    <li> Great value! Most are in good condition &amp; go on nice. Don&#x27;t have individual plastic contains to protect but worth the money to save.</li>
    <li> I have been getting my individual eyelashes done by two different salons for over a year and after getting tired of making appointments and paying, I decided to buy these with the Ardell LashTite Adhesive (Dark).  The quality of the eyelashes are great (same as the salons) and for the quantity you receive, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The lashes are not too short (waste of time) or too long (fake looking), they are perfect in length!</li>
    <li> got this within three days after ordering. :&#x27;] the eye lashes were great, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the length of it. I thought it was a bit long.  When I compared it to the ones I bought at walmart and they are longer. still good quality. I will definitely order from them again</li>
    <li> Great product when on the go and want to fill in lashes for a more natural look. Probably not the sellers fault but when I received my order the product was damaged in some places from USPS, should use bubble wrap</li>
    <li> They are a lot thinner than I thought they would be. I have to use too many to accomplish a full look.</li>
    <li> I always wear fake eyelashes and normally I&#x27;d wear Ardell brand of lashes. However, when you wear them as much as I do, you want lashes for as cheap as possible, in bulk, and great quality. It&#x27;s a challenge to find all three of those descriptions in eyelash buying. I loved that I was getting 10 packs and was iffy on a no name brand. I read the other reviews and trusted them. I was expecting my package this coming week but got it yesterday. Delivery was very fast. When I opened the package, I was overjoyed with the quality. Each lash was perfectly groomed and intact. I am extremely pleased with my purchase and if this deal with 10 packs for the affordable price continues, I intend on buying more.</li>
    <li> This lashes are great! Better than what you can buy at a Beaty supply store. They come out of the package very easily unlike some lashes. So you don&#x27;t ruin any of them when taking them out.</li>
    <li> Love the lashes. Goes on perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Crazy Fast shipping! Quality just like the picture!</li>
    <li> My eyes are a bit bland and where I work, I can&#x27;t really go all crazy with make-up. These babies give me just enough pop to my almond shaped eyes without drawing too much attention.</li>
    <li> These should be listed as LONG lashes, but work well</li>
    <li> Cheap...they break when removing from tray to easily</li>
    <li> Love these! They work well for naturally enhancing eyelashes and great for my professional makeup artist kit. I will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> THEY TEAR REALLY EASY..MAYBE A BAD BATCH..</li>
    <li> Love them! I was skeptical about them but they have more than meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> These are just the same quality as individual lashes you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore, except they&#x27;re a lot cheaper. I will say that these are a bit longer than then Ardell mediums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist, so I do a lot of lashes. They can get pretty expensive. I was blown away when I read the reviews and then saw the price. Not only do they look good, but the price is a steal.</li>
    <li> These are great lashes, and much more reasonable than store-bought ones!&lt;br /&gt;They are various lengths, and very nice! I recomend these!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! The lashes are fantastic. I&#x27;m very picky about my lashes and each and every pack is great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Yay!!! I ordered this product on the June .24th 2014 a couple of days ago and I got in the mail today. June 26 2014 ! Yay ! I have not used my lashes yet but I look forward to it. Iam happy I got it soooo fast! I will reorder from this buyer again! Thank u! Also I have used these lashes before so I know they are good!</li>
    <li> Great lashes, worth the money. Quick delivery!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product 😊&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money. .</li>
    <li> I love medium flare lashes. That&#x27;s all I wear. These are a grea buy very reasonable. And very good quality</li>
    <li> I like them because there really cheap and awesome. I feel like the long &amp; medium are the same. I wear my eyelashes for almost 7 days if I don&#x27;t have any nightmares.Sometimes I use a non heated eyelashes curler upside down to stop theme from beading works every time. hopes this helps someone!</li>
    <li> Nice and shipping was fast</li>
