      <li>Very fast delivery!!!  </li>
      <li>I love shopping through Amazon</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Buy Nail Magic.  </li>
      <li>For years on &amp; off I&#x27;ve used Nail Magic.  </li>
      <li>You just put a coat of Magic Nail Treatment on your nails 2 or 3 days in a row and then remove and begin the process again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Believe me you&#x27;ll be so glad with this product.  </li>
      <li>Now I can&#x27;t find it locally, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have told dozens of people about this product over the years, and many of them have become Nail Magic lifers like me.</li>
      <li>I tried Nail Magic after seeing that ad and it changed everything.  </li>
      <li>I used nail magic once and it made my nails longer and stronger.</li>
      <li>I had really prominent ridges in my nails and after using nail magic the disappeared.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s interesting to me that the original ad I saw was for a nice department store.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had great natural nails until two years ago when they began splitting (horizontally!)</li>
      <li>arrived fast with good instructions.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s important that my nails be protected from breaking easily</li>
      <li>and I get free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I kind of forget about it (and my nails) when real life took over.</li>
      <li>I still use it and my nails are long and beautiful again.  </li>
      <li>I should post photos of these beautiful, hard, claws I have :)</li>
      <li>sister told me about Nail Magic and really likes the product.</li>
      <li>I am still on my first bottle, too!</li>
      <li>Yes, they break sometimes, but overall I have consistently nice nails.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always said that I&#x27;d do Nail Magic ads for free, and this Amazon review finally gave me the chance to sort of do that.</li>
      <li>Since I found this again, I rarely break a nail.</li>
      <li>I used Nail Magic many years ago and never had a problem, but I am very careful when applying it.</li>
      <li>really - \\&quot;You really wouldn&#x27;t believe the difference it makes in creating strong nails!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I use this at least twicea week and have seen great enhancement in my nails.</li>
      <li>When I saw this on Amazon, I thought it was the same Nail Magic that I have tried that is sold by Dr Leonard&#x27;s catalogs, but I was mistaken.  </li>
      <li>I have used tons of different products like this and NOTHING worked as well as Nail Magic.  </li>
      <li>Now with more time to putz with and grow my nails, I searched for it and low and behold of course Amazon had it!  </li>
      <li>I like this product as much as I like the regular Nail Magic.  </li>
      <li>Fixed them right up!</li>
      <li>I pretty much use it by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is the only way that I can have strong nails.</li>
      <li>I have used this product off and on for the last 15 years and it really helps the nails grow &amp; helps make them strong.  </li>
      <li>I have had short nails my whole life that peeled and broke extremely easily.  </li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m using it to grow my nails long as I am attending a wedding in October &amp; want long nails for it that are my own &amp; not fake.  </li>
      <li>you want the REAL thing - a nail strengthener that protects your polish also - then get the one sold by Dr Leonard.  </li>
      <li>But with the nail magic I can do a french manicure and have it last for a week without chipping and if I add some top coat thoughout the week I can get it to last two weeks.  </li>
      <li>I bought this from Sally Beauty Supply because it&#x27;s much cheaper there.</li>
      <li>If you want a product to strengthen your nails and also make them grow fast, &amp;#34;Nail Magic&amp;#34; is the nail product to purchase.</li>
      <li>This stuff works very well.  </li>
      <li>Anyway I did buy the products from Amazon but found it much cheaper at Walgreens 5.99.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve told a few friends at work about it too over the yrs &amp; they tried it and really liked it as well.</li>
      <li>Normally I don&#x27;t polish my nails at all</li>
      <li>but it is worth it because it actually works.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used the Nail Magic long enough to know if it is going to harden my nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Right now my nails are starting to grow</li>
      <li>much better than fake nails-i have used this product for 18 months and my nails are long and very strong.</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life I could have ten natural nails at a nice length at the same time, instead of a few nice ones and a few short scraggly ones.  </li>
      <li>When I moved back to the Atlanta area, I found it at a department store at first, and then for years at drug stores.  </li>
      <li>Goes on well, doesnt get thick in the bottle, looks really nice, dries fast, makes my nails harder and very glossy, and no overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>Last year I bought Nail Magic in desperation when my nails were a mess</li>
      <li>This product is certainly making my nails stronger even though I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>It looks like clear nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Now my nails look natural, feminine, and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far tho</li>
      <li>But sometimes I have to buy directly from the merchant and this is one of those instances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this stuff since I saw an ad in the Dayton, Ohio newspaper in the early 80s.  </li>
      <li>I like them natural</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked and</li>
      <li>My hands are busy and I wash them throughout the day</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and I will be making future purchases.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle to keep my nails long and pretty!</li>
      <li>You can use it alone, as a base coat, or a top coat, though I&#x27;ve not used it as a top coat.  </li>
      <li>This one is a poor imitation of the REAL nail magic product.  </li>

<li> Oh and I type alllllll day long.</li>
<li> It dries completely in just a few minutes, fewer than five.  </li>
<li> how long it lasted before I had to refresh the coat.  </li>
<li> Now I file them because they get too long.</li>
<li> The trick is keeping it on your nails at all times and not letting them dry out.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t have super long nails, but that&#x27;s not the look I want, or I&#x27;d just do fake nails.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t do a double coat in one sitting, for whatever reason it makes my nail beds sore and a slight burning sensation.</li>
<li> I would not allow teenagers to use this as kids are not always as careful as they must be to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Of course, you can&#x27;t use your nails as screwdrivers or scrapers but, if you don&#x27;t do industrial dishwashing and other damaging things, your nails will grow out reliably if you follow the directions on the package.</li>
<li> I wouldnt buy it or any other nail growh fornula.</li>
<li> but since it subsides after a little while I just deal.  </li>
<li> With out this I never filed them much as they were always breaking when I tried to grow them and would end up cutting them off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always had great natural nails until two years ago when they began splitting (horizontally!) during the winter.  Last year I bought Nail Magic in desperation when my nails were a mess and I was holding two together with tape and glue.  I followed the directions faithfully for three months and, as promised, my nails grew.  I still use it and my nails are long and beautiful again.  I am still on my first bottle, too!</li>
    <li> This product has helped my nails recover from dents and peeling.  I use this at least twicea week and have seen great enhancement in my nails.</li>
    <li> not what I thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> This nail hardener does a great job on the nails</li>
    <li> I have had short nails my whole life that peeled and broke extremely easily.  After using this product I have long, hard nails!  It only took about a month for my desired results.  I have used tons of different products like this and NOTHING worked as well as Nail Magic.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> this didnt do anything and was overpriced. I wouldnt buy it or any other nail growh fornula. Deal with what you have or get some fake ones. Period. Youll see htis stuff does NOT WORK!</li>
    <li> much better than fake nails-i have used this product for 18 months and my nails are long and very strong.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it improves my nails</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I could never grow nails as they always broke or chipped. After using this for a few weeks I noticed a difference. Now I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle to keep my nails long and pretty!</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well.  I have used this product off and on for the last 15 years and it really helps the nails grow &amp; helps make them strong.  I had really prominent ridges in my nails and after using nail magic the disappeared.</li>
    <li> I like this product as much as I like the regular Nail Magic.  I think the conditioner part of the product is very worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Perfect, for splitting nails. Fixed them right up!</li>
    <li> This product is the only way that I can have strong nails. Works great</li>
    <li> I bought this from Sally Beauty Supply because it&#x27;s much cheaper there. Unfortunately, it did nothing for my nails, and the polish continually peels off.</li>
    <li> My long nailed Mother introduced this to me in 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s.  It was amazing what it did for my breaking/ chipping nails I was trying to grow from finally stopping biting them. I kind of forget about it (and my nails) when real life took over. Now with more time to putz with and grow my nails, I searched for it and low and behold of course Amazon had it!  I should post photos of these beautiful, hard, claws I have :) Seriously, they grow faster/ longer/ stronger.  Since I found this again, I rarely break a nail. Oh and I type alllllll day long. With out this I never filed them much as they were always breaking when I tried to grow them and would end up cutting them off. Now I file them because they get too long. Yep, good stuff. It does have a small stronger then norm nail product odor and I don&#x27;t care one bit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff since I saw an ad in the Dayton, Ohio newspaper in the early 80s.  My nails are naturally weak, and used to be so thin that I could actually read through them.  I tried Nail Magic after seeing that ad and it changed everything.  For the first time in my life I could have ten natural nails at a nice length at the same time, instead of a few nice ones and a few short scraggly ones.  Women with weak nails will know what I mean by that.  Now my nails look natural, feminine, and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have super long nails, but that&#x27;s not the look I want, or I&#x27;d just do fake nails.  Yes, they break sometimes, but overall I have consistently nice nails.  I receive a lot of compliments on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have told dozens of people about this product over the years, and many of them have become Nail Magic lifers like me. Only one woman told me that it didn&#x27;t work for her, and the company refunded her money.  It&#x27;s interesting to me that the original ad I saw was for a nice department store.  When I moved back to the Atlanta area, I found it at a department store at first, and then for years at drug stores.  Now I can&#x27;t find it locally, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get it on your cuticles, they will be a little hard, so try to keep it just on your nails.  It dries completely in just a few minutes, fewer than five.  It looks like clear nail polish.  You can use it alone, as a base coat, or a top coat, though I&#x27;ve not used it as a top coat.  I pretty much use it by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always said that I&#x27;d do Nail Magic ads for free, and this Amazon review finally gave me the chance to sort of do that.</li>
    <li> I used nail magic once and it made my nails longer and stronger. I was happy when I found it here. The price was reasonable and I will be making future purchases.</li>
    <li> Peels and doesn&#x27;t last compared to OPI Nail Envy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a no go for men since it&#x27;s shinny like glass.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it hardens nails but it doesn&#x27;t last and it&#x27;s too shiny.</li>
    <li> For years on &amp; off I&#x27;ve used Nail Magic.  I&#x27;m a nail biter &amp; I&#x27;ve used this to help me stop.  Right now I&#x27;m using it to grow my nails long as I am attending a wedding in October &amp; want long nails for it that are my own &amp; not fake.  You have to follow the directions of applying it 2 times a wk.  Right now my nails are starting to grow &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 1/2 wks.  I&#x27;ve told a few friends at work about it too over the yrs &amp; they tried it and really liked it as well.</li>
    <li> Nail Magic is the absolute best product I have ever found to strengthen nails.  An Ulta salesperson recommended it to me and I got hooked.  Then the store discontinued it and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except on Amazon.  It sounds like an low-budget ad, but really - \\&quot;You really wouldn&#x27;t believe the difference it makes in creating strong nails!\\&quot;  It does indeed seem magical!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year (plus taking Biotin) and my nails look amazing. Normally I don&#x27;t polish my nails at all I like them natural and I hate chipping nail polish.  But with the nail magic I can do a french manicure and have it last for a week without chipping and if I add some top coat thoughout the week I can get it to last two weeks.  I gave the 4 starts because it does some else that&#x27;s really weird.  I can&#x27;t do a double coat in one sitting, for whatever reason it makes my nail beds sore and a slight burning sensation. Weird right?&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have some allergy to something in the product but since it subsides after a little while I just deal.  Anyway I did buy the products from Amazon but found it much cheaper at Walgreens 5.99.  I hope this is heplful.</li>
    <li> This product is certainly making my nails stronger even though I have only been using it for a couple of weeks. You just put a coat of Magic Nail Treatment on your nails 2 or 3 days in a row and then remove and begin the process again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negative which I knew when I purchased the product. You must not get this on your cuticle or skin. It can damage the nail bed. I used Nail Magic many years ago and never had a problem, but I am very careful when applying it. I would not allow teenagers to use this as kids are not always as careful as they must be to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up great product, does what it says, but use with caution!</li>
    <li> When I saw this on Amazon, I thought it was the same Nail Magic that I have tried that is sold by Dr Leonard&#x27;s catalogs, but I was mistaken.  This one is a poor imitation of the REAL nail magic product.  It does not stay on your nails and it does not protect your polish from chipping.  My hands are busy and I wash them throughout the day so it&#x27;s important that my nails be protected from breaking easily and I hate chipped nail polish.  This one sold on Amazon fails to do the job.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  You will NOT get the desired results.  I love shopping through Amazon so I will always check to see if the product I want is offered on Amazon because sometimes it will be cheaper and I get free shipping.  But sometimes I have to buy directly from the merchant and this is one of those instances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the REAL thing - a nail strengthener that protects your polish also - then get the one sold by Dr Leonard.  It&#x27;s a small bottle and the cost is $5 but it is worth it because it actually works.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked and how long it lasted before I had to refresh the coat.  It makes my nails shiny and it worked wonderfully.  I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Just got this so it may take up to 8 weeks to see results.  So far tho - it&#x27;s peeling off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have tried so many nail hardeners and like Nail Envy the best but it yellows.</li>
    <li> All these products are good.</li>
    <li> Goes on well, doesnt get thick in the bottle, looks really nice, dries fast, makes my nails harder and very glossy, and no overpowering smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> arrived fast with good instructions.  Works well. Had no idea this was such an established product. Will continue to use it and evaluate the results which take time.</li>
    <li> If you want a product to strengthen your nails and also make them grow fast, &amp;#34;Nail Magic&amp;#34; is the nail product to purchase. It is  amazing. It actually soaks into your nail, it doesn&#x27;t just lay on your nails.  Buy Nail Magic.  Believe me you&#x27;ll be so glad with this product.  I absolutely love Nail Magic and you will too!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery!!!  Haven&#x27;t used the Nail Magic long enough to know if it is going to harden my nails.&lt;br /&gt;My sister told me about Nail Magic and really likes the product.</li>
    <li> This is the only nail treatment that ever worked for me. Of course, you can&#x27;t use your nails as screwdrivers or scrapers but, if you don&#x27;t do industrial dishwashing and other damaging things, your nails will grow out reliably if you follow the directions on the package. The trick is keeping it on your nails at all times and not letting them dry out. This works well for me.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS FORMALDEHYDE IN IT.  Why is this not listed! it only lists: Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;N-Butyl Alcohol, Butyl Acetate, n-Amyl Acetate, 2-Butoxyethanol, Ethyl 3-Ethoxypropionate, Nitrocelulose, Water, Methylene Glycol, Gelatin, CI17200 (Red 33)&lt;br /&gt;When I received it there was a warning label on it stating it has formaldehyde and may cause cancer.  I would not have bought it if I had known.</li>
    <li> I had bought this for my nails because I had a bit of ripples on my nails and it actually worked over time. good product.</li>
