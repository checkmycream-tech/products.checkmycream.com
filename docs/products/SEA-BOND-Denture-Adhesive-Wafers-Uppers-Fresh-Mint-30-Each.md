### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very excellent will continue to buy them from Amazon !</li>
      <li>These are the best dentureadhesives out there</li>
      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>A friend told me a very good remedy.</li>
      <li>BUT....I will update this review after the re-line to give them a fair shot!</li>
      <li>It is great</li>
      <li>Hopefully the re-line of my denture in about 5 months time will create perfect suction and I won&#x27;t have to use any kind of adhesive.</li>
      <li>Ok...this is a good product.</li>
      <li>good product for uppers....not so good for lowers</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with product, cost &amp; time of delivery.</li>
      <li>These hold surprisingly well if you spritz them sparingly and make sure to give them a minute or two to set in your mouth before eating.  </li>
      <li>Does as advertised and the mint  taste is nice.</li>
      <li>My dentist tells me that my gums have healed beautifully, and thinks that the pure liquid diet has helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best stuff out there for upper dentures</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>He has no complaints and says it&#x27;s a lot better than the gooey stuff he used to use.</li>
      <li>BUT THAT IS OK.</li>
      <li>and I was able to eat the food without the denture rocking side to side.</li>
      <li>Love the service and the product.</li>
      <li>I love the way they work.  </li>
      <li>I would love to be able to purchase it a bit cheaper or find coupons for a better deal.</li>
      <li>I may not need them any more.</li>
      <li>I bought it from Walgreen for $9.99 for 30, so 33 cents each, which is 50 per cent more than the price from this vendor, $20.32 for 90 wafers, which comes to about 23 cents per copy, or $84 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to any one looking to save &amp; be satisfied.</li>
      <li>More soon....:)</li>
      <li>And I DO hope that they&#x27;ll work, because they are much simpler to use than the gel and paste alternatives, and taste a lot better, too!!</li>
      <li>But in the meantime, Sea-bond is doing a pretty good job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are easy to put in, easy to take off, and are fabulously easy to keep my teeth clean from germs.  </li>
      <li>These fit my husband just fine.  </li>
      <li>and they just don&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
      <li>and I feel comfortable with it and can eat anything without worry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(The re-line improves the fit of the denture to the gums).  </li>
      <li>I tried Super Poligrip with ooze-control tip, claiming &amp;#34;Super strong, all-day hold&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It is quite remarkable, but six front teeth is enough to convince others you have a full set of choppers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about a week the denture stayed in place without any adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no cream or jell,just clean sheet of bond.</li>
      <li>Results were very similar to Fixodent except that it wasn&#x27;t effective from day</li>
      <li>I find the Sea-bond superior to the other two products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Now I am moistening a lot more heavily, and finding better results in terms of adhesion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These help hold Moms uppers really well!</li>
      <li>Namely, apply two layers of powdered dental adhesive, one layer to the denture (that should be moistened), then lay the Sea-Bond patch on the powdered denture, then apply a second layer of powder, on top of the Sea-Bond patch (that should also be moistened.  </li>
      <li>(At first removing the denture was a pretty ouchie experience, but now it does not hurt at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was my first denture</li>
      <li>We find  the &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; her first choice.</li>
      <li>Sure beats buying local..</li>
      <li>These adhesive wafers do an OK job as long as you don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
      <li>Take too large of a piece</li>
      <li>Before my rear molars were extracted I started on a 100 per cent liquid diet, which in my case has been absolutely wonderfully better than my previous solid food diet in terms of energy and weight, because I chose carefully what I would be having, which was about 50 per cent Soylent and 50 per cent high nutrition soups made out of fish and kale and other good stuff and blended until silky smooth in a strong blender (I purchased a Blendtec after considering VItamix and Ninja).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The amount of material I have to cut off then throw away would probably make another 10 wafers but won&#x27;t work properly if try to fit them together.  </li>
      <li>I started out gently moistening.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m using Fixodent Extra Hold Powder.  </li>
      <li>When I get my new teeth</li>
      <li>S&amp;S is really charging over the top prices lately on these..</li>
      <li>On March 4th 2015 I had my six upper front teeth pulled and a full denture installed, one that relies only on suction, with no anchoring teeth or anchoring posts.  </li>
      <li>I always dislike leaving a less than positive review, but this product is very much overrated and did not deliver.  </li>
      <li>It worked well for about a week and then started to be less and less effective, and had the strong disadvantage of leaving a lot of scummy feeling residue on the roof of my mouth, that took quite a little while to remove with paper towels and toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Try to manipulate the wafer inside the denture shell so it covers as much area as possible, especially the front vertical section; it takes quite a bit of maneuvering the wet wafer to make it conform to the front vertical section, but I find it makes a huge difference in terms of stability;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use these daily and was very pleased to find them packaged in larger quantity than the usual 15 pack.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s early days yet.</li>
      <li>Someone tells me that powdered adhesives plus Sea Bond work well for them, but I have not tried this so far.</li>
      <li>Other than the waste I love them!</li>
      <li>I have found it helps tremendously to cut food into little itty bits.  </li>
      <li>There is no other fixative she likes like these.</li>
      <li>Has to be one solid piece to hold steady and properly.  </li>
      <li>Under pressure from my better half, I have been very slowly learning to consume little bits of solid food, so as to vary my diet a bit more.  </li>
      <li>Even though I have to cut them down to my size before I put them on, they are easy to put in, I don&#x27;t have any trouble with my teeth all day.  </li>
      <li>the past weeks the Sea-bond has been less and less effective and my choppers have been loose much of the time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> On March 4th 2015 I had my six upper front teeth pulled and a full denture installed, one that relies only on suction, with no anchoring teeth or anchoring posts.  This was my first denture so I am a denture newbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: About 8 weeks before my six upper front teeth were removed, I had my eight upper rear teeth extracted, leaving a coverup of six front teeth.  This maneuver means that I always had front teeth in the mouth, sometimes real, and sometimes fake, so that I never appeared to be embarrassingly toothless.  It is quite remarkable, but six front teeth is enough to convince others you have a full set of choppers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about a week the denture stayed in place without any adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it began to get loose and to fall out uncontrollably, I tried Fixodent Denture Adhesive Cream claiming &amp;#34;Strong, All Day Hold, Food Seal, Comfort&amp;#34;.  It worked well for about a week and then started to be less and less effective, and had the strong disadvantage of leaving a lot of scummy feeling residue on the roof of my mouth, that took quite a little while to remove with paper towels and toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Super Poligrip with ooze-control tip, claiming &amp;#34;Super strong, all-day hold&amp;#34;.  Results were very similar to Fixodent except that it wasn&#x27;t effective from day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then on March 23 I saw my dentist, 19 days after the fake teeth were put in place, and told him of my problems with the denture being unstable and falling out.  He recommended the Sea-bond product.  Additionally he said that some patients combine the Sea-bond wafers with denture adhesive cream like Fixodent or Poligrip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed his advice and purchased the Sea-bond immediately. What an improvement !!  I bought it from Walgreen for $9.99 for 30, so 33 cents each, which is 50 per cent more than the price from this vendor, $20.32 for 90 wafers, which comes to about 23 cents per copy, or $84 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet despite the improved adhesion, I am not finding the denture painful to remove, though maybe this is because I did not start using it until 19 days after the front teeth were removed, so the gums had more time to heal. (At first removing the denture was a pretty ouchie experience, but now it does not hurt at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hints to denture newbies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;  Before any teeth are removed, change your diet to an all liquid diet.  Before my rear molars were extracted I started on a 100 per cent liquid diet, which in my case has been absolutely wonderfully better than my previous solid food diet in terms of energy and weight, because I chose carefully what I would be having, which was about 50 per cent Soylent and 50 per cent high nutrition soups made out of fish and kale and other good stuff and blended until silky smooth in a strong blender (I purchased a Blendtec after considering VItamix and Ninja).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meant I did not make my gums sore trying to eat solid food. Also my weight declined from about 195 to about 180, and has remained there.  My dentist tells me that my gums have healed beautifully, and thinks that the pure liquid diet has helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D; Try to manipulate the wafer inside the denture shell so it covers as much area as possible, especially the front vertical section; it takes quite a bit of maneuvering the wet wafer to make it conform to the front vertical section, but I find it makes a huge difference in terms of stability;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D; Cut as little as possible from the wafer;  I have quite a small head and a small mouth for a male, but I&#x27;ve found it beneficial not to cut the wafer at all, and instead to make sure I cover every bit of the denture surface, even with a little overlap beyond the denture edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D; The instructions on the package say &amp;#34;moisten&amp;#34; the wafer and do not saturate. I started out gently moistening. Now I am moistening a lot more heavily, and finding better results in terms of adhesion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D; Under pressure from my better half, I have been very slowly learning to consume little bits of solid food, so as to vary my diet a bit more.  I have found it helps tremendously to cut food into little itty bits.  Take too large of a piece and it&#x27;s likely to dislodge the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... to sum up... I find the Sea-bond superior to the other two products I&#x27;ve tried.  Someone tells me that powdered adhesives plus Sea Bond work well for them, but I have not tried this so far. It&#x27;s early days yet. Hopefully the re-line of my denture in about 5 months time will create perfect suction and I won&#x27;t have to use any kind of adhesive. (The re-line improves the fit of the denture to the gums).  But in the meantime, Sea-bond is doing a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: October 6 2015&lt;br /&gt;For the past weeks the Sea-bond has been less and less effective and my choppers have been loose much of the time.  A friend told me a very good remedy. Namely, apply two layers of powdered dental adhesive, one layer to the denture (that should be moistened), then lay the Sea-Bond patch on the powdered denture, then apply a second layer of powder, on top of the Sea-Bond patch (that should also be moistened.  Then stick it in the mouth.  It works !!!!!  Right now I&#x27;m using Fixodent Extra Hold Powder.  Makes the teeth feel cemented in.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these they are cheaper buying them on Amazon</li>
    <li> Very excellent will continue to buy them from Amazon !</li>
    <li> I order these every 21/2 months. Love the service and the product. When I get my new teeth I may not need them any more. will have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> I am waiting to have my dentures re-lined in 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say how they&#x27;ll work then, but as for now: they work in a pinch, but are not very good for hold, hours, food gets into the mess and they just don&#x27;t feel secure. BUT....I will update this review after the re-line to give them a fair shot! And I DO hope that they&#x27;ll work, because they are much simpler to use than the gel and paste alternatives, and taste a lot better, too!! More soon....:)</li>
    <li> Very good. As advertised</li>
    <li> this is the only product I use for my upper denture.It is great and I feel comfortable with it and can eat anything without worry.&lt;br /&gt;There is no cream or jell,just clean sheet of bond.I would love to be able to purchase it a bit cheaper or find coupons for a better deal.</li>
    <li> I have always used sea-bond uppers so I already knew that I like them.  They hard to find all the time here in the stores.  I would recommend them to anyone that has loose upper dentures.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT  KEEPS FOOD OUT AND LASTS FOR HOURS. SOME TIMS I GET A BIT OF A STRANGE TASTE BUT THAT IS OK.</li>
    <li> Does what it should and prevents the nasty residuals I usually get from tube adhesive on my upper.  These hold surprisingly well if you spritz them sparingly and make sure to give them a minute or two to set in your mouth before eating.  I&#x27;m guessing the bad reviews were from folks that saturated them before use or didn&#x27;t know how to trim them correctly.  The hold doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as tube adhesive, but the lack of mess and potential for gagging on the left over adhesive are big pros over any other point in my opinon.</li>
    <li> Ok...this is a good product. I ate dinner tonight and I was able to eat the food without the denture rocking side to side.</li>
    <li> These adhesive wafers do an OK job as long as you don&#x27;t expect too much. They do hold, but not nearly with the strength or duration as a paste. Just use them when moderate hold is required. Definitely easier and cleaner to use than paste.</li>
    <li> Buy in bulk.. Sure beats buying local.. S&amp;S is really charging over the top prices lately on these..</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with product, cost &amp; time of delivery. I would recommend this to any one looking to save &amp; be satisfied.</li>
    <li> good product for uppers....not so good for lowers</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Did not hold as promised.  I always dislike leaving a less than positive review, but this product is very much overrated and did not deliver.  Very sorry to report this.  Truly.</li>
    <li> Does as advertised and the mint  taste is nice.</li>
    <li> These fit my husband just fine.  He has no complaints and says it&#x27;s a lot better than the gooey stuff he used to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Even though I have to cut them down to my size before I put them on, they are easy to put in, I don&#x27;t have any trouble with my teeth all day.  They are easy to put in, easy to take off, and are fabulously easy to keep my teeth clean from germs.  The other denture adhesives leave all that ooze and it would stick to your gums and dentures and take forever to get off.  I will only use this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way they work.  I just wish they came in sizes.  I waste lot cutting them to fit my mouth.  Guess I have a small mouth.  The amount of material I have to cut off then throw away would probably make another 10 wafers but won&#x27;t work properly if try to fit them together.  Has to be one solid piece to hold steady and properly.  Other than the waste I love them!</li>
    <li> These help hold Moms uppers really well! They also &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; her palette! We find  the &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; her first choice. There is no other fixative she likes like these. They can be cut to size!</li>
    <li> I use these daily and was very pleased to find them packaged in larger quantity than the usual 15 pack.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there for upper dentures</li>
    <li> These are the best dentureadhesives out there</li>
    <li> Like the mint flavoring... And less expensive on Amazon</li>
</ol>
