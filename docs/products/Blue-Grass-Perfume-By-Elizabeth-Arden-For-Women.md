<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Seller wonderful to work with!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. My grandmother wanted some for mothers day and you were the only ones who had it. Thank you. I love amazon!</li>
    <li> I remember my grandmother in BLUE GRASS 60 YEARS ago and yet this fragrance is modern enough for my 13year old granddaughter today. I like it as a change a couple of times a week. It is very floral and feminine.</li>
    <li> Love it !!!!. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this scent and it&#x27;s hard to find.  When you do - it is much more expensive than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s thrilled with all the Blue Grass products.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I ordered online since it was unavailable locally. It smelled Rancid. As if I had been cooking with moldy grease. All in all a very horrible experience. I remember this in my younger years as sweet and fresh and clean. What I got was Nasty.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised before the expected date ! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Gréât summer fragrance</li>
    <li> Smelled like cat pee. Would not recommend this mess, I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s made of but stay far away!!!</li>
    <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE, ITS SO WATERED DOWN THAT YOU WON&#x27;T EVEN RECOGNIZE THIS ANYMORE.  SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH WHILE THEN HAVING SOMETHING YOU CAN GET AT THE 98 CENT STORE LIKE THIS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, as described.</li>
    <li> Good fragance. My love really liked it.</li>
    <li> delivery time was excellent.  this fragrance is never a disappointment...fresh and clean. does now overpower.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite light summer fragrance of all time! It got here quickly and was a good price point!&lt;br /&gt;Perfection!</li>
    <li> Blue Grass is the only perfume I&#x27;ve worn all of my adult life.....just by digging around on Amazon, I found I could buy it for less than 1/2 of what the department stores charge.  I was out of it for a couple of weeks and could hardy wait for it to arrive.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, still a favorite through the years.  Shipped well,&lt;br /&gt;good response.  Many thanks!</li>
    <li> Yes thank you I will order again when needed</li>
    <li> great product - great price</li>
    <li> An old favorite from college days, rediscovered via Amazon.  Nice light fragrance - good for young girls as a starter fragrance as well as us more experienced ladies.</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE perfume! This is hard to find now. Thank you so much for making it available!!! I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product as it seems Elizabeth Arden is no longer offering this size and I feared it might be old.  alas, it is fresh.</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen and have worn Blue Grass&lt;br /&gt;perfume, exclusively, for age 15. It is my Signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> Purc in June 2011.  Opened at time previous bottle was finished on Dec 27.  It was horrible.  Appears to have been old and turned to alcohol.  Wrote to vendor through complaint system on Amazon.  Doubt I will get a response from vendor, but at least I have satisfaction of warning others. I made this a one star, but really a zero.[[ASIN:B0058IFI5G New - BLUE GRASS by Elizabeth Arden EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 3.3 OZ - 119149]]</li>
    <li> Incredibly stupid that something like this can&#x27;t be shipped directly to me in Hawaii.  Had my sister mail it to me from California no problem .</li>
    <li> Love this perfume have no seem in years. I was told to try Amazon and there it was. Made a great gift for my mother!</li>
    <li> Wore this for many years when I was younger.  I was very happy to be able to find it again.</li>
    <li> Smelled like soap! Nothing like Blue Grass!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Blue Grass perfume for years and still love it.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to love this scent but as far as I am concerned&lt;br /&gt;it is not my favorite. But of course it&#x27;s all a matter of taste.</li>
    <li> I found service and product to be excellent.</li>
    <li> Close enough to original Blue grass&lt;br /&gt; my mom used 35 years ago nostalgic enough A+++ good buy will buy again Thanks</li>
    <li> Good value as gift for family member.</li>
    <li> A lovely cologne spray.</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass Eau de Parfum Spray for women it&#x27;s the most refreshing fragrance one can ever use.  It makes me feel to fall in love over and over again. It remains on your body even after you have taken a bath - and most of all people around you enjoy it even though you are not smelling it.  It leaves my bathroom with a lovely fragrance long after I leave the bathroom.  I have been using this fragrance since I was 18 years old and I am now 66 Years of age.  Speaks volumes - I buy no other fragrance and hope it remains on the market for years to come.  I often wish that they will return the Splash on the market - that too was lovely.    Is there a possibility that the splash will return on the market?    Still love this product-    but didn&#x27;t receive the Creme Deoderant which i ordered   - in its place Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s green tea refreshing body lotion was inadvertently sent. I have indicated my disappoint on this and await your response.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALWAYS USED THIS  PARFUM SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I JUST LOVE IT.!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> soft scent that lasts all day without re-applying.</li>
    <li> I think my daughter bathes in this perfume.  She in over 50 and has worn it since high school.  It doesn&#x27;t seem ever to have changed its formula, and it smells great and stays on.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! My favorite fragrance always. The only perfume I wear! I ave used it for thirty years and never tire of it.</li>
    <li> This is very disappointing.  The only time I even notice a scent is immediately after I&#x27;ve put it on, and even then it smells nothing like the Blue Grass I used to love.  Within a few minutes the scent is gone without a trace.  Totally useless product!!</li>
    <li> I love this parfum spray and have used it for years.  It is  my summer parfum and wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift for my mom for her birthday. She opened the box right away and splashed some on herself. She was very pleased with it and stated it still smelled exactly the same as it did when she used to wear it many years ago!</li>
    <li> I used this in the 60&#x27;s when I was a teenager.  From what I remember, it had a crisp and green smelling fragrance.  Smells totally different now.  More like a powdery fragrance.  Still, I am liking this and would order again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance! I have loved wearing it for years.  People always compliment me and/or ask what are you wearing?</li>
    <li> Item as promised.  No disappointments.  Good price and secure shipping.</li>
    <li> Seems a little odd smelling...but maybe just me. Maybe it is a little stale.I will not buy it again and use it rarely now.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this since 1968 and everyday since.  Would not be without it :)  Perfect for any time, day or night.</li>
    <li> Just like I remembered</li>
    <li> I have an 85 year old friend who wanted this. Her mother wore the scent. I bought it for her and smelled it. I think it is awful, but it brings back great memories for my friend. I rated it as a 3 because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rate it.</li>
    <li> I used to babysit some 50 years ago for a woman who used this perfume so I would spray a few drops on myself because I loved the scent but couldn&#x27;t afford to buy it!</li>
    <li> Have been a fan of this perfume for years and it never disappoints.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance of all time.</li>
    <li> After loving the fragrance two friends wear, I wanted it for myself. However, what I received did not smell the same at all. Similar but not the same as my friends, who agreed. I know our body chemistry can interfere, but I was really disappointed. I wish I had saved my money. I ordered another cologne fro a different website and it was true to the fragrance. That was Ellen Tracy.</li>
    <li> I have used this itemfor years, but it hasbeen difficult to find it in standard department stores.  I was thrilled to find it on amazomn.com</li>
    <li> excellent all around--thank you</li>
    <li> Classic, elegant Eau de Parfum! Arrived promptly and well. Love it.</li>
    <li> My very favorite.  Have used it excluusively for almost 60 years.</li>
    <li> This  is an old fragrance that I smelled and liked on someone at an airport. I asked her to name it and decided to try it. It is very vintage and light, and can be sprayed on freely. I like it very much...</li>
    <li> Love Love this perfume.  It took a while to find it.  I used it way back n the 70&#x27;s and could never find it.  The only concern is that even with the lid on it seems to evaporate quickly.  Packaging arrived safe and sound.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Great price on here for Blue Grass.  It&#x27;s hard enough trying to find it, so this was a double plus.  I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for over 50 years and always get compliments on it because it&#x27;s clean, crisp and fresh without being overbearing like so many perfumes and are nowadays.  This is a classic!</li>
    <li> …has diminished my enjoyment of this fragrance.I have received the wrong items followed by the  return of the incorrect items to he sender.I finally received my shipment of the Blue Grass but only received half my order and that was damaged.I have finally received my entire order  and with the exception of a still unsettled shipping refund this transaction is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise,this is really a fine fragrance that reminds me of my Mother and another long passed family member.I really wish the bottle was more flattering. I remember at one time it was in a beautiful very elegant bottle with horses .</li>
    <li> This bottle obviously did not contain anything considered to be the Blue Grass fragrance.  It must be labeled a &amp;#34;knock off.&amp;#34;  Very disappointed with this vendor.</li>
    <li> Wonderful classic scent that I love.  Glad that it is still available at a reasonable price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> My late aunt gave me a bottle of this when I was 16. I have been looking for it for years, and now I have it again!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is an excellent fragrance. I haven&#x27;t seen or used it in years and it was a great gift for my Mom who really likes it. Thank you for this product and I will continue to purchase it from time to time.</li>
    <li> This scent came to me when I was just a teenager and used it for many years - then I couldn&#x27;t find it again.  I was so happy to find in Amazon that I bought two just to be on the safe side.  I would recommend it to those women who like the fresh outdoorsy kind of scent.</li>
    <li> I remember this scent as a favorite many years ago.  The bottle was prettier and much heavier then, but the fragrance is still lovely.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful just like the deodorant</li>
    <li> This brought back memories. It isn&#x27;t a complex fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last long, so I&#x27;m using it as a bathroom air refresher.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere - thought it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.  I read a review that it was watered down.  This wasn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s almost too strong.  You just need a tiny bit.  II bought 2 of them and was so happy with them that I just bought another.  I&#x27;m so afraid they&#x27;ll run out!  Good fast service too.</li>
    <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t seen this in the stores for over 30 years / she loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Price is great ships quickly and my wife loves it what else can one say.</li>
    <li> This perfume is, and had been one of my favorite scents. Very clean and lovely. My grandmother wore this and I never forgot it, even when I hadn&#x27;t seen her since I was 7; I recognized the scent at 18 when browsing at a department store. Sadly I thought it was something my mother must&#x27;ve worn, but my mom set me straight when I delightedly bought her a bottle.. And she gave the bottle to me. I continued to buy it, and I always get compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;However this bottle smells like it is at least 20 years old. There is a point when the scent in the bottle begins to decay and smell old. The stock in this company&#x27;s store seems to have reached that point. I wish I had not bought from this source.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years during the seasons of spring &amp; summer.  It has a nice light  floral scent.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  It is an old one of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s and can be hard to find.  It has a very clean scent and I receive many compliments on it.  Different than run-of-the-mill flowery scents.  Just very clean and reminds you of blue grass on a sunny summer day.  I have worn this for years.</li>
    <li> This is one of the older, softer, beautiful scents.  When someone hugs you they are treated to a pleasant olfactory experience.  I am sooo pleased that it is still available.</li>
    <li> They stopped making the lotion, so I ordered the parfum. A bit strong and not so pleasant as the lotion fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite spray perfume.  Shelovesit!  I used tobe able to buyit locally, but no longer.  It was a pleasant surprise to find it here and get such good service to boot!</li>
    <li> I appreciate your sending an email to me to inquire about my satisfaction with this product. I was not at all satisfied with the Elizabeth Arden &amp;#34;Bluegrass&amp;#34; perfume that I received, as it had a strong smell of alcohol, like it had been sitting on a shelf for years. There was no resemblance to the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; that I have worn for years. For your sake, please check your stock of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> My wife of 26 years wore this fragrance as a teenager..........she still loves it, so do I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, great, great!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery; good transaction; my mom&#x27;s favorite so made a&lt;br /&gt;great birthday gift for her</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume since 1970. Excellent price and great delivery time. The smell of Blue Grass takes me way back. This scent has been around for a long time.</li>
    <li> Wore Blue Grass several years ago, but it does not smell at all like it did. It was a very light fragrance with a little lemony fresh smell&lt;br /&gt;but now it seems strong and not very fresh smelling.  Why did they change?</li>
    <li> Wonderful Blue Grass. The Real Item. Quick delivery and price.</li>
    <li> I loved this fragrance as a young girl and was delighted to see it was still available.  It&#x27;s timeless and ageless.  Perfect for a summer day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Blue Grass for over 50 years and like it as much now as I did when my husband, then fiancé, bought it for me.  It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;ve had many tell me I smell good.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and was just as expected.  Gave as gift.  Thank you.</li>
