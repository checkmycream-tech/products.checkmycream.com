<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ive used it for a week staright now, i have really thick and wavy hair. It tames it down, gives it shine. But ive noticed, it makes it hard to work with when you straighten your hair. If youre like me &amp; straighten it everyday.</li>
    <li> I really liked the original Tresemme but the Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo is amazing! Paired with the conditioner is makes my hair manageable and smelling good.</li>
    <li> Great product. Infused with keratin, it smooths the hair and makes it more manageable while using a low-sulfate formula. The smell is pleasant and the matching conditioner is also great. The shampoo&#x27;s most surprising effect was that it had (significantly) straightened my curly hair. Now, it was not absolutely straight but there was a noticeable difference. I re-read the bottle, and having found nothing on this shampoo&#x27;s hair straightening properties, I went to look on Tresemme&#x27;s wesbite. The product details do in fact start with, \\&quot;Want hair that&#x27;s smooth, straight and easy to style?\\&quot; I was not looking for a straightening shampoo, as I mostly wear my hair curly. I therefore do not use this shampoo regularly but have saved it for when I want to follow up with a flat iron after washing my hair. This straightening property could be good or bad, depending on what kind of hair you have and what you want it to look like- just letting you know that it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address some points that other reviewers brought up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it DOES contain sulfates. This shampoo is not advertised as something that is safe to use after a keratin treatment, so do not automatically assume that just because it is a keratin shampoo you can use it after the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;-the formula is LOWER-sulfate. That means that it will not lather up as much, as another reviewer noticed it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product that will smooth your hair and make styling easier. I do wish, however, that Tresemme had included information about the shampoo&#x27;s straightening properties on the bottle to be true to the product&#x27;s performance. I still give it 5 stars despite this fact, and the fact that I do not have a need for a straightening shampoo regularly, as it performs nicely on days when I want to wear my hair straight.</li>
    <li> I have kinky coily hair and they were giving this shampoo and its conditioner out at my job. And I am appalled that they would even think this stuff was good enough to give out. My hair was nice and soft before this went in. It completely stripped my hair of its natural oils... My hair started falling out immediately. I had to pile in the shampoo to undo the mess it did to my hair. WOW!!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME hair care product!!!!</li>
    <li> Really strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> My hair has looked great since using this, BUT the fragrance has a hint of an old lady&#x27;s perfume. It is a nice smell, but very strong.</li>
    <li> Great value, I purchased it as an add on item and I really can&#x27;t complain at all in terms of the quality and value of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses my hair without all the unneeded extra chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks fuller and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A winner. I will definitely be coming back for more.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price for 25 ounces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This leaves my mostly grey hair nice and soft with no feeling of buildup.  I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this shampoo.  Best shampoo I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
    <li> I have a dry and frizz hair, with hardly some visible waves and curls. After first use of this shampoo, conditioner and the serum, my hair looked OK. But with continuous use (I wash my hair every alternate day) for about 2 weeks, my hair was becoming sticky. Tried reducing the serum, that did not help too. My scalp got itchy. Kept scratching throughout night. And my hair fall was tremendous. Was really scared and stopped immediately. My husband uses the same and is fine with it. Has no such issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a similar kind of review before buying the product, but thought might be fore certain hair types. But i too turned out to be one of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, i would suggest, try a small sample (if available), before buying a big bottle. Do not do the same mistake as me. At least in my case, there is someone, who can still use it. else, it would have gone to trash.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Keeps my hair frizz free and love the way it smells</li>
    <li> this is very good shampoo.  it&#x27;s reasonably price and does good on my hair.  love products like this.  try it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, make my hair so soft. I used it together with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Redken, but recently started looking into all this Keratin hype. I decided to give this a shot as it was cheap and had good reviews. It seems to work well, but the consistency and amount you need reminds me more of a cheaper box store brand than a higher end salon brand. All in all, good bang for the buck though.</li>
    <li> My hair felt sticky when rinsing the shampoo out. But it did not feel that way once it dried</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo for two weeks. I wash my hair about three times a week. In that short amount of time, I lost ALOT of hair. I have thick, wavy and used to have TONS of hair. After using this product, I noticed a huge difference in the amount of hair I was losing daily. It is now very dry, brittle and my scalp started to itch. I was using Loreal sulfate free smoothing shampoo and conditioner before this. I wanted to try something different as I flat iron my hair quite frequently. Boy do I regret it! All I can say is BEWARE. It does smoothe your hair by thinning it out! Pay close attention to the amount of hair you are losing in the shower and throughout the day! It DOES matter!</li>
    <li> As one knows , to switch products from time to time is best for your hair.  As with most things , I cannot find it in local stores...so I order online.  The product is great , smells wonderful and does wonders for your hair ,  however the packing of these items leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible shampoo! At first I got it because the name of it intrigued me. I have thin, dry, wavy hair and was looking for something that would help control my hair&#x27;s extremely frizzy texture. At first I loved this shampoo and the scent is really nice too. However, within a couple weeks of use, I noticed chunks of my hair falling out. I did some research on this shampoo and noticed others who said similar things after trying it. I&#x27;m so disappointed because this is thinning out my already thin hair. Seriously this causes a lot of hair loss, do not buy!</li>
    <li> This product seemed find at first. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and I thought that this would help keep it healthy and was doing everything I was told to do but still my hair was coming out in chunks. I changed shampoos and as soon as I did my hair wasn&#x27;t Coming out in chunks. I ran out of shampoo so I was forced to go back to this one and My hair began to shed horridly again. I threw this over my balcony.</li>
    <li> This is a new-to-me product. I&#x27;m very pleased with how it makes my hair feel and the help it gives in styling. My hair is very fine, and it is not weighed down by this product; rinses nicely and does not leave hair feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme products for a long time. It&#x27;s one of the best shampoo products out there that is affordable. I decided to try this one, since it looked new. I was not disappointed. It makes my hair silkier than ever. I also love the scent.</li>
    <li> 7n addition to a pleasant fragrance this is well packaged and the liquid is thick rather than a runny stream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff</li>
    <li> I ordered all of this for my granddaughter and she loves it all very much! thank you Its a good  way to sell the products</li>
    <li> this product i tried and there is really nothing wrong with it but i prefer my former product as my hair is a little frizzy so shampoos and conditioners either help control the frizz or do nothing to control it.  for someone else this my be really good.</li>
    <li> My hair is 4 feet long and very straight.  It is very hard to get a brush through it if I don&#x27;t have the right products. So when my previous shampoo and conditioner changed their formula I was unhappy to say the least. After trying out MANY different brands. My hair was left dull, dry, and unmanageable.  Then I remembered my brother told me about Tresseme is good I bought some and have been using it religiously.&lt;br /&gt;That being said my hair came back, shiney and happy. However, it takes me a lot more of the Shampoo than it does other brands to soap all my hair. I can&#x27;t say its super cheap as of yet. But It is working on my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair type: long and wavy, frizzy and full at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly, I never really used products that were not from a salon. Having a relative that was a hair stylist, I was always led to believe that expensive salon brands know best. However, since I began going to college away from home..all of this changed (since as you may guess), I couldn&#x27;t afford buying 40 dollar shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began my research. At the time I was also watching Laura Vitale on YouTube and if you haven&#x27;t noticed, she&#x27;s got some nice locks of hair! When she made a video she mentioned that she was using Bain de Terre&#x27;s set, and so there went that one in my wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across the Keratin Smooth Infusing collection while checking out the Bain de Terre. It popped up at the bottom by the &amp;#34;You might also like&amp;#34; section. I decided to check it out since it was only 4 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying both the Bain de Terre and the Tresemme. I initially planned to use the Bain de Terre as my main squeeze, and have the Tresemme as a back up in the bathroom (since I have roommates I keep all of my stuff in my room), however this changed after a couple of uses of both products. I still enjoy using the Bain de Terre, but man, I love the lather of the Tresemme! It lathers so well and smells really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: really nice and fresh, will stay on your hair throughout the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Results: my hair feels soft and light and full of volume. I recently purchased the hair serum for frizz and the heat tamer spray, and I got to say, they work really well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to people looking for an afforable shampoo and conditioner set that will make your hair smell and feel really good. (:</li>
    <li> Helps smooth unruly hair. I love it can go a week with out flat ironing. Smells good not chemically. Must have for the frizzy people out there.</li>
    <li> I got the 32oz that comes with a pump!!! I love this shampoo leaves my hair feeling and smelling AMAZING.</li>
    <li> My hair is that hair that wants to be curly, but can&#x27;t make the commitment- so it ends up frizzy, with lots of flyaways. This shampoo and conditioner has made all the difference in the world! I can now wear my hair down after the shower without putting gobs of product in my hair to keep it from looking like a bird&#x27;s nest...  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all, just smooths everything out. Definitely works fabulously for the price, and smells great too!</li>
    <li> I watched couple of reviews on Youtube, and this shampoo has been so popular among some famous You-tubers. This is the first time I purchase this shampoo, and I do love the heat protection product of this brand, and I hope it can works just like the heat protection.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and smells great. Leaves my daughter, granddaughter and my hair silky, soft and shiny. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My hair is dyed so whenever I use a shampoo in the shower my hair feel very dry(I use conditioner after using shampoo). With this shampoo though, it feels soft I like it a lot so far.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/condioner I&#x27;ve used on my hair so far. I can go days without having to wash it because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all unlike other shampoos. It cleans my hair without leaving it oily or weighed down but still leaves it silky soft and tamed. My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz at all and I have naturally thick wavy frizzy unruly hair and this takes care of it and makes my hair look like I had it done as soon as it dries out of the shower I&#x27;ll never switch shampoos again</li>
    <li> It left my hair feeling clean and soft. It smells incredible and it works magnificent. My hair is naturally wavy, but with this shampoo and the conditioner it leaves it looking quite beautifully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m simply chiming in to add to the negative on this shampoo. I initially liked it and have used it the last month or so. I just had a light bulb moment yesterday about my itchy scalp. I thought I was crazy at first because sometimes I scratch my head and then it got worse and was convinced that I had lice that I simply couldn&#x27;t see. My home treatment of lice did nothing to stop the itch as it usually does, not that I get lice often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to me that the only thing else it could be would be an allergic reaction. Like several others on here I am not sensitive to things in general. Maybe 1 medication and that&#x27;s it. I think it just took me longer to realize what was doing it because of my not being sensitive. I have washed my hair with another shampoo tonight and hope that it will gradually fade away. I was becoming concerned because the itching was focused in 3 spots on my head and with any great amount of itching I&#x27;m sure I will eventually scratch bald spots there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smoothing effect was minimal and I was just trying to use it up. My hair is between curly and wavy and was bra strap length. I had begun to have lots of hair fall, to the point of it being all over the house and I assumed it was because my hair was so long. I have since cut it because hair everywhere disgusts me and I am now wondering it this was caused by this shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.  Thought I&#x27;d give it a try rather than spend a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;I do have a much more expensive conditioner.  I&#x27;m close to 70 yrs. with thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can I expect more?</li>
    <li> good items, thanks you</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have used to date. I have super thick, curly/frizzy hair and this stuff makes my hair feel and look amazing!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products to smoothen my waist length curly, dry hair and the Keratin infused ones are by far the best suited for my hair type. I use the entire range and don&#x27;t think I will be changing them up! Before Tresemme came out with this range, I was using the Suave keratin smoothening range and was happy with it but wanted to try a better shampoo as that was the only thing lacking in that brand. I have used this shampoo for over a month now and am very happy with my soft and shiny hair! The only suggestion I&#x27;d offer to a new user is to occasionally (once in 3 weeks) use a clarifying shampoo as there is some build up, which is to be expected from creamy shampoos anyway!</li>
    <li> WOW &amp;#34;Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo&amp;#34; left it feeling like silk. Paired with Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Conditioner,&amp;#34; this shampoo helped create a smooth hairstyle that had a deep sheen. I will  purchase again.</li>
    <li> made my hair softer.. I like it very much! i use it with it&#x27;s conditioner as well and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is ok for  renbonding hair?</li>
    <li> the best shampoo i ever tried, thank you!! my hear is nourished and shininy!!</li>
    <li> Best value. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Well priced and helps with dry hair.  Definitely helps with frizz at a very attractive price.</li>
    <li> love love this shampoo made your hair smooth and love the smell</li>
    <li> This shampoo does exactly what it says it does....I have been going natural for 13 months now and my hair is super curly and tangles a lot.  This shampoo and conditioner not only softened and detangled my hair..it made it so easy to blow dry and gave such good results that I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron!  Lots of bounce and shine with the bump of a curling iron.  I feel like my hair routine just got sooooooooo much easier.  The conditioner made my hair so soft and straight as soon as I put it on.  The shampoo relaxed my curls immediately and my hair feels so healthy....I am thrilled with both the shampoo and conditioner..well done Tresemme.  4a/4b hair type.</li>
    <li> I just want to say how extremely displeased I am with these products. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks now and they have both made my hair look terrible. It is now dry, frizzy and the products are stripping my color out. The description said this shampoo was safe for colored hair. The products have also made my scalp itchy and the scent of the shampoo and conditioner is a little strong. Such a waste. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> As the title of my review suggests, this shampoo both smells and works wonderfully.  The formula is quite thick and rich, but it lathers up easily and nicely on the head, and rinses clean. I used this shampoo with the matching conditioner [[ASIN:B00AO4E9MC Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce]], and my hair felt amazingly clean and soft.  I&#x27;m also loving the scent of fruits with a slight perfume.  The scent isn&#x27;t an easy one to describe, but it is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m generally a user of cheap shampoo and conditioner, and my hair usually does just fine with that.  Using this shampoo is a pleasure, though, and this may convince me that there&#x27;s something in buying more upmarket hair products.</li>
    <li> Having short hair one would think fuzzy ends and waves wouldn&#x27;t be a  problem, one would be so sadly mistaken. Once, when living in South Korea, I had a horrible mishap with a perm and dye job that left my hair half fuzzy, half flat, orange before orange was cool, and with much breakage. Soon I looked like a deranged poodle and nothing helped, so I went to the barber and got a military flat top, shaved up the the sides, the back, and about 1/2 inch on top. And that 1/2 inch had frizzy ends! Well, all it consisted of was frizzy ends but still! So even though I have a short hair style, it requires smoothness or it will stick out over my ears and up in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tresemme Keratin Smooth infusing shampoo is lovely, it has a very light pleasant scent, lathers well, rinses easily. I followed with the conditioner and infusing treatment, and my hair is very smooth. For anyone like me who suffers frizzy out of control hair, this is a good option.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells nice and cleanses well. I am just confused as to how the keratin works in a shampoo. Keratin treatments are a long and tedious process in which the keratin is heat-set into the hair. What good does shampooing it into your hair do? I used this shampoo and did not notice anything special. In any case, I have had keratin treatments done to my hair several times and one of the things they advise is to use sulfate-free shampoos to maintain the results. Well, this \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; shampoo contains sulfates. The main ingredient after water is sodium laureth sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;So, as far as cleansing, this shampoo does that well. As far as a source of keratin I just don&#x27;t see the benefit.</li>
    <li> Keratin came to the forefront when Brazilian Blowouts were the next big thing. A fibrous protein, keratin is a component in hair and nails. Age, pollution, sun, hair syling products and tools can take their tool on keratin leaving hair weak and dull. Keratin shampoo promises to rebuild keratin thereby revitalizing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is milky in appearance with a rather assertive fruity floral aroma. It provides an adequate lather and rinses cleaning.  It left my hair looking and feeling clean. I would rate the performance as average but not exceptional. However, the biggest drawback was my itchy scalp. I normally do not react to hair products other than once with a salon color. The itching persisted on and off through out the day. As I tried this initially without using the companion conditioner, I suspected this shampoo triggered the reaction. The next day I decided to perform a skin test like you should do with home color. That is put a small amount of the substance on skin and see if there is a reaction. My skin immediately reddened and felt like it was burned. Again, it faded after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a reasonably priced shampoo offering the benefits of keratin. However use with caution if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great just stand alone with no conditioner. My hair does feel slightly weighed down but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon packaging was good, no leaks.</li>
    <li> Over the last month, our house has tried a wide range of shampoo/conditioner combos, and Tresemme is one of the clear winners.  It sounds like a commercial, but my daughter prefers this shampoo and its [[ASIN:B00AO4E9MC accompanying conditioner]] to the salon brands she had been using.  The combo leaves hair straighter, shinier, softer, and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on some of the other reviews, it looks like reactions are mixed, but we have only good things to say about this combo.  Give it a try, and see what you think.</li>
    <li> Never tried this one before. I have oily scalp, so I need to shampoo pretty much every day. This product does not over dry or leave a filmy residue which is perfect.</li>
    <li> Now this is an easy choice.  We have been using Tresemme hair products for years.  First, my wife saw them at the local hair salon.  Then she started getting them for our bath.  Not only they work great (believe me, if my wife doesn&#x27;t like anything that touches her hair;  it is gone and will never be seen again in our bathroom), it comes it big bottles and at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Keratin Smooth shampoo works as promised.  Sleek and smooth on the hair.  I have no problem shaping them afterwards with a small amount of Gatsby moving rubber.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had the opportunity to try the Keratin Smooth shampoo, conditioner, and smoothing serum. I love all of them! I have frizzy/curly hair and I have tried various hair products to try and gain some control over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo definitely helps control the frizz of my hair, and smells great! The price is excellent for the amount of shampoo you get in the big bottle (although it takes up lots of space in the shower). I&#x27;m not going to claim this reduces frizz or curls significantly, but it&#x27;s also a shampoo you can buy at Wal-Mart. If you need more, head to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is looking to control their frizz! I&#x27;d also recommend the conditioner and hair serum!</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty normal, I am able to use normal shampoo and usually have no problem.  This is no different, I find that a little goes a long way (I have short hair), and it gets my hair clean without the dry feeling that I get from some other shampoos.  The shampoo works well and lathers nicely and rinses out clean.  I have not had any problems and the shampoo works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end this is nice quality shampoo that keeps my hair clean without the dry feeling hair (or even worse, the oily feeling hair), it seems just right.  This is a pretty good buy for name brand shampoo and comes in a nice size bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good experiences with Tresemme products, this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used with the conditioner and serum, this system works to leave hair smooth and moisturized while still having body and bounce. My hair is fine and straight and shows build-up by looking limp and lackluster. After a couple of weeks of using this, my hair is the sleek, smooth curtain that I like. No fly-aways, and it&#x27;s very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is thick and it only takes a small amount. On my hip length hair, a dollop the size of a quarter is enough to get my hair clean. It does take a little longer than other shampoo formulas I&#x27;ve tried to rinse out completely. It&#x27;s a gentle shampoo and so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair detergent squeaky, it cleans without stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a faint, pleasant scent in your hair, fairly neutral and it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfumes.</li>
    <li> I love changing up shampoos and conditioners, and in the past have always liked Tresemme.  I have long, naturally straight, Caucasian hair and this product works great.  The smell is flowery but not nauseating.  My hair is left feeling softer and smooth, I use it with the complimentary conditioner and also the smoothing serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product line, would recommend for an affordable high quality shampoo!</li>
    <li> While I am not a scientific expert on shampoos, I am something of an amateur expert.  I can honestly say without exaggeration that I have used a few hundred different shampoos in my lifetime.  In my teens and early twenties, before marriage, I would shampoo at least twice a day:  once before school or work, and again before a date or evening event.  On the advice of my hairdresser, I never used the same shampoo twice in a row.  People who saw my bathroom said it was better stocked than a drugstore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I shampoo only once a day, and I found that I love TRESemme shampoo.  I can use it two or three times in a row, and I find that I keep going back to it.  It makes my hair silky, shiny, and smooth every time I use it.  No more shampooing twice a day!  I will definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.  I would not mislead you.  And the icing on the cake is that it is made in the USA, a definite plus!</li>
    <li> Okay so to say the least, this stuff is amazing! Now a little bit about my hair... picture this: Mia in the Princess Diaries when the hair brush actually breaks off in her hair and the man tells her that she has hair like a wolf. That my friends is me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a wild untamable curly thick mess and because of that fact I straighten it every single day. I NEVER have been too overly impressed with any shampoo as they can really do nothing to help my hair but clean it. Then I bought this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells fabulous, is clean and shiney, and most of all, are you ready?, silky smooth soft! I will definitely be buying this forever! Buy it guys, it will save that curly coarse mess!</li>
    <li> Using toether with the conditioner this gives your hair a great feel and leaves your hair feeling great. Using the shampoo as well as the conditioner leaves your haor clean shiney as well as managable. I have to say that for the price you cannot go wrong. All Tresemme products are salon quality. This will leave your enegized for the next style.</li>
    <li> Smells great but didnt work for my hair.  I have pin straight hair in front and a mess of curls in the back, I just dont think theres any help for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Its a great deal for the price, quality and amount you get. Man, it smells awesome, too.</li>
    <li> And my wife works at a company that delivers to lots of salons and designers and even she prefers this brand!</li>
    <li> Do not use this shampoo, it makes your hair fall out! I have been using it for about a month and started noticing my hair was falling out more and more! My entire shower is covered in my hair! I looked.up the shampoo online today and found a lot of reviews about hair falling out as well! I will be throwing this shampoo away !!</li>
    <li> This product made my head itchy! I did not notice my hair any smoother or silkier. I would stick with the other Tresemme products instead of this one.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and curly. It&#x27;s sometime hard to manage and were very damage from bad perms and dye jobs. Using this Tresemme Keratin shampoo, I have seen a big improvement in my hair. My hair feels soft, easy to comb , looks healthier,  has a nice shine to it and leaving my hair very clean. You only need a small amount of this clear gel shampoo to work up a nice lather. It smells really nice and don&#x27;t leave your hair felling strip, so that is great if you color your hair. I recommend this shampoo for  anybody who want soft, clean and healthy looking hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with its matching conditioner ([[ASIN:B00AO4E9MC Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce]]) for a few weeks now and it does a nice job managing my thick and wavy hair that tends to frizz. I like to change things up a lot, so I normally don&#x27;t use the same shampoo and conditioner every time I wash my hair, but decided I&#x27;ll only use Tresemme&#x27;s so I could give it a good trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the fragrance is nice, it isn&#x27;t overpowering and it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair even when it&#x27;s dirty. So even when my hair might look like crap and needs washed, it at least doesn&#x27;t smell like it. Since my hair is thick, I tend to use more shampoo than bottles generally say to use, but with this, I&#x27;ve found I need a lesser amount than with others, which is a nice surprise (the same goes for the conditioner). Seeing as how big a bottle this is, that makes it an even better deal in my eyes. The shampoo lathers nicely and after rinsed out, leaves my hair feeling nice and clean. Tresemme makes the claim that this smooths better than non-conditioning shampoos, and yeah, I&#x27;d have to agree with that. My hair does look better than when I use regular shampoos. I&#x27;m skeptical on the claims that it&#x27;ll repair two years of damage in just five uses though. I don&#x27;t believe that hair damage can be repaired, masked, yes, but completely fixed? I highly doubt that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem comes from the fact that Unilever (who own Tresemme) tests on animals. I&#x27;ve been moving more and more away from giving money to companies who contribute to animal suffering, so I doubt I&#x27;ll be getting this again. I know not everyone feels the same way, but I really don&#x27;t want to be part of that.</li>
    <li> As others say, this does smell great and is an outstanding value.  I never thought I would like a shampoo this inexpensive this much, but it is pretty darn good.  Does not leave my hair feeling stripped nor do I feel like I need a huge amount of it like in other cheaper products.  Only issue is that you may want to put in a pump since the size is a bit awkward to handle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and the matching conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and frizz free all day, even on the most humid summer days. I also have really sensitive skin and tend to break out with this kind of shampoo, but tresemme doesn&#x27;t give me any trouble at all. I get compliments on how soft and shiny my hair is all the time. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: fine, medium-length brown hair</li>
    <li> This works great on African American hair. My daughter is natural and I use this along with the 7 day conditioner and spray and it keeps her hair soft and straight for more than 7 days. I will continue to use Tresemme products!</li>
    <li> After using Tresemme Keratub Smooth Infusing Shampoo my hair feels soft and silky. I used to use Tresemme some time ago. Now I am back to using again because my hair looks strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> After hearing all the hype about this line I had to try it for myself. After damaging my hair with bleach my hair has been far from smooth and manageable but this shampoo (especially paired with the conditioner) will really give your hair an extra boost. Protein does tend to dry out your hair so I would recommend using a leave in conditioner after using this. But all in all, this product is amazing. I&#x27;ll definitely make this apart of my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what keratin is or what it&#x27;s supposed to do for your hair, but the bottle says this shampoo makes for an easier time styling your hair, and I believe it. I have pretty wiry hair that can be hard to manage, but when I use this I just have to do a few swipes with the comb and I&#x27;m set yo go. It leaves my hair feeling clean, light and fuller-looking. It lathers up really good, too, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> ... or probably any price. While Chi Enviro smoothing shampoo is my favorite it is about 6 times the price -- and definitely not worth the extra money. The difference between the two -- in their capacity to smooth thin, broken, fly-away hair into soft silky rick looking hair is imperceptible. The price-- very perceptible! If I could give it more stars I would. The Keratin Smooth conditioner is so think you will have to unscrew the lid to get it out -- it is thicker than the conditioner that traditionally comes with hair dye and softens beyond compare. Used together -- they really change the look and feel of your hair.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair quite a bit so when I seen Tresemme with Keratin I couldn&#x27;t resist. Not only is it cheaper than CHI but it makes straightening my hair a lot easier. My hair is slightly thick and I have issues with split ends but after ONE wash I could feel a difference! My hair is softer and I haven&#x27;t been losing strands of hair nearly as much. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to use this everyday, because I think it would leave a lot of build up on my hair.  So far I have only used it when I am blowing my hair straight.  It makes my hair so easy to blow dry.  I let it air dry until still damp, then blew it out straight, and I looked like i came from the salon.  I bet it would be great for curly hair too if you just let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I have only used it with the tresemme keratin smooth conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product is ok in terms of shampooing. It smells fine, lathers nice and rinses clean.  As for the &amp;#34;frizz free&amp;#34; part I can&#x27;t tell. My hair is no more smooth when I use this or another brand of shampoo with the keratin smooth conditioner. In my opinion the conditioner does all the work. However this product is priced very affordably so I still give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> When I used this product I broke out with an unpleasant looking itchy as hell rash on my arms that made me very uncomfortable and extremely irritable. No i didnt wash in it in case you are wondering or for those of you who like to leave snide little comments about maybe i shouldnt use it as a body wash or that its says its suppose to be used by professionals only (Which if that is true then why do they sell in the grocery store?). Anyways, I simply washed my hair and the rash came on. I discontinued using it and the rash went away. it did however work for smoothing out my hair. This is my personal experience on the matter. Not everyone is going to experience the same thing i did because we are all different. God bless and have a great day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE SCENT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is what I used for 10 years ago. Like this brand and keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;While, I did not compare the price with others, I will suggest you check with physical store</li>
    <li> smells nice and fresh , relax may hair make it easy to brush especially I have curly hair always struggle after wash it, but since I use this shampoo I enjoy the texture &amp; smells good.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo. Excellent price. Easy to buy online. No hassle. Smells great and cleans hair with one application. Arrived in timely manner but the bottle had leaked a little because  cap was not tight. It was in a plastic so nothing else was damaged and only a small loss of product.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I am on a mission to get healthy hair this has helped out a lot. It does what it is suppose to do. Check out the reviews on Youtube. That is what convinced me to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have very thick full hair, but my strands are thin. A lot of moisturizing/smoothing shampoos weigh down my hair, but I have found this one to be perfect. My hair is even easier to blow dry when using this in conjunction with the conditioner and 7 day treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read almost all the reviews on here and I can actually see truth to all of them (even the 1-star ratings). The thing is, this shampoo does what it says it does. There were many reviews about this shampoo drying out hair - it contains extra protein (keratin), so what did you expect?! To combat this I use a really good moisturizing conditioner and I do a deep condition along with it. After the second wash I noticed that my hair was stronger - before my hairdresser would blow dry my hair and the hairs would snap in the process and now they don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll take stronger hair any day. Second most common criticism I read - it doesn&#x27;t lather as much so I have to use more shampoo... okay.. well this shampoo contains *lower* sulfates. Sulfates are used to make shampoos lather. Lower sulfates means less lathering. I like this shampoo and the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 out of 5 stars is that I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but from what I can tell - it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Tresemm&amp;eacute; Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo is a good shampoo but I don&#x27;t particularly care for the sweet floral scent.  It comes in a generous 25 oz. bottle.  It&#x27;s creamy, lathers well, and rinses fairly well.  I am not convinced that it works miracles for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is coarse and dry and I was excited to try this product. I used the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Conditioner and the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Serum together with the shampoo and was left with soft, silky hair that still has body and shine and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down with products. I see this being a constant in my daily hair care for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how this &amp;#34;Keratin Smooth Infusion Shampoo&amp;#34; has very little lather. I had almost a palm-sized amount in hand until I realized that it wasn&#x27;t going to get any soapier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this lotion-y formula on for about 2 minutes and washed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair good and clean. But, it didn&#x27;t feel extraordinarily clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean is clean but I didn&#x27;t notice anything that would distinguish it from other brands and other brands that cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> Usually, if I were to review a shampoo product, it would not be anything special.  Shampoo either does its job or it doesn&#x27;t.  So I&#x27;m bizarrely satisfied with this shampoo.  It works surprisingly well on my long hair, leaving it really nice and smooth and easy to work with.  The one qualm I would have is the bottle design--it is very slippery, especially when your hands are already wet and slick with water/shampoo.  The number of times the bottle has fallen out of my hands is kind of annoying.  But other than that, the product does its job, and Tresemme is a decent company when it comes to social/environmental aspects, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I only have to wash my hair every other day when I use this product (with the conditioner) It smells great and keeps the frizz out of my hair wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Love TRESemme products! Keratin Smooth works pretty well</li>
    <li> I have tick, wavy, frizzy hair. This made my hair feel like silk without weighing it down. It definitely helped with my frizz problem and I love the smell. I am not usually a fan of  Tresemme products but this one is an exception. Now I want to try the serum and the spray from this line. I cannot stop running my fingers through my hair, feels so amazing.</li>
    <li> Good buy for this shampoo.  Helps keep frizzies under control.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo!!! I go through two conditioners per shampoo - my hair is so silky and so soft and sooooo healthy!!!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo along with [[ASIN:B00AO4E9MC Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce]]. I am very pleased with how well they work together. There is a mild scent, but doesn&#x27;t remain on your hair. It leaves my hair nice and clean with no reside. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> ~The good~&lt;br /&gt;-You get a lot of shampoo for a low price. Very large bottle!&lt;br /&gt;-Decent fragrance. Not my all time favorite, but leaves hair smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;-Washes oils and styling products out of hair well.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells nice when washing your hair&lt;br /&gt;-Rinses out of hair easily&lt;br /&gt;-Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~What could be better~&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t get quite the same smoothing results as you can get from similar products by other brands&lt;br /&gt;-Better suited for those with oily hair, since after long term use it tends to leave hair a little dry&lt;br /&gt;-Needs to be paired with a very good conditioner, since when used with light conditioners it tends to make wet hair hard to brush through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Conclusion~&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of shampoo for a really low price. I&#x27;ve found this formula works much better on my daughter&#x27;s hair than it does on mine. She has very oily hair (pre-teen) and needs something to strip out the oil every day. This works well for her, cleansing hair more like a clarifying shampoo than a smoothing shampoo. So for her this works well, for myself I need something a little less drying.</li>
    <li> I usually use Head&amp;Shoulders shampoo. I like the quality and the smell of that brand. However, for a lot less money, you can get pretty much the same quality with this Tresemme shampoo. The smell is also verypleasant and the scent stays in my hair long enough. I don&#x27;t feel itchy on my scalp after using this (unlike the Pantene shampoos which make me feel itchy like crazy). My hair is soft and not dry at all after using this. Overall, high quality shampoo at a very reasonable price. If you need to cut your spending, go for this.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo for my wife who has long beautiful hair and she tells me she loves it. It smells good and makes her hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this product.  It leaves your hair shiny a humidity resistant without causing a lot of build up and weighing your hair down.</li>
    <li> I have long suspected that fancy shampoos, particularly those that are expensive, that supposedly offer all sorts of benefits, are mostly marketing rather than real.  I started changing my mind with Nexus and Clear shampoos, which seemed to me to be better shampoos than my regular, relatively inexpensive (though hardly cheap) shampoo.  When I received this shampoo, I wondered what sort of miraculous benefits this shampoo had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this shampoo was the odor, which one member of my family describes as amazing.  I concur.  I absolutely love the odor of this shampoo, which some people seem to think is too strong.  The odor is fruity with a floral hint, and I believe this shampoo has one of the most pleasing odors of any shampoo I have ever used.  Please consider that the ability to detect odors and the strength of those odors can vary significantly from person-to-person.  Thus, some people may consider the odor overpowering and annoying, while others, like me, find the odor very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor aside, how well does this shampoo work?  I thought this shampoo was excellent.  The shampoo left my hair feeling soft and clean, and that is about all you can ask from any shampoo.  One of the claimed features of this shampoo is its ability to infuse keratin into your hair.  Keratin is an interesting substance.  Heavy Keratin infusions can leave your hair frizzy until some of the Keratin washes out.  This shampoo has some amount of sulfates, which help shampoo to foam or bubble, though the amount is not specified.  Sulfates will slowly wear keratin from your hair, so excessive sulfates are undesirable.  What is interesting is that a heavy keratin infusion leaves your hair limp and as repeated washings remove keratin your hair starts looking good.  What I do not know is whether the keratin in this shampoo would be completely washed out by the sulfates.  I suspect that some amount of the keratin is supposed to remain since the keratin helps smooth your hair, which is a primary purpose of the shampoo.  As a side note, sodium chloride, also known as salt, is very destructive to keratin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing, the shampoo leaves my hair soft, and I like the way my hair looks with the shampoo.

    <li> I used this shampoo in conjunction with the corresponding conditioner, and it did a great job on my hair. I&#x27;d used a different product the day before, and my hair was tangly, flat, and frizzy looking. This time, my hair was really easy to comb through, and it came out soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and didn&#x27;t trigger sensitivities for me (I get migraines from many scents), and there&#x27;s plenty in the bottle to last a long time. It&#x27;s thick, rich shampoo (I thought it was conditioner at first) and does a good job \\&quot;sudsing up.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme mousse for over twenty years. It works so great, I won&#x27;t even use another mousse, So I had high hopes for this shampoo. I was pleased to find this is one of the better shampoos I&#x27;ve used. A matter of fact I recently was at the salon and got pressured into trying a \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; and high price salon shampoo. I thought why not? It was not great. It made my hair oily, weighed it down and made it unmanageable. I decided to give Tresemme shampoo a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. My hair is naturally curly and it didn&#x27;t exactly smooth my hair out, but it did tame some of frizzy ends so they weren&#x27;t as poofy. The smell was nice and it left my hair feeling clean and not weighed down at all. The great thing is that the price is very good for something I consider higher end than your average shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed many Tresemme products over the years.  I naturally have hair that is pretty frizzy and can be out of control.  When I wake up in the morning, I feel like I could have a walk on part for Medusa with my hair going in multiple directions. I found this shampoo to be a good cleansing shampoo.  While this did not dramatically control the frizz, I did think it did have some effect.  Would I purchase this shampoo when I run out?  Most likely.  I liked the smell and it was a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have a short pixie cut with color in my hair and started using this shampoo just a few weeks ago. I&#x27;m very particular about smell and this one passes the really nice smell test, and the price was also another factor, after buying expensive shampoo for years, I decided to go with a lesser known brand and I&#x27;m happy about the price too. It is SUPER cheap, and yet it does just fine as far as shampoos go. My color-treated hair is still keeping its shine and the accompanying conditioner is a nice match to smooth the hair for a nice finish. Happy so far!</li>
