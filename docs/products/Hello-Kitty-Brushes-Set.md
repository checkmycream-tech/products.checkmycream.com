      <li>The brushes are nice, but your not missing anything.</li>
      <li>so the tip was more rounded rather than the straight edge it had before</li>

      <li>The 168 angled powder brush works all right.</li>

      <li>Now I&#x27;ve never dabbled in the MAC brush world before, this was my first time</li>

      <li>This are Really Great brushes, super great quality and super price, the only problem I had was the item got here late, but the seller explain everything, I will recommend this to anyone you will save some serious money.</li>
      <li>the seller was very prompt in shipping and in replying to my queries.    </li>
      <li>expected better quality for being a &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34; and promoting Hello Kitty</li>
      <li>Do not purchase them if you&#x27;re used to the real deal- luxurious mac brushes.</li>
      <li>I really like this product...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not genuine MAC. At least not compared to the MAC quality sold in Europe and Japan (don&#x27;t know if the US gets second grade MAC?). The brushes are so far from original MAC that this set basically only is usable for first time face-painters.</li>
    <li> These brushes were a great buy! Cute Hello Kitty  case holds MAC make up brushes that are thegreat quality you would expect from Mac.</li>
    <li> OMG I CANT WAIT TO SHOW THIS TO MY CUZO SHES GANNA FLIP OUT. SHES MAD ABOUT HELLO KITTY YOU HAVE NO IDEA. IM SOOO HAPPY THE ITEM IS WAY BETTER IN PERSON THE IMAGES THAT THE SELLER SHOWS IS ALL THE SAME WHEN YOU GET YOUR PACKAGE. THE PACKAING IS VERY WELL PUT. I JUST CANT WAIT TO SHOW MY CUZING HER GIFT. I DID ORDER OTHER HELLO KITTY ITEM ON AMAZON FROM OTHER SELLER,BUT THIS SELLER IS ON POINT. PACKAGE WELL AS I SAID BEFORE, RATE PRICE, AND FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> This was my best deal ever this brushes are great, I saved around 60 dollars, the quality is amazing thank you Perfumus, will buy again for mothers day gift.</li>
    <li> The brushes were really cheap for a so called &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;I think in LA their not even as cheap as this were.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was not at all satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes came off as when you tried to wash them.&lt;br /&gt;I expected better quality for being a &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34; and promoting Hello Kitty but i was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This are Really Great brushes, super great quality and super price, the only problem I had was the item got here late, but the seller explain everything, I will recommend this to anyone you will save some serious money.</li>
    <li> This was a great value and came very quick! The brushes are of high quality and case is super cute. The brush lengths are just her perfect size...not to long nor to short</li>
    <li> This product is not MAC! and eventhough the brushes are pretty desent quality if you want to purchas this because it is super adorable which is the reason i did..you might want to concider looking on ebay where it is 7$ with shipping.. that is where i bought mine! this is deffenatly worth a try jsut not for almost 40$ instead do the 7$ deal and you wont regreat it!</li>
    <li> For the price go figure! I do like the case and aside from a couple of the &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; brushes, I dont even touch the others, they fall apart and are not good quality. ELF offers a better line of brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing!nice leather pouch with good quality brush! Especially the #187 is the best for liquid foundations!</li>
    <li> I really just bought these brushes because they were cute and easy to travel with. When I got them, i noticed that the  brushes seemed kind of mixed and they didn&#x27;t correlate to the actual collection from MAC. They did correlate with the brushes shown on amazon though. The contour brush smelled like a cat litter box so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it in fear that my face would smell. If you want a good gift to maybe give a little kid then this would be ideal.</li>
    <li> Okay I know these are not real Mac brushes but I seriously fell in LOVE WITH THEM....they work so good and they are SO SOFT, besides them not being MAC brand I am pretty satisfied, after reading all the post and reviews I didnt think my brushes were going to come through in the mail, BUT delivery was QUICK!! I am very happy I got them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are cute and semi quality, but they are not authentic. I should have realized that due to the price.</li>
    <li> I love my MAC set brush. The time it took for me to receive them was amazing. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it this to be so good. This is my first time but I feel like it wont be my last.</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice, but your not missing anything. Usually MAC brushes are soft and feel wonderful. These are soft, but they don&#x27;t give you the best brushes by MAC. Maybe that is why they are so cheap.</li>
    <li> I gave One of this to my wife and sister they love it I was a little scare, because it was really low price, but it was worth it am going to keep buying in Amazon great place to find gifts.</li>
    <li> Although i knew that the brushes were not authentic.. but they still are good quality except for the blush brush that is the only bad quality one. oh and the brushes had a very funny smell.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the shipment it came with in 3 days and everything is in wonderful condition and Brand New! I have not yet used them but I am sure they are going to be Great!</li>
    <li> Its really cute!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If anyone complain there,JUST GO DIRECTLY TO MAC and buy(because MAC do have those brushes).&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They look ABSOLUTILLY BEAUTIFUL TO ME.</li>
    <li> Its not very big, i guess its good for traveling. The brushes are too small. They were ok but not what i needed</li>
    <li> I really like this product... They actually took their time to personalize a thank you note... First time ever!!!! &lt;3 that!!!</li>
    <li> They have no MAC mark on them but they are AWESOME i love them and i am very satisfied for the price. Took a little while to get it in the mail i guess they had a problem with my order but very happy in the end and they were very informative and responded fast.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT MAILED OUT IN QUITE A TIMELY MANNER!..RECEIVED PRODUCT..AND THE BRUSHES FEEL FABULOUS AS PREVIOUSLY STATED BY OTHER CUSTOMER. THE HAIRS ON THE BRUSHES ARE INTACT AND BRUSHES IN WORKING FORM. UNSURE IF IT IS TRULY A MAC PRODUCT...LOOKS GOOD, FEELS GOOD WITH GREAT PRICE. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ALWAYS ALWAYS CONTACT THE SELLER BEFORE PURCHASING FROM ANYONE ONLINE IF POSSIBLE.FEEL THEM OUT\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The set is beautiful but they forgot to include the small extra brush. I received a great discount for the missing item but I wish they had included it.</li>
    <li> So I bought this on impulse without doing research. Don&#x27;t do that. I was disappointed when they arrived. They&#x27;re ok quality, but totally not MAC. Overall it&#x27;s a good travel size which comes in handy for me since I&#x27;d rather sleep in and do my makeup on the train than wake up 15min earlier.&lt;br /&gt;The dual fiber brush is absolutely my least favorite. It leaves makeup with streaks, so I never use it. I actually took it out of the bag and put my Bare Essentials &amp;#34;flawless face&amp;#34; brush in its place. I also took out the 266 small angled brush and the 316 lip brush; they weren&#x27;t working for me. The 190 brush works well with my liquid foundation, so no complaints about it other than the fact that the numbers wore off the handle pretty quickly. Actually, all of the print on all the handles has rubbed off quickly with almost daily use. The 168 angled powder brush works all right. I had to trim the long end of it so the tip was more rounded rather than the straight edge it had before and it&#x27;s been working much better since. I haven&#x27;t needed the 194 concealer brush since I switched to Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked foundation, but when I was using it it got the job done. The 219 pencil liner works well with the smokey-eye look. My MAC 209 liner brush doesn&#x27;t quite fit in this little brush set since it&#x27;s travel-size, but I put it in there anyway because it&#x27;s my everyday eyeliner brush; I just have to make sure it&#x27;s all the way at the crease and that I don&#x27;t close the zipper all the way so it doesn&#x27;t bend the brush bristles.</li>
    <li> the seller was very prompt in shipping and in replying to my queries.    i&#x27;m not too happy with the product. the bristles of the brushes are either too synthetic-looking (overly shiny, too plastic-ee) or too dull and frail. Hopefully I can return this. Until I can afford to buy from the MAC store, I&#x27;m going to stick with my ecotools.</li>
    <li> The brushes are sturdy but the handles are not. The case is cute though.</li>
    <li> so i received this today, and experimented with one of the brushes and ALL the bristles fell out!!!! the only brushes that are worth anything are the harder ones.</li>
    <li> i got these brushes yesterday and they are fantastic. as for the comment below that says that this page only sells &#x27;&#x27;fakes&#x27;&#x27;, is not true. the SELLER you bought it from sold you fake ones. not all sellers sell fake ones. the ones i received are 100% real mac brushes and are very soft and perfect. i definitely recommend these brushes for any type of person. they are good quality brushes and inexpensive and if they don&#x27;t meet your expectations, you can always return. but i love em &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It came with everything that it was supposed to come with and the brushes are in great condition and everything is very good quality. I love it!</li>
    <li> Imitation brushes. very cheap .</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;ve never dabbled in the MAC brush world before, this was my first time and I wanted to buy cheaper ones before I went more expensive. i personally have no problem with the brushes I think they&#x27;re excellent (except the blush brush- it is TOO SMALL). The foundation brush works well and spreads evenly. I HAVEEEEE however spoken to avid MAC brush users and they&#x27;ve told me that the special collections MAC does aren&#x27;t as good quality as their regular ones. They aren&#x27;t fake- they are just not as up to par compared to the originals.... overall, I think they&#x27;re pretty good, esp. for the price</li>
    <li> These brushes are horrible!!!! would not recommend to my worst enemy!! do yourself a favor and go to target and get some ELF brushes because all these brushes are are cute!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom and I am amazed at the quality of these brushes!!!!! So soft, they are travel size, How I think they are perfect!!!!! Must buy if you like MAC Brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> do not buy this item.  It is not an official MAC  product.  I work for the company and this is not MAC it is a horrendous fake.  You are wasting your money if you buy this.</li>
    <li> MAC cosmetics NEVER released a brush set with the hello kitty collection.  I am a former MAC employee that worked for the company when the Hello Kitty Collection was launched....they NEVER released a brush set for the Hello Kitty collection at all.  Also, Mac eyeshadows do NOT EVER lift up to reveal a secret compartment, nor do they rise up above the pot, true MAC shadows are always flush.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on something that isn&#x27;t what you want it to be!</li>
    <li> I am happy but when it says your gonna get somethinng free i think you should. I didnt recieve anything free just what i ordere</li>
    <li> These cannot be REAL MAC brushes - the head of the foundation brush fell off of it&#x27;s handle within days of receiving the set - and some of the brushes are not soft at all. I ended up giving this set to my 11yr old to play make up since they did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
    <li> No reflection on the seller...&lt;br /&gt;This product was soo cheaply made, that the little money that you use to purchase it, is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped one of the brushes by accident, from not a tall height, and not only did the handle break, but I was so disgusted that I happily gave the set Salvation Army, purchased two other different type sets from Amazon, and have been so happy ever since....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing this 7pc set.... you will not be happy.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but it&#x27;s the truth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;Hello Kitty&amp;#34; brush set  because it was at the price of $24.00 and it said it was a MAC product. I guess I should have been smarter in knowing that these brushes are Just a very cheap copy.&lt;br /&gt;This is the type of quality you would expect from the dollar store. Please save yourself the trouble and choose a different brush set. You might invest a few bucks more, but its going to be worth it. These brushes suck. I bought them 4 months ago and most of them already broke, I gave them to my little niece so she can play with them. (she didn&#x27;t like them either lol)&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!! this is a terrible invesment</li>
    <li> Just received these brushes and I love the fact that they are small and it comes with its own case.  I am going on vacation soon and these brushes will definitely be going with me</li>
    <li> Seriously, i feel stupid for believing these were real. They came in the mail today, and I was appalled by the terrible craftsmanship. If you&#x27;re going to try and put the brushes out there as \\&quot;M.A.C.\\&quot; then at least sew the stitches on the case decently, or make the brushes a little better quality. I compared these brushes to some actual mac brushes i own, and they are crap compared to them. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> i bought this same set from M.A.C at macy&#x27;s a while back when they were featuring the hello kitty items. unfortunately the set was stolen...i was happy when i saw them on amazon ($35.00) at the time...significantly less than i had originally paid for them. they were the same exact thing. same quality and case. the brushes that come in featured sets, like these, are always a bit different than the full sized ones that you can buy individually from mac.</li>
    <li> I have real mac brushes and I wanted a travel set. I thought the price was good so I ordered it. These hello kitty mac brushes are fake. Do not purchase them if you&#x27;re used to the real deal- luxurious mac brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush set came exactly as pictured. The brushes were in great shape when arrived. I got a lot of usage out of them-probably a year or so-before the bristles started to come off. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy these again for daily use but if I ever need them for travel, I&#x27;ll keep them in mind-and so should you.</li>
    <li> I got this item and i luv it, for a travel size makeup brush set from Hello kitty, it was o.k. not a fan of the eyelid and crease brush, they are small. but it is just a travel size small brush set.</li>
    <li> Nice Set.  My 10yr old daughter loves these</li>
    <li> i was so happy when i got this product not only was it a great price but its by a great name brand i would buy from them again, shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> The vinyl cover is cheap and smells.  The writing on the brushes are imprinted like cheap pencils.  The brushes are of inferior quality.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> very good items and quality</li>
    <li> Cute product just not real. These are fake brushes. I bought them for myself but ended up giving them to my 5 year old daughter cause try were not good quality.</li>
    <li> They were cute but they were cheap and didn&#x27;t last as long as previous brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
