    <li> Easy to use clippers not only look nice, but cut quick and clean.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love it. I got it with a high discount code. after i got it, I tried it. it is the best clipper for my toe nail. my left big toe nail is thicker than normal, usually, i need a scissor to cut it. this time I use this nail clipper cut it. yah, I do not need a scissors for my toe nail any more.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for toe nail. You know how it is to cut your toe nail, hard to find a good spot to cut it. And most of time you just can&#x27;t get a clear cut because your clipper is too small. Not with this, This is the perfect size for those hard toe nails, very well build and sharp. I have no doubt that this is a quality clipper that will last for a very long time. Plus they offer life time warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This product was received either at no or low cost for review purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. **</li>
    <li> Very good, May be better if it was just for fingers.</li>
    <li> Having a good pair of nail clippers in my bag is a must. I work with my hands a lot during the day, and I tend to get broken nails quite often. Because of this, I like to keep clippers on hand with me in my purse that way I can easily clip away the broken nail, and prevent any other breakage. Plus it keeps my nails looking well groomed and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pair of clippers are nicely designed, and fit in the hand perfectly. They are fantastic when it comes to cutting nails. One snip and the job is done. These are sharp and make nice clean cuts. They don&#x27;t cause any splitting of the nail at all. These are a very nice, good quality pair of nail clippers. They have a permanent home in my purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> If nail clippers could be pretty, then these are.  Hey are made of stainless steel, and are decorated with a pretty diamond shape cut-out on the handle.  The clippers are large and very sharp.  They are easy to grip and easy to squeeze.  They make clean cuts.  As with any nail clippers, they work the best after your nails have been soaked or after your shower.  They are no-rust, and are easy to clean and sterilize.  You can hang them up using the hole on the back, if you choose.  I was happy when given the opportunity to order for evaluation and review.  All opinions shared are my own, and your opinion may differ.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a very picky and particular person no matter what I&#x27;m dealing with and these nail clippers from Clear Line pass all my tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Line has done an amazing job providing us with the perfect clippers. From the moment I removed them from their stylish packaging I could tell they were a quality product. They are definitely stainless steel, but at the same time not too beefy to get the job done. I also like how they shaved some weight and added a bit of style with the four diamonds on the clipper handle. Last, but most certainly not least I am a huge fan of the matte/satin finish as opposed to the typical chrome we&#x27;ve become used to over the years. This finish keeps these clippers looking fresh and clean like the day I received them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with that said, if you or someone you know is in need of a new set of quality nail clippers then you&#x27;ve found them. I&#x27;m definitely hoping to see more products from Clear Line in the near future!</li>
    <li> None of the manufactures understand that the gripping surfaces need to have deep grooves or a checkerboard pattern to keep the clipper from slipping out of your fingers or hand hand.  I  contacted the company and made improvement suggestions. They got back to me and refunded my purchase price and will work on my design suggestions.  I am impressed with their customer service and desire to improve their products.</li>
    <li> This are these are the very best clippers I have used, they are very precise, they cut clean, and no slipping. This is a very sturdy product.  Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
    <li> really nice shape and handling, very sharp</li>
    <li> Works great very sharp wish it had a built in file</li>
    <li> works great and has been nice addition to my beauty bag.</li>
    <li> I am giving this pair of nail clippers to my husband... I am also giving him this set with a dirty look...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He cuts his nails outside, and he has a really bad habit of leaving the Clippers behind when he comes back into the house. Why he forgets them outside almost every single time I have absolutely no idea. Especially since he only goes out there to cut his nails, how do you forget the nail clippers? I just don&#x27;t even understand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, because he forgets them outside, and we live in Florida... Yes. They rest. And quickly, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s once every week there&#x27;s no rush, it&#x27;s almost overnight. Well, I had bought him another pair of fingernail clippers that were supposed to be dressed resistant, but it turned out that that was just some false advertising and they were absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing professional stainless steel nail clipper. They are super sharp, they are not overly heavy, they are definitely unisex, although I told him that they were made for men because if I told him that they were unisex, he wouldn&#x27;t want them as much. I have no idea why, it&#x27;s just one of those things that I have to deal with daily... He actually believe it because they are longer than almost every other nail clipper he&#x27;s ever seen. But because these are sharper than any of the other ones he&#x27;s had definitely believe that these are made just for men. Something about men having sticker nails? I stopped listening after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So he loves them, &amp; I actually watched him bring these back into the house and place them oh so gently on his counter in our bathroom. I thought it was funny, but I&#x27;m not going to tell him anything else. I&#x27;m just happy that he brought them from outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made from a really nice stainless steel, &amp; I actually do believe that this will never rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This clipper is a beast, an incredibly efficient tool where struggling against nails is now a thing of the past. It packs a powerful clipping punch, making toenail cutting a breeze. After years of struggling with awful finger and toe nail clippers which never clipped evenly, left pieces behind, and were semi-rusted junk. This clipper is a grade above all. These clippers are have amazing durability and reliability. They are made of professional grade stainless steel which gives precision cutting for all lengths and thickness. Its easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t rust. Its built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review. However the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this, except the premium price</li>
    <li> These truly are the best nail clippers out there! Easy to use and sharp. Prompt shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I know one thing after using these clippers, I&#x27;m never going to have to buy another one of these things again!  They&#x27;re durable and I had no problem clipping my toe nails (even my big toes) but gentle enough on my finger nails too.  It&#x27;s like the clippers adjust the amount of pressure they clip based on what kind of nails they&#x27;re clipping... I know it sound weird but that&#x27;s how I can put it into words.  Very solid product and I believe it&#x27;s undervalued - super great steal at this price also considering you won&#x27;t have to buy another set again... ever.</li>
    <li> These clippers work magic on my toe nails. They clip my nails so easy like butter. Compared to other clipper this are hands down the best I have used and I have used a lot of clippers. You can easily squeeze the handles together to cut your nails without a ton of pressure like other clippers. Since they cut so easy be careful to pay attention so you don&#x27;t cut too much. It leaves the top of my nails smooth. I like how there is two types of texture on the part where your thumb goes. When I used these clippers I didn&#x27;t have to worry they were going to slip out of my hands. I received these nail clippers for free to test and review then give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, easy to use and sharp. Excellent and timely service from vendor.</li>
    <li> my toenails won&#x27;t fit between the blades (nail clipper)</li>
    <li> These clippers are perfect for anyone with issues using their fingers. They are so easy to press together to make a clean cut. I have RA, and it makes it difficult to grip and squeeze things at times, especially small items like clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that they are sharp, they make a clean cut smoothly both on finger and toe nails. I also like that the cutting edge curves along the shape of my nails instead of flat or upward. Makes shaping my nails while cutting them so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper gets a thumbs up from my crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper. The best part about it is the aesthetics. The diamonds make for a nice look. Functionally, it does its job: it cuts your finger nails. If I had to find a flaw, it&#x27;s that the outer finishing scratches easily. I really don&#x27;t care about that because it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> Its &amp;#34;largeness&amp;#34; is a disappointment, for it&#x27;s identical in size to the clipper I was replacing.</li>
    <li> Best I have every used.  The size did scare me a little but it works great on finger nails.  I am certainly not going to misplace it because of the size.  This may be the last nail clipper I will ever need to buy.</li>
    <li> Most heavy duty nail clippers can also be a pain to use. I have arthritis in my hands and some of them you have to exert so much pressure that it just winds up hurting my hands and the nail only gets a dent, not a cut. These exert a fantastic amount of pressure, so that even when Mr Thick Nasty Toenails used them, they cut like butter. I suppose it&#x27;s because they&#x27;r actually super sharp. Another complaint I have about most heavy duty clippers is that they&#x27;re just OVERKILL for trimming fingernails, but these did a fantastic job of evening out my nails without leaving jagged or sharp edges. These truly are all purpose. Being stainless steel, we can leave them on the bathroom counter without worrying about them rusting and BONUS! they come with a lifetime guarantee! How cool is that?</li>
    <li> Much better than my previous nail clipper. I&#x27;m glad I paid extra to get a premium product.</li>
    <li> Best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are so strong and sharp! They cut through even the thickest toenail with ease!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how many nail/toenail clippers I have gone through in the last 10 years because they either broke, lost their sharpness, or were too hard to press down and it frustrated me! These clippers are great for nails and toenails, are super sharp and so easy to press down. I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to have these for many years to come because of the quality and sharpness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these clippers for free in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> My nails grow extremely fast, and I have to cut them twice a week. Due to problems with my hands, I can no longer use my clippers; several different pair. I never thought I would spend $15 dollars for nail clippers, but I have to say it&#x27;s truly worth it! I have no problem squeezing them, and they are very sharp. Very glad I bought them! Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> nice and sharp just wish they were a little easier to hold</li>
    <li> These are great nail clippers.  My husband, like most men, have those lovely toenails.  I swear they&#x27;re made out of something different than mine.  He breaks drugstore nail clippers all the time.  These are very strong and cut nicely.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll last a long time.  Thanks for letting me try these out to review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:4ebde9f0cee9ebab319cdbfcf1a8f6f1]]Extremely easy and simple to use. Nice larger size. Made of stainless steel, Has a lovely heavy weight and looks like its made to last for a very long time.. it cuts with ease. I did not have to apply much pressure to clip.  The cut was clean.. I honesty prefer smaller ones so I can have more handing when cutting but these were really great. I would recommend these for the men. Overall i was really happy with this purchase. Pretty design, nice weight, stainless steel, great cut - all Pros in my book.. .  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.</li>
    <li> Thought they would cut better than they did but got the job done and at a good price</li>
    <li> These work great, very sharp and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact company via email on Amazon about Lifetime Warranty, it gets you in the system.</li>
    <li> Easy Press Clippers are very easy to use and feel comfortable in your hand. It does not take a lot of pressure to clip the nails and they provide a sharp clean cut which is something I really like. There is also no tearing of the nails.  No need to have finger nail and toe nail clippers sitting around the easy press clippers is all you need! They are strong enough for your toes.</li>
    <li> These cut finger nails with almost no effort; unlike the cheap clippers you buy at the local drug store.  They are very well made and the blades are sharp and honed.  They are a bit large, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> Now that I have use it a while I can say I don&#x27;t lime this clipper.  It is hard to hold and it slips out from my hand. The cuts are irregular and very noisy. The clippings fly everywhere instead of falling down and the edge is dulling quickly.</li>
    <li> This product works quite well for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> There are a couple of things that I will pay a little more for to make sure that they work well.  One is tweezers...I will threaten someone who dare to touch my tweezers.  lol.  The other thing is clippers.  It&#x27;s just necessary that good clippers be sharp, easy to grip and control, and the right size.  I was very impressed with these when I took them out and felt them in my hand.  You can just tell when you have control.  The steel is brushed and not the slick, shiny kind that you usually find clippers made from.  I think that made a big difference in the control I felt.  The blades are very sharp , which is very important in getting a clean cut the first time.  I am all around happy with these clippers because they pass all of the checkpoints needed to qualify as good clippers in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for the purpose of testing and review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Easy to use...cuts quickly leaving no jagged edges</li>
