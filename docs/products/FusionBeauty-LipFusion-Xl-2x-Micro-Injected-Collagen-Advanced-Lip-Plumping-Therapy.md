<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. I love the texture of it, and I really do feel like it makes my lips a lot fuller.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of this wonderful plumper!! When I first tried this product after MUCH research and reading every possible review, I was disappointed in my personal first-try results. My lips tingled a bit, but it was so goopy, I thought I had wasted my money. Anyway, decided to wear it later that night, I kept noticing my boyfriend staring at my lips, I thought maybe it was the high-gloss factor.... He finally said, &amp;#34;your lipstick is gorgeous&amp;#34;... I thought uhm.... I&#x27;ve been wearing this lipstick for months he never said anything. I replied, &amp;#34;this is what I&#x27;ve been wearing&amp;#34;, and he said, &amp;#34;But your lips look juicier!&amp;#34; Needless to say, I ran to the mirror and could actually see that my lips were plump and fuller!!!! It wasn&#x27;t the glossiness.... My lips were truly plumped!!! Now! This plumper is a staple!!!!!!! Juicy plump lips!!!!! YESSSS!!!!! give it about 10-15 minutes after application and you&#x27;ll see!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it as LGWB (lip gloss with benefits).  However the product came from the seller in a clear, plastic makeup bag and I know why.  The container was broken at the top and leaking. I had to throw the product out after a while because the top finally broke entirely off and I could not use it further.  Too bad, product is not a cheap item.</li>
    <li> I noticed that this really plumped up my lips when I was in very humid climates but didn&#x27;t do much of anything for me in dry air climates.</li>
    <li> I bought the regular lip fusion months ago and didn&#x27;t think it would do a thing.  While I didn&#x27;t think it did exactly what it claimed I liked it.  It left my lips soft and slightly fuller while I was wearing it.  I read a review one time that said it should be used as a treatment, put on every night.  I agree with that.  It worked much better if you used it every night and a few times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;However this XL does almost nothing for me.  No matter how much I use it.  I don&#x27;t understand it.  It should be the same as regular, but with an added kick, right?  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be.  It doesn&#x27;t plump hardly at all no matter how faithful I am at using it.  And it doesn&#x27;t make my lips overly soft the way the regular does.  I actually think it dries them out a little.  All in all I&#x27;m disappointed.  I won&#x27;t buy it again or recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love this product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Does not do any lip \\&quot;plumping\\&quot;. however it does work as a nice clear gloss- though I&#x27;m sure you can find one much cheaper that works equally as good.</li>
    <li> When I first used it I saw a small effect the first try and more each day I used it.  Combined with the LipFusion lip gloss you will have soft pouty lips at any age :o)</li>
    <li> Use it for many years,it&#x27;s mean I love it</li>
    <li> I have tried this item for three weeks now and it doesn&#x27;t do anything but put a gloss on my lips.  I put it on in the evening and wake up to microscopically puffier lips, but I attribute that to the normal morning puffiness that I always experience.  If I apply the LipFusion XL during the day, my lips are glossier, but not plumper.  I have heard that the regular LipFusion (not the XL) works better for some people, so I will give that a try (also it is less expensive!).</li>
    <li> I mistakenly bought this product for my daughter. SHAINY&#x27;S graciously accepted my return, even though the time had expired for a return. This company stands by its vow to give \\&quot;superior customer service\\&quot;. I would definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I used this for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any difference in my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.  Would not recommend. Thanks</li>
    <li> This the third product that I have tried for lip plumping and have to say it is the least effective of the three.  At this point, City Lips, the first product I tried, has worked the best and lasted the longest.</li>
    <li> 100% WORKS! Everyone in my family suffers from extremely chapped lips. We all use this product (even the boys sometimes lol). I used to have to apply lip balm 15 times a day. Now I just used LipFusion XL once or twice a day. Yes, it&#x27;s very expensive but it really lasts and more important WORKS.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. I feel the tingling/plumping and my lips looks beautiful at night but when I wake up the \\&quot;plump\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really there. I would recommend using before putting on your makeup to give your lips time to swell and fill out as well as at night.</li>
    <li> I love using the lip fusion XL! I already have decently plumped lips, but a little extra never hurts ;) It does have a some tingeling but it doesn&#x27;t last more than 15 min or so, at least for me. Don&#x27;t expect it to give you \\&quot;Injectable grade Lips\\&quot; because it won&#x27;t, and neither will any other over the counter lip plumper! But if you don&#x27;t have the money to pay for injections and need a nice way to plump your lips a bit, I suggest this!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it with 5 stars is the price. It is a bit high :)</li>
    <li> Still my go to for lip health, Not greasy and tingly making your lips color vibrant and red, young and plump LOVE, Been using for 5 yeara</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product several times before at Sephora.  It wasn&#x27;t available so I was glad to find it on Amazon.  The price was reasonable and the item was received promptly.  It still works well as a lip plumper and as a gloss which can be used over any color of lipstick or alone.  The problem is I can&#x27;t carry it in my handbag because the contained was broken off at the top of the bottle.  When I opened the package, it had already begun to leak all over the container.  I have kept it on the vanity so I can use it when I get ready to leave the house.  It would be nice to be able to carry it with me and re-apply it during the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now, and I&#x27;ve not only never had chapped lips again, ( despite NE winters and beinga mouth breather!) but my lips retain a fullness and the lip edge remains firm from using it. NOTE: this product does not and should not make your lips tingle- it doesn&#x27;t work that way, as others do, with pepper to bring blood to the lips. I did once order some from an auction site and I had BURNED lips, so it was obviously counterfeit. If you get some that feels tingling or burning, return right away and report it. THe real stuff has a mild mint smell and taste to it. One tube lasts me well over a year- I put it on at night only. I went weeks without recently and really saw the difference in my lips looking less firm and full. It does&#x27;nt give you huge lips, but it keeps them fuller. In beauty, it&#x27;s the millimeters that make a difference sometimes. You won&#x27;t get blowfish lips with this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this at night for years.  It keeps my lips soft, plump and moisturized.  I am definitely sold on this product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip gloss for many reasons. 1) It makes my lips glow from the inside out- like a preteen anime character 2) I apply it at night and my lips are plump the next day all day- and it looks like I was born with soft, pillowy airbrushed lips 3) It seems to brighten my lips. I&#x27;m tan-olive skinned and my lips are dark coral, and a little too dark sometimes, and this lipcloss makes them a soft pink fleshy color. The gloss itself is translucent but it does something to bare-lips that make them light pinker, moist, and pilllowy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2007 and I can&#x27;t live without it.  It makes my lips soft and more plump.  I already have big lips, but they don&#x27;t have that bee stung look that mist people want, and this seems to help.  I would be upset if they discontinue this.</li>
    <li> The best lip plumper around. I use it every night. Could not do without it. Lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> This Lip plumper is amazing it works just a few minutes after you apply it it makes ur lips fuller and sexier &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I wanted to see if this product would eliminate the need to get injections to assist in plumping out my thinning lips.  It does help but no way produces any great lasting results. I was impressed with the speedy delivery from Amazon and the easy one-click ordering. I shall no doubt try similar products from Amazon in due course.</li>
    <li> LipFusion XL is very rad! It looks great and I think it really does plump your lips. It&#x27;s very hydrating and looks great if just worn as a gloss.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t thing this product lived up to what it says it does! I liked the orange flavor but it didn&#x27;t plump at all lol and the price is a burn! I would recommend the City Lips it does do as its says but is expensive as well however if you buy two they give you a third for around 89.99 they also last a long time per wand tube and there&#x27;s not much of a taste, hope this was helpful ;-) [...]</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work immediately as well as other stuff; in the mornings, I use Too Faced Lip Injection. But as a nightly treatment, this stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a billion years, since it first came out. I tried a couple of weeks ago to switch to Dior&#x27;s lip treatment (Sephora seems to be running out of all LipFusion. I wonder if they&#x27;re being discontinued?), and it just wasn&#x27;t the same. For the first time in years my lips were chapping and dry. Ordered more LipFusion XL. I am happy.</li>
    <li> This is a great lip smoothing and plumping product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH ;IT SMELLS GOOD AND IT HAS A SLIGHT TINGLE TO IT ;FEELS REALLY GOOD ON THE LIP&#x27;S WELL AT LEAST FOR ME IT DOES .SOMETIMES  I ADD A LITTLE PICK WITH IT .WORKS VERY WELL .</li>
    <li> This is the gold standard for lip plumpers.  You can use this as a base or solo and if you put it on before bed at night, it not only plumps, but moisturizes as well.  Just a reminder, you&#x27;re not supposed to use this while you&#x27;re out in the sun.</li>
    <li> My wife is 50 and has been buying this for years.  She uses it every night.  It keeps the lips moist and free from cracking.  She tried some other products that were less expensive, but she noticed that her lips started looking less plump.  I don&#x27;t think you should expect dramatic plumping after one use.  It appears to be a long term slow process with just a plumper appearance with continued use.  My wife loves it and continues to buy it year after year.  They used to sell it at Sephora, but now we get it from Amazon at a much better price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an ok to neutral rating.I like this  product but, has a sticky lip gloss feel on lips. I was expecting more from a $40 lip plumper</li>
    <li> This is just like the old Sally Hansen LipFusiuon that used to cost $7 at any CVS or other big box pharmacy. It has a nice, wake e up, mint fragrance that others comment on when newly applied. I just think it is overpriced.</li>
    <li> My lips are fuller, smoother and my lip line is more defined. I haven&#x27;t had chapped lips since I first used it.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. It didn&#x27;t even work well as a lip gloss because it wears off so quickly. I saw no plumping, felt no tingling, nothing. I purchased this November 12, 2012 and used it as instructed until it was gone. I always give a product the benefit of the doubt and am also aware that things take longer to work on some than it does others. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for $1 to use as a lip-gloss.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product when I first started using it...about the first two tubes.  While my lips didn&#x27;t seem plumper, they definitely seemed to stay softer and moisturized (I stopped having to use balm throughout the day).  And the tubes last forever just using it once at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula with this last tube or what....but my lips are staying dry like never before.  I&#x27;ve started having to use balm throughout the day again and exfoliate my lips more often, too.  I&#x27;ve used the product for about three years now....it&#x27;s not like this is a season that&#x27;s different.  And my skin/hair isn&#x27;t getting dryer overall.  It really does seem to be this product that&#x27;s the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my other products...won&#x27;t be buying any more of this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price for what it claims to do.  It doesn&#x27;t plump nearly as much as it wants you to believe.  It feels interesting on the lips though, and FEELS like it makes a difference.  Hard to say though, because I can&#x27;t really see results.  It just seems like a lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for plumping. I have very dry, chapped and peeling lips. This product softens the dry skin and allows me to remove it with a Qtip. Once again I can have smooth soft lips. Nothing else works.</li>
    <li> I was reading the reviews and was very surprised at how many people say it doesn&#x27;t work. It definitely works for me. After about three weeks of using it every night I saw that my lips were very noticeably plumper and also had more color. People would even ask me if I was wearing some kind of lip stain when my lips were just bare. I have been sick for about a month, but my lips have retained their plump, although not the rosy color. Yes it is expensive, but I had searched the web and Amazon&#x27;s price is better than most. I paid $32 and at other sites the price is $50. If this one doesn&#x27;t work for you, City Lips clear has also worked for me.</li>
    <li> Read entire review please.  I like the product much &amp; have been using it for years.  I was very dissappointed that I received some wierd  double container of the product I ordered, with lip therapy on the top&amp; with the bottom half just lip fusion.  Lip fusion is a fraction of the price, of the therapy so I was very ripped off.  Since I live in Costa Rica , &amp; had a friend bring this to me from his visit in Cal., I could not send it back.  Disgruntled purchaser</li>
    <li> love this product...best on the market</li>
    <li> I had used LipFusion XL in the past and loved it but they no longer carried product in the store where I had purchase. Then I saw city lips on-line and decided to try. Okay for softening lips but not plumping. Went back to LipFusion and I am happy again!</li>
    <li> It does moisture but I don&#x27;t see significant difference in size of my lips although I still like it better than other products that sting</li>
    <li> Didnt Work. Didnt Tingle Like Other CHEAPER Products Like The Maybelline...SO Disappointed. I Was Really Excited About This Product. Oh Well.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all and this is the best of the best!  Glides on and lasts for hours.  I wouldn&#x27;t be caught without it</li>
    <li> I apply LipFusion  just before bed.  I live in Michigan and we had the coldest weather in Northern Michigan, since I have lived here.  No dryness, flakiness, and my lips feel good and they are a bit more plump.  At 69 I noticed my lips &amp;#34;thining&amp;#34;.  LipFusion has given me more upper lip, and made my lips look very healthy.  I am sold.</li>
    <li> So before I purchased this item, I decided to read some reviews and was surprised to see many great ones. I even watched a YouTube video of a teen who raved about it and showed before and after pictures. Of course I was hornswoggled! Ugh. This does not work! I saw absolutely no difference. This does make a great smelling lipgloss though.</li>
    <li> I like this lip plumper more than most.  Many of them don&#x27;t really do anything - you can feel this one working</li>
    <li> I used to buy the Almay version in the stores.  It was cheaper, (much cheaper) and had much more in it,  but now it isn&#x27;t made anymore.  I think this co. bought them out and gives you a little bit for an outrageous price.  I would not buy this again.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> XL LIP FUSION is the best product I have ever used for decreasing fine lines that occur with aging around the lips and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I have  used it morninIg and evening for years and I continue to be very satisfied with the results. Gentle plumping of the lips and disappearance of the fine lines above the lips and the mouth............this product delivers!</li>
    <li> doesnt work AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way overpriced goopy lip gloss</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have used another similar, without luck, but this is great, AND doesn&#x27;t burn!</li>
    <li> After using this for almost 2 weeks, my lips show no improvement as far as plumping. The product goes on sticky and makes my lips tingle but if that is what you are after then this product is for you. Otherwise if you are looking to look in the mirror and see your lips plump, forget it. I would recommend you look for some other product elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I got this two.&lt;br /&gt;I brought this as a souvenir for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;She was very satisfied with it !&lt;br /&gt;And I also love it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is worth every dollar. makes my mouth pretty and maintains a nice non oily moisture. plumps my lip as soon as i put it on.</li>
    <li> Great product for plumping lips when used at night, lips looks dewy &amp; full in morning although the effect wears off quickly....shame really. However Ive only had this for 3 weeks so will keep using &amp; hopefully the subtle plumping effect &amp; dewy look will last longer in the daytime. Overall I love the effect &amp; it gives me the fullness I had in my 20&#x27;s, if it lasted longer I would be a fan for life.</li>
    <li> I was told that this product would not be made anymore, I hope that is not true.  I would really miss it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.  It is good for night time to help your lips stay hydrated and look more plump.  More effective than some kind of lip balm.  It lasts quite a while, so don&#x27;t let the price point dissuade you from buying it.</li>
    <li> The product did not &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; as expected and actually made my lips feel dry and it was difficult to apply other lip color over the top.</li>
    <li> really lovely product.  after applying it to the lips, can feel a little pricking and feel hot.  The effect is obvious too however cannot last long.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I have been using it twice a day since I received it. I can&#x27;t see ANY difference in the size of my lips. It is very sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Its plumping effect isn&#x27;t dramatic and lasts only as long as it&#x27;s on your lips, but it feels &amp; looks good while it&#x27;s there.  I&#x27;ve subsequently found another treatment I like better - Smashbox O-PLUMP INTUITIVE LIP PLUMPER</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  I highly recommend it.  It really works, but you must use it consistently.  Give it a try.  Fast shipping as well.  great seller!</li>
    <li> Have used lip fusion in the past and been using various high priced glosses but non compared to LipFusionXL. Now I sometimes wear a tint and this over or just use this at bed. I would recommend getting the Lip Fusion in a color due to the way the color last and also the application is seamless and blended unlike on the occasions when I do combine my lip colors. It works both ways but I truly love the feel of Lip FusionXL. They both have definitely plumped my lips back to where they were when I used them on a regular basis. You have to be consistent in using this product like any other facial/lip product. Feels good and so do the compliments. The price is high if you are a compulsive applicator, then I would recommend using one product for day and LipFusionXL for night for the lip plumping effect.</li>
    <li> I pair this with La Lip Jolie, and try to remember to use twice a day. Seems to moisturize my lips and  in turn make wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I ordered a lot of items and this was the only one i didnt recieve for some reason. I also ordered city lips, which came in mail, and i do like it but i was excited to try this as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip treatment for plumping and moisturizing; and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  I can only give 4 out of 5 stars because I can&#x27;t really tell if there are long-term benefits (like the manufacturer claims), however, while using this product, the results are: youthful, moist, vibrant-toned lips. I am 44 years old and I had worked in the cosmetics industry for about 20 years...this product seems to be unbeatable!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It&#x27;s the first lip plumper I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m happy. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to make you look like ruby rose but it definitely fills out fine lines and you can feel your lips get fuller. It&#x27;s a has a nice tingle without irritating my lips and it looks amazing over other lipsticks. For what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I&#x27;m very happy. The picture attached is just a minute or two after applying</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> This product is nice--smells good and feels good--but does not plump in the least.  Not worth $40!  A nice gloss but not a plumper.</li>
    <li> love love love this item works fab fab fab!</li>
    <li> I really like how this moisturizes my lips each night i apply.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell the difference when i miss a night. I am not sure about how much it helps in plumping but i got these only beacuse my lips are dry and these are the only gloss which keeps them moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I had juvederm lip injections over 5 years ago and I was able to prolong the look by using this product twice a day. A little greasy to use under lipcolor but OK to wear at night or first thing in the morning while at the gym.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know about this product actually plumping, but it gives a nice sensation and keeps lips hydrated...then again Im rather forgetful and don&#x27;t apply every night. But I would probably agree with the other reviewers, if there is plumping is not really noticeable, and if you want fake looking lips your going to have to actually get surgery for those...sorry. I&#x27;m just happy I bought it on Amazon for 36 dollars instead of on sephora for 50! Love you Amazon</li>
    <li> pretty good. i really like it. it helps me a lot. and i would buy maybe 3 more for my friends</li>
    <li> I love this, nothing else moisturizes and plumps better that I have tried. I&#x27;ve learned to not be tempted by a cheaper product, because I always end up buying this after wasting my money on inferior items!</li>
    <li> Use at night and can feel a difference. I chose not to pay for the pricier City Lips that promises so much. I like this and can see a difference</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference except possibly that my lips were softer in the morning than they had been at night</li>
    <li> This is the best ...but I use it at night for lip conditioning....</li>
    <li> Over priced.  But does feel nice on lips.</li>
    <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not but thought id try it anyway. i just put generous amount right before going to bed and wake up with much fuller lips, definitely noticeable. I thought id use it overnight since using it during the day AND keeping it on my lips is impossible - it will be licked off or left on a cup of coffee within 10 minutes but at night it stays on lips longer. like it</li>
    <li> This is a truly excellent produce.  I love how it makes my lips look so nice and plump.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several lip plumpers and there is nothing better then Lip Fusion XL. You feel it working instantly and it last for hours. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this regularly, but all I get is a tingle, and NO plump. My lips stick to everything, my hair, my husband, and that&#x27;s even when I put lipstick over it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used in-store products that tingled, and felt like this product does on my lips, the difference is, the in-store product cost about $35 less. I wasn&#x27;t expecting filler results, but I expected more than a little cold tingle.</li>
    <li> I have used this nightly for more than 10 years. It is not advertised as having a long-term effect, but I started in my mid 50s with thin lips and now have lips as full as I would want. The first night as I usually do with new beauty products, I used it only on the left side of my mouth. I woke with a very crooked smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback, it has a flavor that is not pleasant for kissing.</li>
    <li> this did nothing for my lips that would justify its price. its basically clear sticky moisture gloss. I bought one by physicians formula and one by nyx that were a fraction of the price and basically did the same thing, which is not much but at least they didn&#x27;t cost much. Im sticking to eos lip balms cheap, natural and smell nice. also no irritation</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m putting some crazy chemicals on my lips, but my lips did feel very moisturized and in turn they felt more plump!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years, am attached to it.  Stays on, brings out tiny bit of natural color.  It does come off when you eat or drink though.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months find it better than any other plumping item.</li>
    <li> I do think Lip Fusion works.  It doesn&#x27;t make movie star lips but it does help define your lips so that they look plumper.</li>
    <li> This is my go to for night time.  Moisturizes and works to plump at night.</li>
    <li> This product works!  I&#x27;ve tried many lip plump glosses and this one is the best!  I have bought this twice and plan to purchase again!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love LipFusion products. Yes, they &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; your lips and the shine lasts longer than drug store brands. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product every night since 2006.</li>
    <li> As a more mature woman, my lips were not as plump as they once were.  This product seems to help, especially when used regularly.  People have been asking me lately how I get my lipstick so perfect!  Frankly, I just use this along with a lipliner in a nuetral and I&#x27;m set.  This seller rocks also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipfusion for the past several years.  I&#x27;m not sure if it really makes a physical difference, but it feels and smells nice, and I will continue to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Personally I did not find a bit of difference that of store brand.  Expensive.  It is easier finding a cheaper version at a store</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have been using it for about 6 years. Haven&#x27;t found anything that works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using lip fusion for years and its still my absolute favorite.  I&#x27;ve tried other lip plumping products, but nothing comes close to Lip Fusion.</li>
    <li> This product does plump the lips and has no funny taste or smell.  Stays on even over lipstick.  I will definitely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I saw the product advertised with \\&quot;actual\\&quot; data and thought that there may be something special with this lip plumper. I purchased 2 to make sure I followed through with the full month. Results are disappointing and so I have another crappy product rolling around my cosmetic drawer.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. Not much of a plumper but leave it overnight and it will make your lips very soft.</li>
    <li> This product might have really been great 5 years ago when it first came out, but since then, I&#x27;ve tried many drug store balms that work better.</li>
    <li> I have always hated my small lips!  This product has done what it says.  My lips are fuller:). I use it once a day (after washing my face before bed) and it keeps them plump for the WHOLE 24 HOURS!  It does not burn or sting.  It has a light tingly menthol feeling to it.  I will not EVER be without this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2 years. One thing I noticed it that it actually caused the little furrows around my lip line to completely disappear. This was something I didn&#x27;t even expect. Actually, it was my hubby that noticed it first. It&#x27;s a product I haven&#x27;t been without since my first order. FINALLY...something that works!</li>
    <li> Use it every night, very mosterizing and seriously plumps lips. Been using for 2 years.</li>
    <li> I have used for years  at night and my lips are never chapped. It also plumps them a little as well</li>
    <li> I actually meant to buy another product that I have been using and apparently clicked on the wrong one.  I found this product to be extremely drying on my lips and stopped using it after just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This is a stickey mess on your lips!!</li>
    <li> This is a total waste of money! Your lips turn dark pink but there is little-to NO plumping! I&#x27;ve read many reviews and I was very excited now I just believe this product to be&lt;br /&gt;FRAUDULENT.</li>
    <li> ???????  Who knows.  Need time.  Klara</li>
    <li> I have been using this several years and I can not go without this, it works great, love it.</li>
    <li> Really helps with chapped lips before they even become officially chapped.  I apply in the evening, paying special attention to use when my lips start to feel like they may become chapped, works like a charm, EVERY time.  I have been using this product for at least 7 years.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip plumper by far. The colors in Lip fusion are great for day to keep that full lip look.</li>
    <li> Great if you don&#x27;t want the injections. Plumps with long lasting gloss</li>
    <li> For the price, seriously, I was thinking two young and plump lips on my face after the application.  Nope.  Just red and sticky. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this works.... I know it definitely makes my lips tingle, I just can&#x27;t decide if that tingle 1. actually makes them fuller or 2. subconsciously makes me think that it&#x27;s working and my lips look fuller, or 3. if they&#x27;re just tingling and the tingle makes me purse my lips like I&#x27;m trying to look sexy all the time... (which in turn makes me feel ridiculous)&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the case, it&#x27;s a good long lasting lip gloss, even if it does make me duck face all over the place like a teenage girl trying to impress the boys.</li>
    <li> It is fine, just did not notice that much of a difference. It seems like you need to put in on all the time for some effect.</li>
    <li> What I like about this product is that it gives my lips a fuller and healthier look without having to use fillers. It also keeps my lips softer and smooth.</li>
    <li> Of all the limp plumpers on the market, this is my favorite.  None of them give you the &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; you hope for, but this comes the closest.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, and it does a good job of moisturizing too.  It is easy to apply, no strong smell or taste.  It was hard to find, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on previous reviews, and because I needed a good lip plumper to enhance and prolong recent lip injections that I have received.  I have been using this gloss for about a week, and it really works!  This product lightly tingles, but it is not painful.  After wearing it for a few minutes, I can really tell a difference in the thickness and plumpness of my lips.  I also apply it before I got to bed, and I wake up with nicely plumped lips.  It is sort of pricy, but it is really worth it to me to have the juiciest, softest lips I can have!  I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product because it doesn&#x27;t work.  I used it as directed, but my lips never looked any different, weren&#x27;t hydrated, smoother etc..  It will make your lips feel dry after applying it.  I will go back to applying lip balm at night before bed; at least my lips will be moist.</li>
    <li> This did nothing to plump my lips.  It goes on thick and sticky and has a tingly feel.  I would give it one star, but mine also came with a smaller pink lip gloss that I quite like.  It does not plump my lips but is a good basic pink gloss.</li>
    <li> I did not work at all</li>
    <li> This lip plumber does work over time.  Need to apply it every night. The plumping is subtle, but it is effective.  It can dry your lips out.</li>
    <li> This lip plumper is different than my other ones.  They plump my lips but need to be added constantly on top of my lip stick or by themselves.  This lip plumper puts more colleges that is absorbed quickly and I put it on at bed time and morning!  I see a big difference. I have been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> been using for years and am completely satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;put it on before bed and it keeps my lips plump and youthful!&lt;br /&gt;one tube lasts me a whole year - so in that respect it is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;would not be without it.</li>
    <li> I love this lip plumper. It really works. One negative thing is that it is very sticky. Also you will have to keep applying this to have fully lips.</li>
    <li> As good as you can plumb, without resorting to injections!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48 and my lips have thinned.  This product took two or three weeks to really work but my lower lip especially is now much fuller.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this and it is OK but not a real image changer for her but she will keep trying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have permament lips so I put this over and I have great lips will buy more I over 40</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. It plumps my lips &amp; plumps up wrinkles above upper lip.</li>
    <li> Box came open. Looked as if someone had used it previously.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I was expecting a miracle.  I have thin lips and was looking for a little plumping action.  This product feels like it has plumped the lips, but looking in the mirror reflects the truth -- same thin lips.  Use your money on a nice lip balm and take a pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I like the minty taste and it&#x27;s not too sticky, but I don&#x27;t think it does much plumping. Certainly not worth $40.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in my lips. Very disappointed.  Perhaps this product does not work on everyone. I certainly didn&#x27;t for me.  Would like to see reviews from others who purchased it.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my lips feel. Plumping effect is good. Hydrating and effective. Just wish that it had a little more oomph to it.</li>
    <li> It works well for dry lips and stays for hours.  Although it also temporarily stings to create a fuller lip, for me, with thin lips, it still doesn&#x27;t work well.  Still I like the moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Like it, but had to return because I did find a 2X at an excellent price.  This is more like a sample, good for traveling, etc.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. I have been using it for years and I see that my lips have been really amplified with this product. I truly recommend it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This definitely plumps your lips. I use as overnight treatment and when u get up in morning it&#x27;s still on my lips. Does not wear off during the night. So If you get dry lips at night this is a great product. It tastes good too, sort of a minty fruity tast. It&#x27;s very thick and goopy but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d want in a lip plumper I&#x27;d think. I love it.</li>
    <li> I like this very much but it is very hard to think of it when you put it on your eyes.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all.  I could not see where it made any difference in the appearance of my lips.</li>
    <li> seems to plump and moisturize the lips nicely - I personally like the tingling feeling, but it is a little sticky.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my lips except give a bit of shine. Very expensive lip gloss.</li>
    <li> This one didn&#x27;t plump anything. It did deflate my wallet a little.</li>
    <li> I leave it on the stand by my bed so I don&#x27;t forget and use it every night. My lips feel fuller in the morning. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it helps.</li>
    <li> very expensive, not worth it</li>
    <li> I am very sceptical about lip plumping glosses, but this is the only excepting! I have small and thin lips and i love what this gloss does. Its not to say that your lips are getting bigger, but they look really full and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 month and will always use, untill they will create even better product. But now its the best!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I got a sample of it from Ulta and I was shocked to discover how well it performed as I&#x27;ve been disappointed by the promise of fuller lips from several products in several brands. This stuff is different. It actually delivers so well that I turned around and bought a full size FusionXL.</li>
    <li> I waited a month before evaluating the results for a review. I have definitely noticed a slight plumping.  It&#x27;s not a huge difference, but definitely noticeable to me since my lips are on the thin side. The gloss has a slight tingle but it&#x27;s not that burning &amp;#34;peppery&amp;#34; kind.  I&#x27;m not thrilled with the price of this so I will debate about whether buy it again after seeing how long the tub actually lasts.</li>
    <li> If you want fuller lips, this is a must try. Have been using this for a few years now. Love it!</li>
    <li> i have used it for years daily and as long as it is used daily my lips retain volume,it takes about 90 days to get it to stay at that maximun plumpness,but i do highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> did nothing for me that it claimed to do :(  very disappointed, would not recommend it to any friends, sorry I bought it</li>
    <li> Did not work at all! Was a big waste of money. Very disappointed and would not recommend this product. It does not do what it says.</li>
    <li> This the BEST lip plumper on the market. The key is the dehydrahated collagen that goes into the first 3 layers of the skin and re plumps drawing moisture into it and around it. It stays put for 48 hours, and you will notice a difference right away. It works best when applied overnight but it can be used anytime and as well as plumping it brings a beautiful natural glow to the lips due to increased circulation. I use it in combination with the regular LipFushion in a tint during the day. I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to do so. I saw it on the Today show.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula,but the older one showed much better results</li>
    <li> I have been using FusionBeauty&#x27;s Lip Plumping product for several years.  I only use this lip plumper at night, and in the morning, my lips are moisturized, soft &amp; plump.  I have tried a few others, but always come back to the LipFusion XL.  I have not been able to find this product at Ulta or Sephora latey, so decided to look on Amazon.com.  So glad I did!  Order came early....before predicted delivery date, and it cost less!!  Ordering process was so easy.....will order this product again from Amazon.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> great for overnight wear!  have used it for years...never disappointed...Give it a try!  Fulfills every promise that it makes to keep your lips full!</li>
    <li> So expensive, but its the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I thought the results were good.  Good not Great.</li>
    <li> I love it love it. My lips are so full and plump. I can&#x27;t stop looking at them. It works I feel so sexy.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping for some plumper lips after trying for 3 weeks -  all it does is tingle a bit, and is a sticky lip gloss.  Way too much money for what it&#x27;s says it will do and doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product will only make your lips glossy NOTHING else. I spend a lot of money and wish I could have it back. Bottom line I should have known better to believe that that a product like lip gloss could plump up lips.......</li>
    <li> I give it a three because it smells good and the tingling, stinging sensational it gives feels nice on your lips. However, I have noticed not one difference in the volume of my lips for the past month that I&#x27;ve been using it. My lips look the same as it was before using this product. Naturally my lips plump up in the.morning then goes down after I wake up so its definitely not caused by the product. From what I can see, it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
