    <li> Great drill bit...came fast and packaged well...but be careful with it...let my hand slip a few times with my drill and cut myself...not too bad though...for what it&#x27;s worth should I ever need another one I&#x27;ll be ordering from this company again...</li>
    <li> These bits are AWSOME!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product its a good bit what confuses me is I thought I would receive 3 bits and in turn only received one ,it say nail drill bits and shows a picture of 3 bits, so it is miss leading</li>
    <li> This bit does an excellent job with my acrylic nails.  It cuts the filing time down so much!  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this bit.</li>
    <li> I love it . Works very well but in the ad it showed three bits but on got one in the mail. But no worries I&#x27;m satisfied with it</li>
    <li> Needed a medium size and medium grit.  They aren&#x27;t easy to find in my neck of the woods.&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews of others, I would have expected 3 of them since the description didn&#x27;t say any different.  So, thank you for giving the rest of us a heads up.</li>
    <li> i am very happy with product as well as speedy delivery. it came very fast in the same week I ordered it way before. It works very good but be careful not to push or add pressures while using in motion it simply doesn&#x27;t need that just be light with it cause you could cut a person if your not careful. I would order again if needed.</li>
    <li> small small small&lt;br /&gt;same as before,small small small&lt;br /&gt;diy is ok but not what you wanna do on something big</li>
    <li> I use this to take of my gel top coat and it takes it right off. You do have to be careful because it can cut you if you are going by the cuticle area. It came pretty fast too.</li>
    <li> I am realy exited when arrived, good to see. Very elegant and durable, it does what supposed to do! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I feel that the product is to sharp, I perfer something less sharper and smaller. However I got to say I just started doing my own nails so I may just need to get more use to it.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and use this bit every time. Woud not want to be without it.</li>
    <li> this is no so bad better than the others that i have had at home great way to get smooth  nails</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome!  I would recommend this product to everyone that does nails!  This product lives up to all my expectations and the seller is quick on delivery.</li>
    <li> I did arrive on time but I would suggest a better way to picture the product, the picture gave my the opinion there would be 3 bits so when one arrived i was surprised , i had to go back a read the discription so other than that i am happy</li>
    <li> Only got one I thought there would be 3 but it was ok got it fast ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> This drill bit works great. It fits in my drill very tight. It is better than using sanding bands. It won&#x27;t tear nails like sanding bands do. It is very smooth on nails. It removes acrylic and gels very good. I will be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> Very nice, works amazing !</li>
    <li> I CAN NOT SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I HAVEN GOT THEM YET SO WHEN I GET THEM AND USE THEM THEN I WILL WRITE MY OPENION ABOUT THIS PRODUCT .</li>
    <li> Packed well, shipped quick and received timely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for sculpting the fresh gel nails.  Gently removes imperfections and saves the hand filing time.  Couple quick strokes with the fine or medium bit then a light sanding with 100 grit file and I’m ready to paint.&lt;br /&gt;The fine and the medium are very close in grit levels so I am going to order a course to have on hand for acrylics or if cutting out a smile line is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend</li>
    <li> I need to buy more!  Good quality and works great!  Definitely would purchase again in the near future to have on hand.</li>
