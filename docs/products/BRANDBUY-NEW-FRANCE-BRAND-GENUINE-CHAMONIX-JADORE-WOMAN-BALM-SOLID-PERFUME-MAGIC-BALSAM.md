      <li>Great for a quick touch up.</li>
      <li>the scent is very light.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Lasts for most of the day as well.</li>
      <li>but okay.</li>
      <li>its ok I guess for 10bux but wont be buying it again</li>
      <li>and this is the simplest way to make sure I have a scent with me at all times.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong either.</li>
      <li>Is this Chamonix balm a genuine J&#x27;adore product?</li>
      <li>What a surprise, the scent is true to Jadore and it is so easy to carry with me.  </li>

      <li>and I love the size for my purse and especially when I go on a trip and don&#x27;t want to bring a big bottle of perfume.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying this item, it is a little more liquid than other solid perfumes I ordered</li>
      <li>live n learn</li>
      <li>It is made with paraffin so it can get soft in the heat, but it hardens at room temperature without any problem.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what I was really expecting as far as scent wise at a maximum level, but this is very faintly scented.</li>
      <li>but it is decent enough for the price.</li>
      <li>Disappointed - the scent is nice but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this perfume, but hate the price of the original.</li>
