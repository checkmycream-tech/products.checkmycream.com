      <li>It is easy to clip in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had these sort of bangs before but this one looks so real, very pretty!</li>
      <li>The color matched my own hair really well.</li>
      <li>Another cheaply made item....</li>
      <li>I am really surprised the quality was so good.</li>
      <li>I love these bangs they look so real and really cute.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s very fun to take pictures in and to play around in.</li>
      <li>but very rarely...</li>
      <li>BUT THE HAIR IS SUPER CHEAP QUALITY AND DIDNT</li>
      <li>): such a shame because the bangs were perfect just not black.</li>
      <li>Changes my whole look!Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I recommend any one who&#x27;s looking for a little change in their hairstyles without actually having to cut their own hair, and it&#x27;s is so easy to put on!!!</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying from more from this seller!</li>
      <li>it came on time and worth the price.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fun and worth the money.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge problem, though, and can easily be fixed with a hat or headband.</li>
      <li>//;)...</li>
      <li>The hair itself was kind of too long but looked real.</li>
      <li>Such a great deal compared to the other options out there.</li>
      <li>its super soft and sturdy.</li>
      <li>i really like these bangs</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this bang on my</li>
      <li>Also, its really shiny.</li>
      <li>The bang looks almost close to real hair (almost)</li>
      <li>Feels just like real hair to me.</li>
      <li>Luckily for me I never planned on actually wearing these out, I just wanted to see if I should cut really bangs or not and these were cheap enough to do that with!</li>
      <li>only thing I would say is that if you look at the top of your head where the hair is clipped, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that it&#x27;s not real because the hair goes in a curved shape to fit with the mesh bottom part.</li>
      <li>I live it</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll soon get compliments about your new bangs.</li>
      <li>This was cheap so not worth returning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute but pretty long for people with small four heads</li>
      <li>It came a bit wavy and crooked in a tiny paper package, but I ran it through my straightener on low heat a couple times and it was fine.</li>
      <li>but mine was a total straight blunt cut.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this, especially for the fantastic price.</li>
      <li>MATCH MY NATURAL HAIR</li>
      <li>But by the looks of it, I know it will look so natural with my hair...</li>
      <li>I trimmed mine; it&#x27;s fairly long, and I wanted a shorter style, but too long is better than too short</li>
      <li>I was surprised at the quality of this.</li>
      <li>Its a good deal for the price who would like to try a fake bang as an experiment.</li>
      <li>and it gives me a nice look without having to cut my real hair, but they look kinda weird in certain lightings so be careful when your in yellow-ish lighting.</li>
      <li>Like other reviews say, it is kind of shiny, so I always use a shine booster on my hair when I wear it, and I&#x27;ve also tied a scarf for a retro look so my natural hair isn&#x27;t directly next to it, making the texture difference less noticeable.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t that shiny, and I didn&#x27;t need to treat it much other than straightening it quickly, but that was only because of the way it was packaged.</li>
      <li>I threw this hair piece in the back of my hair drawer where it will live.</li>
      <li>Had it for a few months now and it still looks fresh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little uneven and too shiny but its cute</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a little uneven and too shiny but its cute</li>
<li> Not too glossy,not too flat.</li>
<li> its very long and has to be clipped back almost halfway up my scalp.</li>
<li> I love my long hair and have ordered other fake bangs</li>
<li> way too long and too shiny.</li>
<li> I cut the sides as they were just too long and didn&#x27;t match the style I was wearing.</li>
<li> I thought I would get what I paid for and, since the price was a steal compared to other similar products, I thought it would be crappy.</li>
<li> The only slight difficulty was trying to figure out how to secure it and conceal the fact that it was fake bangs.</li>
<li> i will definitely get another down the road</li>
<li> Not exactly high quality and some of the hair was falling out.</li>
<li> i brushed a little baby powder through it to soften the shine.</li>
<li> It does not fit on your face in this same shape.</li>
<li> The hair itself is very thick with minimal shedding (there were a couple hairs, but that was it) and it looked extremely realistic.</li>
<li> There is no universal color guide listed, like everyone know 1 is jet black, 2 is off black and so on...</li>
<li> It smelled kinda weird when I first bought it</li>
<li> the hair is extra synthectic and will melt if u look at it to hard....</li>
<li> The bangs look really shiny and fake</li>
<li> I ordered black and got a dark brown.</li>
<li> If you have dark brown close to black hair this will blend well.</li>
<li> I have dark brown, almost black hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s cut really odd</li>
<li> It would have been wearable if it was black as listed and ordered.</li>
<li> BLACK</li>
<li> Cute but extremely fake looking in outdoors and fluorescent lighting, crazy shiny.</li>
<li> It was thin and it looks super fake !</li>
<li> No fitting for me at all.</li>
<li> i have dull hair.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re so wonky.</li>
<li> a thick headband to cover the clip on part</li>
<li> Thick and almost prestyled.</li>
<li> Sadly its really dark and doesn&#x27;t match my hair color</li>
<li> I brought it in black which looks so fake looking</li>
<li> Like, ridiculously shiny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does not fit on your face in this same shape. Very disappointed.  I love my long hair and have ordered other fake bangs, I loved the look and shape of this pic. Not at all like it shows.</li>
    <li> wrong color. Impossible to match with your hair. There is no universal color guide listed, like everyone know 1 is jet black, 2 is off black and so on...</li>
    <li> If you have dark brown close to black hair this will blend well. It is a bit shiny but when I straighten hair it is about that shiny too.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product, i would buy again</li>
    <li> took forever to get here, but for the price can&#x27;t beat it! I am really surprised the quality was so good. Its good to have to change your look up.</li>
    <li> way too long and too shiny. only can wear with a head band.</li>
    <li> The bangs look really shiny and fake it doesn&#x27;t blend with your hair. It looks like a Halloween costume wig.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; the word hate..so I gave this 2 stars instead of one! I dunno bout anybody else&#x27;s view on this..but I looked like Mo from the 3 Stooges! I thought it&#x27;d be more fringy/feathery at the ends but mine was a total straight blunt cut. No fitting for me at all.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality for the price you get</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the quality of this. I thought I would get what I paid for and, since the price was a steal compared to other similar products, I thought it would be crappy. But I wore it to work and no one knew it was a hairpiece. The color matched my own hair really well. I have dark brown, almost black hair. The only slight difficulty was trying to figure out how to secure it and conceal the fact that it was fake bangs. But it didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing plastic hair.</li>
    <li> Just because I had to rate this product is the only reason I did. This product is bad bad bad! Falls apart after an hour.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too shiny, so it automatically looks fake, but if you trim them, add some product and work with them (and consider hiding the clip on the top of your head...) you&#x27;ll soon get compliments about your new bangs. They&#x27;re fun and worth the money.</li>
    <li> i just got this in the mail this afternoon. its super soft and sturdy. its very long and has to be clipped back almost halfway up my scalp. i brushed a little baby powder through it to soften the shine. i have dull hair. i will definitely get another down the road</li>
    <li> It would have been wearable if it was black as listed and ordered. It was OBVIOUSLY brown and didn&#x27;t match me at all. Useless!</li>
    <li> the hair piece i recieved did NOT look anything like the picture...the hair is extra synthectic and will melt if u look at it to hard....PLEASE DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY.........I threw this hair piece in the back of my hair drawer where it will live.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised that so many people gave this a good review.  This looks so fake and too thick!</li>
    <li> The hairpiece looks just like the picture, but unfortunately the lack of quality can&#x27;t be seen in the picture.  The hair was very similar to a Halloween wig.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these sort of bangs before but this one looks so real, very pretty! And I got it before schedule so that&#x27;s a plus!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering from you guys again for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> The love bangs but this hairpiece did not work for me.  For some reason, I can not get the bang adjusted to my face and I believe the side bangs should be longer.</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong color ): such a shame because the bangs were perfect just not black. I&#x27;m scared to order again because I don&#x27;t want it to happen one more time.</li>
    <li> It looked like a blotched hair job....dont let the cute again girls example fool you!!</li>
    <li> Cute but extremely fake looking in outdoors and fluorescent lighting, crazy shiny. Luckily for me I never planned on actually wearing these out, I just wanted to see if I should cut really bangs or not and these were cheap enough to do that with!</li>
    <li> It smelled kinda weird when I first bought it but it faded away after time. The hair itself was kind of too long but looked real. Not exactly high quality and some of the hair was falling out.</li>
    <li> I like. I cut the sides as they were just too long and didn&#x27;t match the style I was wearing. overall........GOOD!</li>
    <li> Love it! Thick and almost prestyled.Feels just like real hair to me.Perfect color match.Not too glossy,not too flat. Changes my whole look!Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> ITS  NOT THE COLOR AND IT LOOKS FAKE AND I ORDER IT BLACK AND IT CAME BROWN WHAT HAPPEN?! POOOOOOR.</li>
    <li> The bang looks almost close to real hair (almost) But it only has 2 clip ons to stick to your hair and one does not work properly. Once Brushed.. the clip on hair or thread... keeps falling off.. Its a good deal for the price who would like to try a fake bang as an experiment. I will try it.. but very rarely...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so wonky. It&#x27;s cut really odd and there&#x27;s no way to fix it. Also, its really shiny. Like, ridiculously shiny. Baby powder won&#x27;t fix this amount of shine.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t put this piece in yet.... But by the looks of it, I know it will look so natural with my hair... I&#x27;m a bangs person...//;)...</li>
    <li> The item was delivered in the estimated time, no hassle.&lt;br /&gt;But does not blend in with your hair, it is perfect for a doll, and it is just shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Threw it in the garbage. Wouldn&#x27;t was my time to return it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but pretty long for people with small four heads I use it as a side bang and it&#x27;s cute</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little uneven and too shiny but its cute once you fits it up. it came on time and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered black and got a dark brown. This was cheap so not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Such a disappointment the hair look so fake</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t. Makes these look good on me.</li>
    <li> Another cheaply made item.... Why do I bother.</li>
    <li> i really like these bangs and it gives me a nice look without having to cut my real hair, but they look kinda weird in certain lightings so be careful when your in yellow-ish lighting.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Such a great deal compared to the other options out there. I trimmed mine; it&#x27;s fairly long, and I wanted a shorter style, but too long is better than too short, right? It also shipped faster than was estimated. Like other reviews say, it is kind of shiny, so I always use a shine booster on my hair when I wear it, and I&#x27;ve also tied a scarf for a retro look so my natural hair isn&#x27;t directly next to it, making the texture difference less noticeable. I will definitely be buying from more from this seller!</li>
    <li> Came fast two weeks after ordering fits good love it . I had to wash it like four times cause the smell.. but for $2 can bet it ...</li>
    <li> Omg super cute! Had it for a few months now and it still looks fresh</li>
    <li> I recently received this hair piece. I brought it in black which looks so fake looking and it&#x27;s way darker than my black-brown hair . I think it&#x27;s very fun to take pictures in and to play around in. This hair piece is not a replacement to bangs.</li>
    <li> I live it the bang worked out will for me it was just what I needed and wanted it looks goods on me</li>
    <li> I love these bangs they look so real and really cute. I recommend any one who&#x27;s looking for a little change in their hairstyles without actually having to cut their own hair, and it&#x27;s is so easy to put on!!! I was impressed!!!!</li>
    <li> It is easy to clip in. Sadly its really dark and doesn&#x27;t match my hair color but i can still wear it with beanies and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I received this much earlier than the estimated date, which made me SUPER happy! It came a bit wavy and crooked in a tiny paper package, but I ran it through my straightener on low heat a couple times and it was fine. The hair itself is very thick with minimal shedding (there were a couple hairs, but that was it) and it looked extremely realistic. It wasn&#x27;t that shiny, and I didn&#x27;t need to treat it much other than straightening it quickly, but that was only because of the way it was packaged. I showed my dad and he thought I actually did cut my hair until I took it off!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would say is that if you look at the top of your head where the hair is clipped, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that it&#x27;s not real because the hair goes in a curved shape to fit with the mesh bottom part. Also, if you have thinner/silkier hair, this will definitely slide out. I have thicker Asian hair, so it was alright for me. This isn&#x27;t a huge problem, though, and can easily be fixed with a hat or headband. Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this, especially for the fantastic price.</li>
    <li> ITS CUTE BUT THE HAIR IS SUPER CHEAP QUALITY AND DIDNT MATCH MY NATURAL HAIR</li>
    <li> I love it  I wear it with my clip on ponytail and UT a thick headband to cover the clip on part and I get compliments on it all day!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this bang on my that&#x27;s just my opinion ! It was thin and it looks super fake ! It&#x27;s too shinny</li>
