<li> Since they are shipped from China delivery date is so long.  </li>

    <li> I ordered these for my friend&#x27;s wedding and everyone of them arrived broken. I basically got an envelope full of beads.</li>
    <li> This is way to big for any person to wear. I ordered small and got one so big a person with a size 12 could wear it.</li>
    <li> Order 2!  They are sold (each).  That means 1!  I had to order another 1.  So I can have a pair.  They look so cute with sandals!  I didn&#x27;t read the fine print.  Since they are shipped from China delivery date is so long.  Hope I can rock these babies for the 4th.  If not.  Maybe I will just wear the one (1) I have.</li>
    <li> Yes, this Tonsee Pearl Barefoot Sandle is just as pretty as it looked on Amazon. My disappointment came when I didn&#x27;t receive two for both feet. However my mistake. I should have read it better. The price is inexpensive. And as I say very pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought a pair for both my sister and myself and we absolutely love them. Adds a spark to a plain pair of sandals.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this item.  I am nearly 70 and I put this on my toe and I felt like I was 16 again.  It is beautiful.  I am going to order again this time for me,my daughter and granddaughter.  They both fell in love with this.</li>
    <li> Really love this anklet &amp; I&#x27;m getting nothing but rave reviews for this piece</li>
    <li> Exactly as the picture shows and the fit was excellent.</li>
    <li> They are great just wished I would&#x27;ve got them in time for the wedding</li>
    <li> I assumed that these &amp;#34;sandals&amp;#34; came in pairs of 2, however they are singles. Thats ok, I suppose, considering the price. Maybe I overlooked that part in description or maybe it should be stated more clearly?</li>
    <li> very cute and dainty. I love it. I cannot wait to wear it on the beach.</li>
    <li> Very nice; as pictured. Good to wear to a beach wedding.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality and looked (and was) cheap. I LITERALLY put it on, set my foot down off the bed I was sitting on, and it broke. Purchased this one here and and one from Darice (VL1901M Pearl Bead) at the same time. I HIGHLY recommend the one from Darice as a better alternative. The Darice one has a clasp that allows you to adjust the size, comes in different sizes (not one sze fits all), and it is durable. Already bought another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, but it did not come with the toe ring</li>
