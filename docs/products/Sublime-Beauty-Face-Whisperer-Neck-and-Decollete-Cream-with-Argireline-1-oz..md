      <li>just light fresh smelling.  </li>
      <li>I do love the lavendar smell and feeling of the lotion, very soothing.</li>

      <li>Thanks sublime!</li>

      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth</li>

      <li>Also, the consistency of this cream is thicker than many other creams I&#x27;ve used, and it definitely feels like it stays in place and has great effectiveness in rejuvenating my neck skin making it look and feel younger.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a young bird any more</li>
      <li>It is a very high quality cream...</li>
      <li>OMG, my neck can really tell on me.</li>

      <li>Had high hopes, but looks like I&#x27;m stuck with it!</li>
      <li>Been using the Face Whisperer Neck &amp; Décolleté Cream now for two straight weeks, twice a day.</li>

      <li>My skin has gotten so much softer and the lines around my eyes are lessening.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>Even though it is thicker it doesn&#x27;t give a heavy on the skin feeling either which is nice.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see this product specifically for neck and décolleté, because I recently became aware that as I&#x27;m getting older, this area of my body is looking MUCH older.</li>
      <li>I really like this neck cream a lot, particularly with the ingredients in it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am not fan with the smell and my face feels sticky afterwards but amazing I really saw a difference in my face after using it for a whole week. So I thought the positive out weighs the negative</li>
    <li> Delivery on time. I&#x27;m 35 years old, I have some lines problem of my neck after 2 kids. So I try this cream for 2 weeks after take shower. Recently I found my skin is smoother, and the lines on the neck became lighter. I&#x27;ll keep use and hope it can doing well like this.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle, and I may be starting to see a difference in the texture of my neck skin, I am going to try one more bottle and then make a decision if worth the price to continue. I do love the lavendar smell and feeling of the lotion, very soothing.</li>
    <li> I am 44 years old and have always neglected my neck &amp; decollete area.  That is why I wanted to test this product and give my honest opinion.  I guess I just don&#x27;t give much thought to that area.  I&#x27;ve used a few things in the past but only a few times and then I forget about it.  This time I am committed.  Argireline (known as the natural Botox) is one of the key ingredients in the product and it reduces wrinkles and smooths skin.  It also has peptides that boost collagen production.  In addition to that aloe, lemongrass oil and arnica moisturize and heal your skin.  I put this on morning and at night and it makes my skin feel wonderful.  I look forward to the results after continued use because I&#x27;m committed this time.  I am keeping this out on my counter with the rest of my skincare stuff so I won&#x27;t forget.  I am no longer going to neglect this area!  :)</li>
    <li> In the short time I&#x27;ve used this I can feel a difference in my skin. It has really help the appearance as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using my new Face Whisperer Cream for a few weeks now and I love it!  I love that it does not have a really strong scent...just light fresh smelling.  It goes on smoothly and easily, without being too runny.  A little goes a long way, so I know this bottle will last me a while.  My skin has gotten so much softer and the lines around my eyes are lessening.  I will definitely be continuing to use this!</li>
    <li> Can not wait to start using this product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> If you need a good cream for your neck area then this is one to definitely check out. It&#x27;s thicker than a lot of moisturizers I have tried but not overly thick. It feels great on and is perfect for using in the morning or at night. I think because if it is thicker it perfect for overnight moisture so it has more time to soak in. The cream doesn&#x27;t have any strong perfume odors. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or oily on the skin. Even though it is thicker it doesn&#x27;t give a heavy on the skin feeling either which is nice. I gave this cream to my mother after using it a few times because she can benefit from it more than me. My mother says that after only a few uses she already feels like her neck and decollete look better and firmer. Overall this is a very nice cream that&#x27;ll make your skin super soft and smooth as well firm the neck area over time. I did receive a promotional product although my thoughts and opinions are always completely my own and unbiased.</li>
    <li> this product has a creamy lightweight feel. nice lemony scent. instantly baby soft neck &amp; chest. i have tried alot of products on my neck and this one is the best by far!!</li>
    <li> Noticeable results!  Will buy again. Thanks sublime!</li>
    <li> I want to first say that I am 49 years old, normal/dry and sensitive skin.  I have now used the following products by Sublime Beauty for a little over a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Serum&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic serum&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Face Whisperer® Neck &amp; Decollete&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Serum&lt;br /&gt; Face Whisperer® Day Cream with Argireline&lt;br /&gt; Face Whisperer® Night Cream with Matrixyl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that the results have been nothing short of wonderful.  My skin is smoother and laugh lines less defined.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t take away lines and wrinkles completely, but my wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable.  Another biggie for me is that my neck looks younger.  I have tried many lines and this is the first one that I have been pleased with every product.</li>
    <li> I love the products from here so when I saw this, I had to try it. The neck and decollete cream has got to the best anti-aging cream I have tried as a preventative anti-aging cream for that area. It contains Argireline (which is also a natural Botox) which reduces wrinkles and smooths lines. I read that even Dr. Oz says Argireline is an alternative to injections!! There are also many beneficial peptides which boost the collagen level. With daily, continued usage, you will see results inside a few days. At least I started seeing some results inside 5 days. My wrinkles were not so prominent and the little bit of loose skin I had started to become more firm. This particular cream uses a patented combination of products (such as MSM, which is naturally occurring in the body as of there secret ingredients) to help minimize the signs of aging. After you purchase this cream, you will receive an email that includes a 7 page report on the ingredients and its benefits with research included as proof that there product works. Of course I read it but did not really need to. As stated above, inside just a few days I was SEEING the PROOF for myself!! As an additional incentive to purchase this, they are so confident (as I now am!!) that their cream works, they offer a 100% money back guarantee if by some small iota of a chance you are not happy with it (which I HIGHLY DOUBT you would be unsatisfied). Cannot wait to see my results after a month or two of using this!! (I was provided a sample of this product through a promotion in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  The information provided is solely my opinion and based on my personal experience.)</li>
    <li> I broke out all over my chest from this product.  way too greasy!!</li>
    <li> Love this product &amp; line! It is a very high quality cream...</li>
    <li> Used it for over a month with almost no results. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product! I have being use this product for 5weeks! I am not sure if I like! Did not do anything for me at this moment!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I was immediately impressed by the results after starting to use this product. The natural oils it contains are truly wonderful. I love how my face and neck feel now.</li>
    <li> I really like Sublime Beauty&#x27;s products. They always came in a pretty bag. The content in each product is so nice. This one is no exception. I don&#x27;t have many lines or wrinkle, but my neck, OMG, my neck can really tell on me. This neck cream is really nice. It is not watery nor too thick. IT is easy to apply on and absorb pretty well and quick. I have been using this for 1 week now, I do feel my neck lines are diminished quite a bit. I got it at a discount for a review. I like this cream, it feels good to apply and nice light scent that comes with. I like Sublime Beauty&#x27;s product lines.</li>
    <li> Love how this feels on my neck...very smooth and non greasy..good buy</li>
    <li> Lines on your neck area really age you and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to reduce the wrinkles on my neck with no to little success.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, however.  It&#x27;s a little pricy for me but I will be ordering it again...  It has been worth every penny for me.  It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of offensive odor.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I guess either I didn&#x27;t need it or it didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s kind of tacky, the bottle is small. It just seems like a waste to me</li>
    <li> I used to use face cream/lotion on my neck.  I thought I&#x27;ve been taking good care of my neck until I tried Face Whisperer Neck &amp; Decollete Cream.  It is rich and yet not greasy at all.  Using this cream, I feel my neck smoother.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to apply face cream/lotion on the neck again.</li>
    <li> I really like this neck cream a lot, particularly with the ingredients in it.  I&#x27;m not a young bird any more so I need something that works. Also, the consistency of this cream is thicker than many other creams I&#x27;ve used, and it definitely feels like it stays in place and has great effectiveness in rejuvenating my neck skin making it look and feel younger.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this cream. I am 36 years old and beginning to see signs of aging on my face, neck and décolleté. In particular I have two lines across my neck...This cream has a nice thick, non greasy texture allowing the cream to stay in place. The lines on my neck are barely noticeable and the skin on my neck and décolleté seems firmer and more youthful. I will definitely continue to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sublime Beauty!</li>
    <li> Sublime&#x27;s neck cream has made a BIG difference in the skin on my neck and decollete. At 63, I was noticing all the crepey skin that was starting to develop on my neck and decollete area. I use it twice a day now and have for months. Guess what&#x27;s gone!!! My neck area looks great!!! Give it a try but be patient and make sure you are using a wash that removes all of the dead skin before you apply the neck cream.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! Skin elasticity on my neck is much improved!</li>
    <li> Been using the Face Whisperer Neck &amp; Décolleté Cream now for two straight weeks, twice a day. I just see a slight improvement in my neckline area. The first time I pumped the pump it broke. This is now the second time this has happen to me when using a Sublime product. So each time I use I have to take the top off and I use a Q-tip to get the product out. The opening is small. As far as how long it takes to see an improvement,  I will let you know in another two weeks.</li>
    <li> Overall this product is ok.  I don&#x27;t really have problem skin on my neck at this point, so I can&#x27;t say if it works, but it smelled nice and felt nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> I used Neocell serum for years before they changed the formula. I didn&#x27;t like their new one, so thought I would experiment with some other serums. Tried this one, but it was just OK, and not a good foundation for make-up.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, but did nothing for my neck yet.  Been using it for a couple of weeks at least.  I think my neck is too far gone.  I&#x27;ve had the neck of an 80 year old (and some 80 year olds have better necks!) at age 45.  Had high hopes, but looks like I&#x27;m stuck with it!</li>
    <li> A great neck cream. It smells wonderful.  It seems to be helping out the small lines on my neck. My skin feels so soft and fresh. Its a must try for any woman. I really think its an AAAA+++ product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blend of anti-aging ingredients to bring your neck a youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;- Argireline®, known as the natural Botox, is a key ingredient to reduce wrinkles and smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;- Beneficial Peptides that Boost Collagen Production is also key&lt;br /&gt;- Manufactured in a High Quality FDA Certified Lab&lt;br /&gt;- Arnica, Aloe and Lemongrass Oil All Moisturize and Heal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I spent WAY too much time in high school and college tanning year round. While I did you SPF on my face, I did not think about my chest and neck area so much. I didn&#x27;t realize how delicate that skin is there and how much it can prematurely age. Luckily I was given the opportunity to try Sublime Beaut&#x27;s Face Whisperer Neck &amp; Decollete Cream with Argireline in exchange for my honest review. I&#x27;ve been using this product morning and night for 10 days now and am very impressed with the results already. Just take a look at my two pictures. To me, this product has a faint lemony minty smell that goes away after just a minute or two. This thick creamy lotion really hydrates and plumps up the skin. Makes it look healthy too.  The fine lines on my chest have greatly diminished and the thick, wide line around my neck is is half of what it was. I will keep using this product to see further improvement and have lasting results.</li>
    <li> Love this product. At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure if the product was doing anything, after just the 2nd day I felt the moisturizer working and my neck felt smooth.  Need to use, it longer too see any difference in.wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with my neck not showing much age but my décolletage is another story! I love the Sublime Beauty Neck &amp; Decolletage cream is divine. Silky smooth going on and very moisturizing. I will continue to use many of the products from this line and hope to see continued results!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin feels soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I like the cream, it&#x27;s not watery, the smell is not bad either, goes on and my skin drinks it in right away</li>
    <li> The Pump doesn&#x27;t Work! I opened the container and used it like that! seems to be working though!</li>
    <li> pump doesn&#x27;t work. no tube into lotion so I have to use a stick to scoop out to apply  not impressed</li>
    <li> This goes on well and I feel like it is making a difference</li>
    <li> this makes my face feel so moisturized!</li>
    <li> This product has a silky feel with a wonderful scent.  I love the way my skin feels when I use it and you can see the fine lines fade with use. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  My new favorite face cream!</li>
    <li> I have been using face whisperer for neck and decollet for a frw weeks. I like the way it goes on.  It&#x27;s not greasy or drying it&#x27;s just right. I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve noticed a little tightening in my neck, This product hydrate&#x27;s the area and has a great blend of high quality ingredients. I enjoy using these products from Sublime, my fine lines are lessening, my skin is more hydrated and radiant. Again, I highly recommend these products, they really work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this cream. I was excited to see this product specifically for neck and décolleté, because I recently became aware that as I&#x27;m getting older, this area of my body is looking MUCH older. It has a light and delicious scent, and goes on incredibly smooth. You get a slight tightening sensation, but not too tight. I usually rub my neck and chest area, then do a quick swipe near the outer corners of my eyes, and rub in any leftover product into the backsides of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this cream, and I&#x27;m excited to try some of Sublime beauty&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> Another Sublime Beauty cream. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell of this one. Since I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll continue to use this. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had it long enough to know if it is making a difference.</li>
