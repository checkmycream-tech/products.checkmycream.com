      <li>- I&#x27;m still very happy with them!</li>
      <li>I think these are a great buy!</li>
      <li>Not all that great</li>
      <li>Good and quality product.</li>
      <li>If you are a newbie technician this would be a good brush to start.</li>
      <li>Good for starters and good manageability.</li>
      <li>one of the best pieces i have bought and loved so much.</li>
      <li>They work amazing at doing acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>It just kind of absorbs is and turns into a puffy blob.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended me this ones she said she liked them</li>
      <li>and I liked the option of having a matching set</li>
      <li>And very economic product and qualitie very good, easy to store.</li>
      <li>Discouraged at first cause it fell apart but happy in the end because the bristles are still intacked and work well.</li>
      <li>so I ordered these to have more.</li>
      <li>but I was still able to perform my nail art with them which makes it ok.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I love that you can cover the brushes up when you finish using them</li>
      <li>Love these ...</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fine just that they don&#x27;t weiqh nothinq at all</li>
      <li>They are smooth and easy to use too.</li>
      <li>I like how the shipping was quick tho!</li>
      <li>Top piece of one of the brushes broke off the first day again, save your money!</li>
      <li>then they didn&#x27;t even fit in there caps.</li>
      <li>The brushes were pretty ok.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend these to family and friends who do their own acrylic nails, I should probably mention that when you clean them make sure you don&#x27;t get the liquid inside of the metal</li>
      <li>Specially for 3d designs.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>What caught my eye on this when I got it was, they were pretty and saw the end could be put as a cover over the brush.</li>
      <li>While trying to take off the end - the brush came detached from the pretty decorated plastic part..</li>
      <li>They look exactly like the picture</li>
      <li>It soaks up the monomer well, but doesn&#x27;t really release it.  </li>
      <li>Who every makes these brushes really need change the type of glue they use to hold it together.</li>
      <li>They are NOT sable and they are very flimsy.</li>
      <li>I love that the brushes come in little containers.</li>
      <li>I fixed it by super glueing it back together.  </li>
      <li>Nice little brush, if used properly</li>
      <li>so now i got to go buy some new ones for work.</li>
      <li>very practical n totally meet my expectations, will order again.</li>

    <li> they came broken an i couldn&#x27;t send them back because i needed them for work an then they didn&#x27;t even fit in there caps. so now i got to go buy some new ones for work. an the hairs were frayed and etc.! was not a happy person when i got them.</li>
    <li> What caught my eye on this when I got it was, they were pretty and saw the end could be put as a cover over the brush. While trying to take off the end - the brush came detached from the pretty decorated plastic part.. I fixed it by super glueing it back together.  Who every makes these brushes really need change the type of glue they use to hold it together. I did use it and didn&#x27;t give me no problem.  Discouraged at first cause it fell apart but happy in the end because the bristles are still intacked and work well.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fine just that they don&#x27;t weiqh nothinq at all they&#x27;re so liqht!!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended me this ones she said she liked them but when I bought mines they weren&#x27;t what I expected! The upper part keeps falling apart!</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with these brushes. All three fell apart after only one or two wipes onto a paprr towel after using acrylic. I had another just like it tthat I love so I ordered these to have more. I woukd gi e a zero rating if possible.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for a co-worker and now my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get one for myself!</li>
    <li> Overall good quality product. Good for starters and good manageability. Specially for 3d designs. If you are a newbie technician this would be a good brush to start.</li>
    <li> As a nail tech I do not recommend this brush.  It soaks up the monomer well, but doesn&#x27;t really release it.  It just kind of absorbs is and turns into a puffy blob.</li>
    <li> Nice little brush, if used properly</li>
    <li> Never buying new brushes again !!! Love these ...</li>
    <li> I was really excited to give these brushes a try as they were very pretty and I liked the option of having a matching set but these are horrible. They are NOT sable and they are very flimsy. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Good and quality product. I use them in a dental technician. For imposing ceramics and priming.  I recommend to all.</li>
    <li> The brushes were pretty ok. Not all that great but I was still able to perform my nail art with them which makes it ok. I like how the shipping was quick tho! A+++ on that! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small they were. Couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> would give it a five but one of the brushes keeps coming apart where the two pieces meet. i have to use it as half the length or i will tape it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooo soft and work amazing. They look exactly like the picture and they also come with caps so you can put them away when you are done using. I just love them they also got here so fast. Will definetely order again when i need them again.</li>
    <li> I finally received these brushes, and despite the fact that I received brush sizes 10, 8 and 4 instead of 2, 6 and 8 - I&#x27;m still very happy with them!</li>
    <li> I love that the brushes come in little containers. Also, the three different sizes are perfect for different nail sizes. They are smooth and easy to use too.</li>
    <li> This brush is the worst brush I have ever bought the first application was OK, but then the acrylic sticks to the brush I made such a mess I was doing a clients nail I was so embarrassed even when I soaked it in the brush cleaner liquid I could not get it cleaned</li>
    <li> They work amazing at doing acrylic nails. I would definitely recommend these to family and friends who do their own acrylic nails, I should probably mention that when you clean them make sure you don&#x27;t get the liquid inside of the metal i did this on accident with one of my brushes and it seperated the glue inside and the bristle part came off however that was my fault and not a defect in the brush itself but that will happen with any brush.</li>
    <li> As Expected! Thank  you!</li>
    <li> these brushes were all broke when i got them. ill never buythese again. waste of mony. i do not recomend these brushes.</li>
    <li> one of the best pieces i have bought and loved so much.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing, The brushes fell apart into three pieces with the purple section free from the handle and the brush end. I tried gluing them together but they just fell apart again. I ended up buying some others.</li>
    <li> I think these are a great buy! I love that you can cover the brushes up when you finish using them</li>
    <li> very practical n totally meet my expectations, will order again. And very economic product and qualitie very good, easy to store.</li>
    <li> Brushes were no good a disaster save your money! poor quality! Top piece of one of the brushes broke off the first day again, save your money!</li>
