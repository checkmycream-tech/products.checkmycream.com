    <li> Perfect size, perfect price!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, thank you.</li>
    <li> we put these all over the house as they take up very little space, also very easy to carry into restaurants, especially buffets where none of the other diners are washing their hands before handling the tongs or condiment bottles/shakers. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought these so that I could keep one in each purse/bag for when I go out with my baby.</li>
    <li> Purchased in Jan 2015 and received product with a Sept 2017 expiration. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Convenient travel size.</li>
    <li> I wanted small packets of hand sanitizer - one for my handbag, one each for my bedrooms, one for my diaper bag. This pack of 12 served it purpose and Purell is a decent brand I&#x27;d use.</li>
    <li> Gone are the years when I&#x27;d eat food in the subway.  Now I like to keep some purell around to clean my hands, or else they feel incredibly dirty and germy from grabbing the handholds on public transportation.</li>
    <li> perfect to carry in your purse or in the car</li>
    <li> These handy 2 oz. containers are easy &amp; light to carry in my purse or to stash around the house.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Would recommend seller to future buyers.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go without Purell....quality item.</li>
    <li> The shipping took too long. I was planning on using this for a trip. My trip didn&#x27;t work out in the end, but if I actually went, these would not have arrived in time.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like.  Smells good, dries fast and, I assume, disinfects.  Very pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands. This pack of 12 let&#x27;s me place them in my car, at work and around the house with a few to spare. I will be buying more when this batch is gone.</li>
    <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Was diagnosed with COPD some time ago. Have become a little germophobic. I keep the larger pump bottles by my bath and kitchen sinks, but this size is perfect for slipping into pocket or purse. Can keep in the car, on the nightstand or where ever. The 12-pack is perfect, good price, and the bottles can be refilled.</li>
    <li> Good product, and small size fits nicely in your emergency bag. One for you glove box, and others as needed. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for pockets and purses. Always good to have readily available. This does not replace washing the hands, but it&#x27;s great for when YOU CAN&#x27;T do so. I&#x27;ve used this product since it first came out.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re always sanitizing your hands, why buy &#x27;em one at a time? At this prince it comes out to less than a dollar per. It&#x27;s easy to take with you, doesn&#x27;t have fancy smells or anything. It&#x27;s a no frills hand sanitizer that can be bought in bulk</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for...</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
