<li> The same thing happened with the other set of 10 I got from them.</li>

<li> I received a few different types than what was listed, but maybe Toktok was out of stock on some?</li>
<li> I use it twice and my dark circles begin to fade.</li>
<li> The mask is too thick.</li>
<li> I recommend during summer putting the sheet mask in the fridge few minutes before using and then using it cold.</li>
<li> (If I find a particular variety smells terrible, I will edit my review to mention it.)</li>
<li> The smell is awful.</li>

    <li> Amazing can&#x27;t wait to get it again.</li>
    <li> I really like the way these masks fit my face. I&#x27;ve tried other types before, but these ones conform better, and the moisturizing treatment, though it feels a little &#x27;slimy&#x27;, does an excellent job moisturizing my face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful value and quality results. My skin feels supple and refreshed afterwards. I recommend them all.</li>
    <li> Love these masks! Good variety, and very well priced!</li>
    <li> Good product and good services,I bought 3 combos for my self and 3 more for my sister.We really like it.I will buy more from A-poly again after I use all of the them.</li>
    <li> Packaging can be opened easily. Sheet mask is easy to use and fits face well. Nicely moisturized, doesn&#x27;t drip. Skin is after moisturized. I recommend during summer putting the sheet mask in the fridge few minutes before using and then using it cold. Cools skin and helps relax.</li>
    <li> I really like these products because they really work. I use it once and mg face immediately brightens. I use it twice and my dark circles begin to fade. A third time and my face is bright, clear, and hydrated!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I have a favorite, they&#x27;re all very nice. Great for a sister&#x27;s get-together, pre-party, or girl&#x27;s night in with a movie &amp; smoothies, or a movie and cocktails. A pleasure</li>

Be aware that this might happen with no notice from this seller, in case you have your heart set on a particular assortment. However, I feel all of these masks are high quality and I am happy with what I received. So far, out of the ones I&#x27;ve used, none have had a strong smell. In fact, I am very sensitive to smell and to many products in general, but I have been fine using these! I even bought a silicone mask to put over these to allow me to wear them longer and not have them fall off as I go about my daily activities and it works great. (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GN2BYY0) I have been using the EGF mask after derma needling and it really soothes my skin, especially as I keep them in the fridge before use. (If I find a particular variety smells terrible, I will edit my review to mention it.) I also find that using the silicone mask over these allows me to use my ice roller over top and this further soothes my skin after needling as well as stop the creepy crawly feeling I tend to get from having a mask on my crazy sensitive skin after a while (I feel that way with anything on my skin, so it&#x27;s not due to the mask itself.)</li>
    <li> Always take a long time to receive it, but these are works fine and price is good. We Can do more business with.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying  these. I love  the verity. They smell good and leave  my skin feeling  great.  Can&#x27;t  wait to get some more.</li>
    <li> before I ordered this combo #3, I tried combo #2 and No disappoint on this product.&lt;br /&gt;You can have fun with trying different masks and delivery took just 2wks (way before the estimated arrival date)</li>
    <li> Love these masks and arrived just as expected!</li>
    <li> Love it, my skin feels amazing after the treament, even with my sensitiv skin I have no issues at all...</li>
    <li> I got the Essence Face Masks for a girls weekend and it was perfect. Everybody got to pamper themselves and just relax. They leave your skin feeling refreshed and soft. And the variety pack meant there was something for everyone. Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> The mask is too thick. The smell is awful. It feels like oil on the face after using it. The price can tell.</li>
    <li> I love spas and skincare products.  I use these masks twice to 3x a week.  This is the same ones you see at some spas and they sell this for $5.00 for one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you are getting more for your money.  I did not see any significant improvement but every time I&#x27;ve used these mask sheets, my skin did feel softer and felt refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a facial scrub then use this mask.  It&#x27;s great before a night out.</li>
    <li> Love these masks which I put on after my evening shower while I watch TV before heading to bed. An inexpensive way to prepare for the following day by allowing my skin to replenish itself through my sleep hours and emerge the next day with radiant skin. These comes from South Korea and they are really a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Olga</li>
    <li> I much like. This much well for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Skin becomes very soft and smooth. Possible recommend my girlfriend.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. Its very moisturizing and each pack has a lot of the serum which is great and you can literally use some cotton balls to apply the left over serum in your neck and arms if you prefer. I did not have any reactions to it and even though my skin is oily, it still moisturized it without creating more oils. But these masks are not gonna change your skin type unless I guess you use them regularly? Even then, its best just to keep your skin soft, smooth and fluffy! I do recommend them as they are a little less expensive and a great alternate to other sheet mask brands.</li>
    <li> Very creative masks that relaxes your skin..smooth it..and makes you look refreshed..i am still using them..its exciting using a different kind daily..this will not be the last time to purchase this product..thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this a coupe of times already. It makes your face vibrant. I love that the package has different combinations.</li>
    <li> Love these masks. They&#x27;re so wonderful and make your skin feel refreshed, firm, and elastic. For more reviews on this and others visit foodandink.wordpress.com</li>
    <li> Good quality for price, but not as wet initially as some other brands I have tried. Still a great product though!</li>
    <li> Delivery: Fast Shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Price: $$ cheap&lt;br /&gt;Quality: They are all very good. I have sensitive skin and so far I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to them. They are best to keep in the fridge.</li>
