      <li>not THAT sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I struggled with combination peeling/dryness with oil for years before finally coming upon this particular formula.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It does the job, but I have quite a few (less expensive) drugstore moisturizers that I enjoy a bit more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using MK products for over 30 years.  I love the Formula 2 Balancing Moisturizer.  I was happy to find this online and shop from the comfort of my  home.</li>
    <li> This product is great - I have used it for over 20 years! I have compared it to others on the market [for as much as twice the price] and still prefer Mary Kay&#x27;s Balanced Moisturizer II. Though not in their current line, you can still have your rep to order it for you.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time,Mary Kay is been on my face for many years and hope to use it for many more</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and the price is wonderful,too.  Would recommend this to my friends and co-workers as well if they want to feel dewy soft skin.</li>
    <li> I am normally a huge fan and user of MK products but for some reason, the moisturizers and skin cream have an ingredient in it that makes my skin burn and sting horribly.  I do have sensitive skin but not THAT sensitive.  I used this once and then disposed of it.</li>
    <li> I struggled with combination peeling/dryness with oil for years before finally coming upon this particular formula.&lt;br /&gt;This formula is light and absorbs quickly into my skin, which is extremely important because I put it on before I apply makeup and powder.&lt;br /&gt;It also rids my skin of annoying dryness with daily, minimal application, and keeps it that way for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle will last me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;It has never caused me a break-out or left me with clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this from my local Mary Kay representative, but it was discontinued and the lotion has never been the same. I am so glad I found it online.&lt;br /&gt;The boyfriend loves it and uses it all the time, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, thank you thank you.</li>
    <li> use mostly now during the fall and winter months because it most my skin from getting dry during these months</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer with no greasy residue. I use it daily!  It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Great for your hands too!</li>

    <li> Great Product, I Just Wish Mary Kay Still Carried It InTheir Line. Hate It When They Discontinue Or Try To Replace Things That Really Work!</li>
    <li> Have also used for years and years. But understand they are taking out of the line!!!! I hope Amazon will have it for a while as I bought it out from my Mary Kay Rep.</li>
    <li> This item came with the box rather smashed.  I have used this product over many years, and have never seen it in such a very liquid form.  I&#x27;m supposing that it sat on the shelf somewhere, or even that it was &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but I have quite a few (less expensive) drugstore moisturizers that I enjoy a bit more.</li>
    <li> Glad that this person had this on hand.  my mom uses this all the time.  She does not like the new formula.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has the perfect texture for the skin throughout the year. Not too greasy for summer and not too thin for winter use. However, I stopped using it because of some questionable ingredients. BTW, I live in Baltimore where the water is very hard and drying.</li>
    <li> Disliked--The moisturer was old and rancid. It took our breath away with the foul odor. Have used this product in the past for many years and really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;  I was concerned because it was going to be a Christmas gift for my then pregnant daughter, so didn&#x27;t open bottles until our family Christmas get together.&lt;br /&gt;  How do I return the bottles I ordered? Please help.</li>
    <li> the product was expired and was water when I received it... I threw it out since I was so disgusted..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teresa</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it has been discontinued, now it is too expensive to get more.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for dry skin but does  leave your skin oily.....&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for years under my daily makeup...&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use it daily</li>
    <li> I have always used Mary Kay products and now that I can order them on line, even better.  My dealer always tried talking me into having a party and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of explaining that I don&#x27;t go to, nor do I give parties any more.  Way easier not to deal with it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft. would recommend for anyone. I have used this product for more than 12 years. It is great.</li>
    <li> I have a regular sales person for my Mary Kay products, but due to a family situation, she was not sending in an order when I was low on the product. I needed just a 1 time quick purchase and checked Amazon and was happy to find it available. It even qualified for Amazon Prime so a very happy solution for me.</li>
    <li> Bummer Mary Kay ever dropped this!! I loved it and used it for years!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I use this product&lt;br /&gt;regurally and was out so I placed a order on line and&lt;br /&gt;it came very fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years.  It is a great moisturizer and like it because it is light weight and does not clog my pores.  I do get compliments on my skin often.</li>
    <li> for some reason, this lotion stung my skin and my daughter&#x27;s skin.  Is is outdated?  very disappointing.  be careful what you buy over the internet</li>
