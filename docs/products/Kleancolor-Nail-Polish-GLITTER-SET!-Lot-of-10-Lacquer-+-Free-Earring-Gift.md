      <li>Best bang for the buck!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really great deal must have it in your collection</li>
      <li>These are great for making an impact.</li>
      <li>Some may have a tint to them but they look best when layered on top of another color.</li>
      <li>but if you are looking for good coverage, this is not it..  </li>
      <li>good for the price I suppose</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>Stars, moons, hearts and more!  </li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more to give as gifts!</li>
      <li>My order arrived quickly and the nail polish colors were absolutely gorgeous!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s amazing collection</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>The inside of the bag also had a very strong nail polish smell.  </li>
      <li>I would think they would care more than that.    </li>
      <li>The packaging could have been slightly better.</li>
      <li>so you do need a diferent polish on your nail and use this glitter as a top coat.</li>
      <li>and my daughters love the polish as while.</li>
      <li>Thought it would be better on</li>
      <li>These are not full coverage glitter polishes, they are more of a top coat,  perfect for what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I gave 3 stars because the rest of the polishes are cute and I will enjoy using them over time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for putting a coat on top of a solid color if you want  more depth or if you want natural looking nails with some glitter on top!!</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t like how they clump together and come off rather easy.</li>
      <li>a ton of nail polish for a cheap price.  </li>
      <li>Hoped for more sparkles in some, but most are very pretty, some very BLING!</li>
      <li>, I love the colors, the combination is very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>a full, even look with.</li>
      <li>My personal favorite combination is Tiara Gold on top of a purple shade.</li>
      <li>&amp; I love the Kleancolor product even more than the prior products I have purchased.</li>
      <li>I ordered these because I wanted a variety of glitters and that&#x27;s exactly what I got!  </li>
      <li>so I think I will use them as is and save them for fun toe nails.  </li>
      <li>I even use a tooth pick to get at that elusive shaped  (Star, heart, ex,) confetti I want, but the result is a fun look.</li>
      <li>The rest are just pretty too.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase more from them.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the look so much,  </li>
      <li>I have grown very fond of the gliter nail polish this year</li>
      <li>Really???  </li>
      <li>these are really kool</li>
      <li>I was happily surprised when I got all my polishes, all fun confetti, none of them duds.</li>
      <li>Then, she changed her promise by stating that her supervisor does not include this matte polish in this particular lot</li>
      <li>As I said,  some are more difficult to use,  but for the price they are a lot of fun!</li>
      <li>These are a clear coat with confetti-like material inside.</li>
      <li>Clearly, they do not care about repeat customers.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been burnt by sellers on amazon before when they sent me old unusable polish, so I was weary of buying this set.</li>
      <li>the bottle could barely do my nails</li>

    <li> When I received the polishes, I discovered to my disgust that there was a used bottle of Madly Matte polish by KleanColor included in the lot.  I emailed this company right away (with the accompanying photo as shown below) and the rep was unpleasant to begin with.  No apology; no concern; just a defensive and dismissive tone.  Nevertheless, she promised she would send me a return label and I could send back the lot \\&quot;no worries\\&quot;.  Then, she changed her promise by stating that her supervisor does not include this matte polish in this particular lot and therefore it is not one of theirs.  Really???  If the polish did not come from them, where would it have come from?  The sky?    Clearly, they do not care about repeat customers.  Have a peek at some repetitive complaints that continue accruing.  I would think they would care more than that.    I gave 3 stars because the rest of the polishes are cute and I will enjoy using them over time.</li>
    <li> i had ordered this item.. but they gave me different item...they gave me 6 glitter ones and all r either black white and silvercombinations... i actualy wanted diff colours.. but i din get them... and i got a nail care kit which i didnt need...</li>
    <li> I like just glitter but if you are looking for good coverage, this is not it..  It&#x27;s great for putting a coat on top of a solid color if you want  more depth or if you want natural looking nails with some glitter on top!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. My order arrived quickly and the nail polish colors were absolutely gorgeous! Best bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> From what I can tell, I received what I ordered but the package was severely damaged when it arrived tonight.  The inside of the bag also had a very strong nail polish smell.  I couldn&#x27;t find any broken bottles, so I&#x27;m not sure where the smell is from.  The packaging could have been slightly better.</li>
    <li> I have grown very fond of the gliter nail polish this year &amp; I love the Kleancolor product even more than the prior products I have purchased. I will definitely purchase more from them.</li>
    <li> I like these , however some of the glitters are difficult to work with.  I tried these over another coordinating color,  I didn&#x27;t like the look so much,  so I think I will use them as is and save them for fun toe nails.  I did like the variety and shapes of the glitters. I  received hearts,  cresant moons,  stars,  polka dots. As I said,  some are more difficult to use,  but for the price they are a lot of fun!</li>
    <li> The laquer is great!  I just got acrylics taken off, and when polished with these, the cracking stops.  Hoped for more sparkles in some, but most are very pretty, some very BLING!</li>
    <li> a ton of nail polish for a cheap price.  the only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; i could say is that the base color is very light so you do need a diferent polish on your nail and use this glitter as a top coat.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in this product glitter is bulky and big and doesn&#x27;t really come out the bottle could barely do my nails</li>
    <li> these are really kool</li>
    <li> love it! and my daughters love the polish as while.</li>

    <li> These are great for making an impact. My favorites are Tiara Gold, Chunky Silver, Aurora and Green with Envy. The rest are just pretty too.

    <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie but I&#x27;ve been burnt by sellers on amazon before when they sent me old unusable polish, so I was weary of buying this set. I was happily surprised when I got all my polishes, all fun confetti, none of them duds. Just as a helpful note, some of these polishes have large confetti&#x27;s and are a bit difficult to get a full, even look with. What I do is dab the polish instead of brushing it on. I even use a tooth pick to get at that elusive shaped  (Star, heart, ex,) confetti I want, but the result is a fun look.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be better on it&#x27;s own. I use them over a color polish.</li>
    <li> My wife enjoys the glitter shapes and colors to accent her nails. She doesn&#x27;t like how they clump together and come off rather easy.</li>
    <li> The glitter does not spread on to the nail. The bigger the glitter the worst it would spread. Out of the pack there was only two that would spread.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Thin ... funny smell ... good for the price I suppose</li>
    <li> I just got this set and it&#x27;s amazing collection, I love the colors, the combination is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Really great deal must have it in your collection</li>
