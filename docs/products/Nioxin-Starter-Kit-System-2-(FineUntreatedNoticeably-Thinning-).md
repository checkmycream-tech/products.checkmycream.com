      <li>i am very impressed with the honorable attitude that this company has and a real desire not to screw up ---</li>

      <li>They say it smells all nice and minty, and the shampoo does.  </li>
      <li>It also makes his hair feel very clean, it smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.    </li>
      <li>more like its tingling</li>
      <li>hey if my hair looks better than it has in months...</li>
      <li>Seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>my hair has a lot more volume to it</li>
      <li>this product made my hair fall out more than it was beforehand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the favorite daughter-in-law now.</li>
      <li>I seem to remember it worked better then.  </li>
      <li>I did experience more loss when I started to use Nioxin.  </li>
      <li>During/after menopause, and after lapband surgery, I lost a lot of hair mostly in the front.</li>
      <li>It was when i went to the dermatologist that they were finally able to give me some answers.</li>
      <li>He has more hair than when he started using Nioxin a year ago</li>
      <li>I bought this as to use to make her feel better about her thinning hair</li>
      <li>and she said that she believes its gotten much better.</li>
      <li>They claim it makes each strand look thicker giving the appearance of more hair.  </li>
      <li>OK, so I&#x27;ve used this Nioxin for years and have never seen any results.</li>
      <li>In any event, Nioxin is able to get away with suggesting that their product cleans the scalp</li>
      <li>I used it faithfully, every day, for two months and did not see that it did any more than Head &amp; Shoulders for thinning hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Nioxin twice (two several-week-long tests) and, like most men, I tried it because I figured I had nothing to lose</li>
      <li>On top of that, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well at all.</li>
      <li>I had to use a lot of it to even be able to work it into my hair.  </li>
      <li>One month into using this product, my hair falls out like three times more than before.</li>
      <li>It made my hair fall out more.</li>
      <li>It works well, but you get a much better deal when you buy the cleanser and scalp therapy in the 33.8 ounce bottles</li>
      <li>thinking it would help more with the thinning.....</li>
      <li>While using this I had more hair loss and it became noticeable.</li>
      <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair getting thinner on top -</li>
      <li>Instead of hairgrowth this product has done more damage.</li>
      <li>Love it because I had a lot of thinning hair.</li>
      <li>So far, though, so good!</li>
      <li>Leave it a large corporation to buy a good company and change it.</li>
      <li>On top of that, I have huge flaky dandruff from this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a product like this before but was less then impressed by the results.</li>
      <li>I have concluded that my 3 dollar herbal essences volumizing shampoo/conditioner does a MUCH better job at making my hair have more volume than this product, and it&#x27;s much cheaper as well!</li>
      <li>The Nioxin System was easy to understand and after a couple of weeks I asked the stylist who originally told me about it</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have a huge drawback though.  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;island\\&quot; has mostly filled in.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i used the product sincerely following the instructions and it showed me great results after a month.</li>
      <li>Obviously, I am not too happy that it did not work for me.  </li>
      <li>I would rather have nice smelling hair (and a few moments in the shower to wake up to a pleasant aromatherapy) than to pee away my money while also smelling like someone peed in my hair.</li>

      <li>This is not a difficult claim to make as many types of shampoo and conditioner add volume.  </li>
      <li>Well, with Nioxin you have to lather twice to get any sense of feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>( i have a male hair loss pattern), so i read these products were good to stop the hair from falling.  </li>
      <li>but I have a full head of hair now</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner appear to be salon quality, though I am sure you can find equally good quality products for less.</li>
      <li>Perhaps if they sold a one month supply at a significantly lower price it would have been worth the chance.  </li>
      <li>my hair feels really, really CLEAN; this product smells lovely, very minty and my hair actually feels nice.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell nice and feel nice (as do many), and I try to leave massage each product into my scalp and leave-in for as long as possible.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner made my hair real clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>to not only make me a satisfied and happy customer but got the correct product in my hands as soon as humanly possible.  </li>
      <li>O.K., many reviews said it was normal and it would of fallen out anyway, so I finished the starter kit.</li>
      <li>even right after i showered, this product took care of that right away!</li>
      <li>It may look like a good deal, but we aware that the tube of scalp conditioner in this offer is only the 4.2 oz size.</li>
      <li>Bottom line: I am going to buy some really nice scented shampoo and conditioner which provides added volume, and use it regularly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I am going to buy some really nice scented shampoo and conditioner which provides added volume, and use it regularly.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>WORTH THE MONEY</li>
      <li>My thoughts are that if you immediately started using Nioxin as soon as you noticed some definite thinning or hair loss, that you&#x27;d have even better resultsthan he did and that you&#x27;d be able to hang on to what you&#x27;ve got much longer.    </li>
      <li>Btw, I knew from stopping taking it before that if I started up Propecia again I would re-regrow my hair pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Take Biotin Supplements, they are priced right and work</li>
      <li>It has everything you need and just the right size.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this system to anyone whos worrying about thinning hair but make sure to do the test on the Nioxin website to find out which system is right for you as there are multiple variants.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin System 2 (for fine, natural, noticeably thinning hair) for about a month now.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Nioxin!</li>
      <li>This is better for thinning your wallet than actually thickening or increasing your hair.</li>
      <li>you could always see her scalp in natural light.</li>
      <li>It went on for about the first couple weeks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair regrowth products and this one fell short.</li>
      <li>First of all, the shampoo does not lather well at all.  </li>
      <li>an could notice the hair on top of my head was sparser than the back and sides.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read all the review before buying this and there was a lot of good reviews. I&#x27;m a west Indian female more on the Indian side. I always had fine thin hair since my hair is oily. I started noticing that my hair was thinning out and thought this would be good. So wrong it only mad matters worst. Before using this I most likely was the only person who notice the thin hair. While using this I had more hair loss and it became noticeable. I read reviews and said this was normal and continue to use it. It only kept getting worst. I stop using it and the hair stopped falling and now I don&#x27;t have any new growth and the old hair never grow back. May be this product wasn&#x27;t intended for other races I don&#x27;t know but I will never use this and recommend to anyone. Now I have to really try to solve the issue of the thinning hair I really didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin hair but since my last pregnancy(6yrs ago)it started thinning so I turned to Nioxin. Now have in mind my hair has NOT been falling excessively through out these years but with this product it did. O.K., many reviews said it was normal and it would of fallen out anyway, so I finished the starter kit. Now unfortunately the excessive hair loss during use only lessened when I stopped the product. One thing I do give it is that the scalp treatment gives you a boost in thickness. Maybe not all products are for everyone, I&#x27;ll keep searching.....</li>
    <li> The Nioxin System 2, definetly works for my husband.  He has a receding hair line and his hair is also thinning.  When he regularly uses this system, we start to see hair growth and thickness in as little as 2 weeks.  The key is to use it daily or atleast every other day and don&#x27;t let yourself run out.  If you stay on it, it does it&#x27;s job.  We like it and continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this product.  First of all, even the Nioxin company admits that the product neither regrows hair or slows down shedding, so if you&#x27;re expecting this to be some \\&quot;cure\\&quot; it&#x27;s not going to happen.  They claim it makes each strand look thicker giving the appearance of more hair.  First of all, the shampoo does not lather well at all.  I had to use a lot of it to even be able to work it into my hair.  It also has an unpleasant minty/medical smell.  My hair looks greasy and flat even right after washing.  On top of that, I have huge flaky dandruff from this product.  I have NEVER had dandruff before using Nioxin.  I have concluded that my 3 dollar herbal essences volumizing shampoo/conditioner does a MUCH better job at making my hair have more volume than this product, and it&#x27;s much cheaper as well!</li>
    <li> I just started using this, I&#x27;m not seeing any improvement yet, but they say to give it 30 days, so I&#x27;ll do it, though I&#x27;m skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a huge drawback though.  They say it smells all nice and minty, and the shampoo does.  The conditioner does not.  The scalp treatment, however, outright stinks.  It&#x27;s this nasty chemical odor that follows you around all day, and if your head sweats at all (say, during a workout), the smell becomes even more noticeable.  I can&#x27;t stand using it.</li>
    <li> This is better for thinning your wallet than actually thickening or increasing your hair. The leave on conditioner foamy stuff was icky feeling and I could not stand it for long. I continued using the shampoo and conditioner until gone but saw no difference in the six weeks it took to use it up and was not inspired to further invest in the regimen.</li>
    <li> recently i ordered some nioxin shampoo --- a little hiccup in the order and i was not happy --- BeauteJunkie went above and beyond to not only make me a satisfied and happy customer but got the correct product in my hands as soon as humanly possible.  i am very impressed with the honorable attitude that this company has and a real desire not to screw up --- oh yes that is always gong to be an issue with humans and i failed to honor that!!  job well done BeauteJunkie and i will return as a happy customer soon!!</li>
    <li> During/after menopause, and after lapband surgery, I lost a lot of hair mostly in the front. Hair all over the sink, needless to say I avoided mirrors with overhead lighting.    I tried Nioxin - the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment. They have really helped. No hair in the sink, the front is growing back.    Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, but it worked for me. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT. FEELS LIKE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR MY HAIR. WORTH THE MONEY</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;ve used this Nioxin for years and have never seen any results. Yes the foam stuff will make your hair \\&quot;seem\\&quot; thicker,,,, but Nioxin will not grow new hair or prevent hair loss.  I even took the supplements.  Anyway, after so much research I decided to try Organic shampoo and wow, huge difference in my hair loss.  Right now I&#x27;m using Peter Lame (pricey) for thinning hair and just purchased Avalon (good price) thickening shampoo.  Stay away from all those harmful chemicals they put in Nioxin, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;38 year old mother of three&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Take Biotin Supplements, they are priced right and work</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the products long enough to see if if will slow down hair loss, but here are my observations so far:  The shampoo and conditioner made my hair real clean and soft.  I didn&#x27;t notice any lingering odor from the products. As for the scalp treatment that you put on afterwards, it made my hair feel like brillo (maybe that&#x27;s the thickening effect?) and greasy besides.  When I used the shampoo and conditioner alone, my hair felt soft so I know it&#x27;s the scalp treatment foam that has the other effects. I looked at the ingredients and the active ingredients in that stuff are sunscreen ingredients - so what&#x27;s that about?  Why do I need expensive sunscreen for my scalp/hair?  The inactive ingredients have a big long list - probably not enough of any one thing to have much effect.</li>
    <li> It may look like a good deal, but we aware that the tube of scalp conditioner in this offer is only the 4.2 oz size. At least that is what I received.</li>
    <li> I have been using this kit for maybe a month or two, and I do not notice any \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; at all.  Yet another version of snake oil, in my opinion.  The shampoo and conditioner appear to be salon quality, though I am sure you can find equally good quality products for less. The only part of the system that seems to have any effect is the so-called \\&quot;activator,\\&quot; which you apply after the shampoo and conditioner.  The activator is a foam that you apply directly to and rub into your scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t thicken your hair, but seems to act as a mousse, giving the hair a little more body.  Again, however, the system did not serve its intended purpose for me, which was to thicken my hair.  As an aside, the product makes no claims that that it actually does anything---what it does say is that people THINK it does something--big difference there.  This product appears to be nothing by marketing hype.</li>
    <li> Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  It appears to me they may have also changed the formula.  Either way, I don&#x27;t perceive the same thickening effect it used to have.  This is unfortunate because I used to really love this product line.</li>
    <li> I was suggested by GreatClips when i went for an hair cut .Trusting them&lt;br /&gt;i used the product sincerely following the instructions and it showed me great results after a month.Before using this product my hair fall is more,so due to which i used to go salon once in every 4 months.Now it changed drastically,back to normal every 3 weeks i am going to salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really good and I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband, and he&#x27;s been using it for over a year now.  He didn&#x27;t start using it until he had a sort of \\&quot;island\\&quot; in the front of his hair from the hair loss (sorry if you read this, honey).  He had an area about the size of an orange of scalp clearly visible through the thinning hair on the back of his head as well.    It took about four months for us to really start to see a change.      The visible scalp at the back of his head is now completely filled in.  The hair in that area is only slightly thinner than the rest of his hair, and it&#x27;s a huge, clearly visible improvement in this area.    The \\&quot;island\\&quot; has mostly filled in.  He still has thin hair up front, and his receding hairline did not magically reappear.  However, he has a TON of new growth in the front, and even though it&#x27;s filled in quite a bit, we still see baby hairs showing up all the time in previously bald spots.  Bad news is, these take forever to grow and some spots are still bald.    He used to run his hands through his very short, military hairstyle and find a dozen hairs on his hand afterwards.  The new loss has completely stopped.  He has more hair than when he started using Nioxin a year ago and he hasn&#x27;t lost any additional hair, even though he was losing at an alarming rate before he started using this system.    My opinion is that YES this product works - for him, at least.  It also makes his hair feel very clean, it smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.    Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey.  But my husband&#x27;s hair is so short that in one full year we&#x27;ve only bought two starter kits, and he still has about half a bottle of each product left.  Honestly?  I think my husband feels the price is incredibly reasonable because it not only grew a lot of his hair back, but stopped the loss so he can keep what he&#x27;s got!    My thoughts are that if you immediately started using Nioxin as soon as you noticed some definite thinning or hair loss, that you&#x27;d have even better resultsthan he did and that you&#x27;d be able to hang on to what you&#x27;ve got much longer.    We will be buying him Nioxin from now on.  As an additional benefit, I suffer from an itchy scalp (caused by eczema) and nothing clears it up without irritation faster than this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was not very pleased with this kit. I started off with system #1 and I figured I&#x27;d ramp it up to system #2 thinking it would help more with the thinning.....WRONG. It made my hair fall out more. I read this is suppose to happen initially. It went on for about the first couple weeks. What I don&#x27;t like about this kit is the shampoo is way too drying. I guess its supposed to remove excess sebum from your scalp; at least that what it says on Nioxin&#x27;s website. Well, it strips your hair of too much of its natural oils, which is probably what made my hair fall out like crazy. On top of that, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well at all. The conditioner is nothing special either; its not very conditioning. And the worst part about the kit would have to be the scalp treatment. It&#x27;s a sticky mess! Its basically a mousse with sun block as someone else described it here. Its really sticky and leaves your hair unmanageable. I would deal with all this stuff if I saw that it made a difference with my hair, but alas, it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Cleans hair well, makes it appear fuller.  Don&#x27;t really know if it makes it grow.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter became very ill last summer and was put on medication for Crohns Disease.  She already had thin hair to begin with, but when she started the medication her hair started falling out everywhere and it became very noticeable.  We heard about Nioxin thru a Chrohns support group.  I give it 5 stars!  We started this system in December and now she has a lot of new hair growth, about 2 inches long all over her head.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try this product as I have heard that this line specializes in hairloss. When I recieved the items I read through the ingredients and noticed that one of their main ingredients (SLS) actually contributes to some types of hairloss. Needless to say, I tried it anyways. I figured that my condition (postpartum hairloss) wasn&#x27;t significant enough to cause any major side effects. Well...let me tell you...it irritated my scalp once I applied the product. You ever hear, if it tingles, its working? Yeah...more like its tingling and my head is on fire. I didn&#x27;t continue with the conditioner and once I got out of the shower I actually noticed a small bald spot!!! Trust me, I would have noticed before I washed, as I hate to say it like most people I have an attachment to my hair. I am not sure if it was just me and my body chemistry, but I went back to an all natural shampoo with biotin and niacin, haven&#x27;t seen as much hairloss after using a natural shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am only 24 and 3 months after being hospitalized with a very bad infection i started to lose a lot of hair. I had a number of tests done and everything came back normal. It was when i went to the dermatologist that they were finally able to give me some answers. apparently its not uncommon for women to lose some hair after a traumatic event like a death, child birth or illness. They suggested that i start using rogaine for women, take biotin(a supplement for hair skin and nails) and to try using Nioxin. It is a pretty expensive system so i wanted to try it out before shelling out $80 for shampoo and conditioner. I LOVE this system! I noticed a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance after just 1 wash! because my hair was so thin it was starting to look really greasy even right after i showered, this product took care of that right away! my hair has a lot more volume to it and you cant even tell that i am/was losing hair! also, i dont know if its this product, the rogain and biotin or all of the above, but i am starting to see a lot more hair growth as well! i am not really a fan of the smell of it, but hey if my hair looks better than it has in months...i&#x27;m ok with that!</li>
    <li> I have lost a great deal of hair from my 2 pregnancies and now, I find I have alopecia. I have to keep my hair up with a barrette because my hair loss is a great deal on the front of my head. Actually, if you were a bird and looked at my head, it would look like there&#x27;s a river on top of my head. The hair loss starts at the front and the continues to the back. It&#x27;s not pretty, so I never leave the house with my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,  my review of the Nioxin System 2 Starter Kit isn&#x27;t really complete, but here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening so far:&lt;br /&gt;* my hair feels really, really CLEAN; this product smells lovely, very minty and my hair actually feels nice. Usually it feels kind of wiry.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve only used it twice and already I see the initial hair loss other reviewers have mentioned. It scared me a bit and I wondered if I should stop using it but, really, the only thing I have to lose if I don&#x27;t use Nioxin is more hair, so what the heck, I&#x27;ll keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;* My hair feels thicker, heartier. Don&#x27;t know how else to put it. Usually, when I pull it back into a ponytail, it feels like there&#x27;s not much there. Now, it takes a bit of effort to gather it all up. Maybe I&#x27;m imagining it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as I continue using it. So far, though, so good!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 76 year old mother in law who had such thinning hair you could always see her scalp in natural light. She also had a receeding hairline. She used the starter kit products only once a week (when she washed her hair). She called me a little over 9 weeks from starting regime and was so excited to tell me that she has all kinds of new little hairs along the area that was receeding. Also her scalp doesn&#x27;t show anymore. She could not be happier. She also said her hair feels very soft. There was no mention of hair falling out so I guess that wasn&#x27;t a concern (I was very worried about that from other reviews). I bought this as to use to make her feel better about her thinning hair-I didn&#x27;t think it would actually work. Ha! I&#x27;m the favorite daughter-in-law now. Thanks Nioxin!</li>
    <li> Love it because I had a lot of thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Nioxin products thought I thought this starter kit would be perfect!  I use it daily!  If you have thinning hair and want to try something to thicken it I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Tried this for a couple of months and it is worthless..Not only does it not work but it makes your hair look awful. Don&#x27;t spend you money on it.</li>
    <li> First, I want to make it known that I have always had fine, thin hair but no thin spots.  I am 26 years old.  However, after the birth of my daughter 18 months ago my hair started falling out in handfuls.  Everything I read said this was completely normal and my hair should be back to pre-pregnancy condition by her first birthday.  It never returned to normal.  My hair is VERY thin on the top of my head, especially the crown (if my hair is pulled straight up on the top of my head you can see the curvature of my scalp, scary).  After ignoring the hair loss long enough I decided to see my obgyn and have blood work done to see of something was wrong.  Well, all of the tests came back normal (yes, including thyroid).  She suggested I try Nioxin.  I have been using Nioxin for a 1 month now.  My hair feels healthier and \\&quot;looks\\&quot; a little denser.  I have started to see new baby fine growth on the top of my head that was not there prior to starting Nioxin.  I did experience more loss when I started to use Nioxin.  However, that has subsided and I do feel that my hair loss is a little less (I can run my hands through my hair in the shower and have very few strands come out, maybe 10 strands total during a shower).  I have also started taking pre-natal vitamins, biotin supplements, and omega-3 supplements.  From all of my research these supplements are supposed to help with hair growth and health.    I would recommend this product.  I&#x27;m anxious to see what my hair will look like in a year from now.  I will update this review if anything changes (good or bad).  I would also suggest buying the liter bottles of the cleanser and scalp therapy in addition to the larger bottle of the scalp treatment.  The starter kit is not enough product to see if it is going to work for you.  Everything I have read said it takes 3-6 months to see results.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin System 2 kit is an excellent package that leaves your fair feeling very clean as well as thicker looking.  It is pricey but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> It works well, but you get a much better deal when you buy the cleanser and scalp therapy in the 33.8 ounce bottles, thats 67.6 ounces for around 65 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, you get 8.4 ounces and an extra scalp treatment for 30 dollars.  Do the math.  it is more expensive for the starter kit in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try it out and see if it works for you I would suggest this starter kit, especially if you have shorter hair.  Otherwise, from my experience it works well and if you&#x27;ve got the cash, get the bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a decent amount of time and didn&#x27;t really witness any true results, unfortunately. I&#x27;ve tried many hair regrowth products and this one fell short.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old male and have had a gradual receding hairline since I was about 19.  Since then, I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair getting thinner on top - at one point I shaved my head an could notice the hair on top of my head was sparser than the back and sides.    I&#x27;d tried Rogaine before, but found application really tedious and the product very sticky, so did not continue with the &#x27;treatment&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve also tried a few herbal products, which I did not find helpful.    I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin System 2 (for fine, natural, noticeably thinning hair) for about a month now.  I have not recorded my progress in a scientific way, so am unsure whether hair growth has occurred, but I have definitely noticed a difference in the cosmetic appearance of my hair.    The shampoo and conditioner smell nice and feel nice (as do many), and I try to leave massage each product into my scalp and leave-in for as long as possible.  Step 3 of the system, the foam, is quick and easy to apply - by separating damp hair and shooting a few pumps of the foam onto the scalp.  After massaging a little, I comb the solution through my hair with my fingers, before blow-drying.    At this stage my hair is quite sticky, and trying to use a comb or brush would likely be a painful hair-pulling process, but using my fingers as a comb works well.  After drying whilst separating with my fingers I can apply a little wax and shape into place.    My hair definitely looks thicker.  As mentioned above, I haven&#x27;t counted/studied the number of hairs; but I&#x27;ll definately continue to use the product - if only for the visible benefits.    PS: I haven&#x27;t suffered the hives and sensitivity others have mentioned, despite having quite sensitive skin; but I have recently noticed dry patches of skin around my ear-lobes - probably due to the shampoo - but it isn&#x27;t itchy or painful.  I just apply a little moisturiser.    Good luck with your own experiences and give your own feedback.  People suffering from hair loss are often in adesperate situation, and need some good, HONEST, reviews.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after getting some info about it from one of the girls that does my hair and recommended this to me. I&#x27;ve used a product like this before but was less then impressed by the results. The Nioxin System was easy to understand and after a couple of weeks I asked the stylist who originally told me about it and she said that she believes its gotten much better. I recommend this system to anyone whos worrying about thinning hair but make sure to do the test on the Nioxin website to find out which system is right for you as there are multiple variants.</li>
    <li> I am a 35 yr old male. My hair has moderate thinning. I bought the product 1 month ago and used it daily though I did not use the pump mouse-like product because it was very sticky. No funny smells from the product. I left the conditioner in a lengthy time (3+ min.). I found no change in my hair. I do think it cleans and leaves your hair well conditioned but I don&#x27;t see a difference in hair thickness or growth. I was hopping this would be the product. I have found Nizoral (the anti-fungal ingredient reduces testosterone) to work in the past but it leaves hair dry and I worry about playing with hormones. The only think I have found to slightly work is the VICHY products which are expensive and annoying to apply.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get something straight: Nioxin has no way to regrow hair.  It also has no way to stop hair loss.  That is a fact, and the company acknowledges it.  It is a scientific fact.  The ONLY think Nioxin is willing to represent or suggest is that this \\&quot;hair care system\\&quot; cleans the scalp and that it thickens hair.  Now, Nioxin contends that one of the reasons people lose hair or density is due to a form of testosterone on the surface of the scalp.  This is silly, but maybe true in a very small minority of cases.  In any event, Nioxin is able to get away with suggesting that their product cleans the scalp (it should, it&#x27;s shampoo).  The second claim that Nioxin makes is that users of the product perceive thicker hair.  This is not a difficult claim to make as many types of shampoo and conditioner add volume.  This is not to say the product grows healthier or thicker hair-- it just binds residue to the hair shaft or, worse, degrades the surface of the hair so that it has a more rough texture and therefore appears thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are products (propecia and rogaine) which actually regrow hair.  However, if you read the fine print, you&#x27;ll notice that these products only work for 15-50% of men, and only after several months of continuous use.  My experience with rogaine was that it was a sticky disgusting mess, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine having to use it the rest of my life (if it works at all, the results immediately stop once you stop using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Nioxin twice (two several-week-long tests) and, like most men, I tried it because I figured I had nothing to lose and I didn&#x27;t like to see my hair become thinner in density.  I think the shampoo is poor quality shampoo.  You know you how feel when you use \\&quot;good\\&quot; shampoo it lathers up real nice and then rinses squeaky clean?  Well, with Nioxin you have to lather twice to get any sense of feeling clean.  The conditioner is average.  Then there is the foam you are supposed to apply after the shower to damp hair.  The foam is basically sunscreen and godawful mousse.  The stuff reminds me of the hair scene in There&#x27;s Something About Mary.  This foam makes your hair really stiff and it has no therapeutic benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole hair care system stinks.  Literally.  It smells like someone urinated in your hair.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  I am not trying to unfairly beat-up on the product or put it down as a shill for some other system.  This stuff just stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I am going to buy some really nice scented shampoo and conditioner which provides added volume, and use it regularly.  I would rather have nice smelling hair (and a few moments in the shower to wake up to a pleasant aromatherapy) than to pee away my money while also smelling like someone peed in my hair.s basically sunscreen and godawful mousse.

    <li> #2 was NOT the product for me . Left hair oily &amp; looked oily and dirty in less than a day unlike the #1 products.</li>
    <li> 2 stars because while the shampoo leaves your hair feeling clean and the conditioner is very good, it doesn&#x27;t help thinning hair or even help the \\&quot;appearance\\&quot; of thinning hair at all.  Even the pump of treatment is no different than applying hair spray and then blow-drying your hair while using a comb, which btw does help disguise thinning hair.    Guys, if you&#x27;re losing your hair go get a prescription for Propecia.  I&#x27;ve been on it for a couple years now and have regrown a lot of hair.  I was never bald but my hair was noticeably thin and my scalp was visible.  After using Propecia my hair follicles are still thinner than they were but I have a full head of hair now and you can&#x27;t see my scalp.    I stopped using Propecia to see if Nioxin would help at least maintain the hair I regrew with Propecia.  Btw, I knew from stopping taking it before that if I started up Propecia again I would re-regrow my hair pretty quickly.  The Nioxin does nothing.</li>
    <li> Nothing out of the ordinary to say. The item arrived in time, no delay at all, and undamaged. There&#x27;s nothing to say against the item or the delivery, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> this product made my hair fall out more than it was beforehand. Im going back to my old shampoo, peter lamas, i feel like it actually does something!!!</li>
    <li> I saw results in a week. Hair looks a bit more thick, but thats about it. Im not seeing much else on week 5.</li>
    <li> I used thie system 1 products maybe 5 years or so ago.  I seem to remember it worked better then.  Maybe they changed the formulation?</li>
    <li> We have used this product for 8 years. My last purchase I noticed immediately that the color and packaging had changed. After using it for 6 weeks we find our hair dry. After using the conditioner our hair is difficult to comb. Suddenly hair is thinning.  Forget it!!! Don&#x27;t bother!! Leave it a large corporation to buy a good company and change it.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin Scalp; Shampoo; and Conditioner products  are great! They work great with my thinning hair.  They add volume and promote hair growth in thinning areas.</li>
    <li> I bought this Nioxin starter kit on recommendation of my hair dresser and had high hope for it. I was going to purchase the starter kit on amazon, but end up buying it at super cut because i read about some fake products on internet stores.  I am 38 years old and my long hair starts falling out. So i was hoping this shampoo and conditioner set would stop my hair from falling out. One month into using this product, my hair falls out like three times more than before. I was thinking maybe that is the initial stage and will get past. Boy, was i wrong. Now i have been using it for two months. my hair loss is worse than ever and i got so scared of washing my hair with this product. I stop using it this week because don&#x27;t want to become bald. Anyway, it is not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this starter kit religiously by bottle directions for the past two and a half months and I have noticed no difference whatsoever. In fact, my hair feels even thinner than before I started using it, and my hair stylist agrees. This product does not do what it says it does, not to mention the conditioner does not condition, and the &amp;#34;root foam&amp;#34; or whatever is just watered down mousse. I think those who use this product and see results are either imagining it or something else in their lives is making their hair regrow/get thicker. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a long time and I like it BUT my order was subtituted for another collection.  I wanted this one</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference. I became impatient using it. It was taking to long to see results but I know folks who stuck with it and they saw a big difference.</li>
    <li> I only used it for 2 weeks before it dried my hair out so much that I had to stop since it&#x27;s winter time and I didn&#x27;t want to continue seeing my hair break. However, i did see a slight decrease in hair loss and it seems to be growing in slowly. Will continue to use it once the weather is warmer and my hair can take it.</li>
    <li> i was loosing a lot of hair ( i have a male hair loss pattern), so i read these products were good to stop the hair from falling.  the instructions say there may be some shedding, and it was A LOT.  i though i was going to end completely bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i regret i ever bought these them.</li>
    <li> This kit was the perfect way to start to use this product.  It has everything you need and just the right size.  Recently, went to the hairdresser and he said that he could see a noticeable difference in the texture and thickness of my hair.  I am very pleased and the cost is on point.</li>
    <li> I was told to allow 30 days for Nioxin to start working.  I have been using it for just a couple of weeks and am beginning to notice a difference already.  Even my hairdresser says she likes Nioxin.</li>
    <li> Even after 2 uses, my hair appeared thicker. Seems to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair break less, i have fine hair and i am always looking for gentle shampoos that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> Instead of hairgrowth this product has done more damage. I would suggest using olive or mustard oil for hiargrowth. Wont recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the advice of the lady who cuts my hair.  My hair is thinning and she said that others received good results with this product.  I used it faithfully, every day, for two months and did not see that it did any more than Head &amp; Shoulders for thinning hair (at ten times the cost).  Obviously, I am not too happy that it did not work for me.  If it works for others, good for you.  Perhaps if they sold a one month supply at a significantly lower price it would have been worth the chance.  As it is, I will rate it one star because now I have all of this expensive hair product that doesn&#x27;t do for me what it says it can do.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market for people who have hair loss of any kind.  It even works for men.</li>
