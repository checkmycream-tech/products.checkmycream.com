      <li>/&gt;It makes chair massage a better experience for everyone.</li>
      <li>I love using the cloth but thought it was a bit</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure if I missed a spot where it said the Colors to chose from.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>While I was in school my class had to perform many chair massage events.  </li>
      <li>I use it on every client, they seem to enjoy it too!</li>

      <li>With this nice silky cloth I was delighted to find how much easier sessions are.</li>

      <li>Not only does it give an incredibly relaxing massage, it saves wear and tear on the massagers hands and joints.  </li>
      <li>do love how it works, smooth and no friction.</li>
      <li>They give you a mini-instruction manuel which was pretty nice and helpful.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for quick back rubs or full blown massages.  </li>
      <li>and it is much more fun to be able to add gliding strokes to the massage comfortably right through those sweaters!</li>
      <li>I have the large sized magic massager and it allows me to give a much better chair massage to my clients.  </li>
      <li>I would like this a lot more if it wasn&#x27;t BRIGHT RED.</li>
      <li>This is so great, they come in different sizes</li>
      <li>Not only will it save my hands during chair massage it will work great for table work too.  </li>
      <li>Yes, I&#x27;m a happy camper, and actually plan to get another one for &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; usage.)</li>
      <li>so I have them available for where ever I need to work.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent tool for chair massage, use on children or a client that is not comfortable disrobing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Fantastic addition to my practice.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t express how happy I am with my purchase, will be buying more as gifts for other LMT&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>but I needed other LMT&#x27;s out there to know what an incredible tool this is for your practice.</li>
      <li>They are worth the price, and then some!</li>
      <li>This is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim, I liked what people had to say and as a massage therapist I&#x27;m always looking for new tools to improve my service.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>In addition, I&#x27;ve used the Magic Massager for Swedish massage, particularly when my clients need glutteal work but aren&#x27;t comfortable removing their underwear.</li>
      <li>This makes massaging over clothes so much easier and it&#x27;s a better experience for the client.</li>
      <li>But you have to know how to massage yourself and others in order to get the full benefits of this cloth.</li>
      <li>The Magic Massager has given my practice new life.</li>
      <li>It is worth the money although I could probably make it myself.</li>
      <li>Is truly worth it.</li>
      <li>I am loving using this cloth, it works wonders when I&#x27;m doing chair massages, I love that I don&#x27;t feel the wrong side of the cloth, so the slip is excellent, I only wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so much, $10 for shipping I thought was a bit much, so it ends up as $30 for the cloth.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product, it really allows you to bypass clothes&#x27; inherent friction factor, to not need oil or even soft skinned hands for that matter.</li>
      <li>Wow, it&#x27;s so smooth.  </li>
      <li>As a massage therapist for 13 years, I never did many chair massages until recently.  </li>
      <li>10 stars for the seller&#x27;s fast delivery!....</li>
      <li>would like to be able to afford another one, but the price is holding me back</li>
      <li>Plus, my client says it feels much better than simply using my hands.</li>
      <li>I am a massage therapist who recently purchased the Magic Massager Cloth.  </li>
      <li>thats exactly what I received.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>There is a slightly larger size available (18 x 18) through</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I can get much deeper results than trying to work over fabric, and I don&#x27;t stain their underwear with oil residue from my hands.</li>
      <li>These cloths are washable and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>With this tool, I can use my forearm to massage the shoulder/scapula area in the chair and the clients are so much happier then getting just the hand/fist massage.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Really like these cloths.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I own a massage school. Although I don&#x27;t agree with the enclosed literature that say this will make you a professional. Lol&lt;br /&gt;I do love how it works, smooth and no friction. It makes it great for chair massage and the bright colors call attention to what you are doing by people passing by. Good marketing. I plan on showing this to my students and offering them at my school store.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tool for chair massage, use on children or a client that is not comfortable disrobing.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase a few more so I have them available for where ever I need to work.  (Spa setting, Mobil massage, or a chair massage event)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping that Wizard Industries (the only supplier of this cloth on Amazon) will eventually sell the 18\\&quot;x18\\&quot; size cloth too. This larger size allows for longer massage strokes. For now, the only place I can find the larger size is [...].</li>
    <li> I really love the magic massage cloth! I bought it for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he said it was the best gift he ever received from me. :) it also feels really good against your skin. I tried it on myself and it felt like silk.     But you have to know how to massage yourself and others in order to get the full benefits of this cloth. They give you a mini-instruction manuel which was pretty nice and helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a LMT so this is actually VERY HELPFUL in doing chair massage at functions. It glides over the persons back with ease and their clothing doesn&#x27;t disturb the clients massage!</li>
    <li> this saves my hands as a corporate chair massage therapist!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist who does chair massage. This allows me to do massage techniques that usually require oil/lotion. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to those who do chair massage and want to incorporate some gliding moves and not use oil!</li>
    <li> l love this product! I think my only complaint is that I would like it to be larger to accommodate more of the back.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! I have been a licensed massage therapist for 16 years and I just found out about these cloths! Excellent product! Ideal for pregnancy massage especially when they are in the side-lying position and the draping can get complicated! This way they can leave their clothes on and it&#x27;s easier on everyone! Everyone I&#x27;ve tried this cloth on loves it! This is worth every penny! There are two sizes: [[ASIN:B000FGXVIM Magic Massager Cloth]]this one is considered small (15 x 15) There is a slightly larger size available (18 x 18) through Massagesuppliesandsuch.com item #mmcloth. Both sizes are superb! The smaller one seems small but it rolls over itself and you can move and work with it very easily. I bless the people that invented these things! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for any massage therapist,especially for chair massages. This makes massaging over clothes so much easier and it&#x27;s a better experience for the client.</li>
    <li> It is to silly a concept to buy pre-made, does not work to well, it is to small, etc.</li>
    <li> As a professional massage therapist I sometimes had a rough time doing chair massage when clients wore sweaters or other clothing that was hard on my hands. Sometimes I practically got \\&quot;rug burns\\&quot;! With this nice silky cloth I was delighted to find how much easier sessions are. I discovered I can even place it over the hair to do neck massage without pulling or messing up hair too badly. I use half the energy doing chair massage now and it is much more fun to be able to add gliding strokes to the massage comfortably right through those sweaters! My clients are very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Magic Massager Cloth for over 3 years.....absolutely love it and so do my on-site clients. As a massage therapist, I do a lot of event and on-site work and have found the Magic Massager Cloth to be a wonderful help when working thru clothing of all kids....sweaters, sweatshirts, layers of clothing. It really has saved my hands and arms during long hours of massage! These cloths are washable and very sturdy. They have more than paid for themselves many times over. I am teaching a family massage class, and several people have asked to purchase these cloths to carry with them to work so they can work on friends and co-workers. They are worth the price, and then some!</li>
    <li> I am a professional massage therapist who does a lot of on-site chair massage. The Magic Massager has given my practice new life. I can massage more people for longer periods since there is almost no friction on clothes. Plus, my client says it feels much better than simply using my hands. In addition, I&#x27;ve used the Magic Massager for Swedish massage, particularly when my clients need glutteal work but aren&#x27;t comfortable removing their underwear. I can get much deeper results than trying to work over fabric, and I don&#x27;t stain their underwear with oil residue from my hands. The Magic Massager washes like a dream. With all the use over the last couple of months, often with oil on my hands, it hasn&#x27;t stained. It comes out of the wash like new. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough! What a miracle!</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars was it not for the price. It does everything it says it can do and more but to me its way over priced for a few pieces of silk cloth $10-$12 max!!!!</li>
    <li> I would like this a lot more if it wasn&#x27;t BRIGHT RED. It looks like a pouch for a sex toy. It&#x27;s also quite expensive and the $8 to ship a piece of material is ridiculous. Save your $ and look up a DIY instructions on sewing satin together to make one.</li>
    <li> Fantastic addition to my practice. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in blanket size!</li>
    <li> I recently started doing on site chair massage about 10 hours a week. My hands were killing me from all of the friction from the clothing. The Magic Massager Cloth totally takes away all friction and allows me to do longer strokes rather than just short friction. I use it on every client, they seem to enjoy it too!</li>
    <li> I have made the Magic Massager a Staple in my business!! This product is great, it saves our hands and our clients LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it really allows you to bypass clothes&#x27; inherent friction factor, to not need oil or even soft skinned hands for that matter. The recipient of the massage wins and you as the giver save your hands not needing to work so hard. Win/Win. Also, the product was delivered well within the time predicted. Yes, I&#x27;m a happy camper, and actually plan to get another one for &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; usage.)</li>
    <li> this product was shipped to me early and it is working well for me and my clients love it.  It provides a smooth glide and overall relaxation</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist who recently purchased the Magic Massager Cloth.  Wow, it&#x27;s so smooth.  I have only used it a little bit and I see the possibilities with this cloth.  Not only will it save my hands during chair massage it will work great for table work too.  I love the idea of using it on the neck so that I can avoid getting any oil in the clients hair.  Also it would work great for glut work when the clients choose to leave their underwear on.  I think I might have to order more.</li>
    <li> I love using the cloth but thought it was a bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;It makes chair massage a better experience for everyone.</li>
    <li> This product saved the skin on my fingers.  While I was in school my class had to perform many chair massage events.  Some of these events ran from 2 to 4 hours.  This cloth helped me to get through it without the sore hands and raw skin I usually had.</li>
    <li> This makes working through clothing much easier with less friction and wear and tear on my hands.</li>
    <li> I got this cloth as a last ditch effort for massaging my wife who is sensitive to practically every massage oil out there.  It does just what it says.  This cloth gives an oil-like massage but without the oil.  It is perfect for quick back rubs or full blown massages.  The cloth works just as well over clothing if exposing the skin isn&#x27;t possible or desired.  Machine washable and dryable with no degredation in performance that I have found.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a color choice but I got red.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> People like&lt;br /&gt;It helps  my hands a lot&lt;br /&gt;I can create more a smooth experience for client with their clothes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t like the colour at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I missed a spot where it said the Colors to chose from.&lt;br /&gt;As red is my least favourite colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway great invention !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review in my life.  This Magic Massager Cloth is AMAZING.  I bought one for my father who has alzheimers.  It helps relax him at night.  When the caregivers tried it on him, they all had to have one too.  Not only does it give an incredibly relaxing massage, it saves wear and tear on the massagers hands and joints.  You&#x27;ve just got to try it to believe it.  I gave one to my father-in-law who has lung cancer.  He leaves it under his shirt and massages his stomach.  He&#x27;s said it&#x27;s the best treatment out there.  I never could have believed how wonderful this Magic Massager Cloth was unless I tried it for myself.  Please don&#x27;t cheat yourself and overlook this product.  I can&#x27;t believe that one person could have rated this bad.  You OWE it to yourself to try this.  It will be the one spluge you won&#x27;t regreat.</li>
    <li> Really like these cloths. Only downfall is that you cannot pick the color. I really don&#x27;t care for the color green, abd thats exactly what I received.</li>
    <li> Makes chair massage easier glide over other cloth. Love It</li>
    <li> Perfect for chair massage! You could make it at home but the time it takes to do it you could do a chair massage and pay for it instead.  Add this to your cart!</li>
    <li> No messy lotions or oils, just place the cloth on the area (with clothes on or without) and massage.... so easy and feels very good. A good answer for a Dr.&#x27;s orders to massage a area for a year, which I was dreading, but now it will be alright.</li>
    <li> This is so great, they come in different sizes&lt;br /&gt;I do all sorts of massage and this makes it easier and feels good to the client, over their clothing, not to be used on skin due to cross contamination of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make my own in the future, it&#x27;s really simple just two pieces of satin sewn together but done in a way that it is sown satin  side to satin side inside so it glides well.</li>
    <li> I am loving using this cloth, it works wonders when I&#x27;m doing chair massages, I love that I don&#x27;t feel the wrong side of the cloth, so the slip is excellent, I only wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so much, $10 for shipping I thought was a bit much, so it ends up as $30 for the cloth. would like to be able to afford another one, but the price is holding me back</li>
    <li> Just as good as any massage media, without the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do Oriental Massage, or are doing chair massage at an event, you don&#x27;t use lotion or oil.  The Magic Massage Cloth is awesome.  It actually DEEPENS the pressure, for whatever reason...probably because of less friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned about the cloth while doing a corporate event in SC, from an LMBT with Massage Envy.  His hands were baby soft, lotion free, and he was doing excellent work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing little gadget to have.</li>
    <li> This product makes it a lot easier to massage when someone is clothed. Chair massages are more effective and not so tiring. It is worth the money although I could probably make it myself.</li>
    <li> I have the large sized magic massager and it allows me to give a much better chair massage to my clients.  With this tool, I can use my forearm to massage the shoulder/scapula area in the chair and the clients are so much happier then getting just the hand/fist massage.  It took a massage or two to get used to it, but now I don&#x27;t want to do a chair massage without it!  It is also great for some clients who want a full body massage but want to stay clothed.  It glides over the clothes and let&#x27;s me give a good quality massage.  Highly reccomended by me, though I&#x27;m not sure how the smaller one would work, since I&#x27;ve only used the large size.</li>
    <li> Whoever figured this out deserves the Pulitzer Peace Prize! Glides over clothing like oil, but no mess. Portable, take it everywhere. Anyone can use this, you don&#x27;t have to be a massage therapist, instructions are included.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! Highly recommended! Might buy another!</li>
    <li> This massage cloth is awesome, more than you can realize until you try it.  Both my husband and I love it.  Works just as it advertises!  Well worth the small investment to purchase. Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn K&lt;br /&gt;Waterbury, CT</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist for 13 years, I never did many chair massages until recently.  After a 6 hr day of chair massages, my fingers and forearms were killing me.  So I decided to try this thing for my next chair massage event.  THIS THING WAS AMAZING!  I think I may order another one to keep on hand for those unexpected &amp;#34;can you massage this for me&amp;#34; moments.  I think I&#x27;m also going to utilize it for glut work when clients are not comfortable exposed.</li>
    <li> A career saving innovation! I  do lots of chair massage and this is a joy for my clients and a hand/arm saver for me. Will definitely purchase another. 10 stars for the seller&#x27;s fast delivery!.... Review edit 10/11/16. Still have the cloth, washed weekly with similar fabrics, air dry and it&#x27;s as good as it was when I bought it. Is truly worth it. 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟!</li>
    <li> The Magic Massager Cloth works great for doing masssage over clothing, without wearing out your hands.  Great intro. to massage for the client that has never had a massage.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!</li>
    <li> Great for doing chair massages at events!</li>
    <li> I AM BLOWN AWAY!! I bought this on a whim, I liked what people had to say and as a massage therapist I&#x27;m always looking for new tools to improve my service.&lt;br /&gt;This little cloth is AMAZING, such a simple idea but so incredibly useful. It gives you the glide that oil on skin has but on a clothed client. The only downside there is is that you have to pick up and move the cloth as you go along the body, not a huge problem and easily workable. I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but I needed other LMT&#x27;s out there to know what an incredible tool this is for your practice. Especially for those you use chair massage as a way to attract clientele. I have shown this to all my LMT  and physical therapist co-workers, they are all buying them now. Also this seller expedited my shipping from 5-7 days to 2 day for nothing. Can&#x27;t express how happy I am with my purchase, will be buying more as gifts for other LMT&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I work for a PT and work on people fully clothed. It works very well.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding!!!! I bought this as a gift. Now I need to buy my own. It literally glides over not only your skin but your clothes, too!!  It definitely eases the work you have to exude in giving a massage. 5 stars for both the giver and the receiver of the massage!</li>
