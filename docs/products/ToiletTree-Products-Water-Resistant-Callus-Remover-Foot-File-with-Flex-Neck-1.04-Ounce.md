<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using the ToiletTree callus remover foot file this week and I love it! I get callus on my feet from wearing high hells and they are not attractive. The callus remover worked great on filing down the callus as well as removing dead , dry skin on my heels. The best feature is that it turns off automatically if you press too hard and that stops any irritation from happening. It is small enough to hold in one hand and use in the shower. I alps appreciate that it comes with the 2 batteries needed. Bring on the sandals !</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I have been wanting one of these for quite some time now and I could not be happier with this product. It works wonders at removing dry dead skin and leaves your feet feeling amazingly soft! I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I used it right after my shower and it left my heals so soft they were shiny ;)  The only think I didn&#x27;t like was my feet are ticklish so I had to go lightly over the middle of my foot.  Followed us with peppermint lotion and it feels just like I had a pedicure at home!</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this worked even better than I thought it would! Usually items like this seem gimicky and sound like they will do amazing things then end up not. This callus remover did exactly as it said it would! The rotating head is good and does a fantastic job of removing dead skin. You do have to have a light touch with it as it will stop the rotations if you press too hard. It&#x27;s a safety feature. I like that the head is tough enough to get at the calluses, but gentle enough to use all over the feet without and scraping. I&#x27;m very happy to have this and will be using it all the time as sandal season approaches!</li>
    <li> It works good. It is a process that requires repeated uses to achieve optimal effects.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it seemed to work pretty well, my only complaint would be that you have to go over the rougher spots quite a few times and i would suggest not pressing down to firm or else it will bogg down, all in all it was a pretty good product, it came with batteries, I was kind of confused on how to open it for the battery compartment though.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing little tool and does exactly what it is made for, it comes ready to use out of the box which just makes everything so much more convenient. It comes with the battery and replacement head. I use this on my boyfriends feet and it did a wonderful job.The instructions are easy to follow and use can see a change with just one use. This is something I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love how great this Toilet Tree Callus Remover Foot File with Flex Neck works at removing calluses and making me feet feel and look great! I&#x27;ve never imagined something so simple to use to be so effective. There is no work involved just let this handy tool do the work for you. You will be amazed at how well the Toilet Tree Callus Remover Foot File with Flex Neck works in just seconds giving you peace of mind knowing your feet will look fabulous in any open shoe. Go ahead and show off your feet. people will want to know how you get them to look so good.</li>
    <li> Removed most of my big toe calluses in one sitting! I am so impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my ankles rotate inwards when I walk or stand, I have large calluses on my big toes. This removed them almost completely in one sitting!! It took a bit of time, but that&#x27;s alright. Previous to this, I had been trying to remove them with a small callus remover that you use in the shower. But I&#x27;d never had much luck. I&#x27;ve even tried the callus shavers that actually peal off parts of the callus, but they would leave my feet raw and in pain. This callus remover gently removed my calluses and left them feeling soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did they remove my big toe calluses, but it also removed the calluses on my pinkie toes. Plus, I used it on my heel, where I have rough skin and it left them incredibly soft! I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with the callus remover, batteries, an extra head replacement, and a small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the extra head doesn&#x27;t have a cap on it, like the callus remover itself has. I would love it if it came with two safety caps so that rough head doesn&#x27;t catch on anything while it&#x27;s in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please let me know. I really do appreciate getting feedback about what I have written. I wholeheartedly believe that all reviews should be open and honest, regardless of how the product was obtained: be it bought at a store, bought at Amazon, gotten for free or at a discount. In this case I received this product at a discount in exchange for sharing my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Have really bad callus&#x27;s from being on my feet all day, would manually file them so when I got a promotional code to review it I jumped on it immediately.  I was a little unsure as this just stuck me as a &amp;#34;Seen in TV&amp;#34; product that would break right away.  However I was completely blown away when trying it.  My feet feels a lot softer and the best feature is it doesn&#x27;t allow you to put too much pressure on your feet.  This may seem like a negative at first, but if you are a compulsive filer like me, it&#x27;s a life saver prevents your feet from feeling raw afterwards.</li>
    <li> got this product and i love it, works well and using it already, i use as my personal , i recommended to my husband and i want to buy it again.</li>
    <li> My feet are sensitive, so this product is very good for me, not too harsh, takes a little longer for more dry areas, but gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with my ToiletTree Electric Callus Remover. My feet were always rough to the point that I spent the last half of every shower buffing with a file or pumice stone.  I even hesitated to get pedicures as I didn&#x27;t want the nail tech to have to deal with my sad feet.  I ordered the  Toilet Tree Electric Callus Remover not expecting much, and was blown away by how well it works and how fast it is. It arrived quickly, and was packaged with 2 batteries, the callus remover, 2 roller heads a cleaning brush and protective cover for the head.  The directions were clear and easy to follow.  The callus remover was to be used for 2-3 seconds at a time. I followed the directions, and my feet were baby soft. It took just a few passes, and the calluses are gone. Completely gone. I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am about this. All I can say is this is a great product. I am planning on buying one for my son- he keeps asking to use mine, and this is like a toothbrush where sharing isn&#x27;t recommended and I want  to keep mine all to myself.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. Get you one.</li>
    <li> When I seen this product I knew I just had to have it! I have suffered all my life with rough feet and some of the manual foot files out there just don&#x27;t cut it.When I tried this handy dandy tool out I was so happy about the results.For being a tool that runs on a power source to file your feet,it sounds like it could be painful but it is definitely not! It wears away at the dead,dry.flaky skin quickly and leaves behind baby smooth skin! My feet had never felt like that until I used this device.I highly recommend this Callus Remover Foot File  to anyone with callused up, dry,flaky feet.It works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
    <li> On time delivery and performs as advertised</li>
    <li> Finally I don&#x27;t have to run out for a pedicure every other week!  This tool does wonders!  It is very easy to use.  Works great on my callused heels!  Removes the dead skin as well.  It is flexible so it contours to all of your curves on your feet too.  I love that it is water resistant so I can use it in my shower.  Replaceable heads also make this a great product and reduces waste.  Highly recommend this product for men and women too!</li>
    <li> I have used many Callus Removers. This one is by far the best one! My feet have never felt so smooth. With the flexible neck, it makes getting the curves of the heel, convenient. Great product from a great company!</li>
    <li> I have used this for several weeks and it is great at removing dead skin from my feet.  Looks like I just had a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic on this item, but it works amazing!! It came with batteries it was very easy to use. It made my skin feel silky smooth. I definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This callous remover is powerful and does a wonderful job on my feet. I am very impressed!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing I got to review it for free but that does not reflect the truth of my review.  I have always had callus and rough spots on my heels of my feet.  I tried everything from lotions to other tools.  They all failed.  This was so amazingly easy to use and works so great.  I had smooth heels in no time.  I love it and am going to buy one for my mom .</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! After receiving I was so excited to try and this callus remover did not disappoint! Never have I had such success with dry skin and callus removal. Usually I have to pay extra at the pedicure salon to achieve the same results. And the results last for a while, so no need to do every day. I could not recommend this enough and I am so glad to have in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I have a couple  calluses on my foot that keep coming back &amp; are painful too. I&#x27;ve tried remover creams &amp; patches but they relieve the problem temporarily. The Toilet Tree callus remover  really solves the problem well. I work a lot barefoot,practicing martial arts &amp; sometimes the corns/calluses make it painful to exercise/pivot on my feet. I used the callus remover to buff away &amp; soften a particularly painful &amp; difficult to treat callus in between the toes and within 2 days the callus was gone! The package contains 1 callus remover with head, 1 replacement head, 2 AA batteries, and 1 cleaning brush. It&#x27;s well designed, easy to grip &amp; work with,also easy to clean since its waterproof! .&lt;br /&gt;Callus was removed like white powder. My feet became smoother, softer, &amp; less painful.&lt;br /&gt;The callus remover has a flexible neck  to easily reach every angle of the foot. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when the skin is buffed away like a fine powder.  The product seems well made, durable and of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the performance and quality of this callus remover &amp; would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!!!  My feet are so silky smooth......what is so awesome is you can do it in the shower and the price you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this, hearing it was better than the Amope. However, when I received it, I was seriously let down.  It has no power to it. I touch it lightly to my skin, not even pressing,  and it stops turning. I wrote the company explaining my concerns that maybe something was defective with it. I even tried different batteries. I never heard one word from the company. I should probably just try to return it because it was a waste of money. Should have spent the extra and went with Amope.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to have at home to use between professional pedicures or if you like to do your own pedicures.  It definitely works to smooth out calluses and rough skin on your feet.  It does take some time, and you have to move the remover numerous times over the affected area at all different angles.  But since the Callus Remover is battery operated, there is no elbow grease involved.  I really like that the batteries were included in the package so it&#x27;s out of the box and ready to use.</li>
    <li> I love this little device so much.  It worked like a dream and now my feet are smooth and soft just in time for summer weather.  It was really nice for the company to include an extra head and cleaning brush and even batteries so you can use it right away.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of calluses without all the work of manually shaving  them away.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best thing my feet has ever met! WOW! They haven&#x27;t looked this good in years! All my friends are getting them.</li>
    <li> I really do like this callus remove rand it does work to some degree, however I wish it had a little more power so you could press on it. Don&#x27;t think it really needs the tilt head part. It does work though and my feet feel much softer.</li>
    <li> This callus remover foot file made my feet and heels much softer and smoother. It is easy to use and comes with an extra grinding head.&lt;br /&gt;It is far superior to other foot files! My feet are now ready for summer sandals! A+++++</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, remove callus with ease and very easy to use. Keeps my feet looking smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  It&#x27;s easy to use and not rough on my feet.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I use something on my feet that didn&#x27;t hurt but really work. My heels are soft and the thick skin gone. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I returned it.  The 2 roller it came with have same size of grits, too way course. Although the roller grind the callous, my foot felt rough. I still have to use another product, a file with fine grit, to make my foot feel smooth. My review would have been a lot different if this product came with a course grit roller and a fine grit roller.</li>
    <li> the product arrived on time and is exactly what it was described it to be in the ad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with dry skin as well as after shower.  It feels comfortable to hold and comfortable on the skin, and it&#x27;s easy to use. It does a great job at removing callused skin, but it seems to take a long time.  In the past I&#x27;ve removed calluses with a pumice stone, and that takes about 5 minutes.  Getting the calluses off with this device takes at least three times as long to get to the same smoothness as with the pumice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be helpful if it had some sort of way to collect the dead skin as it&#x27;s working.  Instead, the dust settles on the device, and I frequently blow or dust it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider this a luxury product--nice to have, especially when you have the time for pampering, but not something I would use every week.</li>
    <li> I have used other callous remover products, mostly manual never with a battery.  The manual remover was always a very scary product to use because they hurt and I was cut a couple of times from them.  Since I had a bad experience I was very hesitant about purchasing this product, but flip flop season was coming up fast and my feet were scary.  I decided to try this product because the reviews were great, the price was appealing and hopefully my experience would not be worse that what I was already used to.  I LOVE this product. There was no pain, the product removed all the dead skin leaving my feet looking and feeling soft and smooth.  I am able to do my own pedicures at home with this product, which has saved me a lot of money and they look like they have been done professionally.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to beautify their feet at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I have been testing this for a couple weeks. Let me tell you. It has changed my life. I have always been ashamed of showing my feet do to a health issue cause sever cracked skin. This product has changed my life. I absolutely love it. So easy to use. Its amazing.</li>
    <li> This does nothing for my callous! Totally useless! Waste of money</li>
    <li> I am very particular at my at-home pedicures, so I was very excited to order this callus remover. Not only does it remove calluses, but it always wipes away dry/dead skin in seconds. Within minutes I have soft, summer-ready feet and now I&#x27;m excited to go out to the lake, wear flip flops and cute sandals, without feeling self-conscious about my feet because they look and feel great. I love that it comes with an extra roller. I haven&#x27;t needed to switch put yet, as the one I&#x27;m using is still work quite effectively even have several uses. Just like the description says, it is powerful, yet 100% painless, as well as highly effective. This is something I would absolutely purchase as gifts as well. Everyone should have one of these, it&#x27;s truly a great product from a very reputable brand. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and highly recommend this brand over others. No more pumice stones that fall apart. I&#x27;ll simply purchase extra rollers when the time comes. A major bonus, in my opinion, is that it comes with the batteries. Very handy!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it removed my callus and leaves me with a healthy smooth looking finish. I was amazed at how my heel looked, cant wait to put my flip flops on this summer.  I would definitely recommend this product to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month now and very pleased. I purchased some replacements, although I hadn&#x27;t needed to replace the first one yet.  There is a replacement included in the box. Well worth the money I paid</li>
    <li> This is packaged like something you would buy at Bed, Bath and Beyond, very well merchandised. Easy to install AA batteries (2 included). Once the batteries are installed and you turn it on, the roller head starts going. You can see the dead skin just flying off your feet. Warning, it can get a bit messy so do this over a towel. It takes the rough skin off the heels and also grinds down the callus that is on the ball of my feet. A lot easier to use than metal scrapers. Once done, I wiped my feet off with a damp, warm face towel and applied my favorite lotion. My feet felt silky smooth. This device is easy to clean. Take the brush, included with the device, and brush off the excess dead skin. Then run the roller head under water and turn the device on for about 10 to 15 seconds. Dry with a paper towel. It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: It works but it takes a while. I guess it depends how your thick is your callous and mine is pretty much a Sahara Dessert rough and dry. It took me two session (within a day, 30 minute each heel) to get the desired effect on the photo. I like it and I know if I keep it up, keep using it on my daily feet care, I&#x27;d be getting almost to no callous in no time!</li>
    <li> Love this.  Not too abrasive like other products of this type.  Works very quickly and leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> This Callus Remover by ToiletTree is awesome! I was so embarrassed about my rough feet. Even when I&#x27;d go get a professional salon pedicure, my feet were still a mess. Tons of dead skin and calluses. This has been a miracle for me! Those cheese grater things were awful. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I had cut myself going to town trying to get these huge calluses down. Not any more! Now it&#x27;s effortless. You really just roll the thing around and it does all the work! I am so happy with the quality and performance! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> Exceptional!  Would recommend, absolutely.  Easy to use with great results.</li>
    <li> This is great. I got a chance to test this and I can happily give it a 5 star rating. I have needed something for my callous that I seem to get on my foot and this does the trick. It left me feeling soft and smooth. I also like how it stops if you press too hard, so no chance of hurting yourself.</li>
    <li> I paid actual money for this - unlike most of the reviews here which were given the item for free in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, I have 3 other types of foot scrapers. Living in Arizona, if I neglect my feet and wear flip flops for a few months, my heels get all crispy. Nothing extreme, but not very sexy. I&#x27;ve used the ped-egg mostly - it works fine, and keeps the foot Parmesan mostly contained. The only problem is that it sort of takes forever to grind em down, and you&#x27;re moving your arm the whole time so it gets tedious and tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have an expensive Clarisonic Pedi thing that&#x27;s rechargeable - my problem with this is that foot Parm goes everywhere, and it stops moving if I touch it to my foot with any sort of pressure at all. So it&#x27;s just really slow... and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with this review item, I bought a top rated microplane foot rasp... it&#x27;s a cheese grater basically. It works a little better than a ped egg, but it&#x27;s way messy - foot sawdust everywhere. Also, you gotta move your arm around and saw at your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Flex Neck Callus Remover because it had a 5 star review. My 2 star isn&#x27;t going to change that, but hopefully someone sees this and thinks twice. Does it grind away your rough foot skin? I suppose it does sorta. The flex neck is pointless because if you use enough pressure to even start to bend it, the file stops moving. I mean, 2 AA batteries aren&#x27;t gonna be enough to power this thing to actually do a good job. That said, it does kind of work. It&#x27;s easily the messiest of the bunch though. Instead of a pile beneath you, it&#x27;s throwing foot dust in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is decent, and while it all feels sort of cheap, it isn&#x27;t completely useless. I would have probably given it a 2.5 or a 3, but all the ace reviews paid for with a freebie or discount combined with the fact that it&#x27;s just as weak as anything else I&#x27;ve tried means it deserves a 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to get one of these grinders that&#x27;s borderline dangerous. I don&#x27;t want to sit there gently touching this thing to my foot for 25 minutes while it slowly takes away all these layers. I want to get something that&#x27;ll zap it off in like 2 minutes tops.</li>
    <li> Perfect item for your overworked feet. If you wear sandals, this item is for you. The seller was extremely fast to ship and had great communication.</li>
    <li> Its very good I happy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I did not expect the item to remove everything on my heels the first time. It did a fair job initially. The second time I used the item I noticed the item slowed down faster. I don&#x27;t think the battery life is going to be good. The other thing that I saw was gear rotating the head was plastic. Knowing a bit about motors, gears and plastics I am not optimistic about the life of this item. However, I could be wrong. I am going to keep the item and see how it long the life is. I do think it is WAY overpriced for a plastic item (I can tell the plastic is not even a high grade plastic).</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product. It&#x27;s flip flop weather here in Texas and that means your feet must be perfect. I didn&#x27;t even have to go to a salon to get my feet in tip top shape!</li>
    <li> worked great! i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;ll need it again for a while, but it did the job with no fuss.</li>
    <li> Received at discount for a review, great product my feet were rough now smooth and my callus is gone. What an exceptional product now i can wear sandals again. Ty</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!! it does all the work for you. Because I wear a lot of opened shoes in the summer my feet get so dry sometimes they even split open. This tool is so easy to use and it really does the job smoothing out the callus and making my feet feel so soft. You would think that you would need to apply hard pressure to get the tool to do it&#x27;s job but it is literally just the opposite.  You barely have to apply pressure and the roller takes away all that dead skin. It&#x27;s amazing and gives you a even better sense of accomplishment buy watching. I am simply in aw and grateful to have purchased this tool. Now I can have smooth heels all summer long.</li>
    <li> This product is great for smoothing out rough spots I tend to get in between trips to get pedicures! No more snagging my feet on the bed covers (*shudder* HATE that!!) Easy to use, gets the job done! What more could you want? Now to convince my hubby to try it on his feet... ;)</li>
    <li> This is a a really nice callus remover and it works perfectly. I like that it isn&#x27;t bulky and it fits in my hand well .You don&#x27;t need to  use a lot of pressure on this just turn it on and glide it across your feet and it does the job for you. It is very powerful and does a nice job and I love the results of how smooth my feet became after use. I received this  product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
    <li> This item is great! It does use 2 AA batteries but they are included (BONUS!!) and it also has an auto stop if you press too hard with it. I have had a pedicure done and I hate the scrubbing they do to remove your calluses. This thing is so gentle! Its just a tickle on your feet and is fun to use. My feet are nice and smooth now!</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Durable</li>
    <li> Love this foot file !! Easy to use, does a wonderful job! Smooth feet now.</li>
    <li> Love it. My wife loves this thing.</li>
    <li> With sandal season here, my feet dry are cracking.  I have tried many products that just don&#x27;t work. This callus remover works amazing. My feet are smooth and ready to be shown off.</li>
    <li> Excellent - note that if you buy this brand, other refills do not work, you might want to put a brand that they sell at a local store, pedi brand, etc.  I assume they are all alike, but they work VERY well. When you get refills for this brand, you are forced to purchase via Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Callus Remover Foot file was delivered protectively packaged and exactly as described on product page.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the tool in a promotion for testing and review.  The package comes with a callous remover with&lt;br /&gt;one head attached to the tool,  a second head for the callus remover, a small brush to clean the head of your&lt;br /&gt;callus remover, and two AA Batteries.  Very easy to set up... simply install the included batteries and turn the&lt;br /&gt;power switch on.  I recommend placing a towel or cloth of some sort under your feet to catch the shavings,&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, be prepared to sweep after use.  The tool is waterproof, so very easy to clean, and you can also use&lt;br /&gt;on wet feet.  Especially convenient if you want to &#x27;soak&#x27; first.  We highly recommend this callus remover !!</li>
    <li> I love to wear sandals.  If calluses and dead skin on my feet were a commodity, I would be very wealthy because my feet grow this stuff so fast.  When the skin on my feet is cracked, or the calluses are bulging out, I can&#x27;t wear my sandals.  Being from Florida, wearing sandals is a year round thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little foot file gently sands down the calluses and gets rid of the cracked skin on my heels and undersides of my feet.  It gets into the curves of my big toes a lot easier than the ped-egg and doesn&#x27;t damage good skin, because it doesn&#x27;t rip the skin.  It gently sands the skin off my feet.  If I use it in one place too long, the skin gets hot, so I move it around quite a bit.  It takes longer than the ped-egg (because of the tough calluses), but it is more gentle on my feet, and I don&#x27;t have to buff it afterwards because it buffs as it removes the skin.  When I am finished, I just moisten the skin and put Vaseline Intensive Care Oil on my feet and they look really nice.  Oh yeah, I also have to clean up all the dead skin from the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this foot file over any foot file product I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Works well, just don&#x27;t use much pressure.  A very light touch is best.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of getting rid of rough skin.</li>
    <li> This is by far THE BEST callus remover I have ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERY : faster than expected, 48hours, can&#x27;t top that! It came in a small Amazon box, in which there was the Callus Remover&#x27;s box. In this box you have:&lt;br /&gt;1. The callus remover with 1 head on&lt;br /&gt;2. A second head for the callus remover&lt;br /&gt;3. A small brush to clean the head of your callus remover&lt;br /&gt;4. 2 AA Batteries&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN : It looks exactly as pictures, I think it looks pretty cute and the design is simple and cute! It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE USING IT: I analyzed the product - nothing was broken, all I had to do was to put the batteries in, (there is an explanation on how to open the callus remover in the package but I did not see the explanation on how to put the batteries in therefore I added a picture of how the batteries should be positioned)&lt;br /&gt;WHILE USING IT: I have tried it on clean dry feet as well as after doing a &#x27;Foot Spa&#x27; while my feet were still wet. I does not need to be pushed, it should all be gentle. Wether o dry or wet feet, it was painless. I was slightly tickled when it reached the middle of my foot, but I&#x27;m just extremely ticklish. (You will see the powder off your feet when using it on dry feet, if you don&#x27;t have anything under your feet you might need to vacuum a bit)&lt;br /&gt;AFTER USING IT: I used it twice in the past week (once on wet feet, once on dry) My feet are so so sooooooft !! I&#x27;m excited to get me new sandals and show my feet to the world, because I can!&lt;br /&gt;As I said earlier, this is THE BEST and my favorite callus remover !! I definitely recommend it to anyone that wants soft feet all year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also added a picture of the callus remover on my iPad Mini so you can picture the size a bit.</li>
    <li> It works great. I have been researching for something like this for awhile.</li>
    <li> My product was replaced and the new one works great .Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the second foot file that I have tried and it is awful. They proclaim a flexible head but you cannot even put the weight of this unit on your foot before it stops working. I knew I was in trouble when I opened the box and it had dollar store batteries in it. Also the rollers were very ineffective, they hardly removed anything. Mind you I do not have rough calluses either. The quality of this product was like it was a free promotion at a trade show. I bought it because of the positive reviews but now I wonder where those reviews came from because they certainly were not talking about this unit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it has enough power for what I need. It is supposed to be a foot file and unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have enough of what it needs to do the job.</li>
    <li> This callus remover is great!! I was shopping and almost bought the more expensive nationally advertised one and decided to give this one a try based on reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did - I saved $10 and have a little machine that works just as I hoped it would. It is so easy to run over your feel and the improvement is immediate - just add some lotion and your feet are smooth as silk.  Use it at bed time and add a pair of socks and the results are really good.  Glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great purchase!  Easy to handle and does a great job on rough patches of skin.  Great price and well worth it.</li>
    <li> This works great! It is easy to clean and so much easier to get all of the hard places on the foot. It is easy to use and clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> Keep in mind that the callouses on your feet did not happen overnight. This product will not make your feet look perfect in 10 minutes, nor does It say it will. It&#x27;s a process, slow and steady. My feet have some pretty heavy callouses, I used it for a few minutes for 4 days after my morning shower and I have seen a major improvement. It is designed to slowly remove the dead skin. You cannot put a lot of pressure on it or it will stop. It is a safe product in that regard. Take your time and it works great.</li>
    <li> I got this product free for trying it out and I am glad I did! I always get rough feet in the summer mostly a lot, and I used the callus remover and it works wonders. I love it! My feet are nice and smooth after use, can&#x27;t get any better then this.</li>
    <li> WOW!  this definitely did the trick!  Used it before going away on vacation to the beach and felt very comfortable going barefoot or wearing sandals without being embarrassed about cracked heels !  Would probably use it at least 2 or 3 times a month to just keep my heels looking healthy.  Have used it 4 times already and batteries are just now starting to slow.  Also used Blue Goo foot softener with it as well - amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is just awesome!  I wanted one similar to this for Christmas and this one beats it hands down. It is simple to use and really gets the job done quickly.  I have used with both dry and wet heels and it works without hurting. This Toilet Tree Callus Remover has a replacement grinding head with a flexible neck allowing you to get to those rough hard to reach spots.  I am handing down my Amope to my grand daughter and keeping this one for myself.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my callus feet, it made them smooth and pretty just in time for spring weather. This is an excellent product from ToiletTree and excellent doing business with them.</li>
    <li> I love that his doesn&#x27;t need cords and can easily be transported. It&#x27;s battery operated, rechargable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a fleecy head that doesn&#x27;t allow you to push hard enough to cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Yes if you press too hard it stops, but if it didn&#x27;t it could harmful.&lt;br /&gt;I found that using it dry made my heels softer than directly out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I recorded this item with a discount but me reviews are honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. I have been using this on my dogs recently and found that it helps when their pads are really rough and abrasive and it also heps to file their nails!</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use, certainly, and I can&#x27;t imagine the more expensive models doing a better job.</li>
    <li> I am beyond thrilled with this product. I have been wanting to try a callus remover but was hesitant to try one because they can get a bit pricey. After deciding to try the ToiletTree Callus Remover, I am so glad I did. It is very easy to use, and works wonders. I have tried pumice stones, the little foot things that look like a cheese grater, files, and other products on my heels. I had not found a product that worked until I tried this one. I could tell an incredible difference after just the first use. I also like that it comes with a replacement head, batteries, and a little brush- so everything is ready to go when you recieve the packge. I would give this 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> I was so anxious for my new ToiletTree Callus Remover to arrive.  I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out!  Shipping was fast, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long.  Once I opened the nicely packaged box, I was very impressed on how well made the Callus Remover and Accessories are.  It has an extra grinding roller head and batteries to boot!  What a plus!  The Callus Remover was so very easy to hold and maneuver.  Within minutes my rough callused heels were so soft!  I couldn&#x27;t  believe it!  I am so happy with the results!  This is truly the best Callus Remover I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Absolutely hands down one of the best pampering tools Ive ever owned! I received this in nice packaging came with a brush, batteries, as well as one replacement head. I&#x27;ve tried on both wet and dry skin and it works wonderfully. My feet are abused I don&#x27;t do socks much and I am on my feet all day every day. My feet feel clean refreshed and fabulous! I am so happy to have it in my life now I am going to buy some as gifts next holiday season! The only addition I would add to any of this is some type of bag to put it in when not in use. I use the box but something less bulky would be nice!</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully! I used it on my feet which are always tough and it gave me that just got a pedicure feel all from home. It was easy to install the batteries and use. I would purchase for gift sets. This is a wonderful product and works VERY well!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I tried it and it made my feet baby smooth! I knew the real test would be on my husband. He has real hard callus&#x27; on his heels, and I just had to let him try it. He tried it, and loved it too! It made his feet so smooth, he kept making me feel them, lol. It works wonderful, easy, quiet, and no pain at all. Just turn it on, and gently move it around on the problem areas, and the callus&#x27; just melt away! I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a cure for those problem, cracked, callus feet. Absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry cracked feet especially during the winter. I must admit I don&#x27;t moisturize my feet as well as I should and I find that I have to wear socks to bed so that my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t feel the roughness of my feet! Now that it is warm again, I am paying the price for my laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used in conjunction with coconut oil, this remover had helped TREMENDOUSLY with achieving smooth heels once again. I no longer have to wear socks to bed and I can play &amp;#34;footsie&amp;#34; with my boyfriend without worrying if I will scratch him with my rough feeling feet!</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome!!!! It&#x27;s so gentle. I had one of those pedi-egg and it made my feet bleed, because I didn&#x27;t realize that I was doing it too hard or too long. This stops when you put too much pressure. My feet is so smooth now. Plus the vibration of it feels like a little massager. I loved it so much, I have one to my phone for Mother&#x27;s Day! :)</li>
    <li> I received my Callus Remover Foot File and have been in a sense of amazement since. I have used it not only on my own feet, but also on my husbands who works out doors on his feet all day long. We were both amazed and slightly grossed out by how much dead, gross skin we had to lose. On the plus side, our feet are so smooth, and feel much better. This is a wonderful tool to have for the bathroom. Everybody should be using this at least once a week to keep your feet soft and smooth. It really makes a difference in how you feel, your shoes feel, and with a little lotion afterwards you will have that soft baby skin again. It takes the callus completely off. I had previously used a razor to try to get the grossness off my feet and am so grateful that I now have this awesome tool to use and no more need to shave them off. This is much easier, more convenient and so easy to use. You will be just as thrilled as I am with this purchase. Give it a shot and see for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I bought a similar product, by another brand, last year and while it worked some, it definitely did not do what it claimed, but with Summer fast approaching and my feet still looking rough and cracked, I jumped on the opportunity to try this product from ToiletTree and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It worked great from the first time I tried it. My heels that were so rough it was embarrassing, are now perfectly smooth! I would definitely recommend this callus remover to others!</li>
    <li> This callus remover is definitely a must have! I used it on my foot which does have a callus and it broke it down very well after just the first time using it.The callus remover is very gentle on your skin specially since you don&#x27;t have to put too much force into it,even if you do the head will stop spinning. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when I use it at all and actually feels pretty nice! I love that it comes with an extra head so that it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexible head is also very neat as it&#x27;ll move in the direction that you want it to. The callus remover is very sturdy and nicely made.I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now and it&#x27;s actually keeping my stubborn callus&#x27;s away. My feet are so much softer and smoother then they were before I got this callus remover. I absolutely LOVE this and everyone should have one to keep their feet feeling and looking beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  It left my feet feeling nice and smooth and required no work on my part, which I love.  The toilet tree brand is a reliable brand and their products are durable and well made.  This is a great product to own with sandal season upon us!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry and cracked heels for a long time, and it has been painful, but mostly embarrassing to say the least.  I don&#x27;t normally like to go out in sandals or show my feet.  I have tried many different moisturizers and scrubbers, but nothing has done the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree Electric Callus remover has changed the way I look and feel about my feet!  First, it is so easy to use, and the removal of callus does not cause pain.  It is very gently yet effective tool and has removed all of my dry and cracked skin on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it has a replacement head as well as it&#x27;s battery operated without wiring mess.  My favorite time of using the Electric Calllus Remover is during the shower, and it is totally water resistant, and that makes it much easier for my callus to be removed when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer embarrassed to show my feet, and I have actually started to wear sandals (which I never liked wearing because of how horribly dry and cracked my heels used to look).  Now I can finally enjoy wearing sandals, or even go bare feet with confidence!</li>
    <li> I definitely think that this is the dupe for Amop&amp;eacute;, and it is sooo much cheaper. It delivers the same experience, if not, better. It comes with a spare head and a cleaning brush for our convience. It does really work in scrubbing and taking off those calluses in your foot or hands. My husband is a computer engineer and he always use computers everyday, he got a calluse on his right hand as a result of his everyday repetitive job. I tried using this gadget to remove his calluse and bam, it did. It worked really well and it isn&#x27;t painful at all (in case some of you might be wondering). The gadget is also very small and compact, that it can fit inside a woman&#x27;s purse. It only needs two AA batteries to work. Overall this is highly recommended, and it is very affordable. I purchased this using a promo code for review.</li>
    <li> After 2 days, it clears my doubt .  I  wished would have bought this long ago.  My heel is soft and I felt 20 years younger right away.  The only downside is product shipped out from china and took 2 weeks to arrive.  But it is well worth the wait , and it come with a spare roller.</li>
    <li> I was not sure I would use this.  I get regular pedicures, but lately, my feet have started getting rougher sooner than I&#x27;d like.  I purposefully by passed my monthly pedi when I ordered this - may as well give it a real trial, right?  I am absolutely in love with this thing!  First time I used it, my feet were so smooth - better than after I have gotten a pedicure. You don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure, just let the machine do all the work.  Only takes a minute to get the hang of it.  My only complaint is that it sounds so much like a dentists drill...small price to pay.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> awesome packaging also gives you the batteries you need to run it,,,, works well</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It gently and easily removes callus buildup with regular use.  I have been using this product for about a month now and can see noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging and also everything included in this. It works really well and really fast and super east to clean! the batteries last long and are easy to insert. my feet were more than awful and now are almost baby bottom soft!</li>
    <li> Seems like most of the reviewers received this gratis.  I on the other hand paid for mine.  I like to wear my Chaco sandals but after a while I build up huge calluses.  After doing some research I went for this model.  I had read about some complaints of not enough power.  Well, if you are using like a belt sander, no it doesn&#x27;t have enough power....but if you use it to remove calluses in a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; manner, it works fine.  It was fairly quick and zero pain.  I&#x27;d suggest rechargeable batteries.  I take off one star for overall build quality.  It looks pretty flimsy and may not last many years, but for the price I think it is worth it.  Cheers!</li>
    <li> Thia is a great product at a affordable price. It is fast works great  and also has no cord. You can take it  on trips or keep at home. I found it easy to use. And I like that its not that large it can fit easily into a make up bag, or shaving kit. It has a removable head so its replaceable. I love the smoothness of my feet.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!  After one use on shower it stopped working!!!</li>
    <li> My and my hubby&#x27;s feet love this! i received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. We are so impressed with this callus remover foot file by Toilet Tree products. my hubby and i have more than normal calluses on our feet from running around and taking care of 6 kids and working that we needed something to relieve the pressure from the calluses on our feet and this tool does the trick...this callus remover foot file comes with the hand held unit and an extra attachment and a brush for cleaning along with the batteries necessary to use the tool. it is very easy to use and gets your foot smooth where your callus was...our only thing we would like is to be able to have an attachment that could go a little faster and harder with pressure of the tool without making it stop...this foot file did an excellent job filing down our calluses on our feet we are very happy...thank you so much</li>
    <li> It gently grinds rough skin down to a fine dust without applying any pressure but it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power.  If you have thick heel skin and are used to using a callus shaver (the razor blade on a handle) this file will not replace it.  It would take an hour to do the same job a shaver does in 5 minutes.  But it does a good job of smoothing the skin after using the shaver.  If you are taking care of the feet of someone who can not feel their feet or is in some way incapacitated, then this is a good choice because it is much less aggressive than even a scrubber and you don&#x27;t risk damaging any healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I just tried out the Electric Callus Remover and I can proudly say that I know a way to get soft callus free feet in minutes at HOME! I can save the money I would be spending at the salon on pedicures on new shoes. The Electric Callus Remover is so easy to use and I can see the old dry skin being removed from my heels as soon as I start to use it. The remover is very light weight and fits nicely in my hand, unlike other products I have tried that leaves my hands aching. Cleaning is simple. After use just brush it off and rinse it under water. Your ready for your next use. It also comes with a plastic head cover so the head doesn’t get damaged while storing. I love that it has a safety feature too, so if I push to hard it will stop rotating, and prevents any damage to my skin. Now I can walk around in sandles without fear of my dry feet anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I did recieve this at a significant discount for review purposes. How ever all opinions are always my own.</li>
    <li> SO easy to use and it works!</li>
    <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.</li>
    <li> I was torn between giving this four or five stars and decided on four because it does work ok, but not without still taking quite a bit of time. For the most part I don&#x27;t have really rough heels. I had a few spots that I wanted to test this on where my shoes rubbed and caused a callus on the sole of my feet. It made the area softer, but I wonder if it would have worked just as well if I had used a manual file. Like I said this does take going over the area several times because the instructions state to use for only 2-3 seconds in the area you are working on. This definitely will save you money over getting a pedicure, but will still require some time. It&#x27;s nice that the package includes an extra head and batteries so you don&#x27;t have to hunt them down and can let someone else try out the unit. Overall it is not bad, but don&#x27;t expect it to work as quickly as you&#x27;ve see in any commercial of similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use this amazing Callus Remover. All you do is insert the batteries and turn it on. Just go over your heels gently and it does wonders getting rid of that dried, callused skin. You don&#x27;t have to press hard for the unit to work and it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use it either. In seconds my heels were smooth and softer. A nice plus with this unit is that you can use it in the shower, because it&#x27;s waterproof! So there&#x27;s no fear of getting it wet. It also has a flexible neck to get in those hard to reach crevices. I&#x27;m really happy with this awesome product! I received complimentary product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Loved it never had anything make my feet feel so good and soft . They are ready for summer and flip flops . Husband used it for calluses on his hands and they haven&#x27;t felt that good in years.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do so good for me.</li>
