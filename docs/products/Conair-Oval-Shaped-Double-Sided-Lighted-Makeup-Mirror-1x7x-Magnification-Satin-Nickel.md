      <li>Glad we bought it.</li>
      <li>Love the lighting and the size of mirror.  </li>
      <li>It was also very light weight and moved too easily</li>
      <li>and I think a pretty fair price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that it is far beyond either of our expectations.</li>
      <li>Love the quality of light.</li>
      <li>She is still quite young but loves to get dressed-up &amp; look very nice just like her Mommy</li>
      <li>Now, I’m smudge free.</li>
      <li>The mirror seems to be made very well and is handy to have.</li>
      <li>improvement from the light provided by overhead lighting in my bathroom.  </li>
      <li>the light is NOT at all \\&quot;hot\\&quot; to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I can make sure I leave the house looking hot.</li>
      <li>So happy I found one, even though it was not new.</li>
      <li>satin nickel finish is great for hiding fingerprints and dust, and I have used it for three months, now, without a single problem or complaint!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good solid piece that stays in place as you adjust the angle.  </li>
      <li>It is a very pretty addition to my makeup table.</li>
      <li>honestly use ONLY the magnification</li>
      <li>, mine is OK so far</li>
      <li>she is young she is using this mirror appropriately for her age.</li>
      <li>After having read mixed reviews on this mirror, I decided to go ahead and order it as I liked the look.  </li>
      <li>But I did buy her some &amp;#34;LIPSOL&amp;#34; with a tiny bit of rose color in it.</li>
      <li>Wife likes it, price was right.</li>
      <li>It does get warm, but I can still touch it for a long period of time without getting burned or feeling any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Space friendly, and decent size to view my face.  </li>
      <li>Everyone in the family wants to use it!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what we wanted yes</li>
      <li>It makes my eye liner and mascara applications much easier.</li>
      <li>With the 7x magnification, you won&#x27;t see your whole face at once, so bear that</li>
      <li>Lighting is very sufficient; she often uses the magnification side w/</li>
      <li>Nice heavy base..doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
      <li>I have wanted a mirror that can magnify and/or light up for a LONG time, but I kept putting off purchasing one because I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money and then regret my choice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon a super nice mirror today while in Costco - which was round in shape, but also had the satin nickel finish and was much larger.  </li>
      <li>after much research, debate, and comparison, I finally decided to buy this Conair True Glow oval mirror, and I must say, I have been BEYOND satisfied!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Two-sided - regular and magnified - with a soft circle of light.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as bright as I expected and the surface area of the mirror was small.  </li>
      <li>Mirror Much smaller than I expected , also falls over easily</li>
      <li>price is VERY reasonable for the quality of the mirror, and it is, in my opinion, extremely sturdy and well-made!&lt;br /&gt;The oval size is just right for the shape of my face, and the height is perfect...not too tall or too short.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more a person to write an outstanding review as opposed to a bad one.  </li>
      <li>The mirror makes it clear whether my make-up is applied well or not.</li>
      <li>Light not very bright.</li>
      <li>I want to use the light, it is just the right amount of brightness--(it doesn&#x27;t blind me or make me squint at all)--AND</li>
      <li>A little smaller than I expected (I should have measured!), but a great little makeup mirror.</li>

    <li> Much larger than I expected and very sturdy base. Very happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve been using it a month now with no problems.</li>
    <li> My second one. I shoulda&#x27; bought this from the get-go. Instead I bought two from Bed Bath and Beyond and took them both back.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. My wife and I looked at 5 brick and mortar stores, 2 consignment shops, and 3 online stores before she finally &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34; for this. I&#x27;m happy to say that it is far beyond either of our expectations. She loves it and uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this mirror. I can&#x27;t see without my glasses to put my makeup on. This mirror has been a God send to me. I am very happy with the size of the oval mirror. The light is great when you need it. It is a very pretty addition to my makeup table. I would definitely purchase it again if I ever need another mirror.</li>
    <li> Smaller than anticipated.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected (I should have measured!), but a great little makeup mirror. Love the quality of light.</li>
    <li> Overpriced.  Light not very bright.</li>
    <li> I agree that the lighting provided with this mirror is inadequate. Also it didn&#x27;t appear to me to be 7x magnification. I returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift for a family member.</li>
    <li> Mirror is too small.  Cannot see all of face. Should have gotten larger mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great size &amp; height. I absolutely love that it has a socket for additional appliances. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality product but for the price I think it works great. I use it to do my eyebrows and for its intended purpose I love it.</li>
    <li> Two-sided - regular and magnified - with a soft circle of light.  Good solid piece that stays in place as you adjust the angle.  Works like a charm.  Glad we bought it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, good light and I think a pretty fair price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more a person to write an outstanding review as opposed to a bad one.  After having read mixed reviews on this mirror, I decided to go ahead and order it as I liked the look.  I will go with the prior reviewers who stated that it&#x27;s size was too small.  In addition, I found the lighting itself to be quite poor and little or no improvement from the light provided by overhead lighting in my bathroom.  I stumbled upon a super nice mirror today while in Costco - which was round in shape, but also had the satin nickel finish and was much larger.  The lighting is also a vast improvement and to boot was only $19.99.  Upon returning home I printed up my return label to send back.  Sorry, Conair - just not a good deal for the price paid.</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent for seeing stray eyebrows as well as applying make-up. It makes my eye liner and mascara applications much easier. It’s a time saver. The mirror makes it clear whether my make-up is applied well or not. Now, I’m smudge free.</li>
    <li> Too small. Go with larger size. Trust me.</li>
    <li> fits the purpose  but not exceptional</li>
    <li> It was exactly what we wanted yes</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Great product.</li>
    <li> sorry to say that light worked for all of 10 minutes then went out. not happy but no time to return or fix. don&#x27;t even know if I can fix it.</li>
    <li> Space friendly, and decent size to view my face.  With the 7x magnification, you won&#x27;t see your whole face at once, so bear that in mind.  Many review gripe about the bulb life, but, breath held, mine is OK so far</li>
    <li> This looked like the Conair mirror I had just broken but was not at all. I found the mirror to be too narrow and couldn&#x27;t see my whole face. It was also very light weight and moved too easily and I didn&#x27;t like the switch on the cord. The finish was very nice and the whole mirror gave a nice appearance but not the one for me.</li>
    <li> The mirror seems to be made very well and is handy to have. Mi would have preferred the  lighting  be a little different.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter LOVES this mirror!!!!!  She is still quite young but loves to get dressed-up &amp; look very nice just like her Mommy (AND her Grandmother, as well, I HOPE!!!!  (:  She uses it every day, makes sure her hair looks nice, checks to see her teeth are clean-----even tho&#x27; she is young she is using this mirror appropriately for her age. No lipstick or heavy make-up yet. But I did buy her some &amp;#34;LIPSOL&amp;#34; with a tiny bit of rose color in it. She thinks this mirror is GRAND!!!! She talks to it as she &amp;#34;ROLL-PLAYS&amp;#34; !!!  (:</li>
    <li> I love this! I can make sure I leave the house looking hot. The light is not too bright, but I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with the mirror. Lighting is very sufficient; she often uses the magnification side w/out the mirror&#x27;s lighting...we have sufficient lighting in this bathroom. The magnification she reports is &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; for her usage.</li>
    <li> my only objections are that the base could be a little  heavier &amp; the light a little brighter</li>
    <li> I had this mirror before, however, it blew up where the cord goes into the base.  I was lost without this mirror!  Tried some others, but lighting was not good, so they were returned.  Conair discontinued this particular mirror, so I was desperate to find it.  This is the best mirror ever!  So happy I found one, even though it was not new.</li>
    <li> I live this mirror, the lights are perfect, not too bright! Does get warm though after a while. :)</li>
