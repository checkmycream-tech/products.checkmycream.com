      <li>The absolute best in anti-aging serums, hands-down.  </li>
      <li>The best moisturizer for older women.</li>

      <li>I have used this product for quite a while and love it.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>A side by side comparison showed that the product sold here is at best watered down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Estee Lauder Perfectionist Wrinkle Cream for a few weeks and it does seem to be doing an excellent job of reducing/smoothing the wrinkles.</li>
      <li>However, it does appear to smooth wrinkles temporarily when used before applying makeup.</li>
      <li>This was filled up with something else - would not buy this ever again</li>

      <li>I use this in conjunction with a Clarins product, Instant Smooth, which literally fills in the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I expect it to wait a month or so to see significant improvement, because I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks.</li>
      <li>The one I just purchased smells like body milk while the one I had at home have the usual characteristics nice smell of Perfectionist.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I dont know how it is posible since the bottle seems normal..</li>
      <li>Caveat emptor, next time I will be more careful.</li>
      <li>Direct to the garbage</li>
      <li>and thus I am using a bigger amount than by using the normal way of pressing it.</li>
      <li>gave three stars because it does smooth the wrinkles long enough for daily use, but I didn&#x27;t see any long term wrinkle improvement.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin so soft and since i have dry skin it also has lots of moisturizer in it.</li>

    <li> I just love the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local department store and have been using this for 3 months. The first two months I used twice a day as the instructions state. I stopped using it twice daily because there was no noticeable long term differencel. However, it does appear to smooth wrinkles temporarily when used before applying makeup. I use this in conjunction with a Clarins product, Instant Smooth, which literally fills in the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I gave three stars because it does smooth the wrinkles long enough for daily use, but I didn&#x27;t see any long term wrinkle improvement.</li>
    <li> Awesome product my skin looks great</li>
    <li> So far so good. Just started using. It goes on smoothly and unsented (which I prefer).  I expect it to wait a month or so to see significant improvement, because I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> My wife said looks like regular lotion placed in the bottle!!  Direct to the garbage</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Wife at Christmas and she was on her last jar so she went to a local store (starts with M end in ys) and bought another jar. Let me warn you the item sold is not what you would get from a reputable retailer. A side by side comparison showed that the product sold here is at best watered down. She noticed marked improvement over the past few days and has been using a fraction of what she was using with this forgery. Do yourself a favor and spend a few extras $ on the real thing, you are just wasting your money here. Caveat emptor, next time I will be more careful.</li>
    <li> Great deal, great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder Perfectionist is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The consistency and texture  are very different from what it&#x27;s supposed to be . I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I would not recommend buying from this company . I think they put something else in that bottle</li>
    <li> My wife thinks this stuff is the greatest thing since popcorn!  Yes, she rants and raves about it, so it must be good.  She has been using this for a long time and swears by it, even though I think it is pricey.  As they say, a woman&#x27;s vanity has few boundaries, but I&#x27;m a man, so what do I know?</li>
    <li> Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always good to my skin. This is the second one.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping by supplier and great value.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite a while and love it.  It was a little cheaper on line, so that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!!</li>
    <li> Always use it. Its great.</li>
    <li> The price was good here....</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer for older women.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years, it does not disappoint</li>
    <li> The absolute best in anti-aging serums, hands-down.  I&#x27;ve bought and tried EVERYTHING out there at EVERY price.  I always come back to Perfectionist.  Buy it.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This was filled up with something else - would not buy this ever again</li>
    <li> bottle despenser is hard to use.</li>
    <li> Necessary beauty product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Just what I ordered. Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder provided a refund for this product and another one I bought from their website. This product made my wrinkles worse. Don&#x27;t know if it takes time to see results, but very embarrassing to use product since it just wasn&#x27;t right for my skin. Unfortunately I bought this on amazon and didn&#x27;t get item refunded.</li>
    <li> On-time delivery and excellent product.</li>
    <li> Very thin liquid, won&#x27;t get it again.  I&#x27;ll stick to Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I beleive the produc is fake. I have been using Estee Lauder Perfectionist for the past 15 years. I still have my previous bottle so I have compared the two products. The one I just purchased smells like body milk while the one I had at home have the usual characteristics nice smell of Perfectionist. I dont know how it is posible since the bottle seems normal.. but the product inside is definitely not perfectionist.</li>
    <li> this is a another great product, it smooths the appearance of lines while building collagen. Received the product right away and&lt;br /&gt;as listed</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several yrs. and will not use anything else. It makes my skin so soft and since i have dry skin it also has lots of moisturizer in it. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived with the spring broken, which is very frustrating as I have to open it in order to use the serum and thus I am using a bigger amount than by using the normal way of pressing it. I am using this product for many years.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin moist and wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> regular lotion place in the bottle. don&#x27;t order from Jellybean company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Estee Lauder Perfectionist Wrinkle Cream for a few weeks and it does seem to be doing an excellent job of reducing/smoothing the wrinkles.</li>
