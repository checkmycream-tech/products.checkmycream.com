      <li>this was one of my favorite gifts ive ever got.</li>

      <li>I rated this replacement head as OK.  </li>

      <li>Not a bad shaver, just wish the heads were more durable</li>
      <li>Works fine now.</li>
      <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
      <li>and they dont fit that one either.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t fit my mangroomer.</li>
      <li>The head doesn&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
      <li>This replacement head doesn&#x27;t fit the mangroomer.</li>
      <li>Back hair shaver is (To Me) a great product to have around.</li>
      <li>One side always slips free.</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>The replacement head didn&#x27;t really fit the man groomer as the original head did.  </li>
      <li>Who sells a replacement product that doesn&#x27;t fit the original product.    </li>
      <li>So, the product is either not an original replacement or there is some type of defect in the production  process.</li>
      <li>I am still using my original Mangroomer that I have owed for over 3 years now</li>
      <li>the blade comes out, transfered it to my original head and no problems at all.</li>
      <li>Put the old one back on and it fits perfect.</li>
      <li>Other than that great item.</li>
      <li>As mentioned by other reviewers, Mangroomer the company was GREAT when contacted.</li>
      <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy this as a result of those reviews, and that would have been a tremendous mistake.</li>
      <li>Luckily, because I had read your review when I ordered it, I did not panic.</li>
      <li>If you need a new head for either model, this is perfect and Amazon sells this at a fair price, (if you can combine this head with a few other items, Amazon gives you free shipping too.  </li>
      <li>&quot; figuring most people won&#x27;t take the time to complain and will just go buy a new one.</li>
      <li>The original one is exactly as in the picture, silver.  </li>
      <li>it will shave it down very nicely and neatly.</li>
      <li>However, if you take care of the original cutter head, keep it clean and lubricated, it might last for many years.  </li>
      <li>My older, worn-out head snaps on and off easily, but this one will not remain seated at the corner when snapped into place.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy unless you own an ultimate pro model of the man groomer</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit the model I ordered it for, so I had to get creative and move the new blade onto the old units head.</li>
      <li>By Sunday morning I received a reply from Mangroomer that my shaver was an older model and they would send me a free replacement if I gave them my address.</li>
      <li>That becomes even more apparent when you try to use it.  </li>
      <li>and there you go fixed and ready to cut your backhair very smoothly and with no marks anylonger.</li>
      <li>The new head doesn&#x27;t fit my existing groomer.  </li>
      <li>In fact, they replaced my older Mangroomer with the new model (compatible with this replacement head) and threw in a nose/ear trimmer, all free of charge!  </li>
      <li>Using mangroomer for back hair for last 5 years now, replaced the head once, quite happy with the product.</li>
      <li>The email response was super fast and the replacement was in my mailbox in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The original head snaps on and off no problem, these new ones just aren&#x27;t the right size.</li>
      <li>I looked inside my original and there&#x27;s a #8, these new ones both have a #3 on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i think it could not only improve the invention but make the company more mony bc</li>
      <li>Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund and didn&#x27;t even require me to send it back.</li>
      <li>I see how the blade is improved by it not being as exposed to pinch the skin like before, they improved it by moving the actual cutters below the top metal teeth</li>
      <li>Before you buy this product, be aware that you cannot return it to Amazon.com because it is \\&quot;not eligible for return.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This Mangroomer back hair shaver replacement head is just what you need if you damaged yours, or it&#x27;s not cutting as comfortably as it used to.  </li>
      <li>So if you can&#x27;t fit this new head on your original Mangroomer don&#x27;t worry just take that spring thing off and take the blade out of new head and move it to old head</li>
      <li>this is a very cool product I like to use to keep the hair on my back in check.</li>
      <li>They emailed me back, fairly quickly, and said that I owned an older model which was why the replacement head didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>I contacted them from their website to tell them my problem and they sent over a completely new mangroomer and their new mangroomer wipes product TOTALLY FREE of charge.</li>
      <li>I have to make sure that I let the shaver do the work and not \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; which makes small light marks on the skin</li>
      <li>you would need to order new razors on a more regular basis.</li>
      <li>It works, it&#x27;s easy to use, and the only replacement part is putting in a new disposable shaver!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>if you get the handle wet, remove the batteries to make sure it dries out.  </li>
      <li>I got the hang of it fast and use it with and without a mirror.</li>
      <li>It does work, but as you said, we really shouldn&#x27;t have to do this.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>Heads wear out fast, and can be costly to replace.</li>
      <li>There is no reference anywhere to different models available, so</li>
      <li>Struggled with with both heads for 15 min and tossed the whole thing.  </li>
      <li>The new head would not go on right which almost left me in disappointment but with some thought just take the blade out and move it to original head, works perfect.</li>
      <li>I was able to disassemble both the new and old heads and re-assemble the new blade on the old head</li>
      <li>In order to use it, I had to take the internal parts (blades and springs) and had to put them in the original head assembly.  </li>
      <li>Better than original head but would not fit, so took guts out of new one and put in old head.</li>
      <li>New head is a totally different one than pictured, still tried to make it fit, it doesnt.</li>
      <li>Removing the old head was easy enough (nothing appeared to break)</li>
      <li>I can put the old one back on and it locks on just fine, so it is a flaw with the replacement head.  </li>
      <li>I used to have one of the original Mangroomers from ten or more years ago, and this head is far superior in cutting preformance and comfort than the one from my very old unit.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to return my older model, just provided them with the order number and retailer I bought it from.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>too bad since this original product works great just needed the replacement head</li>
      <li>I have been pleased with my Mangroomer since purchasing it a few years ago.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The item is awesome, it&#x27;s like having a new mangroomer, since the original head was not working well anymore.... anyway, the only disappointing part was trying to install it.  For some reason, the small tabs did not fit on the base the way the original head did.  I don&#x27;t know if mine was defective or what...    I eventually had to carefully take the blade/cutting components off the replacement head, and put them into the original head, and then connect it back to the base.  Now it works great, but I shouldn&#x27;t have had to do any of that....    Thats the only thing stopping this from being 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought the Mangroomer in January 2010 and the replacement head in September 2011, and it works great. I can&#x27;t explain all of the reviewers who had difficulty with different models or the replacement head not fitting. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this as a result of those reviews, and that would have been a tremendous mistake. It works perfectly, just like day one. (Thus far at least.) It would appear that if you purchased yours after January 2010, you&#x27;re in the clear here.</li>
    <li> I had to replace the blade because the first one started to hurt like crap after 3 uses. I mean hurt a lot.  The replacement does not fit as many have documented here. One side slips. So you have to replace only the top side through careful gymnastics. They should refund half the money. As others have stated, they know about this problem.  This is very disappointing.  Good idea; pitiful execution.  Headed for file 13.</li>
    <li> I ordered this new Premium Blade recently as my original has always been very rough on my skin and always left me with marks and bit me alot. This blade is way smoother on my skin and does not bite me now. Yes I could not fit the head to my mangroomer as some have complained about so what I did is take the spring mechanism out and the blade comes out, transfered it to my original head and no problems at all. The new head would not go on right which almost left me in disappointment but with some thought just take the blade out and move it to original head, works perfect. I see how the blade is improved by it not being as exposed to pinch the skin like before, they improved it by moving the actual cutters below the top metal teeth so no way it will pinch me anylonger or bite me. So if you can&#x27;t fit this new head on your original Mangroomer don&#x27;t worry just take that spring thing off and take the blade out of new head and move it to old head and there you go fixed and ready to cut your backhair very smoothly and with no marks anylonger. So yes this new blade system is a major improvement. I am still using my original Mangroomer that I have owed for over 3 years now and I use rechargeable batteries and the batteries last very long.  IMPORTANT: Buy from Walmart the Shaver Saver spray lubricant in the shaver section and before each shave spray the blades and also after each shave spray the blades again while unit is on and your blades will last a very long time and will not have to be replaced for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This will not work on older mangroomer essential groomers.    Mangroomer customer service acted like they did not know about this problem and they took my contact info.  I doubt that I will hear back from them.    Save your money.  Back hair is back!</li>
    <li> C. Longo,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, I had the same problem! Luckily, because I had read your review when I ordered it, I did not panic. After seeing that the new head plastic pins were not quite connecting on one side, I simply followed your advice and removed the new blade and carefully installed it into the old plastic holder. It does work, but as you said, we really shouldn&#x27;t have to do this. Also, you are only replacing one side, so eventually the old metal teeth on the orig. head will start to wear. Obviously Mangroomer is aware of the problem, but probably ordered like 10,000 of them and so is just selling them \\&quot;as is\\&quot; figuring most people won&#x27;t take the time to complain and will just go buy a new one. Too bad, as it has the potential to be a great product: If the head was a little wider, the length a little longer, the construction a bit more solid (and, of course, the replacement head fit!) they would have a winner that most men would love.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I listen to the other reviewers?  The replacement head has slight manufacturing differences from the original that do not allow it to snap in place.  Don&#x27;t even think about trying it.  Cheap junk waste of time and $$</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is perfect.  I hate having hair on my back, especially in the summer...my wife refuses to shave my back so I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution...this is it...works great...reaches all the hard to reach areas...one of my prize gadgets</li>
    <li> Just remember it is battery operated and you are in the shower - if you get the handle wet, remove the batteries to make sure it dries out.  Other than that great item.</li>
    <li> The replacement did not fit my unit and I was only given a 50% refund when I returned the item. Wasn&#x27;t happy at all.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other posters, the replacement heads I bought did not fit my shaver. I emailed the company on a Saturday night, explaining that I had bought my shaver in June, 2008. By Sunday morning I received a reply from Mangroomer that my shaver was an older model and they would send me a free replacement if I gave them my address. By Sunday afternoon I had another email from the company saying the replacement had already been shipped. I had it less than a week later and they also threw in a free nose hair trimmer.  It was a simple fix and the company was very responsive. I&#x27;m not sure why others have not had success in contacting the company or gone through the trouble of trying to put the new blades on the old head.</li>
    <li> Was replacing head on a 10 year old Man Groomer. The new head would not snap on my Man Groomer. Took the new blades from new head and put in my old head. Works fine now.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I had it for more than a year, and it never stopped working until i dropped it and broke it, so ordered two more.....</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with my Mangroomer since purchasing it a few years ago. I needed a new blade assembly, so I purchased one online. It doesn&#x27;t fit! There is no reference anywhere to different models available, so I don&#x27;t know what gives...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace the head of my shaver and to my dissapointment the item did not fit. I could not get it to lock in place no matter how many times I tried. So, the product is either not an original replacement or there is some type of defect in the production  process. Do not purchase this item unless you want to loose your  $$$$$.</li>
    <li> The replacement head didn&#x27;t really fit the man groomer as the original head did.  It was difficult to put on.</li>
    <li> i wish i would have pattened this. always had to beg mom or gf to shave back which is embarressing in itself. this was one of my favorite gifts ive ever got. i only wish they would make one change so you can get the same feeling and shortness of shaving ur face. if had just a regular mach 4 shaving end or something to that sort of a regular razor i think it could not only improve the invention but make the company more mony bc you would need to order new razors on a more regular basis. so if u do consider this idea u can email me back and i could give u my address for my 10% of profits. thanks</li>
    <li> Does not fit into original product. This replacement is NOT as pictured. It is black, and it does not work with the model pictured. Overall a useless product.</li>
    <li> Heed the other reviews, I missed this major flaw! I purchased this \\&quot;Premium Replacement Head\\&quot; for my Mangroomer Back Shaver purchased in October 2009, however, it does not fit.  My older, worn-out head snaps on and off easily, but this one will not remain seated at the corner when snapped into place.  Other poor reviews have noted this problem with \\&quot;older\\&quot; models.      Before you buy this product, be aware that you cannot return it to Amazon.com because it is \\&quot;not eligible for return.\\&quot; I called Mangroomer&#x27;s \\&quot;Customer Service\\&quot; and was told by the phone rep that she couldn&#x27;t resolve my problem and that I would be contacted via e-mail.  I imagine I will be waiting a long time for that e-mail.  Ten dollars down the drain...    Edit: To Mangroomer&#x27;s credit, I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to receive a response from them.  In fact, they replaced my older Mangroomer with the new model (compatible with this replacement head) and threw in a nose/ear trimmer, all free of charge!  I didn&#x27;t even have to return my older model, just provided them with the order number and retailer I bought it from.  Very cool!  Bumped up to two stars.</li>
    <li> Ordered a replacement head and it will not fit right. Put the old one back on and it fits perfect. Not happy!</li>
    <li> I loved this replacement. Contrary to people having difficulty in putting this on, i was able to put it on with quite ease. It fit just like any other gadget with hooks. Using mangroomer for back hair for last 5 years now, replaced the head once, quite happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Replacement blade is too small for the wand head.  One side always slips free.</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT FIT. I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ALL THE REVIEWS. DON&#x27;T BUY IT. I JUST THREW IT OUT, TOO MUCH OF A WASTE OF TIME TO SEND IT BACK.</li>
    <li> Mangroomer need a new QA manager. Still waiting for them to send UPS to pickup their product ... it&#x27;s been sitting outside package, labeled and ready to go for over 3 weeks! Sheeesh, maybe they new a new Return Department Mgr. too  :/</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement head and it simply does not fit. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement - same problem. The original head snaps on and off no problem, these new ones just aren&#x27;t the right size. I looked inside my original and there&#x27;s a #8, these new ones both have a #3 on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Mangroomer directly and their customer service is pretty weak. First they put me on hold for 10 minutes, then when I called back I had to wait at least 5 minutes before anyone picked up. When I told the rep I had to call back because they left me in limbo he was silent and didn&#x27;t apologize, nor did he apologize for the product not fitting. He took my info down; we&#x27;ll see if anyone calls but I&#x27;m not optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, get the Razorba. It works, it&#x27;s easy to use, and the only replacement part is putting in a new disposable shaver!</li>
    <li> The act of installing this replacement head broke the product.  Total waste of time and money.  Cheaply and poorly made.</li>
    <li> So I got this and it looks exactly the same as the cutting head that is already attached to the Mangroomer, however, when I try to attach it it does not lock in to place.  I can put the old one back on and it locks on just fine, so it is a flaw with the replacement head.  I am going to return it and will adjust my review if the replacement item fits.</li>
    <li> Better than original head but would not fit, so took guts out of new one and put in old head. New head does not scratch or tug hair.</li>
    <li> Waste of money does not fit the groomer it says it was made for.had to actually remove the blades from their casing and rig to old blade casing.</li>
    <li> Perfect grooming tool for unwanted back hair!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> scraped my back to smitherings</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product.    I bought my mangroomer about 6 months ago.  It worked great the first time.  I didn&#x27;t save the receipts or packaging or anything, because it worked great - once.  It hasn&#x27;t worked since.    When I saw these \\&quot;premium\\&quot; blades, I thought it might make the difference.    This replacement blade does not fit the original mangroomer.  Who sells a replacement product that doesn&#x27;t fit the original product.    Now I have both a useless mangroomer and a useless replacement \\&quot;premium\\&quot; blade.</li>
    <li> The good reviews about the backshaver convinced me to give it a try.  It works really well. I have to make sure that I let the shaver do the work and not \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; which makes small light marks on the skin (no big deal, actually).  I got the hang of it fast and use it with and without a mirror. Practice makes it even easier over time. I have had mine for a month. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Back hair shaver is (To Me) a great product to have around. I have had the shaver for many years. Easy to use and keeps one well groomed. The replacement blades are also a good feature as when needed they are easy to replace and install.</li>
    <li> I rated this replacement head as OK.  In order to use it, I had to take the internal parts (blades and springs) and had to put them in the original head assembly.  I had to throw out the replacement plastic, as it did not fit.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t fit my mangroomer. did they change models?  had to duck tape to the unit or it falls off. word</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Mangroomer for several years and thought it was time to replace the head.  Removing the old head was easy enough (nothing appeared to break) but I could not snap on the new replacement head.  Just didn&#x27;t fit.  Now I can&#x27;t even snap the old head back on.  Struggled with with both heads for 15 min and tossed the whole thing.  What poor design.  The Mangroomer wasn&#x27;t that great of a product anyways, I don&#x27;t expect to buy another one.  I&#x27;ll email the company and see what happens, but I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.    edit:  I contacted the company via email and explained my frustration.  They emailed me back, fairly quickly, and said that I owned an older model which was why the replacement head didn&#x27;t fit.  The offered to replace the old model at their expense.  I sent in my info and got a new (current model) Mangroomer a few weeks later.  I&#x27;m impressed.      I&#x27;d have to give 5 stars for the company.  I haven&#x27;t used the replacement head yet - no need for another year probably, so I can&#x27;t rate that.  I do wish the description page on Amazon specified that the replacement head was for a new model and would not fit older models.  I was wondering about that before I ordered, but there was nothing on the page and I couldn&#x27;t even tell whether there were any newer versions of the base model.  Stars off for the lack of information.</li>
    <li> Heads wear out fast, and can be costly to replace. Not a bad shaver, just wish the heads were more durable</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are not sharp.</li>
    <li> The new head doesn&#x27;t fit my existing groomer.  The shape of the arched piece is slightly different.  Maybe there are different model versions but this didn&#x27;t work on mine.  I was able to disassemble both the new and old heads and re-assemble the new blade on the old head and it seems to work.  Description should say &amp;#34;some (dis)assembly required&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> New head is a totally different one than pictured, still tried to make it fit, it doesnt. already opened it, so cant return it. now seeing other reviews, i guess i just have to buy the whole trimmer? Thank you for helping me waste my time and money JACK!</li>
    <li> Good idea, terrible end product. You get what you pay for I guess. Product feels cheap and of poor quality from the first time you grab it. That becomes even more apparent when you try to use it.  Maybe they improved the second version but with a no return policy on this type product,I don&#x27;t think I will take that chance.  I will with stick with a quality name brand clipper or traditional razor in the future.</li>
    <li> New head wouldnt stay on so i had to remove the blade and install in the old head but it works great.</li>
    <li> did not get the one in the picture, it will not fit</li>
    <li> the cartridges do not fit my mangroomer, so i bought a new mangroomer and they dont fit that one either.</li>
    <li> This Mangroomer back hair shaver replacement head is just what you need if you damaged yours, or it&#x27;s not cutting as comfortably as it used to.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to remove the one that&#x27;s in there now, but with care, it will pop off without breaking.  Snapping the new one in is a breeze.  These heads are interchangable with the Pro model too, and a few dollars cheaper.  The cutter assemblies are identical and work exactly the same, including the same level of comfort.  If you need a new head for either model, this is perfect and Amazon sells this at a fair price, (if you can combine this head with a few other items, Amazon gives you free shipping too.  What a bargain!  However, if you take care of the original cutter head, keep it clean and lubricated, it might last for many years.  I used to have one of the original Mangroomers from ten or more years ago, and this head is far superior in cutting preformance and comfort than the one from my very old unit.  Not sure these would fit on one of those old ones. I know when I tried removing an old head from my old unit, it broke the area where it snaps into. I bought the new disposal battery model too, and everything works great, (see my review)!  Mangroomer stands behind everything too, and will replace any defective items, but you must email them, (calling will not be productive).  Best!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Mangroomer back shaver and threw it out after trying it a few times.  It was like using a metal rake on my back, it scratched my back up and gave me lots of ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> The head doesn&#x27;t fit correctly. You&#x27;re further ahead just purchasing a new unit.</li>
    <li> i was warned it mite not fit. it surely did not fit. had to duct tape it on. it was just a little off so it would not snap n place or glue. too bad since this original product works great just needed the replacement head</li>
    <li> Not as advertised, sent Ultimate Pro Back Shaver replacement and not the original one.  The original one is exactly as in the picture, silver.  They kindly tried to solve the problem by sending a new one but it was the ultimate pro back shaver a second time.  Don&#x27;t buy unless you own an ultimate pro model of the man groomer (color is black).</li>
    <li> The replacement head did not fit on my original version of the mangroomer. This obviously sucked, but... As mentioned by other reviewers, Mangroomer the company was GREAT when contacted. I contacted them from their website to tell them my problem and they sent over a completely new mangroomer and their new mangroomer wipes product TOTALLY FREE of charge. The email response was super fast and the replacement was in my mailbox in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that if you have an old mangroomer from a few years ago, this replacement head won&#x27;t fit on it properly.</li>
    <li> this is a very cool product I like to use to keep the hair on my back in check. it will shave it down very nicely and neatly. Its not razor close but close enough if you were going on a cruise or pool party that you wouldn&#x27;t look like a wooly mammoth.</li>
    <li> This replacement head doesn&#x27;t fit the mangroomer. What a waste! Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund and didn&#x27;t even require me to send it back.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit the model I ordered it for, so I had to get creative and move the new blade onto the old units head. Worked fine afterwards, just not happy about the manual labor to make it work.</li>
