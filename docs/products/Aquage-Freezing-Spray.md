      <li>I would say Aquage is one of the top products on the market today.</li>

      <li>Plus, my hair just got flatter and more stuck to my head as the day wore on.</li>
      <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>The look is soft but the hold is great.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, though Thankfully, a lot of it.</li>

      <li>That is the only consistent thing about this product.  </li>

    <li> Smells great (light light scent) without being sickening and keeps hair bouncy and in tact! Expensive but I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Every product by Aquage is great. I have very thin and fine hair but you wouldn&#x27;t know it when I use Aquage products. This hairspray is great for blocking humidity. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray!  It holds your hair all day.  It still allows your hair to be bouncy and natural feeling, it is not at all sticky!</li>
    <li> I am using it and it is good on my hair, though it did not have any smell, it soves the purpose</li>
    <li> I am constantly having to run the nozzle under warm water.  That is the only consistent thing about this product.  I have used Aquage for years and love it.  This was the first - and last- time using the freezing spray.  It is really tacky feeling.</li>

    <li> Competitive price with the salon&#x27;s and you don&#x27;t have to take the time to go and buy it.  Great product</li>
    <li> This is the only hair spray I use! It is sent free, does not leave my hair sticky, does not leave my dry, and holds my style all day long. I use less then department store hair spray each use. I recommend it to any one that struggle with keeping their hair in the style they start the day off with. I have used this hair spray for over ten years now and have no plans on changing. It does cost more then other brands, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used B &amp; B for several years and really liked it,but The nossel always got clogged.  This hairspray I have not had the problem and it is really good, and it holds up to Oklahoma wind very nicely.</li>
    <li> this stuff is so good.  it holds, but is not heavy.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, though Thankfully, a lot of it. This didn&#x27;t hold my hair in place one hoot! Plus, my hair just got flatter and more stuck to my head as the day wore on. Don&#x27;t know why so many others gave it such rave reviews. It performed horribly for me.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser moved to a new salon, and I followed her, but sadly they don&#x27;t carry Aquage products. This is my favorite hairspray. It&#x27;s a lighter hold than the Kenra 25 and not as sticky. It also isn&#x27;t sweet or perfumed smelling which I can&#x27;t tolerate.</li>
    <li> As I said above this experience was great. I love this product too.It holds better than any product I have ever tried!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. Can be combed out &amp; not have to wash every day. Not heavy but holds.</li>

    <li> Received on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Very fine mist and no scent is great.  Holds without looking like you have it on.</li>
    <li> Love this product....but now that I can get it here, I will never pay full-price at the salon again!! YEEAH!</li>
    <li> Best Hairspray I ever ever used</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that has hold with out that hard look this is the spray.  The look is soft but the hold is great. I would say Aquage is one of the top products on the market today.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray I have ever used.  It keeps my hair in place&lt;br /&gt;all day and I can comb thru it at any time without pulling&lt;br /&gt;my hair.</li>
