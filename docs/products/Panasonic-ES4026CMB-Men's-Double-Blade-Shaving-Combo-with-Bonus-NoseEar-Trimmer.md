      <li>Very happy with the shaver, the price is great and the product quality is very very good.</li>
      <li>In the morning the razor works beautifully and sometimes I even end up with a closer shave than my Gilette.</li>
      <li>Really good price for an excellent shaver and came with bonus nose/ear trimmer.</li>
      <li>i bought this product twice but 2 yrs apart because my son broke the 1st one i bought and was happy with the performance and price of both the shaver and trimmer</li>
      <li>Great value for the money.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for a great price.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased many Panasonic products, and I am very happy with their quality, value and durability.</li>
      <li>shame on Panasonic traying to sell this razor as a good product..   </li>
      <li>again, for the price this a good deal.</li>
      <li>Panasonic has always had a good quality product in the market.</li>
      <li>The nose trimmer, however, does a good job</li>
      <li>Is a pretty good razor with a very good blade.</li>
      <li>It sure is  a good deal since it also comes with a nose trimmer.</li>
      <li>Was really nice that they included the nose trimmer with the razor.</li>
      <li>this shaver ES4026, as a quick or touch up shaver, it works great.  </li>
      <li>It works fine, quality is good.</li>
      <li>getting the free trimmer was a good deal.  </li>
      <li>A more flexible charging system would be nice.</li>
      <li>good battery life and unique feel in your hand.  </li>
      <li>so glad I bought this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>What I found is that using it is actually more of a hassel than my disposable Gillette razors.    </li>
      <li>Razor is ok for touch ups and keeping in the car.</li>
      <li>We love Amazon.</li>
      <li>It will not charge any more</li>
      <li>Works OK.</li>
      <li>this get the job done okay for the price.  </li>
      <li>To the Panasonic Company, please continue to make good quality products with reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>the cleaning is as easy as the instruction states.  </li>
      <li>The razor itself works fine, though, based on my experience.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have in the shower when I am in a hurry and works really well with shaving gel.</li>
      <li>Quiet and have had really noisy razors so that is great in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Washes with soap and water in seconds!!!</li>
      <li>For that price it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
      <li>This shaver originally belonged to my roommate.</li>
      <li>always use alcohol or astringent to clean out my pores and refresh my skin after a shave</li>
      <li>I think it must be an issue with the blades; they just won&#x27;t clean me up.</li>
      <li>After I use this shaver, I still have to use my razor for clean up.</li>
      <li>I want a full refound..</li>
      <li>but cool.  </li>
      <li>however if your grizzly adam and wanted to shave off that beard and don&#x27;t kid yourself fellows, some guys get a full on beard as there 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
      <li>Either will do great to keep germs and other bacteria off of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other Panasonic items I had that are made in Japan are great  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
      <li>oh and the ear and nose trimmer is pretty cool.  </li>
      <li>the battery stopped taking a charge right after the warranty expired.</li>
      <li>I had bought an electric shaver about 7 years ago and it wasn&#x27;t that great even though it was one of the more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>It really shaves!</li>
      <li>Glad to see that it&#x27;s only about $36.</li>
      <li>the first one i had for 3 years</li>
      <li>and they were not even aware of it.</li>
      <li>My previous shaver \\&quot;Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow\\&quot;, which I lost when I moved, was a great shaver and gave me a clean shave even with 50% charged battery.   </li>
      <li>in all, its an OK shaver, but it does take a long time to shave.</li>
      <li>Also, I am sure to clean off the shavor with a few sprays from Andis 6in1 or Barbercide</li>
      <li>I will give it one more chance with new inner blades</li>
      <li>but i doubt that will change anything, it should have worked right now since it&#x27;s new.</li>
      <li>seriously misrepresented with claims of remarkable close shave.</li>
      <li>Pretty decent shaver.  </li>
      <li>The ear/nose trimmer works better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Are you really going to listen to a guy&#x27;s review in which it is titled \\&quot;Shamalamadingdong...</li>
      <li>I was honest enough to return the second one and they promptly reimbursed the shipping cost.</li>
      <li>so why would you expect a couple pieces of oscillating metal that&#x27;s not even sharp do any better.  </li>
      <li>The shaver itself works fine and has long battery life.</li>
      <li>I tried this shaver both dry and in the shower and it works fine.</li>
      <li>The only change I would suggest is that the charger be more flexible and not have to plug it directly into the wall with the shaver directly attached.</li>
      <li>You have to trim the hair down first with a pair of clippers or trimmers and then to shave to get the smooth</li>
      <li>Lately I had gotten interested in them again because of the convenience and hoped that over the years they&#x27;ve gotten better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not available any more anyhow.</li>
      <li>it was almost cheaper to buy a new razor than buying new blades.  </li>
      <li>decided to purchace a new one instead of buying replacement blades.  </li>
      <li>i personally think the shaver&#x27;s very capable.  </li>
      <li>Now, after I have tried using it for more than a month or two, I am not completely satisfied with the shaver.</li>
      <li>Having said that, the shaver itself will give about 95% clean shave when you shave back to back twice or thrice.</li>
      <li>He gave it back to me a week later, and I tried it on a day&#x27;s growth as well as a full weeks growth.  </li>
      <li>Electric razors just are not made for heavy beards, fine for peach fuzz</li>
      <li>and I expect the shaver to clear it off, which it does not.  </li>
      <li>nothing beats an old fashion blade shave.</li>
      <li>ok for the price no better no worse than any other electric razor.  </li>
      <li>Wet or dry, it does not give me a clean shave.</li>
      <li>and i still got one good charge with the island&#x27;s dirty electric before it was time for a replacement.  </li>
      <li>The battery life doesn&#x27;t last long and when it&#x27;s &#x27;dying&#x27; it slows down significantly</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cheap enough to toss guilt-free when they start to get dull.</li>
      <li>this is the second panasonic electric wet shaver i have purchased and i have to say, they really don&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
      <li>So the shaver sits sideways instead of straight up and down while charging.  </li>
      <li>long as I trim my beard down with clippers first, this shaver gets the hair.</li>
      <li>Careful with it if you have a sensitive skin!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This razor is a toy.  It is flimsy and works poorly.  It takes 3 times as long to shave with this than any other electric razor I have ever owned.  It does not come with a power cord, it uses a wall plug that the unit sits on.  The electrical outlets in my bathroom are horizontal instead of vertical so I must use an outlet in another room to charge it.  I gave it two stars because it is waterproof and the nose trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> ok for the price no better no worse than any other electric razor.  nothing beats an old fashion blade shave. Electric razors just are not made for heavy beards, fine for peach fuzz</li>
    <li> I tried this shaver both dry and in the shower and it works fine. The ear/nose trimmer works better than I expected. The only change I would suggest is that the charger be more flexible and not have to plug it directly into the wall with the shaver directly attached. A more flexible charging system would be nice. Even with this charging system I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;3-19-2014 It will not charge any more I don&#x27;t know what the problem is but  this is how long it lasted for me. it&#x27;s not available any more anyhow.</li>
    <li> i bought this product twice but 2 yrs apart because my son broke the 1st one i bought and was happy with the performance and price of both the shaver and trimmer</li>
    <li> Other Panasonic items I had that are made in Japan are great  I don&#x27;t believe this one was since it was much less expensive    Even when new it doesn&#x27;t trim very close and had a hard time cutting also.  Automatic bath/washer stop working after a few months.</li>
    <li> This machine is useless.. what a waste of money.. don´t buy it.. shame on Panasonic traying to sell this razor as a good product..   I want a full refound..</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a great price.  It&#x27;s hard to beat Panasonic.</li>
    <li> this is the second panasonic electric wet shaver i have purchased and i have to say, they really don&#x27;t disappoint.  the first one i had for 3 years yet it kept on working after i dropped it bouncing it off the sink.  it wasn&#x27;t after dropping the changing unit while traveling in bali and i still got one good charge with the island&#x27;s dirty electric before it was time for a replacement.  this shaver ES4026, as a quick or touch up shaver, it works great.  good battery life and unique feel in your hand.  the cleaning is as easy as the instruction states.  i personally think the shaver&#x27;s very capable.  however if your grizzly adam and wanted to shave off that beard and don&#x27;t kid yourself fellows, some guys get a full on beard as there 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  i&#x27;m sorry to say not even a straight razor can do the job alone so why would you expect a couple pieces of oscillating metal that&#x27;s not even sharp do any better.  oh and the ear and nose trimmer is pretty cool.  weird... but cool.  maybe some day i&#x27;ll find a use for it.  and it comes in a set.  so how can anyone say no.</li>
    <li> I can not believe how badly this shawer works, or maybe i should say DOES NOT WORK. I keep thinking i&#x27;m doing something wrong because it is impossible that someone could launch a product that doesn&#x27;t even come close to doing something it&#x27;s meant to do, let alone do it well, but i tried everything the manual says. I will give it one more chance with new inner blades but i doubt that will change anything, it should have worked right now since it&#x27;s new. This is a disgrace for Panasonic. Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> this is my second purchase of a panasonic razor.  decided to purchace a new one instead of buying replacement blades.  it was almost cheaper to buy a new razor than buying new blades.  this get the job done okay for the price.  getting the free trimmer was a good deal.  again, for the price this a good deal.</li>
    <li> Rated for 100-120 V not for the 220 V found in other parts of the world. Returned it without ever using it!</li>
    <li> Shaves close to your skin without irritation to your skin. Really good price for an excellent shaver and came with bonus nose/ear trimmer. Panasonic has always had a good quality product in the market. Whether it be a shaver, video camera, portable CD player, radio etc. I have purchased many Panasonic products, and I am very happy with their quality, value and durability. To the Panasonic Company, please continue to make good quality products with reasonable prices. I am so so glad I bought this product on Amazon. We love Amazon. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This razor was bought as a Christmas present for my youngest son, and therefore purchase in December. He did not begin using it until the second week of January. This razor does not work.  He gave it back to me a week later, and I tried it on a day&#x27;s growth as well as a full weeks growth.  Nothings happens. Again, this razor does not work, and you would be wasting your money to purchase it.     And yes, by the time we had reached this conclusion, the warranty period had passed.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for two reasons:   1. My previous shaver \\&quot;Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow\\&quot;, which I lost when I moved, was a great shaver and gave me a clean shave even with 50% charged battery.   2. I was attracted to the price of this item and the bonus trimmer, which by the way does a &#x27;not too bad&#x27; job.  Now, after I have tried using it for more than a month or two, I am not completely satisfied with the shaver. Wet or dry, it does not give me a clean shave. After I use this shaver, I still have to use my razor for clean up. That makes me unhappy. I also tried keeping it fully charged always, but even then the shave is not completely clean. I think it must be an issue with the blades; they just won&#x27;t clean me up. And for the note, I don&#x27;t have hard beard hair and since I shave everyday my beard hair is quite short and I expect the shaver to clear it off, which it does not.  Having said that, the shaver itself will give about 95% clean shave when you shave back to back twice or thrice. But then it leaves your face burning and itchy after that. Again, it did not happen with my previous Panasonic shaver. I still carry it with me when I travel and use it when necessary but with not complete satisfaction.  Now, for my regular shave I have given up on the shaver and gone back to using the razor again. I will wait for a while before i buy another shaver now. The nose trimmer, however, does a good job and i have no complaints on that.   I wish i had spent the extra bucks and bought the other Panasonic shaver.   P.S. Let me be a little show off ;&gt; and share with y&#x27;all that the seller had sent me two orders for a single payment by error and they were not even aware of it. I was honest enough to return the second one and they promptly reimbursed the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> I had bought an electric shaver about 7 years ago and it wasn&#x27;t that great even though it was one of the more expensive ones. Lately I had gotten interested in them again because of the convenience and hoped that over the years they&#x27;ve gotten better. What I found is that using it is actually more of a hassel than my disposable Gillette razors.    The battery life doesn&#x27;t last long and when it&#x27;s &#x27;dying&#x27; it slows down significantly so you don&#x27;t get quite the shave you should be. It also misses some spots and the shave is not as close as you would get with a typical razor. It actually takes me longer to shave with this thing.    Now I&#x27;m back to using the disposable blue Gillette razors. They do the job and anything closer and you&#x27;ll be drawing blood. They&#x27;re cheap enough to toss guilt-free when they start to get dull.</li>
    <li> Are you really going to listen to a guy&#x27;s review in which it is titled \\&quot;Shamalamadingdong...\\&quot; Well, just in case you are, this is the best quality razor you can buy for the price. Long lasting battery life. I live with a few roommates who continually unplug my razor to power up their Sonicare toothbrushes. Pansies. Anyway. In the morning the razor works beautifully and sometimes I even end up with a closer shave than my Gilette.It&#x27;s nice to have in the shower when I am in a hurry and works really well with shaving gel. A quality product especially for the low price.</li>
    <li> Bought one in Marshalls as 30$ only. Works OK. Checked and read some others&#x27; review from Internet and people were disappointed with the Timmer since it barely does its work. The razor itself works fine, though, based on my experience.</li>
    <li> The item arrived sooner than expected! Is a pretty good razor with a very good blade. I think I probably got the best razor for the price I paid. Careful with it if you have a sensitive skin! It really shaves! It has a long lasting battery life even if I decided to purchased it with a 220 V converter in order to use it when I travel.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the shaver, the price is great and the product quality is very very good. Purchase with the eyes closed.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent shaver.  Biggest problem for me is that my outlets in the bathroom are sideways.  So the shaver sits sideways instead of straight up and down while charging.  I still need to use a razor occasionally, as it has trouble with the stubble at the neck line area and below the chin.  Razor is ok for touch ups and keeping in the car.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself works fine and has long battery life. It sure is  a good deal since it also comes with a nose trimmer.</li>
    <li> the battery stopped taking a charge right after the warranty expired. the trimmer rolled off the counter and shattered on the floor. not well built, not built to last.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. Found it way too slippery to use in the shower. But Dry it is fine and due to the small serface area it takes a bit longer to shave but no big deal. Quiet and have had really noisy razors so that is great in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Washes with soap and water in seconds!!!</li>
    <li> what a mistake. poor shave. seriously misrepresented with claims of remarkable close shave. what a joke. My mistake in tossing wrapping, so I cant return it. save your money. DO NOT BUY this product</li>
    <li> I have used the Panasonic shaver for a long time now and it is working like day one. Was really nice that they included the nose trimmer with the razor.</li>
    <li> Only used for 4 months, charged it for about 12 times. Now the battery is dead for recharge.  Passed the return date.  A piece of junk now.</li>
    <li> This shaver originally belonged to my roommate. So I acquired it used. He said it didn&#x27;t work for him, but it worked well enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry course skin and facial hair. I also have problems with ingrown facial hairs, so I am unable to use razors such as BIC, Gillette, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I trim my beard down with clippers first, this shaver gets the hair. However, I must agree with the people who have say that it doesn&#x27;t shave longer facial hair. You have to trim the hair down first with a pair of clippers or trimmers and then to shave to get the smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use alcohol or astringent to clean out my pores and refresh my skin after a shave so I do not get razor bumps. Also, I am sure to clean off the shavor with a few sprays from Andis 6in1 or Barbercide 5in1. Either will do great to keep germs and other bacteria off of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its an OK shaver, but it does take a long time to shave. All shavers take a long time for me! Glad to see that it&#x27;s only about $36. For that price it&#x27;s well worth it! I hope this review helped.</li>
    <li> This Wet/Dry for the price is awesome,this is my second Panasonic ES 4026 and lasted me for 8 years plus....</li>
    <li> It works fine, quality is good. A little slower process than w/ Remington, but it&#x27;s also alot cheaper than a Remington. It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
