      <li>and I absolutely love them!</li>
      <li>These are ingenious for face!</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>Blends nice.</li>
      <li>However, they do work nice -</li>
      <li>Shipping was speedy and the sponges were packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>Great substitute to the original beauty blenders.</li>
      <li>They did not bounce and blend as good as original Beauty Blender.</li>
      <li>The softer, bouncier texture was able to distribute the runnier foundation very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Foundation and concealer go on smoothly!</li>
      <li>Love these, they blend foundation</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>my fault and would probably still be working if I had been better about washing it and air-drying it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess for the price they may be ok.</li>
      <li>I would also mention, however, that both sponges do absorb more product than a brush does, and I would probably choose to use a brush for most liquid formulas.  </li>
      <li>I immediately fell in love.</li>
      <li>I love love LOVE these sponges, and I&#x27;ve even ordered another bag</li>
      <li>I love the beauty blender and have tried many dupes.</li>
      <li>I AM IN LOVE.</li>
      <li>It is of much better quality than these sponges and $6.</li>
      <li>I love mine</li>
      <li>Make sure to rinse them out before use.</li>
      <li>I guess my expectations were too high because of all the great reviews.</li>
      <li>I will say the sponges are very soft, and I did try them damp as well thinking that might work a bit better, but I didn&#x27;t find it a very effective method to apply foundation as it looked streaky, and well, watery.</li>
      <li>Save your money and just buy one original Beauty Blender instead of buying 4 of these!</li>
      <li>Putting on my foundation has become so much more easier in and giving me a more smooth even look.</li>
      <li>I love the application of my makeup, I only use powder foundation and it goes on beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Oh I&#x27;ve used many brands, cheap etc</li>
      <li>Works great so far, makeup applies well</li>
      <li>With thicker formulations, like creams, the Pro Sponge performed better than the Original BB.  </li>
      <li>With liquid formulations, it was a close call, but the Original BB seemed to do a better job.  </li>
      <li>I figured it would still be more cost efficient than buying the original beauty blender.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Texture:  The Original BB is spongier and has more spring to it.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, these are actually better than the original Beauty Blender.</li>
      <li>I loveeee these beauty blenders so easy to use ... Works well</li>
      <li>fast shipping, packaged great, comes in a resealable bag to keep unused sponges fresh and free of any dirt etc.</li>
      <li>The Original BB also dries more quickly than the Pro Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these sponges are so soft, works amazing when I use it to highlight and contour my forehead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost easier to smooth the foundation on with this &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; than bounce it.</li>
      <li>cheap.</li>
      <li>I have looked everywhere for a great sponge makeup applicator all have fallen short.</li>
      <li>but I think I&#x27;m too cheap.</li>
      <li>so I can not pontificate, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>If you use a foundation with any kind of clay in it, make sure the sponge is not very wet.</li>
      <li>Not close to the original beauty blender.</li>
      <li>and many do this, but not after the first use.</li>
      <li>I just got this product and was excited because of the reviews.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I am SO impressed with these blenders!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to buy this too...</li>
      <li>off paying for the original beauty blender.</li>
      <li>I clean with castile soap and rosehip oil after each use.</li>
      <li>I returned and received a full refund.</li>
      <li>It keeps the sponge nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I guess sticking with the original and spending the money is worth it sometimes.</li>
      <li>but it expanded nicely when i ran it under (squeeze and let absorb a few times) warm water.</li>
      <li>They are good quality and may be good for other people who prefer full coverage makeup, although for me they simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>The sponge is also easy to wash if you follow the instructions: I run some oil into it, then add a gentle detergent and rinse out with water.</li>
      <li>Absolutely stunned about this beauty blenders!!</li>
      <li>I HAD to keep one for myself because of how soft they are and how easily they blend the products you need smooth on your face.</li>
      <li>Until now, I recently purchased the Pro Beauty Sponge Blenders and they are amazing and  perform as they are described.  </li>
      <li>worth every penny.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>Holds the right amount of moisture.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this company and all that they stand for (cruelty-free, great customer service.)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommendation:  Given the price difference, and the superior performance of the Pro Sponge for thick formulations, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pro Sponge over the Original BB.  </li>
      <li>I personally prefer the authentic beauty bender.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these sponges! My BB was tore-up in a matter of a few weeks. These guys are durable and clean right up, even with daily use/wash. They provide a great airbrushed look, and don&#x27;t suck up your product. Great benefits at this cost. I&#x27;ve shared my bag of sponges and need to order again.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly suprised! I have used Beauty Blender and would rate these above in texture and performance! Will definitely recommend and rebuy!</li>
    <li> I loveeee these beauty blenders so easy to use ... Works well</li>
    <li> The moment I wet one of these sponges, it became very hard.  It didn&#x27;t feel like a sponge at all.  I returned and received a full refund.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This is my husbands account! I order this sponge with low expectations. I love the beauty blender and have tried many dupes. Taking this out of the package it felt weird and heavy. But I kept an open mind. I wet the sponge then did did my makeup. I immediately fell in love. It is amazing. I am a professional makeup artist and used it on clients as well! I am sold. I actually like how it feels is a must have for my kit as well as my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Not good. This sponge is WAY too dense to use, even when it&#x27;s damp. I was so excited to buy this too... what a disappointment! I think most of these reviews are fake, because there is no way they can have so many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> This works so well and they look and work EXACTLY like the other brand that overcharges people.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my blending needs!!!</li>
    <li> These sponges work a little differently from others that I have used.  They don&#x27;t absorb as much foundation, so it took some getting used to.  I tried different amounts of foundation until I found what worked for me.  They are a bargain for 4 sponges. The customer service is wonderful!  They are prompt in their replies and polite.  A pleasure doing business with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the beauty blender because I could not bring myself to pay $20 for a sponge. I bought the 4 pack of the pink teardrop and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out...LOVED IT! Seems like a pretty high quality sponge for being around $4 each...some reviewers say they were ruined after one or two uses but I&#x27;m assuming they were too rough with it while cleaning...I was gentle with mine and its still all in one piece! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be just as good as the beauty blender, but they&#x27;re definitely quite different. My foundation doesn&#x27;t look how I would like it to and the makeup applicator feels heavier and is harder to work with. Very disappointed, but I still loveeee their brushes. I have to say though, save your money when it comes to these and just buy a beauty blender because they really can&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges are so soft, works amazing when I use it to highlight and contour my forehead.</li>
    <li> Foundation and concealer go on smoothly! Great find</li>
    <li> What a deal!  I originally had a 2 pack of Beauty Blenders on my personal wishlist that I have been meaning to buy for a longggg time.&lt;br /&gt;But the price of those went up from $21.00 up to $32.00 O_o What? I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m not spending that much on just 2 when I can get 4 for the price that I did these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My foundation, has never looked this good.  It is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I did however see some people who said: &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t Buy these.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;The sponge broke.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;When running water on them, you&#x27;re not supposed to squeeze too hard.  You have to squeeze gently and slowly if you want them to be in good condtion.  :)</li>
    <li> Awesome makeup sponges. Holds the right amount of moisture. Each one lasts for a good 30 days!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these sponges especially after reading the glowing reviews on here. However, they did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Beauty Blender that I reluctantly purchased due to the hype surrounding it and while it is overpriced, it does the job pretty well. I was looking for an affordable alternative to it since I believe $19.95 for a sponge is too much money. So I decided to give these sponges a try. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The color and shape are similar to a Beauty Blender&#x27;s but the texture does not even come close. These sponges are less flexible and hard. They soak a lot of makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a dupe to the Beauty Blender, take a look at the Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge. It is of much better quality than these sponges and $6.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup accessory I own!! Excellent product and customer service. This is the only beauty sponge I will buy from now on!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was speedy and the sponges were packaged nicely. Just follow the instructions for cleaning. I clean with castile soap and rosehip oil after each use. It keeps the sponge nice and soft. You can use the sponge wet or dry. Really great for contouring with cream or powder foundations.</li>
    <li> These are really good quality! Would recommend to anyone wanting blenders.</li>
    <li> Not close to the original beauty blender. This one is too firm and when I use it, it moves the foundation or concealer with it instead of blending it.</li>
    <li> I am getting used to using this method...so I can not pontificate, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and was excited because of the reviews. I used it with my BB cream as I normally would and I followed the instructions on the back of the pack of sponges. After one use and one wash this is how the sponge looks, see picture below. I loved how it applied the make up but it&#x27;s already starting to tear, cheap. I guess sticking with the original and spending the money is worth it sometimes. Oh I&#x27;ve used many brands, cheap etc and many do this, but not after the first use. I apply makeup daily, I am not abrasive or rough either.</li>
    <li> Very great product!!! Full size when wet and very soft! Can&#x27;t wait to order again!!</li>
    <li> Great substitute to the original beauty blenders. I bought the pear pink one, and my makeup looks significantly better and lasts the whole day.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. It is cacks of the first use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I am SO impressed with these blenders! I was very hesitant to buy something other than the original Beauty Blender because the ulta brand I tried was a terrible copycat. HOWEVER, these are actually better than the original Beauty Blender. They are a much better value and do an absolutely incredible job blending my makeup. I&#x27;ll never use another brand!</li>
    <li> I guess my expectations were too high because of all the great reviews. The product is nothing close to the real beauty blender. It&#x27;s very hard even after soaked in water. It does expand after soaked but that&#x27;s about it.. It doesn&#x27;t soften up at all. It&#x27;s very very dense and uncomfortable to dab onto your face because of the denseness.</li>
    <li> Once the puff  up when wet, they&#x27;re like a stress ball and make-up applicator all-in-one.</li>
    <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t see what is so special about these.  They&#x27;re foam.  Not worth the price in my opinion.  However, they do work nice - but then you have to constantly wash them - I prefer a brush, which you also have to wash but not as often.</li>
    <li> It looks and is shaped like a Beauty Blender, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to a Beauty Blender. This is too dense! I don&#x27;t like it and will just splurge on the real deal.</li>
    <li> It applies foundation and bb cream flawlessly. I don&#x27;t know if it actually cuts down on the time required for rubbing it in with fingers, but it is certainly less streaky than using fingers. The sponge is also easy to wash if you follow the instructions: I run some oil into it, then add a gentle detergent and rinse out with water.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, packaged great, comes in a resealable bag to keep unused sponges fresh and free of any dirt etc. worth every penny. hope they last!</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for a great sponge makeup applicator all have fallen short. Until now, I recently purchased the Pro Beauty Sponge Blenders and they are amazing and  perform as they are described.  Putting on my foundation has become so much more easier in and giving me a more smooth even look. A must have product for anyone who uses liquid foundation, powder - you can even use it as a blush brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed. This is comparable to the real Beauty Blender. It looks the same, too. It comes in a cute resealable package and instructions on the back. The sponges expand and soften quite a lot after they&#x27;ve been dampened, just like the real Beauty Blender. I love it. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Blends nice. Make sure to rinse them out before use. They have a funny smell in the beginning bit it goes away if you soak and squeeze with water</li>
    <li> Proved to be slightly flimsy, but I fear I was a bit heavy handed with the cleaning.  I love the application of my makeup, I only use powder foundation and it goes on beautifully.  **Little tip**  If you use a foundation with any kind of clay in it, make sure the sponge is not very wet.</li>
    <li> These are INCREDIBLE dupes for Beauty blenders. I bought 1 set, and decided to try one out before adding it to my kit. I HAD to keep one for myself because of how soft they are and how easily they blend the products you need smooth on your face. These are the bomb dot com, y&#x27;all. I&#x27;m going to be ordering another set very soon--THAT is how great they are.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying the pink teardrop sponges and I absolutely love them! I am a liquid foundation user and this sponge blends it beautifully and flawlessly onto my skin! I am going to try the other sponges as well!</li>
    <li> Wow horribel material..... when dipped into the make up it does not even apply it evenly. The material is tuff and expands too much.&lt;br /&gt;Better off paying for the original beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet but it expanded nicely when i ran it under (squeeze and let absorb a few times) warm water. They are soft to touch and a very pretty pink. I noticed no color transfer. It took a few days for the one i got wet to fully dry out if at all. It never went back to original size. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, just playing around, I have bounced it off my cheek and I can actually hear it. I&#x27;m not sure if that means it&#x27;s too hard to work properly or not but we will soon find out! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll update after I use the sponge a few times.</li>
    <li> I guess for the price they may be ok. I really want to like them but those sponges are very hard. They did not bounce and blend as good as original Beauty Blender. I had hard time to bland my make up this morning using the PRO pink, drop shape one. I&#x27;m using Dior Forever formula which is very forgiving and I never had an issue applying it with BB, therefor I need to pass on PRO Makeup Applicators. They are good quality and may be good for other people who prefer full coverage makeup, although for me they simply don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Love these, they blend foundation just right. Works great!</li>
    <li> These are ingenious for face! Love how easily they clean up and you can use them wet or dry</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about</li>
    <li> I had an experience similar to some of the other negative reviews I read. I was excited to try these sponges as I was transitioning to liquid make-up after a long stint with bare minerals and found that I felt I was hardly putting any make up on my face, it felt like most of what I tried to apply had been sucked into the sponge. I will say the sponges are very soft, and I did try them damp as well thinking that might work a bit better, but I didn&#x27;t find it a very effective method to apply foundation as it looked streaky, and well, watery. I went not too long after this botched attempt to the clinique counter where the woman applying make up said to never apply liquid make up with sponges if you didn&#x27;t want to waste your make up. I would be curious to try Sephora&#x27;s beauty blender but I think I&#x27;m too cheap. Stinks to ever spend your money on something that doesn&#x27;t work for you, hope this information helps.</li>
    <li> Not better than all the other dupes.&lt;br /&gt;I hardly ever write any reviews. These are stiff, they take the concealer and foundation from your face and absorb the product instead of covering your face. I made the big mistake of buying these through Amazon.com,even though I live in Canada and I had them shipped to me through myUS. I figured it would still be more cost efficient than buying the original beauty blender. With all the great reviews and almost 5 stars on Amazon, I was very excited to use them. Very disappointed. I am sure lots of these reviews are fake.Save your money and just buy one original Beauty Blender instead of buying 4 of these!</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price, and excellent service. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this company and all that they stand for (cruelty-free, great customer service.) It pains me to leave a poor review, but these sponges don&#x27;t compare AT ALL to the original BB. I soaked them for a really long time under running water, and even filled a bowl with water and let it soak, and they still felt incredibly stiff. When I would bounce it on my face to blend foundation, it sounded hollow? Almost like a tennis ball. It&#x27;s almost easier to smooth the foundation on with this &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; than bounce it. These look almost like plastic balls in that they&#x27;re not porous like a typical sponge is. Either way, I&#x27;m sorry Beauty Junkees, but your sponges don&#x27;t compare.  Very strange. :(</li>
    <li> Works just like the real ones only difference is these feel like they have something in the middle  compared to the real blender beauty isn&#x27;t as soft, but still gets the work done. Works great I love mine</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE. I was so worried about ordering these and receiving sponges that were, yet again, awful dupes for the beauty blender. When I first wet this sponge, it was a little dense in the middle and not very squishy and I worried about how it would deposit my foundation, especially since I had been using the real techniques sponge before for the same task. These sponges went so far above and beyond my expectations! They deposited my foundation flawlessly without putting too much on the skin, and smoothed out any cakey areas to make my skin even, flawless, and gave me amazing coverage. I love love LOVE these sponges, and I&#x27;ve even ordered another bag just so I have backups. They wash like a dream and after 2 uses of getting them wet and working with them, they soften up. I&#x27;ll never use anything else for my foundation. These are everything I was looking for and more!</li>
    <li> Absolutely stunned about this beauty blenders!! Loved it!! Recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Works great so far, makeup applies well and they don&#x27;t &#x27;eat&#x27; my makeup so no waste</li>
    <li> So I ordered four sponges, which I assumed would last a good while with proper care. I was mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponge #1: Tragically was the victim of my two-year old who grabbed it from the spot it was drying and shredded it. That one I will own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponge #2: While getting it wet for to use for the first time, developed several tears immediately in it. This was extra annoying since it happened immediately after the incident with Sponge #1. I went to bed very upset that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponge #3: Decided to take super-duper extra care with it while washing. My initial wash went without a hitch, as did my initial use. As I was cleaning it for a second time, again being SUPER gentle with it and squeezing with the least amount of pressure possible, BAM, developed a tear. Within a second use and washing had developed two more tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing - I can&#x27;t afford to buy products I can&#x27;t rely on, no matter how inexpensive they are, and I can&#x27;t have products falling apart on me when I&#x27;m using them on clients or cleaning them between clients. My Beauty Blender took months and months of abuse before it succumbed to mold (which was 100% my fault and would probably still be working if I had been better about washing it and air-drying it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had found a gem and am extremely disappointed that after a week I&#x27;m down to only one sponge (although only two of the causalities were due to a manufacturing defect and one was due to a mom defect). Fingers crossed that it lasts through all my wedding clients on Saturday since I don&#x27;t have the money or time to run around and get a new one before then.remely disappointed that after a week I&#x27;m down to only one sponge (although only two of the causalities were due to a manufacturing defect and one was due to a mom defect).

    <li> Small and hard as a rock</li>
    <li> I thought it was a waste of money. I personally prefer the authentic beauty bender.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Just as good as Beauty Blender at a fraction of the price. Vender was awesome, too...sent them quickly and in perfect condition. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this sponge (let&#x27;s call it the Pro Sponge) as well as the Original BB, I have the following thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture:  The Original BB is spongier and has more spring to it.  The Pro Sponge is firmer, including at the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:  The Original BB is smaller, both dry and when wet, although it expands more when wet than the Pro Sponge.  The Original BB also dries more quickly than the Pro Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:  I tried both sponges with cream foundations (Kevin Aucoin Sensual Skin Enhancer, Tarte Amazonian Clay 12 Hour Foundation) and a liquid foundation (Armani Luminous Silk).  All were used over Hourglass Veil Primer.  With thicker formulations, like creams, the Pro Sponge performed better than the Original BB.  The firmer nature of the sponge allowed it to force thicker products to blend into the skin.  Whereas with the Original BB, the spongier nature made it more difficult to spread thick product.  Further, because of the overall firmer nature of the Pro Sponge, the tip was also firmer, making it easier to get in the crevices around the eyes.  With liquid formulations, it was a close call, but the Original BB seemed to do a better job.  The softer, bouncier texture was able to distribute the runnier foundation very smoothly.  However, I had to look VERY closely to discern any difference, and once I applied a setting powder, that difference all but disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:  Given the price difference, and the superior performance of the Pro Sponge for thick formulations, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pro Sponge over the Original BB.  It&#x27;s a more versatile product in my view, and obviously much less expensive.  I would also mention, however, that both sponges do absorb more product than a brush does, and I would probably choose to use a brush for most liquid formulas.  Where the Pro Sponge really shined was in the application of VERY thick formulas like the Kevin Aucoin Sensual Skin Enhancer, which if you&#x27;re not familiar with it, is thick enough to be used as a very full coverage concealer.  Brushes leave this formula looking cake, unevenly spread, and as if it&#x27;s still sitting on top of the skin.  The Pro Sponge did and excellent job of forcing the product around and blending it into the skin itself.</li>
