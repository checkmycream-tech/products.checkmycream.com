      <li>This is a good comb for your hair.</li>
      <li>It does make my hair look good</li>
      <li>I purchased this (and another model) to have a back-up to an exceptional Kent comb that I have had for about 10 years.  </li>
      <li>This is the slighly shorter version, at 175 mm, which is great for all-around use and ideal for carrying in my suit jacket inside pocket.</li>

      <li>The best comb and the last comb you will ever own.</li>
      <li>This is a comfort item for sure.  </li>
      <li>Great quality and holds up very well over time.</li>

      <li>It would make an excellent present.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Kent is an outstanding line of combs</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t think of a better comb.  </li>
      <li>Love mine and would recommend.</li>
      <li>I have several Kent combs and they are in my opinion the best made combs for the price.</li>
      <li>I will be able to leave this to my grandson.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth alot more than that!</li>
      <li>It feels great in your hand - it has a nice &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to it and is extremely polished.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t scratch your scalp like those cheap plastic ones.</li>
      <li>It should feel like glass but smooth and unbreakable.  </li>
      <li>Smooth combing, great craftsmanship, and better than I expected!  </li>
      <li>The length is also very nice - not a &amp;#34;back pocket&amp;#34; comb but also not so enormous that it takes up a ton of bathroom counter space.</li>
      <li>If you want a good comb that&#x27;s easy on your hair and will last for ages, get one of these.</li>
      <li>Comb is flat out amazing!</li>
      <li>I am under no illusion that it comes my hair any better than a cheap plastic model, but the weight and heft combined with the classic bakelite look and the &amp;#34;hand made&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Teeth thicker than expected but comb works well and feels great in your hand.</li>
      <li>but you want something cool in the hand.  </li>
      <li>You can have a good grip on this comb and still have plenty of comb to push through long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>This is worth the &amp;#60;9</li>
      <li>These not only look good, but the smooth teeth are comfortable on your scalp and they hold up well to inevitable drops in the shower or bathroom.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t fully polished and smooth like the older comb.  </li>
      <li>As I mentioned, I purchased two Kent combs, the first one had some problems, and I thought it was a fluke.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it at first</li>
      <li>I would be very willing to spend more money to get a similar level of quality to that of the old comb.  </li>
      <li>Fairly large and course toothed, I like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a real comb.  </li>
      <li>Works better than expected.</li>
      <li>Trust me, this is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>The quality of Kent products has gone off a cliff, and they should be very embarrassed.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a REAL comb then you won&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
      <li>Seems really well made.  </li>
      <li>The old one started losing the occasional tooth last winter (not bad for almost 15 years), and I was really pleased to find them being sold through Amazon.</li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re durable, and they don&#x27;t hold grease based pomade in the comb like many other combs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>These combs are high quality, durable and gentle on scalp.</li>
      <li>I know I should not expect the exact level of quality as my old comb, but this is inexcusable.  </li>
      <li>Finally, a comb that is for real!!</li>
      <li>but my hair has so much more life to it now and stays softer and praise the Lord no more chunks of hair get ripped out like those crappy molded plastic combs.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like a Course Tooth comb, but I have no other choice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m bald, by my 12 year old son shows no signs.  </li>
      <li>Wow, what a comb.  </li>
      <li>This comb hasn&#x27;t arrived as yet, as I only just bought it (and a smaller one for my husband), but having used an identical comb for about 15 years, I can certainly confirm that these are quality combs.</li>
      <li>Substantial and masculine for the man that will actually bother to worry about what his comb looks like.  </li>
      <li>I replaced an old Ace comb that I had purchased years ago that had finally lost some teeth.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for thick hair.use on my head and beard.</li>

    <li> Great comb! I use it for my long thick hair and long thick beard. Kent is an outstanding line of combs</li>
    <li> Smooth combing, great craftsmanship, and better than I expected!  I bought two so would have one at work as well.</li>
    <li> Teeth thicker than expected but comb works well and feels great in your hand.</li>
    <li> Seems really well made.  I&#x27;m bald, by my 12 year old son shows no signs.  I bought this for him, he loves it!</li>
    <li> This comb hasn&#x27;t arrived as yet, as I only just bought it (and a smaller one for my husband), but having used an identical comb for about 15 years, I can certainly confirm that these are quality combs. The old one started losing the occasional tooth last winter (not bad for almost 15 years), and I was really pleased to find them being sold through Amazon. If you want a good comb that&#x27;s easy on your hair and will last for ages, get one of these.</li>
    <li> Kent has been the good &#x27;ol stand by for me for years.  Can&#x27;t think of a better comb.  Wow, what a comb.  Yes indeed.</li>
    <li> Kent quality - great comb.</li>
    <li> These combs are high quality, durable and gentle on scalp. This one was a gift as I am so happy with mine. I have used these since the 70&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I purchased this (and another model) to have a back-up to an exceptional Kent comb that I have had for about 10 years.  This comb is terrible and doesn&#x27;t even come close to the quality of the older one!  It is a major disappointment.  As I mentioned, I purchased two Kent combs, the first one had some problems, and I thought it was a fluke.  Sadly, this one has the same problems.  The issue is with the finish.  It isn&#x27;t fully polished and smooth like the older comb.  There are some burrs on the teeth and there are notches where it wasn&#x27;t cut correctly.  The notches pull and damage the cuticle of your hair as you use it.  I have long hair, so this just won&#x27;t work.  I wish I would have decided to return it before using it.  The quality of Kent products has gone off a cliff, and they should be very embarrassed.  I know I should not expect the exact level of quality as my old comb, but this is inexcusable.  I would be very willing to spend more money to get a similar level of quality to that of the old comb.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage!</li>
    <li> Kent combs are no joke.  They never grab the hair (unless there is a knot), they&#x27;re durable, and they don&#x27;t hold grease based pomade in the comb like many other combs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this comb. I use it every morning to comb my hair after showering. It feels great in your hand - it has a nice &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to it and is extremely polished. There are no edges to snag/rip your hair. The teeth are spaced appropriately (not so wide to be worthless and not so close that combing becomes difficult). The length is also very nice - not a &amp;#34;back pocket&amp;#34; comb but also not so enormous that it takes up a ton of bathroom counter space. You can have a good grip on this comb and still have plenty of comb to push through long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Fairly large and course toothed, I like it.</li>
    <li> The best comb and the last comb you will ever own. I will be able to leave this to my grandson.</li>
    <li> What I&#x27;d expect of Kent combs. Love mine and would recommend.</li>
    <li> This comb makes me happier than a comb should. I am under no illusion that it comes my hair any better than a cheap plastic model, but the weight and heft combined with the classic bakelite look and the &amp;#34;hand made&amp;#34; moniker make me feel like I&#x27;m using something that would be handed to me by a butler in my mansion in the English countryside. It does make my hair look good but this is almost beside the point.</li>
    <li> Tired of killing your face if you ever wanted to put a comb through it?  Look no further!  Works better than expected.</li>
    <li> Nice comb! Substantial and masculine for the man that will actually bother to worry about what his comb looks like.  It has a good weight to it, it&#x27;s thicker than it looks. It won&#x27;t scratch your scalp like those cheap plastic ones. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s nice. It would make an excellent present.</li>
    <li> Finally, a comb that is for real!! It actually does what it is supposed to do, and the teeth actually work!! This is the slighly shorter version, at 175 mm, which is great for all-around use and ideal for carrying in my suit jacket inside pocket. I wish all combs were like this one!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of combs in my life.  These not only look good, but the smooth teeth are comfortable on your scalp and they hold up well to inevitable drops in the shower or bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great detangling comb. Fantastic for thick hair.use on my head and beard. Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t pull out hair when it catches a knot.</li>
    <li> I used a 175 mm fine tooth Kent comb for years, Sawcut F3T, so I was disappointed I could not replace it.  Obviously Kent does not make this model anymore.  I don&#x27;t particularly like a Course Tooth comb, but I have no other choice.  Shame on Kent!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Rosenberger  dorothyndon@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I have several Kent combs and they are in my opinion the best made combs for the price. I replaced an old Ace comb that I had purchased years ago that had finally lost some teeth. I will continue to buy Kent combs.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Comb is flat out amazing! Bought it for my beard which is very long and coarse...or at least was. This comb has done wonders for the health of Mt beard and actual hair! I didn&#x27;t realize it at first but my hair has so much more life to it now and stays softer and praise the Lord no more chunks of hair get ripped out like those crappy molded plastic combs. And because of how they&#x27;re constructed, no sit ends either! Everyone with any kind of hair should have one of these, do not wait! This is worth the &amp;#60;9$ heck it&#x27;s worth alot more than that! So happy I got it, and man you can feel the quality in the comb and in your hair!</li>
    <li> i own 3 of these kent comb&#x27;s and they are the best.  best quality in the business for a great price!</li>
    <li> This is a comfort item for sure.  You could have any bendy/flexy rubbery comb but you want something cool in the hand.  It should feel like glass but smooth and unbreakable.  That&#x27;s a real comb.  Like the bakelite beauties of 1920.  I had a bakelite comb once and this  material feels very similar.  If you&#x27;ve never used a REAL comb then you won&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about.  Trust me, this is the real thing.  Running it through your scalp is not just straightening your hair, it&#x27;s calming.  This feels like a comb should.  It&#x27;s one of the pleasures afforded to men that should not be overlooked.  Like shaving.  Combing your hair should be a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a good comb for your hair.</li>
    <li> Great quality and holds up very well over time. Would recommend getting couple different tooth sizes based upon your personal need.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m reviewing a comb, but this is a good one!  Probably the best I&#x27;ve had.  I bought a few Kent combs to replace all my black drugstore ones.</li>
