<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love every brush in this kit.  And I really didn&#x27;t expect too because I have a TON of brushes from MAC to Sigma yet I find myself reaching for my Real Techniques brushes over them.  That&#x27;s really what finally pushed me to just buy this set already and I&#x27;m so glad I did :)  I can&#x27;t emphasize enough what a steal this is.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> These brushes along with the purple set are just brilliant. Samantha &amp; Real Techniques, I can&#x27;t thank you enough for making brushes that are great quality and don&#x27;t require you to sell organs to pay for them! In particular, I love the contour blush brush. Very versatile and picks up just the right amount of color. Also, the lip pencil is spot on. I don&#x27;t know if it is the cut of the brush or the synthetic hairs but it spreads pigmented color like a dream. Great for OCC Liptars!</li>
    <li> Don buy it! I love brushes from real technique, but one brush come broken and to return it I need to pay one tax, what not compensates. Definitely I&#x27;ll not buy more these brushes again on the internet, mainly here in the amazon, just in a store. Don&#x27;t buy it! It can come broken for you too.</li>
    <li> Though the buffing brush is small, it applies liquid makeup like a DREAM. My face looks smooth and makeup is well blended. The other brushes are also good. They wash easily. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> These brushes made me want to play with makeup again. For years I just used a very light coverage foundation with Bare Minerals and a bit of mascara. Once I started watching the Real Techniques/Pixi Woo videos on youtube, I decided to try some more techniques (MEDIUM coverage?? contouring?? what??) and bought a few brushes. I got hooked and my daily makeup routine hasn&#x27;t been the same since. Still easy and quick, but so much better! And more fun :) These brushes are super soft, easy to use, and a HUGE bargain.</li>
    <li> Love these !!! Great for beginners</li>
    <li> I liked every brush except for the foundation brush. It wasn&#x27;t very soft. I love the buffing brush though. I&#x27;d probably say that it&#x27;s my favorite out of the four.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the foundation of your face!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  Affordable, reliable and most of all easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Whenever you wash them they return to  their original shape!!</li>
    <li> Zero shredding, zero smell. Super durable. Bought these couple months ago. I am absolutely satisfied with my brushes. Great price and great product!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel.  Soft brushes.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> All of the real Techniques brushed worked wonderful. Be sure to watch the instruction video from the link on the box (they are helpful)!</li>
    <li> Good quality of course, they are real techniques brushes! Good buy!</li>
    <li> My personal favorite brand!!! Real technique brushes are really good in my opinion especially considering they are not so expensive. The work great if yo know how to use them and  know what your doing i really love these brushes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear much makeup at all, nor do I own many makeup tools. However, I wanted to wear makeup for an event I was attending, most notably concealer for under my eyes and a bit of foundation. The problem (for me at least) is that liquid foundation leaves streaks and powder &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; looks fake. After a lot of research I decided I needed a brush and was about to purchase quite expensive brushes to get the look that I wanted. However, I decided on these brushes after watching a few videos on YouTube and reading the reviews on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great about these brushes is that the packaging tells you which brushes are for what application. For the novice, this simple bit of information is priceless. I used the smallest brush to conceal any dark spots, pimples, etc and the pointed brush to apply concealer around my eyes. These are the best brushes in the kit in my opinion. The largest brush works GREAT for applying all over face/neck foundation. The tip that I followed was to apply the makeup in circular and upward movements. By applying it like this, all of the makeup seeps into your pores and it looks like you aren&#x27;t even wearing any. The flawless look that it gives means I have been wearing makeup more often and I actually enjoy it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously can&#x27;t believe how cheap these brushes are. If you are on the fence, I urge you to try them. They work great and are a great intro brush for the average makeup user.</li>
    <li> not soft like i thought</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!! It&#x27;s a must have set for all beginners</li>
    <li> I just got started doing makeup and I decided to buy these brushes because they looked like they were good for beginners and easy to use. I received these the other day and I have to say, they are wonderful! They feel nice, soft, and dense. I compared these to my elf studio brushes which are super soft but have the tendency to disperse all the product on the first stroke; these have the ability to retain product and and blend it out while &amp;#34;locking&amp;#34; it in. When I cleaned these and tried to wipe them off, the paper towel I used was still dry because the bristles held in the water! One thing I&#x27;m not sure about, I don&#x27;t know how the &amp;#34;pointed foundation&amp;#34; brush is an intuitive brush shape; it&#x27;s nice and it can probably be used in a variety of ways but it looks like an artist&#x27;s brush, which is mostly used to lay paint flat against the canvas. The need to lay a product flat against your face (rather than stippling it in) isn&#x27;t very high priority for me when I&#x27;m trying to put together a natural look. Otherwise this set is just fantastic (especially the biggest brush - it&#x27;s great for blending in and buffing liquid, cream, and powder foundation), and I would highly recommend these. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find that these are Authentic Real Techniques brushes. They are soooo soft. I would repurchase!</li>
    <li> For beginners and makeup enthusiasts alike this is a great set. I have well over 200 brushes (yes) I have a problem lol. I use a blend of very high end brushes to Elf brushes and everything in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are soft and very easy to work with. I haven&#x27;t encountered any shedding or loose handles. These brushes and not scratchy and they blend product beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are seeking a great little collection at a great price I would certainly check this set out.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes because they are soft, dense, and you can get a good application with liquid foundation. I used my fingers to apply before and really noticed the difference when I used the buffing brush. The makeup looks a lot more natural and you&#x27;re able to get more even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are thicker than most so they cover more for a quick application. The handles have a smooth metal-like covering and soft black covering at the end of the brush so they are comfortable to hold as well. The set also comes in a nice, black travel case, which is handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorites are the buffing brush for applying liquid foundations and detailer brush for liquid lipsticks like the OCC lip tars or other lip stains that require a precise application. They are quality brushes for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get 5 stars from me due to the design, the black case, and price.</li>
    <li> why did i wait this long to have them? eye collection and thise core collection and now my stippling brush is on its way. They are great super quality . I mean when looking for brushes, u wanna get them firm, soft, and tightly held for a perfect prof application. You cant go wrong with real techniques brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such amazing brushes . thank you thank you thank you &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> Wife said I get sex if I bought her this. Win win</li>
    <li> amazing, works well, is a perfect tarter kit. I will be buying more real techniques brushes in the immediate future! really only use the buffing brush though</li>
    <li> The brushes are great. They&#x27;re are very soft and have great coverage. The stand is great for when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning and not having to dig in my bag for the right brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes make for a smooth and effortless application for makeup. I use the powder brush for my liquid foundation and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes, definitely worth the investment. I purchased these a year ago and still in excellent condition. I&#x27;m buying these for my sister in law along with the eye collection. Perfect for somebody with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Ok  brushes not the best quality brushes</li>
    <li> Great brushes, very soft, well made and no shedding after 6 months of use and cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price, the whole real techniques line is a wonderful investment. Good alternative for those who want synthetic brushes, also packaging is recyclable.</li>
    <li> I am in a process of replacing my broken Elf ones with this set (and more probably). I like that they don&#x27;t cause breakout for me.</li>
    <li> I love the buffing brush, use it as foundation brush and it works just the way i wanted. The contour brush is a bit small, i reckon it can be a bit bigger. The pointed foundation brush i use it as an under eye concealer brush, it is too small to use on the whole face.</li>
    <li> made in china, but it&#x27;s good for using.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this set. I used it mostly for my powder contouring and buffing my blush to blend in better. Love the quality they don&#x27;t shed one bit</li>
    <li> These brushes blends foundation and concealers quit well. I love the buffing brush how it just buffs the foundation into the skin giving it that flawless coverages. These are great brushes for beginners to advanced makeup artist and would recommend this to any female who loves doing makeup!</li>
    <li> Real Techniques are the only brushes I&#x27;ll use now. I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end brushes and I actually find these better. The main brush I use in this set is the buffing brush. I don&#x27;t know how I ever used a regular foundation brush now that I&#x27;ve discovered this! And the contour brush is amazing too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this set!They are so soft and easy to clean too. Just a great set.</li>
    <li> ordered these for the 2nd time!</li>
    <li> Loved these!!!!! Best brushes out there</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes but they are small. I use it for my foundation and it goes on very smooth. I really like them and would order them again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good quality definitely worth the money and just feel great on the skin and are very easy to use</li>
    <li> I have purchased this core set 6 months ago. Now the only brush in this set I&#x27;m using is the buffing brush. I use it while I have washed my Shiseido foundation brush and it has not dried yet. The buffing brush is good for applying foundation when I&#x27;m in a hurry and give a pretty nice finish. The other three brushes are not bad, but not impressing. I have not touch those three for more than 5 months. If they sell the buffing brush alone life will be so good as I would like to buy one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I recommend these brushes for anyone needing professional quality make-up brushes but who can&#x27;t afford the pricier product. These are comparable in every way.</li>
    <li> This line of brushes is the best of because they&#x27;re very soft and durable. I own so many of them and they all are perfect. Buy them, you will love them all. They&#x27;re soft on your face and easy to clean, plus you get four brushes for the price of one! Yes, they&#x27;re a keeper!</li>
    <li> Having used the MASH brushes although soft and did the job of applying make up.  The Real Technics brush sets are soft, beautiful to blend with and give a lovely finished make up look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the starter set and the core collection and the blusher brush.  I can say for me that&#x27;s enough, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any more, as I find I have all the brushes I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them.  By the way just for info, writing this review is the wife of Paul Hammond!  Also thanks to Sam Chapman for having th insight to produce excellent quality brushes at affordable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate all purchased real technics brushes 4 stars would be a 5 if there was an option to purchases them separately.</li>
    <li> i like the buffer brush its very versatile! everything from blush to contour to all over face! i wont give this 5 stars because im quite dissapointed about the foundation brush (pointy top) its too small for my face to use all over so ive tried to use it to apply concealer under the eyes and although its pointy it pokes me and is unconfortable :/ so yeah other than that i love all the rest !</li>
    <li> I love this set, except for the pointed foundation brush.  It&#x27;s pointed alright.  I only used it once because it literally stabbed my face, causing my skin to react/break out in a small rash.  All of the other brushes are perfect, though.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great quality. But i wish they were a little more bigger! But overall  i liked them very much. My makeup looks flawless!</li>
    <li> Arrived so fast and are just as shown- beautiful</li>
    <li> Very nice brush set. I have been using them daily for months and they are holding up well. Feel soft and are effective.</li>
    <li> Box it came in was cracked thank goodness that part wasnt needed!</li>
    <li> Real Techniques brushes are the nest the buffing brush is awesome. I also use the concealer brush for blemishes, works great!</li>
    <li> I only really use the powder brush and the blush brush. the other two don&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes</li>
    <li> great brushes and great price compare to SIGMA. I bought this set and the starter set. love them. I don&#x27;t believe in buying high end brushes cuz I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but real technique is a really good investment. they help you achieve the perfect look honestly.</li>
    <li> I saw these on YOUtube and I love the pixiwoo girls. They obviously use and promote these brushes. I have to say they are even better than I thought. As a makeup artist, brushes are paramount and these little babies do not disappoint. They are soft, distribute the product beautifully and do not shed. I am so glad I have them in my collection.</li>
    <li> Wife was impressed but I wish I bought the full deluxe set...I know nothing about make-up.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooo soft and durable. I&#x27;ve had them for a few months now and have definitely roughly washed them with soap, but they still look like new afterwards!!! Great starter brush set for someone, it has all of the essentials and you can substitute the buffing brush for a blush brush. Just make sure that you wash them at least twice a month, especially your foundation brush. Wash the base of the hairs (near the handle) of the foundation brush really well and make sure you spread the hairs apart or else you can have some left over foundation stuck there for months and not even notice it if you don&#x27;t wash it properly- you&#x27;ll a tough time washing it out later on if you don&#x27;t .&lt;br /&gt; Amazing brush set for this price, can &#x27;t really get a better deal.  I even think that the brushes are softer than some MAC brushes of my mom&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve tried before. Only thing that they should fix for future editions, is making the whole handle gold- the black part tends to have foundation stains on there (from my hands) and you have to really scrub it to get it off. Besides that, I would go for it!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are real! I love the way they feel on your skin and the precision it gives your face. I have no idea why they are such good quality brushes for the price they sell for.  They also sell for $18 at ulta, but why buy them there when you&#x27;re getting a bargain here!? The shipping was fast too. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I love the entire kit but the Buffing Brush is my fave to use to apply liquid or cream foundation.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful the bushes are soft and brush on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes and love the finish they give! Only thing is that the Buffer brush absorbs some of my foundation so I have to use more with that brush than I would with my BeautyBlender. Still amazing tho!</li>
    <li> Awesome travel set.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s go!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes; quality order</li>
    <li> Three of my brushes were fine, one (the foundation brush), all the hair started falling out of it the second I took it out of the case. It thinned out majorly and i just didn&#x27;t feel like going through the trouble of returning. Unfortunate bc I heard great things about these brushes....</li>
    <li> These brushes have changed my makeup wearing experience. You will not regret buying this product. I even prefer them to the mac and sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes!! Very soft and perfect airbrushed looking finish!</li>
    <li> The foundation brush is amazing; soft but firm, durable, appropriately sized. The case is nice, but I&#x27;m not sure what the extra elastic bands are meant for. All in all, a great purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes. Definitely recommend. It comes with everything you need on a daily basis for your basic makeup routine and I love how it&#x27;s able to stand up.</li>
    <li> Whether you&#x27;re a makeup artist or just enjoy quality brushes these are a must for your makeup kit. They&#x27;re perfect for foundation application, blending, highlight and contour..</li>
    <li> Very very very goooooooood</li>
    <li> Just so so,the hair of brush is not soft enough.But</li>
    <li> Five stars!! Love this set!</li>
    <li> Liked so much ordered another set.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this set, excellent... From Venezuela!!</li>
    <li> best brushes I have ever purchased. No shedding plus they are very soft</li>
    <li> You get four brushes and all are of high quality.  I use the larger one the most for blending of liquid foundation.  It work perfectly.</li>
    <li> This was a really great brush set for the price!  The only one I don&#x27;t really use is the smallest brush for eyeshadow.  I recently lost my foundation brush somewhere, which was a shame.  I really fell in love with the size and shape of it which was perfect for liquid foundations.  The others helped to buff out any streakiness and apply blush/highlighthing/bronzer.  I quickly ditched the carrying case though..  It was a little bit of a pain to put them back in the straps every time and easier to just pop them in the compartment of my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes I&#x27;ve used. They are soft and provide great makeup coverage.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. I wish I bought it sooner, my only gripe is that I dont really use the foundation or small detail brush though.. they should replace that with a powder brush and better concealer brush</li>
    <li> I used to get brushes from sephora but those got pricey and the drug store brands weren&#x27;t cutting it. I got these and absolutely love them! Total steal for this price!</li>
    <li> pro but not that useful to me</li>
    <li> real Techniques sells great brushes at a good price.  I have been using these several years now and they stand up through a lot of washing and tossing on the counter</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great brushes</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister and she does not like it very much.</li>
    <li> best brush set i ever had  i like the contouring brush to the max</li>
    <li> great brushes!!!! they don&#x27;t shed at ALL and they are so soft</li>
    <li> I could honestly go on and on about these brushes, but I won&#x27;t. I will just say that these brushes are soft, densely packed, and do their respected jobs very well. I use them everyday; they clean easily, and are just the best brushes that I own. I have very sensitive skin, and I was scared that these brushes would do to my skin what my other brushes (my BareMinerals brushes, mind you) did. Which was scratch my skin, leaving it irritated and stingy, and leaving behind tons of hair on my face after every swipe. These are just wonderful by comparison! I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with shedding or fallout. I just love them.</li>
    <li> Very nice! I&#x27;m a sigma addicted, but this ones are just as good, for a much better price! super worth it!</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes, perfect!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! A must own.</li>
    <li> Use it EVERYDAY. Telling everyone about it!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is such a great value and you&#x27;ll get to travel with these. Bristles are soft and the size is just nice.</li>
    <li> Have been waiting on these brushes to be sold on amazon since they were developed. I must say that it was well worth the wait. The brushes are soft and perfect for applying cream and liquid products without streaking. I use all the brushes in the set and have even stopped using some of my more expensive makeup brushes in favour of these.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these brushes!</li>
    <li> Amazing for mineral makeup. I look amazing and get even coverage with every use</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. I always want to know whether the hairs fall out, and these DON&#x27;T. I use the biggest one for bronzer, next biggest for my finishing mineral veil, next for concealer, and last for eyes. Love.</li>
    <li> I loveee these brushes !!! Follow me on YouTube to see what you&#x27;ll be receiving if you wanna see exactly how they look : MY YOUTUBE USER NAME: jayeeeCeee !! I love themmmm</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for quality brushes at an affordable price you cannot do better than real Techniques or Ecotools.  They both have a range of synthetic bristle brushes that are as soft as any natural hair brush.  Synthetics also have superior performance with any wet formulas (liquid foundation, cream eyeshadow, etc) because they don&#x27;t absorb the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to various Mac, Trish McEvoy, Hourglass, and Bobbie Brown brushes I have a large collection of these real Techniques brushes, and I reach for them just as often.  They are worth it!</li>
    <li> The foundation buffing brush is phenomenal! I use it for liquid foundation and it buffs in flawlessly. The contour brush is perfect to apply my bronzer to contour under the cheekbones. The smaller foundation brush is a great brush for concealing under the eye. The super tiny brush is also a good brush to use with concealer to shape around your eyebrows. These brushes are so incredibly soft and of great quality. This is a steal on Amazon! Cheaper than the price at Ulta! LOVE &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t much about makeup brush comparison but these feel great and arrived quickly. The case is firm but flexible and converts to a stand which is convenient since I don&#x27;t like to put stuff on the counter when I travel. I washed them when I got them and they took about a day to fully dry so just keep that in mind when using for the first time. Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> love these brushes amazing quality . glides the product on.</li>
    <li> The shipping was really fast and the brushes are great. I love their textures. They aren&#x27;t itchy like some other brush brands. I plan on ordering more real technique brushes.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes!  Will purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> The names labeled on the side of each brush were faded. Beside that, the brush are in good condition. I&#x27;m glad I know which brush is use for what.</li>
    <li> Love love love this set. Super soft and grabs a lot of product with little effort. So impressed and obsessed! Easy control and I love how they label what the brushes are for and explain what it is meant to do. FOREVER USING RT! Don&#x27;t hesitate. BUY it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great value, great product! Soft on the face, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Great Brush set! I use this, along with the starter set, whenever I travel. They are great for blending and applying just the right amount of color and coverage. I recommend these to everyone who needs a travel set or is just starting out with makeup. it offers the best brushes for the face application without any confusion or extreme demand of technique.</li>
    <li> I love this set so much that I bought a second one as a gift. I love how it stands too. Great function and form!</li>
    <li> Perfect! It makes my makeup more beautiful and makes my foundation lasts more... i love it so much, specially the buffing brush</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes. They are a really nice quality, especially for the price. They hold up well after washing, fit comfortably in your hand, and do a great job of applying! Make sure you check out the pixiwoo video tutorials on youtube... definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
    <li> Great price for durable make up brushes. Love the carrying case that props up into a stand.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these brushes after seeing a vast amount of beauty gurus use them on YouTube. First of all, 2-day shipping Amazon Prime, my @$$! I basically received this package in regular 5-day shipping time, which was a huge disappointment after getting use to the speedy services of previous Amazon Prime orders. Second of all, it left my foundation looking streaky. I typically use my Beauty Blender or Sigma&#x27;s flat top F80 Kabuki brush to apply my MUFE HD foundation but wanted to give this a shot due to the hype. I was left unsatisfied and actually had to use 2 pumps of foundation as oppose to one because the brush wasn&#x27;t blending/buffing it so well and evenly on my face. If I were to keep one, I&#x27;d keep the contour brush. I found it to apply setting and contour powder fairly well in smaller, angled spaces. However, I would purchase that brush separately since this will definitely be a return for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice and soft. The bristles don&#x27;t easily come off but there are one or two strands that stick out longer than the others (easily chopped off). It arrived when they said it would! Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for. Bristles are soft but not flimsy. Variety of sizes is nice.</li>
    <li> These brushes are my absolute favorite. They aren&#x27;t flimsy like most brushes.</li>
    <li> The detailer brush sucks but the others work amazingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll just copy the comments left for the other brush I bought from this same line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup freak.  Once I began to use these brushes, my best friend commented on how good my skin looked!  I have a huge blotch on the right side of my cheek beginning right below my eye going down to the center of my cheek due to aging and sun damage from using Retin-A.  But using this brush to apply makeup seem to have improved my skin&#x27;s appearance so much to elicit the above comment from my friend who is a real FASHIONISTA!!  That&#x27;s what I call worth the money spent on these brushes.  I went ahead and also bought the other brushes in the line.  I am so pleased with the purchase and the results.</li>
    <li> I used the buffing brush a lot to apply foundation or tinted moisturizer.  I also use the contour brush frequently.  Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> These were my first purchase of Real Techniques.  Delighted with them.  Soft on the skin, easy to wash, love the long&lt;br /&gt;handles.</li>
    <li> I wish you could mix and match these brushes cuz i honestly never touch the foundation/concealer brush. Im sure they&#x27;re great brushes but i never gravitate towards them in any set. But the contour brush is perfect and so is the other brush idk what to call it tho but i use it for my powder and blending</li>
    <li> These are all you&#x27;ve heard they are and better.  I hav hi-end to low-end brushes and these are the best.  Way to go Sam and Nic.</li>
    <li> Love the champion color, and the detailer brush! I use it as a concealer brush, it does a very great job, better than a lot of higher brands.</li>
    <li> Very nicely packed! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great price for decent brushes! I do use these much!</li>
    <li> It‘s perfect！I would like to try another series for eyes.</li>
    <li> Gives good coverage on the face when you use it. Very easy to use and isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin either.</li>
    <li> So easy to use and amazing quality! No shedding!!!</li>
    <li> Love it ! I&#x27;m such a make up junkie. I have had real technique brushes before so there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to love these as well . The contour brush is my fave I use it for not just contouring but for highlighting as well. Very happy with the set of brushes totally recommended there are as good if not better then sephora &amp; Mac brushes an at a respnable cheaper price with great quality and durability .</li>
    <li> A must have! Very soft! Love them!</li>
    <li> Great set.  I use all the brushes for specific purposes.  Good deal!</li>
    <li> These are incredible yet budget-friendly brushes. I have pretty much all of the RT face brushes and love all of them. My only complaint about this set is that the foundation brush is rather small. That said, it&#x27;s pretty nice for concealing.</li>
    <li> Prefect Brush! I love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t need the cover, just the brushes would be fine.</li>
    <li> Works great. Things blended quite well.</li>
    <li> Just Okay, the detail brush and foundation brush was not as good.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes there so soft and Amazing😃😀</li>
    <li> I love this brush set, not only is it affordable it works great plus it comes with in a case so the brushes wont get damaged.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, you can get by with this set alone.  I don&#x27;t use the brushes as they are labeled - and to be honest, I&#x27;d never heard of Pixiwoo on YouTube when I bought these, I just wanted a set of soft brushes. I&#x27;ve purchased many brush sets over the years, both expensive natural hair and synthetics, and these brushes are the softest by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffing Brush:  So thick and plush! I have very sensitive skin and I can buff and buff my SSC minerals in, and no irritation at all. And sometimes when I use a cream to powder foundation, I spritz the end of the brush lightly w/water, dip the brush into the foundation - WOW! My face looks like it&#x27;s been air-brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contour Brush:  I use this for my blush 99% of the time, and the few times I use a highlighter above my cheekbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pointed Foundation Brush:  I only do two-shade neutral eyes, so I use this one for the lid eye-shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailer Brush:  This is \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to be used as a concealer brush or a lipstick brush, but I use this one to apply a pearlescent highlighter on my brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed them several times and they still look good as new, and I&#x27;ve yet to see any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m disappointed with is the case.  It doesn&#x27;t stand up all that easily (you pull a cord and fold it over, similar to a drawstring you&#x27;d have on the bottom of an anorak jacket).  After only 2 months, the elastic bands have stretched - pockets to store the brushes would have been better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to purchase these because some of my friends and a lot of Youtube gurus use and rave about these brushes! The delivery was super quick and I was very happy with these brushes! I used them for the first time today and my makeup looked so flawless on my skin!!! I definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> these brushes are soft and are great quality, i love to use them for foundation, powder and contour i think they are very affordable</li>
    <li> Very nice set of brushes.</li>
    <li> These are difficlult to store due ti it&#x27;s wide shape, but the brushes are amazing. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> the brushes are pretty good, except the contour brush because when i felt the brush the hairs were falling off! dissappointed.</li>
    <li> Good quality fibers and well constructed. This brand has a nice weight and heft to the brush. Easily cleaned with water and a drop of shampoo. Brush fibers dry straight and don&#x27;t frizz. I&#x27;m a hairdresser, and for the money this brand is a good deal. Applies makeup well, easy care, and bacteria resistant, and nice case for protection and hygiene. I recommend this set.</li>
    <li> good set specially for beginners</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes for an excellent price! I previously tried the Bestope brush set and the quality is no comparison. Real techniques seems to be the best option without breaking the bank. No shedding, sturdy, very soft but very dense.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints , my brushes haven&#x27;t shed and they make my application of my makeup flawless</li>
    <li> Great brushes...although I did abandon the case</li>
    <li> Is a excellent product!!! Beatifull!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft. Can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first set of Real Techniques brushes - I would definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> Super small, travel size small. I only use 2 out of the 4</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes today and I have to say that I really do love them! They are firm and easy to use. I gave them 4 stars because the shipping seemed to take forever.  Otherwise I am pleased and may end up purchasing another set in a few months!</li>
    <li> The buffing brush and contour brush are excellent. (great for applying powder products) The other two brushes I really dislike. The shape is terrible and because of that, they are super scratchy on the face. They have a sharp point to them so it almost feels like your face is getting stabbed by tiny prickly needles. Now the shape of the handles are also something I dislike. I store my brushes in a vase filled with rice and these are kind of bulky at the ends. (I wish they tapered in instead) If you store them in a container without rice, I found that the rubberized material on the ends get in the way of pulling the brushes out easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes. Every Real Techniques brush I&#x27;ve purchased is great quality. No problems whatsoever and the price is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Good quality, definitely purchase</li>
    <li> Getting this for my best friend because I have it. It&#x27;s a wonderful gift for any birthday or holiday. Quality brushes at a cheap price. They are truly amazing. Favorite brushes..&amp; they&#x27;re fine for beginners or makeup artists...they&#x27;re necessary for anyone who is trying to put on a god face basically! lol. Lovely product.</li>
    <li> Love it .. I ordered 4 and I don&#x27;t regret it ..Real techniques for me equal Sigma but a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT AND THE SUPER PACKAGING VERY VERY FAST DELIVERY&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> LOVE the buffing brush!! It gives great coverage and leaves you will the most airbrushed and flawless look! The contour brush is good for contouring lol (duh) and the foundation brush is actually a bit small for applying foundation so I like to use it to apply and blend out concealer under my eyes. The detailed brush is also good for applying lip color. Overall a nice kit ☺️</li>
    <li> I love these. However, be careful because it has counterfeit. I bought this set 2 times. the first time came as the real one. the price was a little higher, too. the 2nd time, what I got wasn&#x27;t the same with the first. It&#x27;s like of hurt when I use it. Especially if I use Detailer Brush to put lipstick on my lips, the tip of the brush HURT my lips! So i know this one is counterfeit. I asked amazon to send me a different set. And I can tell the different feelings when I have 2 of them on the hand. So, Buyers, don&#x27;t forget to try it, ALL 4 of the brushes before deciding to keep it :)</li>
    <li> For the price, this set is so good! Each individual brush costs more so its a great deal. That buffer brush leaves my skin flawlessly blended and that detailer brush is so useful too. I thought the pointed foundation brush would be a bit bigger but it doesnt matter because I just use it when I want a more concentrated full coverage look. Oh and the fluffy contour brush is amazing! I use it to highlight too. Overall, amazing brushes. So soft and durable and beautiful!</li>
    <li> The price for these brushes is well worth it, especially since they are less than $15. I got these almost a year ago and they don&#x27;t shed and spread product very evenly. Bottom Line: I very highly recommend these brushes to anyone who loves a face beat to the gods!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes - incredible quality for the price. I&#x27;ve had mine for over three years and it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re brand new; they&#x27;re holding up really well.</li>
    <li> Good price and nice quality brushes. I use them for powders and blending some foundations and concealers. Also easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> Very good, came in a new, sealed box.</li>
    <li> returning this. Just not a very high quality product in my opinion. I have the real techniques foundation brush and I incorrectly thought that brush was in this set. It isn&#x27;t but the brushes just aren&#x27;t worth keeping to me!</li>
    <li> Actually i just need one of those collections,but i really like it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Good quality. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love them! Very good quality product.</li>
    <li> Lovee how soft these brushes are and perfect results</li>
    <li> The buffing brush is my all time favorite foundation applicator. I also like the small rounded brush for contouring. My only complaint is that due to my sensitive skin I&#x27;m required to wash my brushes weekly with a deep cleanser to remove any bacteria and the buffing brush began to shed horribly and needed to be replaced. It lasted almost a year before the first bristle fell out though so definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, professional quality for a reasonable price. The face brush is my fav. Blends liquid and cream foundation quickly and easily. The lip brush/detail brush is great too. These are a part of my freelance kit.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. I use them every day! Very good quality for the price! I love makeup brushes in general, and I was so excited to see these brushes were so inexpensive! Professional or amature these are the brushes for you! I can wait to buy the purple eye set too! The brushes are very fluffy and dense and VERY soft. They are pefect for putting on your foundation or even contouring. Would definitely recommend to friends and family, and will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Good quality and great product</li>
    <li> Best starter brush set ever! Soft brushes. Cleans easily! This set contains all your basic foundation starter applicators.</li>
    <li> Core Collection Set is superb quality. Especially the buffing and the conturing ones. They are very sooooft . I just didn&#x27;t like the foundation brush bec of its size but i use it with my concealer :)) The detailer brush is good for lips.So you must realllly have this set and the other rt products if you like make-up.</li>
    <li> The detailer brush is really too little for me to use. I really like the other brushes though. They are quite soft and you can tell they are well made. I like the longer handle. The case is a good idea, but it&#x27;s not a necessity.</li>
    <li> Well made. I like them.</li>
    <li> I have never owned such a nice pair of make-up brushes! They&#x27;re soft on the skin and they truly do provide a much more even coverage when using liquid foundation. I am not a make-up artist or one who wears a ton of make-up, but I really like how easy these are to use.</li>
    <li> I am very picky on the types of brushes that I use and always end up having to buy the very expensive one to get the look I want. I am a makeup artist and this paint so well I have no complaints with them. I will continue buying and recommending this product to everyone I  know!</li>
    <li> It was a present for my sister and She love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this set after purchasing the Real Techniques Stippling Brush and Expert Face brush. (I have reviews on both of those products as well, if you&#x27;d like to view those too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with the first two brushes I purchased from this brand, so I knew I just had to have the Core set.  The Buffing brush in this set is my absolute favorite brush!! I have not found another buffing brush with the quality this one has! It is so soft on my sensitive skin, and picks up pressed and loose powders perfectly! They sit easily on the top of the brush without falling down next to the ferrule, which makes cleaning super easy!  I have not had any shedding at all with this brush and I use it daily, as well as doing &#x27;Sanitary Cleanings&#x27; Daily. (Using a makeup cleaning spray to spray bristles, and then wiping on tissue to get product I just used off.)  I also deep clean/shampoo my brushes once a week, sometimes twice depending on what products I use, and I still have not witnessed any shedding and I have had this set for quite awhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Contour Brush is my second favorite in this set.  The length and shape of the bristles are perfect for what it&#x27;s intended use is.  Again; these soft, plush, synthetic bristles pick product up easily and truly make for a beautiful finish.  Cleaning this brush, is also super easy! No shedding so far with this brush either!  As well as contouring with this brush, I also like to use it for highlighting. It&#x27;s the perfect shape for highlighting under my eyes, above my brow, and on the tops of my cheeks!  I use this brush with powder and creme bronzers and/or highlighters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third fave brush in this set is the detailer brush (the smallest brush).  I use this brush after I have applied my foundation to smooth my liquid out under my eyes, so it wont settle into my wrinkles under eye; as well as the corners of my nose so my foundation doesn&#x27;t look cakey in those tight corners.  I clean this brush with my makeup brush sanitary cleaner (the spray/tissue method) daily. Since the brush is so small, I don&#x27;t normally do deep cleanings because I don&#x27;t dip the tips in any product, rather I just smooth the bristles over product in few areas of my face.  You could also use this brush to apply lipsticks, as you would a lipstick brush. It&#x27;s the perfect size for that if you have a lip compact vs an actual lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite brush is the foundation brush.  To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even used this brush at all yet. It just stays in the brush pouch.  I have never seen a foundation brush that small! It is super small, more like a concealer brush than a foundation brush.  I guess I don&#x27;t too much mind though, since I don&#x27;t apply my foundation with those kind of brushes. I like to use UD&#x27;s Optical Blurring Brush. (It&#x27;s ahhh-mazing for liquid foundations!)  So, this poor lil guy just sits in the pouch until I can find some use for it, or maybe if one of my friends wants it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All, in all, I do love Real Techniques brushes!  It comes with a pouch, that you can use to sit upright on your counter (Like in the picture of the product), but I&#x27;ve never used it that way. It doesn&#x27;t really seem practical.  I have other ways of storing brushes, like in vanity cups, or my acrylic vanity organizers.  So, like the foundation brush, the pouch is hidden away and doesn&#x27;t get used either.  Another good point to mention about these brushes is the way they are made. They all are pretty round and have a big base with a flat bottom, so when you are applying your makeup and switch to another brush, you can sit the brush upright on your counter and don&#x27;t have to lay it flat. This is good if you plan on using the brush again during the same makeup application so you don&#x27;t have to lay it down with product on and get bacteria, dirt, etc onto the bristles and put it back on your face. Yuk! Who wants that?  All the brushes are also labeled on the handles so you will never forget what kind of brush itis, and they also have Samantha Chapman&#x27;s beautiful signature on the handle in pretty writing.  The colors of the brushes are very beautiful as well! I love the bright golds, pinks, and purples! It makes for a great makeup brush collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unfortunate thing about this set is that you can NOT buy these brushes separately! Big Frown!  I would love to have a couple more of the Buffing Brushes and another Contour brush. Unfortunately, if I want another one, I would have to buy the whole set again.  This means another pouch and ridiculously small foundation brush hiding in my drawer.  But, I guess it&#x27;s good marketing done by Real Techniques...more money, right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many more brushes I anticipate on trying from this line because I have fallen so deeply in love with the ones I have.  Honestly, these brushes are high end quality, with a Wal-Mart budget! *wink wink* I highly recommend Real Techniques to all my friends, family, and whomever is reading this!  You wont regret it! Your makeup brush collection will thank you, as well as your face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo J.McCranie</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes all around. However I only use the buffing and contour brush. The buffing brush works flawlessly with my mineral powder foundation. The contour brush is small so its great at placing the bronzer exactly where you want it and blend effortlessly. I cannot speak about the other two brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush is not soft, and makes my face painful. I have to put it aside after twice of use.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes. They don&#x27;t shed.  The buffing brush applies foundation so effortlessly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Imitator&lt;br /&gt;مقلده وغير اصليه</li>
    <li> Perfect. The brushes are so soft and I see no fall out. Already used them multiple times. Definitely recommend these and will buy the other brushes too.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this brush set.  The brushes are great for blending foundation and contouring.  The case is if great use when you are using them all at once and for keeping them all together.</li>
    <li> I got the name of this brand during my makeup class they are very soft they feel amazing and  they are also very durable nice pouch also helps to keep it organized</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic. I love the handles, they have a nice subtle weight to them and feel so well made. The brushes are extremely soft. I am a huge fan of brushes with white tips as I feel they are typically softer, better quality, and it&#x27;s easy to see when they get dirty; all of these points are true with this fantastic brush set. They also wash very well and dry faster than any of my other brushes. This is a great set and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I placed the order for these brushes yesterday evening at 6 pm and they were delivered today at 1:40 pm. This was the fastest shipping I&#x27;ve ever received on anything! As for the brushes, I&#x27;ve wanted them for a long time but they were $17 at Bed Bath and Beyond so when I saw them for this price I decided to go for it. They&#x27;re really soft and sturdy. I have other real technique brushes and I love them way more than my Sigma ones because they&#x27;re softer and they hold up better over time. The only brush in this set that I can&#x27;t see myself using very often is the smallest one (the detailer brush) because I tend to use fluffier brushes on my eyes and I rarely apply lipstick with a brush. Overall I think this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Basic brushes that you need. Good for beginner. I use the buffing brush the most and I LOVE it. &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re very soft and help when applying makeup. If you do not have the money for sigma and do not want e.l.f. brushes purchase these. They have not shed on me and I&#x27;ve washed them plenty of times. The case does come in handy when your traveling so keep them, do not throw it out.</li>
    <li> Although I use them for different purposes than what is stated on the brushes themselves. I use the pointed foundation brush as a blending brush for my eyeshadow, and I use the smallest brush for lining my eyes rather than for concealer. I do use the contour brush for contouring though  it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Not a big fan of the case but the brushes are excellent.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the case/stand that the core collections come with and how low the cost is for 4 sturdy brushes but I must say I don&#x27;t use these brushes for what they are &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be used for granted that is the point, your brushes are supposed to be versatile.&lt;br /&gt;The contour brush- I use to set my highlight.&lt;br /&gt;The pointed foundation brush- I don&#x27;t use at all because it&#x27;s just too stiff.&lt;br /&gt;The detailer brush- I don&#x27;t use at all because I&#x27;m not sure what i could use it for.&lt;br /&gt;The buffing brush- I used for my liquid foundation which works great but I changed to Real Techniques stippling brush (which gives a WAY better finish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use these brushes on anyone else&#x27;s face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that was helpful and you can find uses for all of these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL this was a good buy!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of brushes. They&#x27;re very soft and have a nice structure. I feel like I&#x27;m giving my face a massage when I use them to apply powder. These are also good for contouring.</li>
    <li> The buffing brush is beyond amazing, have not tried other brushes yet but I heard so much good reviews and everyone it&#x27;s right when they say they are soft brushes but yet gives you such flawless results. And um yeah this is the real not generic kind so don&#x27;t worry these are the real deal. Im very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> very good product, very soft on your face.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with these brushes. The buffing brush in particular is really good for buffing in liquid foundation, and the countour brush is the perfect size for the hollows of your cheeks. Another good thing about these brushes is that they keep their shape and softness even after you&#x27;ve washed them multiple times. Definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t really find much of a use for the foundation brush and the detailer brush. I generally prefer the buffing brush over the foundation brush for liquid foundation, and I think the detailer brush is just too small to do anything other than cover spots, if you have any. Overall though, the set is worth the money if you&#x27;re looking for a really nice finish with your foundation.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes to do my entire face, so with that said these brushes are amazing!</li>
    <li> The main  reason i got this set was because i heard so many people rave about how good it was and the cost. I decided to give them a try in hopes that i did not waste my money. I HIGHLY recommend this product! The bristles are very soft and gentle, not to mention it applies my products very smooth and gentle.</li>
    <li> Delivered fast and the brushes are good and comfortable</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of these brushes because the price is so reasonable. But they are really soft and actually made my make up look much better. I wish I found these a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mostly rating this for the buffing brush which is amazing! I use it with a bb cream and it gives a smooth look! It helps minimize my pores as well. The other brushes I haven&#x27;t tried yet but I considered them extra since all I was really after was the buffing brush.</li>
    <li> awesome!! Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do without this set, I think these brushes should be the core to anyone&#x27;s brush collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffing Brush I use to apply and blend foundation, the smaller round brush is great for setting under the eyes, highlighting, or contouring, the pointed foundation brush I use to apply and blend concealer under the eyes, and the small precision brush I use to line the eyes or apply lip product. I own two sets!</li>
    <li> It worth than price,love it !</li>
    <li> If you just starting out and experimenting on makeup this product is a great start. Its not too expensive and it gets the job done. What i like is the different variety you get with this packet. This is a great brush to have as you continue to grow in the makeup world, im sure you would get better brush as you go along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not fake as it&#x27;s says</li>
    <li> I love Real techniques and after purchasing the &#x27;travel essentials&#x27; set was kind of disappointed with this set. The brushes seemed (bristle wise) smaller than I thought they would be and the &#x27;pointed foundation brush&#x27; feels kind of cheap (the travel essentials foundation brush is much better). When I received them some of the bristles were also falling out (pictures included). All in all happy with 3/4 of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Nice brush set! I work as a make up artist and use the face brush as my foundation brush personally. I also use the Sigma F80 and prefer the sigma over this one, but only by a very slight margin. The sigma brush is almost twice as expensive as this entire set, so if you are just looking for personal use or want a good set of brushes to start out with I&#x27;d recommend the set. the small detailer brush is also nice for some inner corner highlighting, and the other two brushes I use for concealer and to gently brush off fall out eye shadow fro under the eyes, or to set foundation with powder on smaller areas. One point deduction, because if you clean these brushes twice a week with rubbing alcohol and brush cleaner the glue will dissolve over time and the bristles will shed, BUT this took almost a year for me and since I work with make up I do clean those brushes a lot more than a person that just uses these brushes for themselves. Personally, I don&#x27;t think you necessarily need the other brushes, unless you are really into make up. If you are simply looking for a nice foundation brush for a great value this real Techniques set is a wonderful choice!</li>
    <li> Perfect soft end brush and I have extremely sensitive skin and it was perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter plays with makeup for hours at the time so good quality is very important! So far so good! She loves the brushes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Mac brush girl and find I was using these more!  I like the larger brush for powder and the 2nd biggest one for highlighter on cheeks. The eye make-up brushes are too flat for what I want to use them for... But I do use them for smudging.  The large brush is worth the set price alone.  Very soft and no shedding.  I threw the case away and keep then in my brush cup at home.</li>
    <li> Wife LOVES them!  Exactly what she wanted and arrived quickly with no issues!</li>
    <li> Decided to buy these brushes after reading stellar reviews here and on other websites. I wanted to up my makeup game without spending a fortune. This set is great (I threw the case away like other reviewers). I don&#x27;t care for the concealer brush, and I use the small brush for shadow. But I use the blush and foundation brush EVERY TIME I do my makeup. They are thick and soft. The domed foundation brush is unlike anything I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ll never go back. It&#x27;s worth the set just for those two amazing brushes. Much cheaper here than Ulta (even on sale). You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Spring for the eye set too!</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes. They are super soft &amp; don&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> soft brushes, great for the price</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected, the reviews were so great I thought it&#x27;d be a very full brush. Definitely not as great as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> Love their brushes. Such a great price for the quality. Highly recommend for those trying to get a good set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I have heard many good things about Real Techniques brushes, and they have lived up to their reputation so far. I have only had them for a day now, but love them. I have used all but the small pointed foundation brush, I am a little disappointed with that one only that it is way to small for all over full coverage foundation, like I apply. It is great for concealer more than anything. I am so happy with them though, I received them on time and in perfect condition. The only other thing I was a little disappointed with was the case, it&#x27;s very &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; looking and feels like it could easily break or ripe, then again this sale was about the brushes and not the case. I recommend this set to anyone who wants to add a few more good brushes to there collection, or for first timers, just starting there makeup journey as a starter kit basically.</li>
    <li> My daughter picked this out. Great price and soft brushes. She had been shopping around and this was her pick.</li>
    <li> I love this set with the exception of the foundation brush. This product loses a star because the foundation brush has been shedding like crazy. It sheds during gentle washes, sheds during application, I&#x27;m almost amazed I have and bristles left at all! Other than the shedding problem the brush is great for a first timer like me. This is my first foray into the world of makeup brushes, but the buffing, blush, and detailing brushes are wonderful. Super soft, very clean and wonderful application. If you buy this set maybe try a stippling brush, or a different foundation brush.</li>
    <li> LOVE the price, love the quality! I&#x27;m a SAHM who loves make up but who is alas, on a budget. I read reviews about these brushes and decided to try them - they&#x27;re fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> real techiques brush is good product for me. easy to clean and i think it is best make up tool for me.</li>
    <li> i love it so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hair of the brushes never falls&lt;br /&gt;and the price is very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that i didn&#x27;t like about it the case!&lt;br /&gt;it is really hard to back the brushes to its place</li>
    <li> I love it! Well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always seeing or hearing the hype for this brushes now i know why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the case for the brushes aren&#x27;t that nice but nonetheless it&#x27;s all about the brushes!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order these brushes after purchasing a similar one from another wholesaler I decided to purchase a set since it was being offered as a reasonable price. I am not disappointed these are quality brushes just as well as sigma brushes. The brush is a soft make-up application using this brush is flawless certainly no streaks nor shedding as in the case of the cheaper brands</li>
    <li> My niece has really enjoyed these make up brushes, and believe me, she has spent some money on this type of stuff.</li>
    <li> I love them, it&#x27;s easy to clean, is very soft, does not transfer, has the perfect size to use and to load everywhere. I recommend very much.</li>
    <li> I Love, love, love this set! I ordered it after watching it being used in several make-up tutorials and I can not say enough about these brushes. The pouch that it came in is also great!</li>
    <li> the core collection is perfect for applying all face makeup... well almost all. it is a great collection. super cheap and awesome quality. but it is a great idea to purchase the starter set, a stipple, and powder brush so that you have great brushes for every makeup use.</li>
    <li> Very excellent and I am very satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> I looooooooove this set!  It is perfect for on the go and has a professional application.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this Set, high quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> good brushes！I like them~</li>
    <li> The buffing brush provides amazing airbrush look and the coverage is way more good but NOT CAKEY~! It&#x27;s similar to the SIGMA F80 but a bit less dense so easier to manipulate. Just amazing~!&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush is good but I don&#x27;t use it that much , only when I didn&#x27;t wash the buffing brush. I&#x27;ts great, there isn&#x27;t any marks of the brush, doesn&#x27;t affect the coverage. It&#x27;s good but I too much in love with the buffing one that I don&#x27;t use it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The countour brush is good, a bit too hard so not easy to manipulate but once you know how it works it&#x27;s really good! It&#x27;s good for blush, contour and it blends super easy~! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The pointed brush for concealer is a bit too long, I mean, the hairs are too long so the concealer isn&#x27;t really precise. I cover my acne with it and because I don&#x27;t want a really heavy coverage, I only conceal blemishes one by one so I&#x27;m almost undetectable but with this brush it&#x27;s a bit hard but still OK.&lt;br /&gt;I like this set and if you don&#x27;t want to have a lot of brushes, you can really only buy this set and your face will look AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> The brushes live up to their hype! All are super soft, easy to clean and give off an amazing finish.</li>
    <li> the brush is soft! It looks beautiful! Apply great application! I love real techniques brushes! Never fail to disappoint me!</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Make sure to keep them clean or they streak. Great value !</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, soft and easy to handle. Very well made and affordable. The only think I don&#x27;t like is that some of the head of the brushes are very small.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE them so much. I purchased the stippling brush, foundation brush &amp; the other collection either. I like them all, but i actually not really fun of the foundation brush,&lt;br /&gt;But i used for some other thingy so its still worth it. All in all i highly recommend it:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. I have had one set of them since they first came on the market. I ordered a second set because I wanted a second contour brush. I use one for bronzer and contouring and the other for blush. I also adore the buffing brush. Sam is amazing and I love all of the Real Techniques brushes. They are all so soft and such great quality.</li>
    <li> In love with my brusht set. It is authentic from what I have compared and seen. I bought these to replace my first set from the long use. They last a long time! My only pet peeve is the foundation brush every time its always felt a lack of quality in the specific brush... I recommend for your beginning brush set!</li>
    <li> SERIOUSLY YOU GUYS! Specially the buffing brush! which is my personal favorite brush of ALL TIME. I use it for under eye concealer because it blends such a flawless finish without a minimal effort! I also use the contour brush for highlighter and love it too, the pointed foundation for eye primer and the detailer brush for lips. Also, this brushes wash beautifully within hours!</li>
    <li> I have ordered in total 3 in past. I bought one for my mom, sis and myself. Quality brushes for the price asked. I usually clean them with mixture of Olive oil and dawn and sun dry them. Quality is the maintained- Using it from nearly 2 years and will still use them.... Buy it with out any doubt. I am not a professional make up person but I occasionally go for full make up for a night out. I find them helpful to apply as I don&#x27;t use more 3 products on my face. For girls who need the whole set of 12 or 14 kinds should not buy this. This could be perfect for traveling too as it comes with a brush kit.</li>
    <li> Good set. The liquid foundation brush is a tad small for my liking. I absolutely love the buffing brush to set my foundation &amp; the contour brush is nice too!</li>
    <li> Wow. I ordered to see what was the rave for,and these are super good. I used it for everything now,i&#x27;ll may order an extra to use.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist in video production... and these brushes are perfect!  They&#x27;re sturdy and very soft to the touch.  As well as actually cruelty free!  A lot of brushes claim to be animal friendly - then are made with actual animal fur/hair?! Not cool.  And not a factor with these great brushes.</li>
    <li> Great set. It looks lovely on the vanity, with sturdy quality and washes well. The bristles are soft and packed tight. I use the buffing brush everyday for foundation, it&#x27;s quick with flawless results.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! for a great price!</li>
    <li> I went through so many brushes that cost anywhere from 5 bucks to 80 bucks , and these are my favorite, the price point is really great and they are durable and super soft. I would deff recommend these for a novice and a beauty junkie as well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING! I want them all in every single shape and style. Cant get enough! You neeeeed these in your life!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality makeup brushes! Love these! So soft and they don&#x27;t shed :)</li>
    <li> great quality brushes, no shedding and very soft</li>
    <li> I use all of these brushes every day. They are such an amazing value because they are very high quality. If you need to add some staples to your brush collection, this set and the real techniques eye set are really all you need.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! They were a great price, easy to clean and came with a nice case. I am planning on getting more real technique brushes soon they are a great quality and price. I recommend these they are holding up great and I have had them for a while.</li>
    <li> I am in love with all of the real technique brushes.  For the money they do the jobs very nicely.  Does not lose bristles.  Very soft</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice! I have mac, chanel, sigma brushes which are all very pricey, but these brushes are just as nice or maybe even a bit better. I love them! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about them where the bottoms of them are very bulky so its a little harder to store compared to a pointed bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes however work amazingly! I really love them and use them everyday!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these makeup brushes, I used to think the brush didn&#x27;t matter but after spending money on higher end products the brush does make a huge difference. I had originally purchased the powder brush from Ulta and liked it so much that I ordered these the very next day. They wer $10 more so getting them here was also the best deal as far as price wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order the shadow brushes next from this brand.</li>
    <li> Very good,fast international delivery</li>
    <li> Probably one of my favorite sets of make up brushes. The bristles are soft and pick up a great amount of product. You can not go wrong with these brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are so soft and pick up product so well.</li>
    <li> Very soft taklon brushes. Good for blending. Easy to wash and maintain. Extremely value for money and can rival pro brushes :)</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft yet still manage to get the job done properly and makes my foundation look even. Not like other make up brushes where the product will stick to the bristles and gather bacteria. Lovely brushes will definitely end up buying more of these :)</li>
    <li> I just started wearing makeup a couple of years ago. I usually apply the makeup using the applicator included in the casing. So, RT brushes are my first ever makeup brushes and they work great. Each brush is very easy to use, especially with the instructions on the box. The bristles are very soft for my skin and don&#x27;t cause irritation. My favorites are the buffing brush for face powder and the contour brush for blusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to wash them yet, but I hope the brushes will stay intact and won&#x27;t shed with frequent cleaning.</li>
    <li> I  really love my new brushes! The bristles are so soft and they make my skin look amazing! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are quite nice, easy to clean and hold up very well. Bristles are soft and do not irritate skin or leave an itchy feeling like some of the cheap brushes. Recommend!</li>
    <li> The best brushes I own , I loved the these brushes are perfect they are so soft they make my mackeup look better , I would recommend these brushes to everyone buy them therer are great</li>
    <li> Girls don&#x27;t be fooled!! I mostly bought this for the larger brush, because I like to use a buffing brush to apply liquid foundation. Unfortunately the largest brush was on the smaller side :( Also the smallest brush is pretty much useless as of right now, maybe in the future i will find a use for it.</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup brushes. The quality of the brushes are great. No brush hair fall outs or damages. The brushes are soft and dense where makeup will be apply beautifully. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or irritation. I highly recommend real techniques brushes because they&#x27;re great and affordable.</li>
    <li> this set is so cheap, about 2 50 a brush but i would pay20-30 just for the buffing brush in this set love them!</li>
    <li> The best brushes by far even more then the expensive brushes. These work way better then my sigma brushes. I have a smaller face so these work perfect to blend</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes, will buy more from the real techniques line</li>
    <li> I recommand it and I&#x27;m so happy with my new prushes :)&lt;br /&gt;I use it , so good , Nouf</li>
    <li> Works great, bristles are soft and dense. And handles are easy to grip!</li>
    <li> Best brushes I ever used. Love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. I worship Sam&#x27;s videos and decided to purchase these brushes in May and I can honestly say they&#x27;re my go-to brushes. They&#x27;re a bit smaller than I expected but that&#x27;s not a problem for me at all, it&#x27;s actually a good thing and I love how they look different from other brushes. And they are so SOFT and affordable. I swear this set was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite brushes. I use MAC and sephora and bdellium tools brushes usually but since I&#x27;ve received these I have yet to use any of my other ones. The buffing brush and the contour brush I use every day. I&#x27;ve washed them once since I&#x27;ve gotten them and they&#x27;re still fine which is more than I could say for other brushes in this price range.</li>
    <li> They were delivered in a great time. I didn&#x27;t think that were made that great but you get what you paid for. At least i have brushes now.</li>
    <li> This set came in with really handy brushes that I use everyday. The contour/blush brush is my favourite one. The powder one is also really good. The ones that I use less are the small foundation brush and the lip/concealer brush. These are good too, although the small foundation brush is my least favourite because it does not feel as well as the others on the skin (however it is not bad at all, rather good).</li>
    <li> These brushes have been absolutely amazing and exactly what I was looking for! Great quality and great price!</li>
    <li> I love it.Its very good！</li>
    <li> I use this set every day.  It is a very nice quality set. I use one brush for applying liquid foundation and the bigger brush to apply loose powders.  Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good quality! But then I have to return for I found something half the  price but  with same quality. But definitely this is a good brand! I love everything if this goes on sale I might buy this again!</li>
    <li> I consider that may this product is fake.</li>
    <li> Very convenient set. I use the three big ones a lot.</li>
    <li> Really like these brushes. Purchased after hearing so much about them. They work like a charm and are at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> I had a long review that disappeared, but these brushes are awesome. They are super soft, but not flimsy. They pick up and distrubte color well.  I am very pleased. After I purchased this set, I ended up buying 2 powder brushes, the eye set, the blush brush, the setting, brush, and a few others. These brushes and the Coastal Scents brushes are taking over both my personal and professional kits.</li>
    <li> I love real techniques brushes, and I love this pack. However, I don&#x27;t use all of the brushes for their recommended use. I mainly bought this set for the bronzer brush, which I ADORE. It&#x27;s perfect for contouring. The pointed foundation brush I would never actually use for foundation. Instead, I use it for my under eye concealer, but it can leave streaks so I tend to rub it in with my fingers afterwards. The detailer brush could work great for concealer on spots, but I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with blemishes so I usually use it to set my waterline with black shadow after applying eyeliner. I think that it can definitely have many uses. Lastly, the buffing brush- I use it for blush, I find that the real techniques blush brush is far too large, especially since I&#x27;m not a huge blush fan to begin with. It could totally be used for powder foundation, as recommended, or liquid as well, but I prefer the expert face brush. Overall, great purchase, my favorite being the bronzer brush.</li>
    <li> Overall the whole set is excellent and of really high quality along with the pouch. My only beef is with the foundation brush that it is not that good for foundation use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get get the hype about these. They&#x27;re too stiff to me. Like my Sigma Cosmetics brushes WAY BETTER</li>
    <li> my daughter wanted this and it is a good product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! It&#x27;s very soft and does a wonderful job blending/ smoothing out my make-up. I would highly recommend them because they&#x27;re affordable and are great quality!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes. They have not come apart at all. They feel good on my skin and do the job. They came quickly in the mail which is always a plus!!!</li>
    <li> I needed some new brushes that would hold up better and give me a better finish/application. I am not afraid to wash these since ether do hold up better than all of my other brands of brushes ( however I am still careful and conscious when I wash them.) I wash them weekly to some times every few days ( depends on the brushes I use and their how often they are used)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The board that comes with the brushes is stupid. It is hard to put the brushes in and out of the elastic. It is clumsy and just overall a pain. I keep my brushes in a jar instead.</li>
    <li> Looooooove it so much  iam so happy the shipping was so  fast and good service it got a soft hair i will buy all real techniqes brushes and the price so nice too .</li>
    <li> I Love this brushes. didn&#x27;t expect to get this quality for this money. will buy more. I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Want all of them.</li>
    <li> Very nice. They are soft, wash well and most importantly apply makeup well.</li>
    <li> I really like this smaller brush set for when I travel.  It has been working out really well and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> These brushes were perfect!! Just as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of brushes but I really LOVE this set!! This is not a cheep brush set that leaves bristles on your face or all over the floor while you&#x27;re using them. These are the real deal and I am very happy that I have them in my vanity room. You will NOT regret buying these brushes. When you get your set and use them you will be doing your girlfriends a favor by recommending them to your friends as well. They&#x27;ll love you for it. I paid a fortune for my MAC brushes but I could have saved a couple hundred dollars buying these in the first place. Awesome product!! I want every brush this company makes now. Seriously!!</li>
    <li> Very soft.  Haven&#x27;t you them. But I&#x27;m favorite YouTuber uses them so I&#x27;m sure there great.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these brushes! Very soft and easy to clean. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the bristles coming out of the brush and onto my face. Great price and great quality. I love Real Techniques!</li>
    <li> As i expected thank you</li>
    <li> Best brushes I have ever bought. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product is very good,except for the fact that the shipping is very expensive. It says that it is only 13, and then your like &amp;#34; what a steal!&amp;#34; and then you realize how much the shipping is.</li>
    <li> I love these! And they are cheap.</li>
    <li> Great brush set! I love the contour brush. It works so well</li>
    <li> Omg! the minute you owe a real techniques set of brush you won&#x27;t have to buy any more.  These brushes are fully packed it they are soft and easy to work with.  I really love them, you won&#x27;t have a problem blending things together because they work beautiful.  I give it a 5 out of 5.  I wash them all the time and they don&#x27;t even shed, they are just wonderful and the price was very cheap.</li>
    <li> I want to start out by saying that I was surprised to see how cheap these brushes were,  because the quality is outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own more expensive brushes from other high end companies,  and I can easily say these brushes definitely compare to - and have out-performed - some of my more expensive ones.  I was pleasantly surprised  by the ease of application,  and blending was a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How they felt on my face was an extra bonus.  They didn&#x27;t feel scratchy,  but they were extra soft - it was like I was brushing feathers across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for decent brushes without having to break the bank,  then these are your best bet.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for such an affordable price. I don&#x27;t really like the stand it came with, doesn&#x27;t really work for me. One of the brushes also doesn&#x27;t fit in the band so it was hard to get in and out. Otherwise, the brushes are great quality.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel like the small brush fits into this set but nonetheless there brushes are great. They&#x27;re soft and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because I&#x27;ve heard good things about them.  However, I was not thoroughly impressed with all of them.  The contour brush isn&#x27;t great for contouring, in my opinion.  I sometimes use it for blush. The buffing brush is my favorite!! It&#x27;s amazing for applying foundation.  The line brush is okay for eye shadow.  The last brush, I actually use for eye shadow too.</li>
    <li> Buy these brushes now!! They work with your makeup in a way you can&#x27;t imagine unless you&#x27;re a professional makeup artist...and I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;d watch makeup tutorial where they&#x27;d name all the brushes they&#x27;d use, that in themselves usually cost more than my cosmetics!!&lt;br /&gt;I dreamed of being able to use professional brushes, really curious to see if they made all that difference and THEY DO!!&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are a dream..they&#x27;re beautifully made, never shed, soft as kittens, yet springy and resilient. They&#x27;re totally synthetic and vegan quality. Till you&#x27;ve applied Make Up Forever HD foundation with the buffing brush ( included here) or stippling brush ( bought separately for £10)  you&#x27;ve not seen what foundation can do for you. But I guess it will work with any good foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give yourself a treat and try them. They&#x27;re designed and made by Sam( antha) Chapman who is a professional makeup artist, and appointed trainer for Avon UK. She publishes tutorials with her sister Nic ..as Pixiwoo  On YouTube.  If you look at her later videos you can see her using these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best brushes, bet price...FABULOUS!!</li>
    <li> its okay. i was hyped because off too many good reviews. the shipping was fast and the items are in good condition. the brushes are good but not the ones that will make an impression.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a severe allergy to most makeups &amp; brushes.  We were told to try these &amp; we both are amazed at how much better her skin is.  These brushes are finer silk &amp; therefore don&#x27;t clog up with tons of makeup &amp; facial oils.  Even though she could go longer between cleanings, she chooses to clean them more often than recommended without any degradation to the brushes.  Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great travel container so the brushes are not twisted in your suitcase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush set for my wife and she loves it. The brushes are very sturdy and the brush case/stand is perfect. The brushes look and feel like a high-end professional set, but at a fraction of the cost. They use synthetic bristles instead of natural hair and I feel that it helps to keep them in good shape. My wife washes her brushes regularly and they are still in excellent condition. If you follow proper steps in both washing, drying, and storing, your brushes should last a long time as well. You can easily find tutorials online regarding proper handling and care and I suggest you do it.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Everything is amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and they are my favorite makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I love love love the foundation blending brush; it&#x27;s my new every day brush.  The bristles are very soft with no falling out.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes expecially for the price. The buffing brush is a can&#x27;t do without brush and blends your minerail powder foundation like butta......a must have set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They are soft and allow a novice like me apply makeup like a pro. Totally worth the price as you would pay quite a bit more in the drugstore or even Walmart.  I highly recommend these brushes and if they wear out I will definitely repurchase.  These are really great brushes.</li>
    <li> What value for money - easy to recommend. These function as any high end brush (depending on use and need) but for a price lower than a bargain set. I have three sets of REAL Techniques and find these to work so so well. OK, some will not like these - and that will always be the case, but for the price little to lose, and I feel a lot to gain. If you are a MUA and need spare brushes for busy shoots - add 2-3 sets to the cart. No kidding.</li>
    <li> Bought this just for the buffing brush, the rest are just added bonuses!&lt;br /&gt;Love all of these brushes, they all work just amazingly.</li>
    <li> The brshes are good quality and the case is very practical, its very handy when you use it as a stand. I think this is a good set of brushes for beginners who just use essential makeup.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brushes that work extremely well!  Just as good as my Morphe and Crown brushes!  Better price, equal or better quality, and Vegan friendly, which makes me happy.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have used. They are so soft and work amazingly! I would definitely recommended them!</li>
    <li> I love the brush! Its so soft and smells good too..i had tried other brushes before but my face breaks out.but with real techniques so far ni break outs</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Arrived before expected and the quality is amazing!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes. I have looked at all the stores and was not willing to pay big money since I&#x27;m just a normal working class girl. These  brushes are awesome, and the price is great. A great buy!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are fine for the price, but they are nothing special. I have a hard time picking up pressed powders with them.</li>
    <li> Great, soft brushes, no shedding, and great price.  Use the buff brush and the highlighter the most.  Very easy to use especially for a newbee.</li>
    <li> Decent set of brushes. Absolutely love the case they come in.</li>
    <li> I was in the search of a set like this, I&#x27;m not a makeup pro so I wouldn&#x27;t want to waste a lot of money on brushed. There are great quality, size and work excellent! better than expected!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always nervous about buying makeup brushes online, since it&#x27;s easy to get ones that are stiff or rough. Luckily these were not. These brushes are very soft and are still working fine after a lot of use. The bristles aren&#x27;t falling out and they remain soft, a blessing. The case/holder is great and is very helpful in a lot of ways. I would definitely buy these again but luckily the product seems to show me that I won&#x27;t have to anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes!  I am a big fan of Pixiwoo, and when I heard one of the sisters created this line, I definitely had to get them.  They are soft, durable, and most importantly perform the jobs they are intended for. I&#x27;ve also found they clean up very well too!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, I got the sololy for travel. How ever I am going to use these daily. I love them.</li>
    <li> My makeup looks so much better when applied with these brushes.  This is very inexpensive and  excellent buy for the price.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft. I love the case. It makes it very easy to hold up the brushes while applying makeup and storing. They were also shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the buffing brush are so soft and dense so it&#x27;s perfect for me to apply my pressed powder foundation. And its size is just right. Same goes with the contour brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think the foundation brush is a bit too small but it&#x27;s not a downside at all because i don&#x27;t use it to apply foundation all over my skin, I&#x27;d use my fingers to blend it out afterwards. So actually it can be used as a foundation brush and also a concealer brush ;)</li>
    <li> It is an overall good brushes. I&#x27;ve never own any other brushes so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to Sigma or mac or any other brand.</li>
    <li> extremely soft brushes , great quality , amazing price , apply make up perfectly ,, i love hoe they are color coded .. sam did a great job .. i recommend them to everyone</li>
    <li> I now have almost the whole set of Real Techniques brushes.  They are awesome and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> this definitely did not meet my expectations. with its price, i should have just gotten myself a sigma brush. the brushes are too small compared to the picture. the flat foundation brush is very, very, very small. like the size of my thumb and i&#x27;m petite! same goes with the powder brush and contour brush (i don&#x27;t have any idea where you can use the contour brush with that size) all in all, it looks like a toy for an 8 year old girl playing makeup. can i have a refund? &#x3D;))</li>
    <li> I just received core set, eye kit set and face brush today, it was amazing how the foundation, concealer and eye shadow bleds well. I recommended this set to new beginner in make up, thanx to amazon.com for a very good service as i m ordering this from Saudi Arabia, nice work guys</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure my sister will love these brushes and I will probably order from them again to get her the set of eye brushes for her birthday in February. They are good start up brushes, and the case they come in is great for storage and make up application.</li>
    <li> I receive on time. Very good! Thanks</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price and they last forever if you take proper care</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best, and what a great price! Love, love, love the way the brushes work with my makeup. Very satisfied and shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> I like them ,it was feeling soft on my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow I mean for the price these are excellent quality. No weird smells or threads falling out which other customers had complained about. They are better then the $60 brushes which I had bought from Nordstrom previously!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! They came quick and I can&#x27;t think of a problem with them!</li>
    <li> I really love the buffer brush but the rest of the collection was just ok to me.  Still a great price!</li>
    <li> This brushes are soft, full, apply makeup and foundation smoothly and retain their bristles even after washing.  For the price I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for everyone from beginners to MUAs. The buffing brush is great for foundations and the contouring brush is awesome for highlighters and bronzers. I wish I knew about this brand early because for the price they are great options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used real techniques for years and love their softness, makeup is so much easier to apply with the right brushes. This is my second set of brushes, the first ones are still in good condition but my daughter wanted them!</li>
    <li> I never had a set of nice brushes. I would always buy one brush at a time. I saw thes on many rivew on  you tuob  and  i decided to treat myself. They are awesome brush set with soft fibers,i also bought  tha face  brushs set , the eye set and blush brush  from Real Techniques they are amazing  too.</li>
    <li> Omg when I say great quality I mean great quality! Its been more than a year since I had these brushes and they still work the same awesome no shedding at all! Safe to use for liquid products.</li>
    <li> I really like the bristles and the quality is really good for these brushes.</li>
    <li> I really noticed a difference in my makeup after using these brushes. My makeup went on smooth and the coverage was better than usual. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because i heard about them on a blog. Best purchase ever. I am in love. Best</li>
    <li> My fav. Brushes at the moment!  I use the buffing brush to apply foundation and the contour brush to set my under eye concealer and they do not shed!</li>
    <li> The brushes are sooo good. I love them! If you are looking for new brushes then get those brushes. :)</li>
    <li> these are amazing quality brushes. you cannot go wrong. stop reading and buy immediately! These are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t hesitate this is as close as you will get to sigma and mac brushes they are soft the real deal love these brushes I order the entire collection the brushes came very nicely packaged and in just 8 days from purchasing date! buy these brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these o so soft brushes.  They work so well and were reasonably priced.  Great travel case too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This brushes are absolutely awesome. These brushes are worth a lot more than what they cost. My favorite brushes are the buffing brush for foundation and the contouring brush but all of them are great. I use these brushes regularly. Awesome buy. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things when it comes to real technique brushes and I am looking forward to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes--can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price! I have a few Mac brushes, and I prefer these. Great quality. Will order more by this company.</li>
    <li> Larger brush is very nice and soft. Medium sized brushes are rough on my skin and I don&#x27;t like using them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great i&#x27;ve had them for 2 months wash them 1x a week and they still have yet to shed unlike my mac 187.... amazing amazing amazing</li>
    <li> . . . I bought this kit, they are beautiful and distinctive, bought my aunt a happy girl by obtaining them</li>
    <li> I love the buffing brush for my pressed powder or loose powder and I use the contour brush quite a bit. The other two don&#x27;t get much use. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use the pointed foundation brush to blend concealer but mostly, I just use my finger. The pointed foundation brush seems to need cleaned more often if this is the case, but if you know how to use them correctly, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> nice brushes for the price. The bristles are very soft. The case that it came in is handy for traveling.</li>
    <li> I can certainly see why this brand has a good reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the brushes are durable, don&#x27;t shed, blend well, and best of all, this collection of four brushes is a little more than 1/2 the price of my one MAC foundation brush which sheds every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret that purchase but I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> These brushes feel very sturdy and nice. They&#x27;re soft, but firm so they don&#x27;t flop all over your face. Amazing bargain</li>
    <li> FAB!!!! i&#x27;d give this a million stars if possible, I&#x27;ve spent fortunes with dior and mac brushed but the shed. real techniques doesn&#x27;t shed and gets the job done really well. I use this kit daily and wouldn&#x27;t change it.</li>
    <li> The bigger brush is definitely better than the smaller ones. It is good for foundations.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are cheaply priced  and well made. I wash these all the time and haven&#x27;t expected any shedding like I have with my other high end brushes from MAC and sigma.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes.  They feel so soft on my face and I use the biggest brush to apply CC cream and foundation.  Applying foundation with a brush is so much better than using your fingers as a lot goes a long way and it is distributed so evenly and nice.  These brushes are definitely a bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> real Techniques Core Collection Set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for makeup, everything have a specific thing.&lt;br /&gt;I used a no brand brushes , real techniques is much better that them.&lt;br /&gt;To buy it......&lt;br /&gt;like: Every thing except the smallest brush.  Dislike: the smallest brush, cause it&#x27;s not good for the concealer OR MAYBE I don&#x27;t know how to ues it, and i don&#x27;t know another ways to use that brush.</li>
    <li> Great!!  Love them !!</li>
    <li> High quality and inexpensive</li>
    <li> I love the contour and buffing brush!!! The concealer one not to much Since I still have to smooth out with a sponge after sometimes. But other than that I love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> THE BEST BRUSHES  I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!! BETTER THAN MAC BRUSHES THAT IVE BOUGHT! great price + they never shed!!!!&amp; easy to clean!♡</li>
    <li> My Daughter liked it !</li>
    <li> I love my real Techniques Core Collection Set!  These brushes are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes. No need to go spend a fortune on others. My only reason for giving four stars instead of five is that I got this in hopes of using the buffing brush but purchased the Expert Face Brush also and use it instead of the buffing brush in this kit. I will purchase more Real Techniques products.</li>
    <li> Love....LOVE!! Best&lt;br /&gt;Brushes ever! Will be a real techniques customer forever. Great product. Super soft. Great price. Love! LOVE! Love!</li>
    <li> Good purchase. Best brushes I have used in years!</li>
    <li> Very good product !!!</li>
    <li> Wow, that&#x27;s all I can say. I have owned and used these for months now and wanted to wait to see if stray hairs or &#x27;pushed down&#x27; effect would happen. Nope, same as the day I bought them. Very easy to clean and soft, very soft. The handles fit perfect in my small hands. Other name-brand handles were too large and I would end up dropping the brush, thus a lot of expensive product falling off the brush. I can see these lasting me for years and as a matter of fact, I plan to purchase the other set, too.</li>
    <li> exceed my expection，best brush i have had so far，love it！</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. A few hairs came out of one of the brushes when I first used it but hasn&#x27;t anymore and still works fine.</li>
    <li> Real Techniques offer great brushes without the high end cost.</li>
    <li> Real Techniques are the best drugstore blushes. Inexpensive but great quality!&lt;br /&gt;So happy with my new RT brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. my daughter and I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat Real Techniques brushes if you are in the market for inexpensive quality. They are not the cheapest on the market, but their quality far exceeds their cost make them one of the best values.</li>
    <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;And they&#x27;re very soft&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s easy cleaning</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. They are cruelty free, animal hair free (yes apparently those are TWO different things) and they are effective! I bought these because I&#x27;m allergic to animal hair so I had to have synthetic brushes. I learned that just because something is cruelty free, doesn&#x27;t mean there is no animal hair! Anyway I found these brushes which were affordable, cute, and animal free, I decided to buy them and I have been happy for many many months! They wash up very easily, and of course have this cute little carrying case if you travel. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget or seeking 100% cruelty free and animal hair free brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes were exactly what I was looking for, and the price for all 4 was amazing when compared to the price of just one at a store like Walgreens.  These brushes are more than comparable to highend brushes, and the price point makes them that much better.  The carrying case isn&#x27;t much, seems a bit impractical, and I haven&#x27;t used it at all.  But the brushes are perfect!</li>
    <li> They are soft and apply makeup well. Only thing I would have liked is some eye shadow brushes. I use the large brush for foundation, the next size for bronzer, the flat brush for concealer.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!  Excellent quality.  They wash up really well and dry quickly.  I&#x27;ve had no shedding problems.  I ditched the case though - no need for that.</li>
    <li> Looove them, i&#x27;ve wash them a few times and they dont shed at all</li>
    <li> Really, nice brush set.  Works really well for me.  Just the right size for traveling and the case is small enough to fit in any bag. Shipping was right on time.</li>
    <li> I am a big-time Pixiwoo fan but hesitated about buying these for a long time...I&#x27;m so glad I did! These brushes are GREAT! Very soft, manageable size, and really get the job done! I feel like I&#x27;m participating in their YouTube tutorials when I use them. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I just loved it! Worth every penny and even more! Much better than most of the high end products out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this set specifically for the buffing brush since you can&#x27;t buy it alone. It was just ok. Nothing special. The case is good for traveling. Buy the Expert face brush instead, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> real Techniques Core Collection Set is a need for everyone from starter to professionals. I love them. I use everyday easily ;)</li>
    <li> Everything in this set is an awesome value with good quality. The &amp;#34;contour&amp;#34; brush that it comes with, I actually use it for applying/blending under eye concealer. The &amp;#34;concealer brush&amp;#34; works great on blemishes. LOVE the &amp;#34;buffer brush&amp;#34; it&#x27;s my favorite for foundation, I use it with NARS SheerGlow and it blends it in nicely. The &amp;#34;foundation brush&amp;#34; is probably the one I use lease. Every brush dries fairly fast when deep cleaned, no shedding, and keeps its shape. I am considering purchasing a second set because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for the buffing brush and contour brush. I have used the foundation and concealer brush (as a lip brush) as well but not on an everyday basis. I use the buffing brush for all foundations (liquid and powder) and bb creams. I use the contour brush for contour as well as powder blush. I love how the white tips let you see how much product there is on the brush. The case is nice for travelling and is also good for drying the brushes after washing. Make sure the brush tip is facing the ground so that water doesn&#x27;t collect in the brush handle. No loose hairs so far (~2 months)!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these brushes professionally, but I use them for everyday use. They are very good considering the brushes I had before them. I think they will end up lasting a long time too.</li>
    <li> These babies rock! they are soft, good quality and work like they should! I would say you get what you pay for, but these are so inexpensive, that you&#x27;re defiantly getting a great deal!</li>
    <li> when i ordered these they came so quickly. i opened them straight up and was enchanted by the feel and touch of the brushes on my face. people say the foundation brush is too small but i think its the right size, to really get up in the corners for concealer and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this set really deserves 5 stars because it came with nothing damaged, beautiful condition and quick postage.</li>
    <li> I love the contour and buffing brush. They are soft and dense. I have been using them for almost a year and they still in good shape. The other two I rarely use them. The concealer brush is too small that it will take a long time to apply. I didn&#x27;t use the foundation brush because I prefer using my fingers. With the price in mind, this is one of the best brush set I own. (and I love the case that comes with the brushes: great for travel)</li>
    <li> The tiny detailer brush is great for applying concealer! The brushes are all soft and I have washed them already and they still stay the same! Totally recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Real technique brushes are the best. To be honest I would&#x27;ve purchased these at ulta or wal-mart instead probably cheaper. But I don&#x27;t regret buying them.</li>
    <li> Buffer brush started having lots of amounts of hair shedding.</li>
    <li> This is NOT an example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  These brushes are inexpensive AND are good.  I have yet to really figure out what to do with the feather-like brush, but the other 2 are very nice to add to a collection.  The case is worthless, but I didn&#x27;t buy these for the case.  I am happy with how tight and short the brushes are on the buffing brush.  It works well for bronzer/blush as well as cleaning up foundation.  They do not smell funny nor has a single hair fallen out of these brushes.  I will look for other brushes by real Techniques to see if I can find some replacements for those awful brushes that come with the Bare Minerals start-up sets!</li>
    <li> these are great!  very affordable, soft, purposeful brushes.  I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to discover them.  I love the quality and price.  perfect for anyone either starting up their makeup collection or for a veteran looking for variety.</li>
    <li> These brushes have not shed a single hair. The powder brush had one single hair that was longer than the rest and when I tried to pull it out it wouldn&#x27;t budge! So I had to trim it to the length of the rest of the fibers. Its soft on the face and feels great. And don&#x27;t expect too much from the case, almost treat it as a complimentary freeby for buying the brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get good makeup brushes for a long time now but didn&#x27;t want to pay a huge amount, I think the price is great on these &amp; the quality is great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes. They are very soft and even after washing they are still soft. My powder goes on nicely. I no doubt recommend these brushes! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great, been using everyday since I&#x27;ve got them, only wish the buffing brush wouldn&#x27;t shed as it does. Maybe it&#x27;s just my one brush, as the other ones don&#x27;t do it. Other than that really recommend them, a simple and easy using brush set, quality is good and the brushes are soft, everything I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I use these brushes daily...really put on liquid makeup well...and other brushes are for blush and eyebrows....nice collection and a great buy.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASE THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER , VERY FAST SHIPPING, WELL PACK. AND BEST OF ALL! ITEM AS DESCRIBE! VERY NICE! GREAT! POUCH, SHE IS SO HAPPY WITH PRODUCT. THANKS!</li>
    <li> I love how colorful these brushes are. They work well, and so far haven&#x27;t had any shedding. I also like the feel of the handles and of the bristles.</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes you can find! their ultra-soft Taklon bristles work products on skin as smooth as silk; ideal for HD makeup! Easy to clean and maintain, carrying cases are extremely useful! I also love the fact that they are 100% crueltry free&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced all my natural fiber brushes in my pro kit  for these and I absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! They help to create a smoother makeup application. They are just fun to use. I can&#x27;t wait to get another set.</li>
    <li> I love them. The concealer brush i do not care for as much, but i love the others completely. Check out my youtube for reviews katie Durrant</li>
    <li> It was for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;She decided to bought because my sister has one.&lt;br /&gt;Very good and complete set.&lt;br /&gt;She recommends this set for any woman.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Great set for beginners. I love the buffer brush- it really blends well. The little case they come in is practical and functional. I gave one to my girlfriend as a gift &amp; she really likes them also.</li>
    <li> I discovered Real Techniques more than a year ago and own almost every single set of their brushes. My favorite sets are the Core Collection and Sam&#x27;s Picks (limited edition). The Core Collection features good quality basic brushes with soft bristles. I do not know if the brushes being &amp;#34;hand-cut&amp;#34; make much of a difference because a few of my brushes had one long stray hair. I have washed these brushes many times and there was very minimal shedding. I made the mistake of tossing the black brush holder but it can also be used as a brush drying rack if you turn it upside down. I think this is an excellent brush set for the price and I have bought myself a set and given one out as a gift as well. I highly recommend this brand! The company also has a channel on Youtube with tutorials on how to use the various brushes so this can be helpful when learning how to use them.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes, super soft &amp; even super fast shipping!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES! They blend powders and cream foundations with little effort. i use the buffing brush to buff out my cream bronzer and it blends it out to perfection. I use the contour brush with my translucent powder and the pointed foundation brush to apply the cream bronzer. As for the tiny detailer brush, I apply a highlight to the inner corners of my eyes because the size is perfect for that purpose. I deducted 1 star because the handles of the brushes are big and they don&#x27;t fit in my roll up brush holder. Hope this was helpful :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used brushes in the past that had celebrity names and made all kinds of claims before proceeding to lose bristles during routine use or cleaning with solution. Big waste of coin!&lt;br /&gt;Each of these brushes has at least 2 uses: The use listed on the box and then the use you discover once you get comfortable with your own technique. They are great with wet and dry products and actually save you money because you won&#x27;t use as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip the high-end brushes, save your coins, and give these a try first.</li>
    <li> I bought the Expert Face Brush and was impressed by the quality of the brush so I decided to buy this product. I honestly think that you are getting your money&#x27;s worth for this. Usually a drugstore brush is around $8-$10 dollars, but you get four products for the price of two. I bought this solely for the contour brush, but surprisingly loving the buffing brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;I use the contour brush to apply both my blush and bronzer. It doesn&#x27;t soak up too much of the powder between the bristles. It also prevents me from using too much of the product on my skin. It makes it easy to blend out the product so I don&#x27;t get streaks on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The buffing brush is used for my face pressed and mineral powders. I heard it can also be used for liquid foundations, but I didn&#x27;t try that yet.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten a lot of use from the foundation brush because it&#x27;s so small. It would take a long time to cover my entire face. I might use it to apply concealer though. The not-so-apparent usefulness of this brush is the reason why I&#x27;m docking a star off the rating.&lt;br /&gt;The lip brush is good. No complaints. I had a mini one from a lip palette so I was glad to get a new one with a full sized handle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the quality is good and the bristles are soft. Don&#x27;t try to skimp out on brushes because they need to last a long time. I regret buying elf brushes now that I have these in my collection. It also beats out my ecotools brushes. So if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on luxury brushes, try real Techniques.&lt;br /&gt;(Note: The price on Amazon was cheaper than my local Walgreens so I bought it online)</li>
    <li> makes my makeup look flawless! very soft fibers and I think I may like these better than my mac brushes! surprised the price wouldn&#x27;t be higher for the quality of these</li>
    <li> Excellent as they said! I like how it blends all the bb cream and my concealer really well! I feel pretty than ever with the help of this brushes!</li>
    <li> best brushes i hv ever used..hv fallen in luv wid dese brushes..&lt;br /&gt;thnks to sam fr bringing up such luvly pack of makeup brushes sets</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality.  These are exactly as described.  The case is great it stands up for easy access or folds for traveling.</li>
    <li> A bit stiff but I like them - would definitely purchase this brand again.  Traveling case is functional.  word word</li>
    <li> I have heard many great reviews about these products and decided to purchase and am VERY impressed.. The price is rather inexpensive compared to other high end brushed I&#x27;ve tried.  Some people have complained about the hair shedding but I find if you just wash them they will not shed! Also VERY soft, great at blending I&#x27;ve purchased many other Real Techniques brushes and have been satisfied with all of them.  Great price for the quality you get, highly recommend &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> the product is as expected, lovely material and nice brush hair.&lt;br /&gt;yet, the case is not as expected.&lt;br /&gt;enjoyable experience</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes are amazing and the handles are in the right size.. I didnt like 2nd from the left brush i couldn&#x27;t make it work other than that the rest are great</li>
    <li> one of my friends is trying to be a make up artist and she recommended this ones after seeing various tutorials where they use them.&lt;br /&gt;They are great! and i wasnt disappointed. super soft and they work amazingly. I recommend them :)</li>
    <li> The gold brushes are for your face, such as blush, bronzer or finishing powder. I love the color coded brushes by Real Techniques!</li>
    <li> I use this for my bareminerals set.&lt;br /&gt;From left to right. Brush 1) I use for my foundation and mineral veil 2) I use for my &#x27;all over color&#x27;  and blush 3) I use for a cream concealer 4) I use for contouring my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic brush set. I highly recommend giving it to that friend that loves make up but only uses drugstore products because they will appreciate the quality and the price ratio of these brushes.</li>
    <li> my sister loved it and there so smoothed out and i think there  smart for travling if you travle or if you just like these brand i recomend it</li>
    <li> Really nice and super soft. For the price they are great! a couple hairs fell out but otherwise no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Get these brushes.  They are so soft and well made.  I&#x27;ve washed mine numerous times, and no shedding nor losing their shapes.  I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face brush set ever. The big one works perfect for foundation and also powder and there is another that works great for contouring. Great quality, very soft.</li>
    <li> These have become my go to set of brushes.  You can create and endless amount of looks with this starter set.  The brushes are good quality, clean easy, and can withstand daily wear and tear without any issues.  Slowly but surely these are replacing the others I have in my collection at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my brushes for over a month now and they are Great. The coverage and blending both are wonderful and wish I had made this purchase earlier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking for a powder brush for a long while, and the buffer brush works well. It is so soft and spread a thin layer of powder perfectly on my face. love it very much.</li>
    <li> Love the product, the brushes are amazing but the box it was in was all cracked! The brushes weren&#x27;t damaged but watch out if you&#x27;re ordering this for someone else</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Super soft!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time, actually it arrived earlier than expected which made me happy. I used them to apply my foundation and bronzer and they work great! It was actually fun applying it. They distribute evenly and are soft on the skin. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> These are perfect! Easy to clean, soft, and look great.</li>
    <li> First off, my purchase came exactly on the estimated delivery date which i always love. So that&#x27;s good, and the products was exactly how the description says it would be. There is nothing much else to say other than how satisfied I am with my purchase and I would definitely recommend this to anybody who are looking for great makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Samantha Chapman is a makeup genus. She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  These are multi functional brushes and can be used on any facial feature and with any type of make up!  I can not get enough of these brushes.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes. Would reccomend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Worth sooo much more than $10 and change!!! Sooo soft. Didn&#x27;t think I would like all the brushes and the case but WOW!!!! I did!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive brushes!!! Small flat to pack on color on the lid, big to blush and bronze, and medium to set under eye. I don&#x27;t have a use for the flat foundation brush but whatever!</li>
    <li> These Real Techniques brushes were soft, affordable and more importantly there was no shedding. these brushes are also great for beginners to makeup. I will Purchase the rest of the Real Techniques brush collection.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are soft and will not leave weird marks on your face. I use them to put on my makeup, concealers, and to blend in my contour makeup, love it! it will not flake hairs everywhere. It is also does not make my skin itchy like other brushes I used.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Met expectations and is as stated in reviews. Will purchase starter set. Value for money , packaging great.</li>
    <li> My foundation, concealer and powder goes on so soft and evenly with these brushes. It&#x27;s like someone hit the soft focus button like on photo editing. Everything blurs to an air brushed finished look and I love that!</li>
    <li> I have no doubt in my mind that these brushes are amazing, but too bad I did not receive them on the promised date. what&#x27;s the point of being a prime member if you still do not get your stuff when you are supposed to. I had an important event today and relied on that delivery to be today. Not to mention tracking info was not available. Seriously? Beyond irritated.....</li>
    <li> I had an acne problem,  but with these soft brushes the acne started to disappear !! I used to have rough brushes but this is amazing so I t won&#x27;t be rough on the skin</li>
    <li> I like the two fluffier brushes a lot..they&#x27;re very soft and blend liquid of powders very well without leaving any streaks. I use the dome brush for under eye area. However, I don&#x27;t care for the two smaller, thin brushes. That foundation one leaves streaks when try to blend out liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> My sister love it, they are very softy!</li>
    <li> I bought this set specifically for the buffing and the contour brushes although I can figure out some use for the other two. The brushes are smaller than what they looked like from videos and pictures but that is not a problem; as with other brushes from this line the quality is amazing as is the price, if they were three times more expensive, they would still be worth, they are so well made I have not had trouble with shedding and they keep the shape perfectly, I totally recommend these brushes for beginners, experts, anyone who needs quality brushes at reasonable prices look no further, this is your brand!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set because I really wanted the contour brush and to my disappointment, they are not sold individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the contour brush and budfing brush are wonderful. I have no issues with blending or shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the contour brush, it is very soft and is just small enough to fit into the contour of the cheeks perfectly.  it is definitely my favorite in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i use the buffing brush to apply and blend out my blush as it fits perfects in the cheek area and is not too large. it also does a really good job at picking up product, i barely have to tap the brush in it tonget intense pigmentation. I LOVE using this for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; have yet to really use the smallest brush but I tried it for lipstick and its good. The brush feels very synthetic and more plasticy? but as its so small it doesnt really have a negative outcome when used to apply my lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the foundation brush.....&lt;br /&gt;I knew I would dislike this in the first place, I dont believe you can get a flawless application when you use brushes with this particular shape. As with all flat foundation brushes, the application was streaky and just unsatisfying. I didnt even bother to do my whole face. Another thing that I do NOT understand their thought process on this is the size. it&#x27;s ridiculously small to even be considered to use for foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the best pro out of this is that it is small enough to get into smaller areas of the face. though the quality to me seems very crappy. Like the smallest brush in the set, it has a very plastic/synthetic feel, and I feel like the product just sits on it and it does absolutely nothing to help blend. NOTHING. The brush is awful all in all.  I much prefer my sigma F80 or beauty blender. ANd well as I mentioned, I am completely against flat foundation brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, the contour and buffing brush are great brushes, blend well and pick up pigment very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about these brushes and oh my gosh they&#x27;re worth the hype. I got a pretty sweet deal on them here on amazon. they&#x27;re soft and multi-purpose and omg i just love them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for the price, def worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more and the are really soft. Worth it</li>
    <li> I freakin love these brushes. They are soft and they make for an easy makeup application. I will be purchasing a few other brushes from real Techniques.</li>
    <li> These things came in the neat little case and they are perfect for applying makeup!  These are the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve bought (I usually just use one or two).  I will now make sure to always have a set at home and one the go!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally  made this purchase!  Don&#x27;t debate about getting it, just go ahead and buy it.  These brushes are amazing whether you&#x27;re a beginner, a pro, or anywhere in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are high quality brushes for a great price.  They are extremely soft but also dense enough to get the right amount of coverage.  I use these daily and they are my favorite way to apply my makeup</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these brushes. I use the buffing brush to apply liquid foundation. I don&#x27;t believe the packaging or web site says anything about using this particular brush with anything but mineral/loose/pressed powder, but I used it with the liquid anyways. I loved it! It blended out my foundation so well, and it stayed on MUCH longer than when I apply it with my round buffing brush from BH cosmetics. I use the contour brush to contour my cheeks and forehead with bronzer and I like it a lot. It&#x27;s a small brush so it&#x27;s perfect for the hollows of your cheeks and for getting small areas on your forehead and jaw without having huge streaks of color. I normally use a contour brush from E.L.F and I like the real techniques much better. The pointed foundation brush I used to blend out my undereye concealer a bit, and to apply a loose powder to set my undereyes. It is a dream for the undereye because the pointed tip allows you to get into the corner of your eyes and the brush is so soft (as are all the brushes). I didn&#x27;t use the pointed detailing brush yet, as I don&#x27;t seem to have a use for it...I read you can use it for lipstick..but I don&#x27;t wear that often so I haven&#x27;t used it for anything yet. Overall, I LOVE these brushes. They are super soft and feel very durable...they blend product well and deposit the color where you want it. Definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are wonderful. The buffing brush works perfectly for applying foundation, my makeup has never looked better.  The smaller brush is great for applying concealer and the others do wonders for contouring. A++ brushes.  Can&#x27;t wait to purchase the other Real Techniques brushes that are available.</li>
    <li> Just got these brushes in today, tested them out, and I am very satisfied with this set. The brushes are really soft, and they look like they could go for 40 bucks instead of 18, which is a plus. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this item. My makeup goes on so smooth and has an airbrushed look to it. These brushes are very comparable to high end brushes and they do not shed.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes...so flawless...best brushes ever used....very easy to use and gives excellent results...love these brushes very much..gives .very smooth finish</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;He makes beautiful makeup&lt;br /&gt;The hair soft and good handle&lt;br /&gt;The bag also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and also face brushes</li>
    <li> my friend loved it,very good quality</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best &amp; are priced too low for the amazing quality.  I own every single brush made by real techniques &amp; some of them I have multiples. They are soft but not flimsy &amp; have great control. I love the there is no barrel on them so when they are being cleaned you are sure that you are cleaning the entire brush. If I lose them I will repurchase &amp; none on them have fallen apart. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> it was a gift and the receiver loved it.</li>
    <li> great quality, the price is very good.</li>
    <li> I LOVE real techniques brushes. I also have the eye collection. I have really oil and sensitive skin and they work great on my skin. They are so soft and they work perfectly. They also are not that expensive compared to some other brushes, but they do just as well. I would defiantly recommend these to every one.</li>
    <li> Being an Australian buying these brushes at priceline is just too expensive for me so i decided to buy them off amazon as they are in a such more affordable range. For me they actually came wayyy earlier than the expected date it said.It came 5 days earlier than I thought. The quality of these brushes just blows my mind and they are just so soft i swear almost like a teddy bear. I also purchased the starter set, travel essentials set and expert face brush and i think amazingly of all the brushes.</li>
    <li> the hair is soft,and I am think of buying some more brushes also.&lt;br /&gt;Hope i can use it for a long time with my proper care</li>
    <li> In love with these brushes. Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality . My girlfriend said this is as good as her Bobbi Brown brush set. I am glad.</li>
    <li> Would have been more useful if a blush brush was included instead of the contour brush, to make it a &amp;#34;core collection&amp;#34;. Hence docking a star. But overall, the quality is excellent!!</li>
    <li> I love real Techniques Brushes! The price worths every penny you spend! Its very soft but it can pick up the powder very efficiently, I like the design at the end of the brush, makes it very easy to hold especially when I have foundation on my fingers but can not wash them off temporarily.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes! They don&#x27;t malt all over my face like past brushes I&#x27;ve used and they apply makeup very well and smoothly. I would definitely recommend these brushes for makeup lovers. Very pleased with these, will definitely be buying more Real Techniques products!</li>
    <li> I was expecting them to be better quality but some of my brushes didnt seem to work well for me</li>
    <li> I am no make up artist so I can&#x27;t review this brush for that purpose. I bought the set as a spare (travel) set for my personal use, therefore I use it seldomly. It has always provided great results. However, I would say the bristles aren&#x27;t very soft com pared to my other brushes... I own other super soft make up brushes from drugstore brands and I tend to like them a little better. Real Techniques has a great reputation so if you are into not so soft brushes, you should gdefinitlely get these.The level of softness is just my personal preference.</li>
    <li> Did NOT get the brushes in this picture. One was so far off;; the contour brush isnt what its supposed to be. These are fakes, if anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one on the top is the REAL brush and the one on the bottom is what I received. Super disappointed.</li>
    <li> All the brushes have super soft bristles and they&#x27;re very gentle on my sensitive skin. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these brushes to both beginners and makeup artists!</li>
    <li> This brush set looks cute. The quality is good consider its low price. It&#x27;s very soft and easy to blend. But if not considering the budget, I would still go for a  designer brand like bobbi brown.</li>
    <li> Love the blush and powder brushes and the packaging but the concealer and foundation brushes are not so good. They streak when applying a liquid or cream foundation or concealer. All the brushes are easy to clean and do not shed, however.</li>
    <li> these brushes are great for beginners because they&#x27;re so simple to use and the label on the side does help. they&#x27;re also fantastic for professionals as they are soft and durable. I&#x27;ve recommended them to so many people and everyone else loves he,</li>
    <li> This brush set is perfection! I have not used any of my other brushes at all. I use these to contour and bronze. Its sooooo perfect. The buffing and contour brush are my favs ofcourse. Would reccomend to any girl who is looking for a great contour brush at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> good item&lt;br /&gt;speed ship</li>
    <li> Love them!!! I use them differently them what they say they are for. I used the powder brush for foundations the foundation brush for concealer  and the detail brush for my inner eye shadow. They work great!!! The products get really on your face!!</li>
    <li> the foundation buffing brush gives me such a flawless look will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> The buffing brush is very useful and the amazon package is Minions! So cute! Delivered earlier than I expected~</li>
    <li> I like these brushes so much. My favorite one is the Buffing Brush as it does a really nice job. It is definitely satisfying for a price.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter for Christmas. This is a repeat order of these brushes. This is a great basic set for your makeup collection.</li>
    <li> Love it and use it everyday</li>
    <li> I have been wanting some good brushes for a really long time since the only htuses i owned were by E.L.F. Which dont get me wrong those are good for the price but i needed better. I have heard a lot about Real Techniques and i decided to ask for a set of them for Christmas. I got this set and i was sooo happy. That morning i did my makeup with them and tested every one.&lt;br /&gt; The blush brush: the brush is named &amp;#34;contour brush&amp;#34; but i use it for blush. And its my favorite one in the set. Blush is my favorite makeup product and i was really in need of a new blush brush. I havent washed it yet and have been ussing it for about 2 to 3 weeks. Its still super soft. But its a little shorter than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush: thats the name and it does the job. This is my second favorite brush in the kit. The only thing i dislike about it is how small it is. But its okay because it gives really good coverage. Medium to full using Bare Minerals loose foundation. My old brush took about five minutes to get the results this brush does in one. So great i also havent washed it yet and it remains fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer brush: i dont notice a huge difference with this brush and my E.L.F one honestly. But yesterdayni did try a different technique and it seemedd better. So i liked this one but i was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush: honestly if you have acne this brush sucks. It was better than my E.L.F one but i just use my fingers. It left streaks and didnt help to cover anything at all. If you havr clear skin this brush is great but work in little areas.  This is my least favorite brush and the reason im fourr star instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder: this is really cool i like it! It holds i think 7 or 8 brushes and folds over so the brushes stand up for you. The only downfall of it is the velcrow isnt big enough to fit more than four brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i do like this kit.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these brushes! I have used all of the brushes and I am extremely happy with this purchase!  The face brush applies my liquid foundation beautifully.  I do find that spraying the brush with either a setting spray or Mac&#x27;s fix plus adds to the blendability and helps my fast drying foundations smooth over my skin. The setting brush is awesome for applying blush and highlighters as well as powder</li>
    <li> I love the bigger brushes for my bronzer/blush but don&#x27;t really have a use for the concealer and foundation brushes.</li>
    <li> Great product! I am in LOVE with this set. Stuff For Spa is definitely where I will be purchasing from again. Dee is such a great person! Thank you! Definitely recommend buying from Stuff For Spa. They&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> These brushes are professional quality and come in nice packaging.  The liquid foundation brush is a bit too small for my liking.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great to use on the go because the super awesome case it comes in. But besides that, it seriously is an amazing set. They are great quality and can last you a long time! Love them! :D</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for an amazing price. They dont last as long as high end brushes but they have lasted me over six months now and a fab!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes because they clean easily and apply makeup smoovely. The fibers on these brushes seem soft and air lifting. Drys quickly. Will purchase more.</li>
    <li> very impressed with the quality of brushes so far.&lt;br /&gt;gives a really nice finish to foundation etc.&lt;br /&gt;does not shed! yay!</li>
    <li> they fell apart the first time used</li>
    <li> I love all the brushes except for the foundation brush. The bristles on the end of the foundation is kind of prickly, and hurts the skin a bit. Other than that, all the other brushes are soft, and works to achieve its purpose</li>
    <li> I would recommend them to anyone! The buffing brush and the contour brush are my favorites. I have little use for the smallest brush yet.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every day!  I use the pointed brush for nose contour and it is perfect : )</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but i love the look of it i am sure it will be awsome</li>
    <li> Ive used brushes from every major makeup brand out there and I must hand it to real Techniques... they have amazing quality at an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality face brush set. There are multiple uses for each brush and the brushes themselves are quite good looking .... In a nutshell .... Buy them !!! ... You won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Affordable and good quality.</li>
    <li> So happy I tried these!  Consider this Brush Snob reformed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed concealer brush alone is worth the $15!.. I use it daily to set my under-eye concealer w/mineral powder foundation.  It is the perfect shape &amp; deposits just enough product, no cake!  Woooo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a set worth trying, no duds. I use all of the brushes. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the case but @ this price point who cares!</li>
    <li> love,, perfect packaging and price, its smells so good, i recomended. i get it to my friend and she loove it</li>
    <li> These are so soft and they are so great for putting on makeup. They help create whatever effect I am going for and they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. Love them!</li>
    <li> Good...very handy. This brush set is really good..had it for 2months and no complaints yet..I hope I have none though</li>
    <li> Detailer Brush - Smallest brush in the kit. I use this brush to apply lip tar and sometimes concealer. It&#x27;s nice. It has a pointy end for very precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pointed Foundation Brush - Nah. Out of the entire range of RT brushes, this is one of the ones I&#x27;ve used the least. It&#x27;s really small. I feel it&#x27;s way too small for foundation. It&#x27;s more of a specialized kind of brush that could be used for getting foundation in a tricky place, applying highlighter, applying concealer, or possibly blending. I don&#x27;t use this brush at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffing Brush -  I use this brush every day. I use it to apply foundation, powder, powder foundation, bronzer, blush, highlighter, contour, or to just blend away edges. Extremely versatile and a good size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contour Brush - I use this a few times a month. It&#x27;s great for contouring under the jaw, but I find it too fluffy to contour my cheeks, nose, forehead, or chin. It does the job, but I prefer using my Becca paddle brush to contour, and my RT buffing brush to blend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panoramic 2-in-1 brush case/stand - Meh, I tossed this because I found it a pain to use. I didn&#x27;t like that it was always open and that my brushes weren&#x27;t sealed off from the outside environment when the case was closed. I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t like having to put each brush back into a specific place, and I feel like this gets dirty and isn&#x27;t easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012. Since getting them, I&#x27;ve used at least three of them every single day. That&#x27;s two years of constant use, and they look and preform the same way they did the day I received them. Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush. My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer. Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones. Did I mention that you can now buy these at Walmart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are superior to animal hair brushes in every way. They are cruelty free. They are extremely easy to clean-- I timed myself, and I can wash twenty brushes in seven minutes. They do not get stained. I purposely didn&#x27;t clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product. (I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.) They  don&#x27;t hold any funky smells or bacteria after washing, since the bristles aren&#x27;t porous, unlike animal hair bristles. For the same reason, they dry off very fast. My RT face brush takes about 30 minutes to dry if I leave it damp on a washcloth, and I can dry it almost completely in a few seconds if I rub the brush against a sham. I&#x27;ve cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly. My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first. Another advantage of the non-porous bristles is that you don&#x27;t have to condition them. After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don&#x27;t get brittle. If you don&#x27;t, your brushes will start shedding. The RT brushes don&#x27;t need to be conditioned, and they don&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, they are soft. Softer than animal hair. They pick up product and dispense it with ease. Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product. Truly a pleasure to use and apply makeup with. My one small gripe is that sometimes product can get stuck on the black grip part of these brushes, but that is hardly an issue since it cleans right off. They just might look a bit dirty after rolling around in your makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are so durable and have held up better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever had before. As I said before, I&#x27;ve beenusing them for two years already and they look and feel the same way they did the day I got them. I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come. I would give these to a friend. I would repurchase. Affordable, durable, just a great product. These would be a great gift to anyone that wears makeup. I would recommend these over any other brush on the market. I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.using them for two years already and they look and feel the same way they did the day I got them.

    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist but I love doing my friends&#x27; makeup as well as mine, and They work great for me. They get the job done!!!</li>
    <li> very good brushes, very good quality</li>
    <li> I have plenty of non expensive and very expensive makeup brushes in my collection. Usually the cheaper brushes are not very good quality, but these brushes are priced very well and the quality is amazing! These brushes are very soft and the bristles do not fall out unlike others I have( expensive and non). They also blend makeup very well and the brush does not soak up all of your makeup like some do. These literally are the best brushes I have ever worked with.... and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune! I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for quality makeup brushes without breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> These brushes work great for me. Since I&#x27;ve just started wearing makeup. They are super soft and great quality. The seller also ships super fast.</li>
    <li> Brushes weren&#x27;t even used, tried to return and they wanted to charge a restocking fee. I was willing to pay it but since the tape of the box was removed they didn&#x27;t want to work with me. Terrible company and complete rip off</li>
    <li> i will never buy anymore brushes from Amazon my buffing brush, contour brush, and multitasking brush aaaall shed, not on my face but the strands tend to just pop up  once I&#x27;m done using it on my face :( ... otherwise they&#x27;re soft blah</li>
    <li> These brushes gotta be the best and affordable set  of professional brushes in the market, i think these are better than Sigma.</li>
    <li> RT brushes are so soft and apply the products perfectly. It couldn&#x27;t be better. I am in love with all of them</li>
    <li> Love them can&#x27;t wait to use</li>
    <li> If you are looking for affordable makeup brushes I highly recommend Real Techniques . Not only are they affordable but they are also great quality.</li>
    <li> This set is amazing. I spent hours researching brushes and sifting through reviews and I always came back to Real Techniques Core Collection Set. Firstly, the brushes are of excellent value and very high quality. I have bought more expensive brushes that weren&#x27;t as soft or as good as these. The brushes that are included are a nice set. I use the blender brush the most, and I also suggest buying the expert face brush in addition. The stand is perfection. My favorite part about the stand is when I wash the brushes, I set the stand into the display position and face my brushes down to allow them to dry. I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a few months every day and they have held up perfectly with many instances of washing. Highly recommend! You can&#x27;t really go wrong with the price either. If you are looking for a good brush set for a good price, this is your best bet!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! I use them every single time I do my makeup, and I have never had any kind of bristle fall out problems. They are very quality, and are firm, thick brushes, which is my favorite.Great for foundation and concealer and also contouring use.</li>
    <li> Powder brush Good finish</li>
    <li> Holy moly...I was shocked to find that these brushes are as awesome as they are. Not all of them, but the foundation brush, and blending brush, are my two favs now. Especially the blending brush. Not to mention, you can&#x27;t beat the price. I paid less for the four of these, then I did for one of my older brushes. I have had them for about a month or so now. They wash very well, dry really fast, (bonus), are super soft and I have not noticed any of the hairs falling out, (which happens all the time with my MAC and Bare Mineral Brushes), and nothing drives me more crazy, than when I am doing my makeup, and having to stop in the middle of it to get the dang hair off my face. These and my Kabuki brushes are definitely my favorite to use. :)</li>
    <li> excellent little set of face brushes. they&#x27;re made well and the bristles are super soft. i love to use the contour brush for highlighting and the detail brush is perfect for putting concealer around your eyebrows/browbone or your lips, or can even be used as a lip brush. the buffing brush is excellent for foundation and gives a flawless finish; i like to use the pointed foundation brush for undereye concealer. i love all of these brushes; i&#x27;ve used and washed them a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Almost all the brushes are perfect but when I got it the detail brush and a giant clump of hair fall out!</li>
    <li> I give it to my friend, and she love it!</li>
    <li> Cheap brushes.  You get what you pay for. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are well worth it. My favorite is the foundation buffing brush. I loved them so much I bought a second set. Cheaper to buy them here than ulta.</li>
    <li> recommended 👍 top quality</li>
    <li> Love this set. Worth the price. Wish I would or ordered sooner,</li>
    <li> Love these brush set! I like the fact that the manufacturer offers instructions guide @ their website !</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes I just wish it would come with the foundation brush and powder brush to be complete.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed as I have so many of these brushes and know exactly how the bristles look, straight hairs, not wavy from the bottom to half way up.  The color of the metal below the brush to where it meets the black handle is a completely different color.  The writing is different on the handles.  The case has never been a very unattractive white case which does not work properly to prop brushes.  These are most certainly &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; Real Techiques Core Collection Set.  I puchased this exact set awhile back and compared the two, very upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller, if you are willing to send me the correct set I will be happy, otherwise I wish to be refunded.  (I am happy to take pictures and post)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this next week giving the seller a week to do right.  Kind regards.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re awesome! Very soft and efficient, I definitely recommend. ♡</li>
    <li> I like these Techniques brushes more than any others I&#x27;ve tried. They work well, and are very affordable, especially in a set.</li>
    <li> I love it so much I bought it then traveled with it and forgot it in a diff country, when I returned I re-bought the product. They are all very good brushes. The biggest brush I use for foundation. the smallest for around the eyebrows concealer, the foundation brush use for concealing under eye and the contour brush for contouring (which I rarely use). I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The brushes are sooo soft. I love them. For the price, these brushes are pretty good. I will purchase them again for a friend</li>
    <li> Some brushes in the set I know I will not use.  For instance the powder brush and detailed brush.  Other than that this set has a great contour brush and buffer brush for blush and contour!</li>
    <li> I wish I purchased these brushes before I bought any MAC or Sigma brush. It gives the same performace at a MUCH lower cost! Outside of the buffing brush I honestly dont use the brushes for what they are labelled as but because they are multi-functional it makes such a great product. The foundation brush is perfect for applying under eye concealer, the contor blush is PERFECT for contoring and can also be used as a blush brush as well. I hardly use the lip brush but when I do it&#x27;s very useful to apply concealer on those small blemishes that may appear on your face from time to time and the buffing brush is so great for applying my mineral powder. If you are looking for the best brushes at an affordable cost then this. is. IT. Look no further. No shedding. I wash it weekly and the bristles are still soft and NONE has come out. Do yourself a favor and buy it!</li>
    <li> After looking at many makeup brushes on amazon, many were more cheaper options for more brushes, but overall I liked the previous reviews and the look of these. So glad I ordered, no bad smell, like some complain about with other brushes, they were perfect and exactly what i needed, now to find a eyeshadow brush by real Techniques, and ill be a happy camper</li>
    <li> These are really good brushes at a great price! I am beyond pleased, their hair is 100% cruelty free and they are simply amazing.. I will probably order more of them soon :)</li>
    <li> This brushes are soft and they don&#x27;t shed the price is definitely worth it! i would absolutely purchase them again if i have too. I recommend them to everyone</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! then are affordable and really good quality for the price. I Love them so very much</li>
    <li> i really like like the texture of the brushes. they are also very cute, i totally recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> For the price point, the brushes are great. However, I only do like the contour and buffing brush.&lt;br /&gt;Hardly touched the detailer brush.</li>
    <li> The brush bristles are a bit shorter than what I like for the biggest brush, making it a little stiff. Not soft and luxurious at all.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great brush set; and I&#x27;ve used brushes from Lancome, Mac, Sephora, etc. The only brush I wasn&#x27;t a fan of was the large concealer brush--it was pretty stringy in my opinion, and has already worn down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the contouring brush, though--I would&#x27;ve bought this set again just for that brush.</li>
    <li> Soft and very effective!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and make applying my makeup easier with more professional looking results. Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great overall set and is very comparable to higher end brushes. They are very affordable and can be used exclusively to take care of all face makeup. I have washed them numerous times and they still retain the same shape and performance that they did on the first use. The case is also great for travelling with. The brushes have names on them to tell you where to use them which is useful for beginners, however the brushes can be used for more than one purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detailer brush can be used on pesky pimples however I find myself reaching for it more as a lip brush on dark opaque lipsticks which can be harder to apply straight out of the lipstick tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed foundation brush can be used for foundation, but it is very small and takes a long time to cover the face. I use this to blend the concealer under my eyes into my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buffing brush is great for mineral makeup as well as applying liquid foundation. It can also be used for blush as well as bronzer for an all around bronzed look instead of harsh contouring. I also use this for powder and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contour brush fits perfectly in the contours of my cheeks so it is great with bronzer but it also works well with blush. This is also great to set powder, especially under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes ! They absolutley amazing ,super soft, blend everything really well specially foundation when you buff it and blush brush also i use for contouring the cheeks is awesome i didnt find the flat brush useful (to be honest) but the rest was wonderful. Definatley reccomend it for someone who is looking for good brush set and not wanting to spend so much on one. Its probably the same quality/or even better :)</li>
    <li> No complains on this end, these brushes are pretty good. Reason behind it not being all 5 starts was the concealer brush,.. ehhhh they could have made it better, from my end that is, and the case, if you&#x27;re getting this product because of the case then sorry but it is a cheap and ugly case,... over all the brushes are ok.</li>
    <li> I got my package on time today and was so excited to use these brushes. I have a few already that I have bought separately and have decided that I need each and every brush they make. I have been watching Pixiwoo on YouTube for awhile now and was so excited to hear that Sam had designed a brush set. These brushes do not shed and pick up just the right amount of product each time. I also like the case/stand that they come in, that makes them a lot easier to travel with! All in all I am very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing the real Techniques Starter Set next!</li>
    <li> fine brush. perfect for all cosmetic use. i love it. the top brush is very soft but dense. thank you!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best I&#x27;ve ever used/owned. They do their individual jobs so amazingly, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy the starter set.  I would recommend these brushes over the more expensive ones, for sure.  I use these for contouring and highlighting, and love the way the foundation brush blends.  So in love!</li>
    <li> best best best best brushes ever . good price . great quality . I will buy the other brushes as soon as i can !</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and well made!! When I use these my make up has the airbrushed look! They also do not leave little bristles on your face after you use them! They are by far my favorite brush set!!</li>
    <li> I love them, they are so soft and nice wand material, I found love in these brushes, I think I might buy other brushes soon til I have the whole collection</li>
    <li> Definitely will reorder these! Bought an expensive Mac brush and HATE it. Love the powder brush in this set!</li>
    <li> Compared to what I&#x27;ve found of this brand in stores, these brushes have smaller and shorter bristles. So you definitely control makeup, but I prefer longer, fluffier bristles to achieve a lighter pigment application. Personal preference only. Quality is good. I will stash in travel case but not daily use.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes everr!</li>
    <li> My daughter took this and is using it.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE these brushes!! I&#x27;ll prob order more</li>
    <li> This is the perfect core collection of brushes. the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fray. Price was perfect.I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. I like how they say on them &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; ext. Totally functional. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Lovely, high quality brushes that so far have stood up to much abuse. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good quality set of brushes for inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> Will forever be a bug fan of real techniques. Bristles fall out very rarely but sometimes they do. I love the feel of these brushes though and how well they pick up and transfer products.</li>
    <li> Love my brushes!  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SET. My friend bought me one and I bought another for myself after using it for a long time. It&#x27;s compact and buffs my powders and blush flawlessly!</li>
    <li> The only thing missing from this set is a flat-top brush, but this is an excellent kit. The brushes are very soft and excellent for applying makeup!</li>
    <li> These brushes provide great coverage and flawless finish. Impressed, especially for $. If you purchase, there are great tutorials provided online by the creator.</li>
    <li> The brushes work for a variety of different uses. I use the smallest concealer brush for precise detailing for my eye shadow looks and it does amazing. Like creating the outer \\&quot;V\\&quot; for a smokey eye...omg it works wonderful! The rest are great for blush, all over powder, contouring, and highlighting.</li>
    <li> Love...love....love this set! Very inexpensive and great for beginners and make up artists! Highly recommended! To ladies who love make up, these brushes are great to have!</li>
    <li> Very good one. I got this brushes for my wife and she liked it very much and told me that it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is valuable for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest it.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed having these brushes! The bristles are very soft and do not shed when applying makeup. The brushes are also really comfortable to hold, not bulky or awkward. The carrying case is nice but I do not use it as a stand because there really isn’t a reason to do so. I do wish that they had included a blush brush. It seems like that is the only brush missing to make this set complete. Overall, they were a great buy and I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> The foundation brush doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky like my mac brush does. The blush brush spreads the blush on well. It doesn&#x27;t apply it the heavily and the brushes are great for blending. The concealer brush is the only one I use. I ordered a set for myself and for my sister. I seriously love these brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes leave my foundation feeling amazing, does not make my foundation look cakey. They are also the perfect size!</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good. I don&#x27;t use all of them, but it&#x27;s quite a useful set to have. For example, foundation brush is way too small for me to be very efficient, but I use it as a concealer brush or for areas that are hard to reach with an Expert brush.</li>
    <li> This Brush set is very nice, not sure why it comes with a carrying case, its was hard to put tools back in. I just stuck them in my container of other brushes. Feels good on skin and cleans well!</li>
    <li> These brushes fulfill every promise they make.  They are the best for contouring no doubt, I have used many kinds of brushes, but these top them off.  Only set back is they are hard to take out of the casing for each use.</li>
    <li> I swear by real Techniques brushes and this set is amazing.  Soft, durable, excellent value and NO shedding!  The brushes are also true multi-taskers and can be used in a variety of ways.  I use the detailer brush to pack eyeshadow in my outer V and I use the contouring brush not only for contouring but also for blending out my eyeshadow.  Sounds crazy but it works!  This set truly puts over-priced Mac and Sigma brushes to shame.  I plan on buying another set just to get my hands on an extra buffing and contour brush.  If they ever decide to sell those two brushes separately, it is on!</li>
    <li> I bought this set after seeing some of the brushes used in makeup tutorials on youtube. I really have loved the set and honestly have nothing negative to say about it. Some previous users have complained about shedding but I have not noticed any more shedding that usual in a brush. These brushes are also very easy to clean and the material used for the bristles dries quickly. The brushes all have many uses, for example I like the foundation brush for concealing under my eyes- however, it is rather small so I imagine if it were used for regular foundation application it would be time consuming. Overall, I would really recommend the brushes.</li>
    <li> So these have got to  be the holy grail of makeup brushes. First of all, they LOOK pretty. Its hard to find a brush set that looks pretty and is inexpensive. But they perform GREAT. I am so surprised at how well they perform. I shouldnt be, but I guess for the price I paid I wasnt expecting much. BUT I am pleasantly surprised! And very happy. These are my go to brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought what was supposed to be a fool proof system for using face brushes.  Packed them in my travel case for my next trip.  Very first use and I had black hair ove my face.  Too late to return.  If you buy be sure to use immediately to decide if you really want them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes my foundation glides on I use the concealer brush for my brows the contour brush is perfect for the apples of my cheeks great set will be repurchasing for my kit&lt;br /&gt;Olga</li>
    <li> These brushes are of great quality for the price and are very versatile. I often use the buffing brush for powder but have also used it for bronzer and for blush. The contour brush is great for highlighter or bronzer. I actually use the tiny detailer brush to highlighter the inner corners of my eyes and under the brow bone. The pointed foundation brush is the only one I have yet to use (I generally apply foundation/tinted moisturizer with my fingers) but I&#x27;m sure I will find a use for it. Anyone who enjoys makeup but does not want to break the bank on expensive brushes should definitely have these in their collection.</li>
    <li> This product was affordable and I have enjoyed using these brushes during my daily makeup routine. Really a great purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i like the brush i bought. it&#x27;s soft, and the material is good, and not expensive.  and for a beginner, i think it&#x27;s enough .</li>
    <li> From all the sets, this is the only one I would repurchase. The foundation brush is way too small for foundation, but I love it for under the eye concealer, Love the contour brush but I use it to apply highlighter rather than for shading and to apply a thin layer of powder underneath the eye to set my concealer as the size is perfect for that. The buffing brush is great! Love it!</li>
    <li> good presents, my wife love it</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes for the price. The big one is perfect for blush.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS AUTHENTIC AS I HAVE COMPARED IT TO STORE BOUGHT REAL TECHNIQUE BRUSHES AND THEY LOOK FEEL AND PERFORM THE SAME.  I DONT USE THE CASE BUT IT SURELY COULD COME IN HANDY</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for anyone needing good quality brushes at an affordable price. I have been using these brushes daily for months now and still love them as much as I did on the first day! I have not experienced any issues with brush strands falling out, poking, etc. and they are easy to clean. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It came in perfect condition very satisfied</li>
    <li> This set was the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve properly used and they were great tools! As a beginner to properly applying my makeup, I heavily recommend these handy brushes (well most of them) to newcomers and even pros. For the price, of course it&#x27;s a bargain deal and the best part is they&#x27;re very effective. The only brush I didn&#x27;t use was the one with the smallest tip (I forget the name), I had no use for it. The buffing brush has become one of my favorite brushes but it is also my least favorite to clean. real Techniques definitely did a great job with this line but the only cons I&#x27;ve recently had with these brushes, is now the bar on the tools are peeling and the brush names are fading so the life expectancy isn&#x27;t as long as I wanted it to be. I may buy a new set for those reasons.</li>
    <li> The best brushes ever I swear. They make blending a carefree job. No better brushes out there for the price. You gotten have a set of these if you&#x27;re a makeup lover ❤️</li>
    <li> I am loving these brushes</li>
    <li> Was for my daughter and she loved it</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase for these sets for my personal use and as gifts, they&#x27;re soft and perfect for creamy products and for light usage of powder, I wish I could order the puffing brush and the contour brush seperatly though.</li>
    <li> I bought a contour kit by Anastasia Beverly Hills so I was looking for brushes to use with that kit and I love these! They work really well, very soft, and are very pretty. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> love the buffing brush. didnt really care about the others.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes. I like the way the bristles feel and they are actually better than my MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> Fake brushes but do work well, the buffing brush is much smaller than the original.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes they do everything my real expensive brushes do. I would have never spent the large amount of money for  makeup brushes if I had tried these before.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes! They are so soft and blend nicely for contour. These are good for starters as well</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the $$.</li>
    <li> THEY DO NOT SHED AT ALL. LOVE THESE !</li>
    <li> Love buffing and contour brushes...haven&#x27;t used others yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard such great things about the real technique brushes and I finally gave them a try. Overall, these are amazing brushes. I bought a SHANY 12 piece set for about the same price last year, but the quality of the brushes dwindled so fast. Plus, not all the brushes were amazing to begin with. I&#x27;m happy to say I had a better experience with the real technique brushes. I use the small concealer one the most and the contour one the least. The bristles are super soft on all four brushes, which is nice because I have sensitive skin, so it doesn&#x27;t feel prickly and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me. The only issue I have is with the powder foundation brush. I think the mineral powder from my Bare Minerals foundation is too fine because a lot of it ends up falling out. As a tip, try to swirl the brush around your face. That gives the best application for powder/mineral foundation. Overall, really happy with these brushes and will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these brushes! It really takes your make up to the next level! The best brush set with an affordable price! Just perfect!</li>
    <li> These brushes work so well for applying foundation, and concealers. Tip: If you apply a makeup mist (like MAC&#x27;s) before tapping foundation on the brush... it will go on a lot smoother &amp; last all day. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> Again this item was a gift so I can&#x27;t attest to how it held up when used. The product was as advertised add came when they said it would. Everything was satisfactory.</li>
    <li> All of these brushes are great and I love the quality! I love the blending brush which I use for bronzer and the power brush! They apply product really well. The only complaint I have is the foundation brush is a little bit streaky, but its not too big of an issue. great product all in all!</li>
    <li> Love them they stay soft even when using liquid foundation. Easy to clean, no hairs fall off. Really great brushes</li>
    <li> I recently needed to upgrade my make up brushes.  Seeing several Utube videos raving about this brush line, I decided to give them a try. I ordered this brush set and several other of the real Techniques brushes and really love them.  They are soft and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of sam and nic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i watch pixiwoo on utube religiously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sam&#x27;s brushes are the BEST ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so soft, and perfect in any way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have over half a dozen of real techniques brushes, and i am very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recently, i tried to use an old brush i had, with natural hair, and i am NEVER going back to non-taklon brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;u can watch sam&#x27;s videos on utube which explain how to use the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy make-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:--]</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really found the foundation brush to be helpful, but I love the other three, Especially the buffing brush. All of these brushes are high quality products, well made, and can be used with both liquid/cream or powder products, which is awesome. It&#x27;s unfortunate, in my opinion, that it&#x27;s impossible to buy these particular brushes separately, but this is a Great deal. At low cost, you get brushes as good or better than you can get from Sephora or Everyday Minerals or Bare Minerals (I&#x27;ve even seen YouTube videos praising this brand more than MAC brushes); plus you get a carrying case that doubles as a brush stand to boot. It doesn&#x27;t get much better than that.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these brushes. They give off an airbrushed look at a very reasonable price. They are less expensive than M.A.C. brushes however, quality wise I think they are on the same scale.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing these brushes, I did a lot of research. I already owned some ecotools brushes and I was very pleased with those. This set provides brushes I haven&#x27;t been able to find elsewhere. I would spend the price of the full set just on the buffing brush as it is so versatile. Amazingly soft, super durable,  no loose hairs, great value.</li>
    <li> Very good brashes. I really liked them. They are very soft to my skin. But hair falls down while washing after use</li>
    <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;Fast&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
    <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
    <li> Very dense bristles applies makeup like a dream. I love them and will be buying all the brushes in the future. In comparison to Shany natural fiber brushes which I also purchased and found to be great brushes, these are even better at application (i believe that the density of the bristles have a lot to do with it) and more sexy looking and labelled.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean. No shedding.</li>
    <li> fast shipping great brushes!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this set! I don&#x27;t use the carrying case because I have other brush holders, but the brushes themselves are awesome. I love how versatile they are! Since I have the expert face brush for my foundation, I use the buffing brush for powder and cream blushes. I use the contour brush to set the concealer under my eyes with powder. I use the other two brushes less often, but they are nice to have on hand. This set is awesome for how cheap it is!</li>
    <li> I have found the best set for my make up set.</li>
    <li> I love this on-the-go brush set from real techniques. The 2in1 brush holder/stand is an excellent idea. I hope all brushes comes with this brush holder.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Absolutely love them! I pretty much use them everyday now. They are my favorite. At a great price too!</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend! Wonderful brushes. Very soft, no shedding, and easy grip! Perfect for applying foundation and concealer for me</li>
    <li> This is the best 15$ I ever spent. The buffing brush and contour brush are perfect. I don&#x27;t ming if it falls apart in a couple months I&#x27;ll buy another set. Great brushes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup addict and I&#x27;m so glad I got this. The price and quality is amazing. I do not use the small brush because I do not need it. If you are trying to get into the makeup business and I recommend starting with buying this, a Sigma Kabuki brush for foundation (because I did not like the foundation brush in this kit for my skin) , Mac blending brush and a good angled brush.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I don&#x27;t know what else to , I think they&#x27;re priced affordable, they&#x27;re soft and do a great job:)</li>
    <li> I got these brushes and I fell in love right away. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the finished results after I apply my make-up in the morning. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to get them.</li>
    <li> You know what, reviews don&#x27;t lie. I have been eyeing out this set for a few months now but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I am willing to pay that much for just eye brush set. Well I finally came to my senses after reading all the reviews on Amazon and I have to say boy, those brushes are AHHHMAZING! I have had ecotools brush set before which I used for over a year and they were wonderful. This set reminds me of it and also since they are made by the same company the quality is obviously GREAT! I did not experience any shedding, the bristles are super soft and pick up just enough product without any excess. I use all four brushes! my favorite one is the buffing brush. I think it&#x27;s the favorite of everyone&#x27;s haha. I wish it was a big bigger but hey it&#x27;s one of the BEST brushes on there. I am VERY happy with my purchase, the price and quality. I will definitely repurchase when these go bad.</li>
    <li> These brushes really love up to all their hype. Their inexpensive, useful and leave the most beautiful finish on the skin. The expert face brush is also amazing! A must have for anybody who loves make up.</li>
    <li> amazing brushes love love it work perfectly fine no problem no hair all over  the place i wash my brushes allot and they are still in good condition my brushes are  7 months old an still working fine</li>
    <li> Love!! Some of my most absolute favorite brushes they are apart of my everyday use love how they pally makeup and the finish is amazing</li>
    <li> Great good value for money</li>
    <li> I love my brushes! They came pretty quick. I use them every day. Easy to clean. I love them.</li>
    <li> First of all I got my package earlier than expected so that&#x27;s a huge plus...I washed them the first night I got them and couldn&#x27;t wait to play with them the next day. They don&#x27;t shed are super soft and leave your face looking FLAWLESS!! I am going to buy every real techniques brush available to mankind lol</li>
    <li> This brushes are a-mazing!!!!!! I am a huge fan of sigma brushes, but now i am going towards this brushes more, price+quality the best!</li>
    <li> love it, so good and easy to work</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase, really enjoy all of the brushes that come in this awesome set! Would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! THESE BRUSHES DONT SHED AT ALLL!!!! Amazing quality!!! SO soft!!!! Low priced!! so smooth on the skin! recommend recommend! :-)</li>
    <li> The foundation brush is one of the best I ever tried, you need it ! Not quite as soft as some people say it is, but very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for a few months now.  They apply makeup beautifully and are incredibly soft. They are easy to wash and come perfectly clean.  If you are looking for great brushes, these are it...no matter your budget.  I actually threw away my other (more expensive) brushes because they felt scratchy and worthless compared to these.  I also have the eyeshadow brushes, the stippling brush and travel essential set.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to spend more than $20 dollars on single brush. The set quality is amazing. They don&#x27;t shed and they are super soft.  And the price is insane! Love them!</li>
    <li> Also bought the brushes for eyes in addition with these along with the eyebrow and eye lash brush. Love this brand and the varsity of brushes. And that the name and use for brushes is on the handles. The case and stand idea is amazing and handy too.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my now complete set</li>
    <li> These are awesome brushes. Great for eyeshadow, foundation and eyebrows. They also work well for contouring highlighter and blush.</li>
    <li> Meh...i don&#x27;t get all the hype i tried using these brushes in the way some beauty gurus do and its not a fav for me.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my sister i personally did not use them so i dont know how is but she told me to give it a 5 star before she asked me to buy it for her she read  alot of reviews and watch many videos on youtube so finally i bought them for her and now she is so happy with them she cant stop wearing makeup just to use them</li>
    <li> I think I was expecting too much from this set. It is quite good but not so perfect. For me, flat foundation brush is tiny and cant work properly on any kind of faces, it would be better if it was bit bigger than itself. Others are great for applying makeup specially counter and buffing brushes are almost perfect!</li>
    <li> bought it a long time ago, one of the best things i have ever bought. Really long lasting, really smooth, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> So soft and durable. Totally recommend. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I puchased the brushes as a gift.  The brushes are soft and the quality was nice. I will be buying some for myself.</li>
    <li> I went through a phase of buying really expensive Bobbi Brown brushes, to specialized brushes from makeup companies like hourglass and urban decay, to bargain brands like eco tools. These real techniques brushes, however, are the most convenient and most used out of my lot. I love the case because it allows me to take them everywhere. They are lightweight, but not cheap feeling and the bristles are incredibly soft. It really picks up and distributes products so well. I love them, much like all the other reviewers and the price is phenomenal, without giving you too many unnecessary brushes you probably won&#x27;t use unless you&#x27;re a makeup artist.</li>
    <li> excellent product arrived in good condi...</li>
    <li> I really like this set, combined with the real Techniques travel essentials set it makes a perfect full set. Very pleased with the texture of these for mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes for how inexpensive they are.  I love to use the tapered brush for adding in precise contouring, and then use the largest brush to buff it out.  The results are damn-near airbrushed.  They don&#x27;t shed, they blend amazingly...  I&#x27;d buy them again and again.</li>
    <li> These brushes have been a great addition to my collection!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this set of brushes. I have never purchased high-end brushes because I can&#x27;t afford to spend so much money on a brush - I&#x27;d rather spend it on actual skincare. But this set is wonderful and very multipurpose. I use all of these brushes for multiple purposes and they work well for everything. The case is also incredibly handy and has room to keep other brushes in there. I put my eye brushes in there and I am set. I don&#x27;t need to carry any other brushes or brush kits. The only problem I have is that the domed brush is starting to shed! I&#x27;ve had it for quite a few months now, and all the other brushes are fine - which is why I took off one star - but it is still an amazing set of brushes and it was worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought the set solely for the buffing brush. It is just amazingg! I wish the buffing brush was sold separately.</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes. They have a good weight on them. I use the buffing brush as more of a blush brush and the detailer brush isn&#x27;t very sturdy since it&#x27;s bottom is kinda curved but I love them anyway (:</li>
    <li> What is there to say about these brushes?  I&#x27;m going to keep it short with a few points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- The brushes are totally worth it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;- They are all very soft.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Random: I love the shape of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the buffing brush to apply powder, and it works perfectly for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t use a foundation brush at all.  It just seems out of the picture now with all the different ways to apply foundation.  (Works as a concealer brush!)&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t particularly care for the case the brushes come in either, but at least it comes with one!</li>
    <li> I really like the contour brush for using bronzer and the face brush for applying foundation.</li>
    <li> Connect the product was on time and deal with the seller very sophisticated product is worth the experience&lt;br /&gt;Worth 5 stars</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling and doing all the basics. The brushes do not shed and the size of the case is perfect!</li>
    <li> My favorite brushes.  They are so soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> For one reason or another, I can never find Real Technique brushes anywhere other than online. I am a huge fan of Amazon&#x27;s Prime 2-day shipping so I knew I&#x27;d be ordering these brushes from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are amazing quality for the price you pay. I prefer them over any other brushes (their price makes it super easy).&lt;br /&gt;The buffing blush is perfect for foundation and even powder.&lt;br /&gt;I use my pointed foundation brush for under eye concealer.&lt;br /&gt;The contouring brush is great for highlighting.&lt;br /&gt;They are all amazing brushes and you won&#x27;t regret buying them!</li>
    <li> I have been doing makeup for about a year on my friends, found that the real technique core are the best.  Product goes on so nice and easy.</li>
    <li> I  have a small face so these are the perfect size for me. I&#x27;m usually disappointed when it comes to face brushes of the internet but these are more than worth their value and I  strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great and so soft! The are especially great for buffering. Very high quality for the price, definitely a great set for both beginners and make-up crazy ladies like me :)</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they&#x27;re super soft &amp; great quality! The price is awesome too!</li>
    <li> This brushes are super soft on my very senstitive skin , and the countour brush do its job very will .</li>
    <li> What a lovely little brush set. Here&#x27;s how I use them, going from left to right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush #1 (contour) I use this for blush and bronzer on my cheeks.Precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush #2 (foundation) I use this in conjunction with my fingers to apply foundation. I dip the brush in the lid of my liquid, and paint it on my problem areas, and then blend it out with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush #3 (concealer): I use this to apply my lipstick. My lips are a weird, full shape, and I have trouble being precise with merely the bullet. I apply as much as I can straight from the bullet, and then I blend and smooth the product with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush #4 (powder?): I rarely put product on this brush, instead I use it for buffing. It works beautifully at buffing away any eye shadow fallout. I also use it at the end of my routine if anything in my foundation needs &amp;#34;smoothed over&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
    <li> These are such great brushes.The bristles keep their shape with use and with washing. I like the card it comes with too, that tells you what each brush is meant for.</li>
    <li> What can I say? These brushes are the best! And they are priced so well compared to so many others that you could pay a fortune for and are nowhere near as good as these. I am all about make up and quality and these are the best out there for the price.</li>
    <li> My mom bought these for me because she wanted to get her order&#x27;s total price past the amount needed for free shipping. I always go with real Techniques for my makeup brushes and this is a great, basic set. They spread the makeup smoothly without leaving streaks like brushes with harsher bristles do. I only use them to do my own makeup (foundation/concealer/highlighting), and only wear makeup like twice a month, but I always find these brushes to be high quality for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Brushes are good quality, the case is a great size for fitting in my makeup bag, and it also converts to a stand which is awesome. There is also an elastic band on the other side of the case which can be used for pencils, etc. This is an excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about the real Techniques brushes and how great they are.  For me, they&#x27;re adequate, but not phenomenal, at least on me and my skin. Others, no doubt, have great results but mine was just okay, good but just okay.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made other RT brush purchases and have had the same meh results, will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> These are definitely my go to face brushes. The quality is amazing, they are easy to clean &amp; best of all inexpensive. I clean them with baby shampoo and they are like new.</li>
    <li> Great  ,they cover well !</li>
    <li> I love all the brushes in the set but the foundation is way too small for application so I use the buffing brush instead.</li>
    <li> I really like this set. It helps me apply my make up easier.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of researching before I bought a set of brushes. I wanted high quality brushes, without the price tag. I chose the real techniques core collection. The shipment came on time and so far, I have been very pleased with the purchase! I washed them and have used them everyday now and have had no hairs fall out. Im not too crazy about the case they are in, but it is effective. For the price, I love these brushes! My makeup looks better and goes on smoother... will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> I bought these for My wife and she loves these brushes, excellent quality, original, she love them all</li>
    <li> The product was really good. It kept up to my expectation. The brush holder isnt that useful since it does not keep the brushes standing up. The sizes that are shown on amazon arent correct</li>
    <li> I discovered these brushes watching the creator&#x27;s YouTube makeup guide channel, Pixiwoo, which I highly recommend.  The brushes are soft, don&#x27;t shed (like the natural bristle bare escentuals brushes do) and I just love them.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much. I am actually on Amazon today to purchase another set. Not because the other set wore out but because I use them for so many things that it would just be easier to have 2 sets. This way I dont have to clean them while I&#x27;m doing my makep routine, I can just wait until the end. The contour brush is my favorite brush. I use it for my blush, bronzer and highlighter. Its the perfect size. The pointed concealor brush is my next favorite. Initially I didnt use it at all. One day I decided to use it to buff in my under eye concealir and I just fell in love with its ability. The sharp pointed angle allows me to leave a crisp line at the outer corner of my eye and it buffs out shadow fall out beautifully. Now it is one of the brushes I use every day. The buffer brush leaves a satiny smooth finish especially with MUFE HD finishing powder. The small brush is so versatile. It works great for lip stick and concealing small blemishes. But what I use it for most is for placing cream eyecshadows as a brow highlighter or at the inner tear ducts of my eyes. I love the quality. I have washed them once a month for the last year and daily with a brush cleaner and they are still in fabulous condition. These are well worth the money spent considering some brands sell one brush for the price of this whole set. I am so glad I found this brand I purchased all the brush sets and individual ones sold. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Goood quality love them alottt</li>
    <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had.  I think I&#x27;ve ordered just about every brush Real Techniques makes now.  Makes putting on makeup fast and foolproof.  I find new uses for them all the time..</li>
    <li> I use this set everyday, the foundation brush is great for liquid foundations and washes really easily with face soap. Synthetic fibers, but extremely soft and hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes!</li>
    <li> All products as described. Delivered in time. Great experience!</li>
    <li> No shedding and great price.</li>
    <li> This is the second set I ordered and couldn&#x27;t be happier!! Original packaging, brand new! Love these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are my first set of makeup brushes that weren&#x27;t dollar store quality. They amazing and a great buy for the price! These brushes are very soft to the touch and are very dense and fluffy. The stand that they come in is very nice and find nicely on a bathroom counter. They apply foundation beautifully and really setting it into my skin making my foundation and concealer last much longer than when I use to apply it with just my hands. I personally do not contour very much, but these brushes are wonderful for contouring. The brushes also clean very easily which I find very nice about these brushes. Would I recommend these brushes? I would highly recommend them, especially for the price that they are set at!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for contouring powders. Don&#x27;t like the cheap case though.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Bristles are so soft and workes with blending so well. It&#x27;s easy to care for.</li>
    <li> Love this set of brushes. I use them on a daily basis. I really enjoy using them as contour brushes and blending for foundation and concealer. While the price may seem low these brushes are a very good quality better than any brushes that u have purchased previously from target or other drug stores. These are also great brushes if you are a beginner in the makeup world.</li>
    <li> Great quality, budget friendly for make up beginners would have prefer a wider foundation brush.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing value and the brushes are so soft.  I was looking for an alternative brush set to replace my BM brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to pay a high price for a mediocre product.  I ordered this set after some research and I would definitely buy again/recommend. The buffing brush has less surface area than what I&#x27;m used to using, but I don&#x27;t find it to be a problem.  The brush actually fits better in the lids of my travel/trial sized products.  The case is a great bonus and perfect for travel.  There is also room on the opposite side of the case for additional brushes, so this should fit all your make-up brush essentials safely while traveling.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes !!!!! I would recommend these to anyone. They work so well and for the price that&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> the best manmade brushes i ve ever use.soft but easy to make up.also very cheap.deliver time also very short.and every brush writes it&#x27;s using way ,very convinient</li>
    <li> I went from using Walmart $3 brushes to these.  I thought good brushes were expensive and not worth the cost, boy was a wrong.  These are reasonably priced, so soft and really change makeup application!!</li>
    <li> Very soft on skin,no bad odour. Delivery was on time and packed so nicely,and thanks to Amazon for quick and safe delivery.these brushes are beyond my expectations.....so beautiful ladies out there must buy these brushes.highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this item so much!!!</li>
    <li> They are good quality brushes. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I thought the largest brush would be a good powder brush but it&#x27;s actually quite small. If you are prepared for that than you should be very pleased but to be honest I wish I would have skipped this set and just bought the single powder brush.</li>
    <li> Awesome exactly what I wanted and love that the box tells you what each brush should be used for if your new to using brushes</li>
    <li> This is a good set which I bought with the eye essential set. I chose this and the eye essential set over eco tools and I am very satisfied. I have asian eyes and a big face. These brushes are small for your face but they worked for me well. I used the pointed foundation brush for applying foundation/concealer under my eyes between my brows and around my mouth and nose which worked perfectly. It really got into the corners and under my eyes well. I used the big brush(forgot what it&#x27;s called) to set my foundation with powder. The brushes are really soft on my skin, no pokey hairs, I haven&#x27;t had any fall out either. The case is alright, I find it a hassle when I&#x27;m in a rush to shove it back in the elastic, individual pockets would be better for me. I use the contour brush for contouring, bronzing and blush which works fine.the precise brush is good for anything you need precise things done but it&#x27;s very small like less than 1/3 of a centimeter.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;As good as my MAC ones.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to buy the entire lot!</li>
    <li> These brushes are unbelievable soft, and for the first time in my life, I actually have the \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; look  to my foundation! I use the blending brush in the core collection and honestly it&#x27;s the best brush I have ever used! I will be ordering more soon:)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my friend for Christmas. She said she wanted face makeup brushes and I know this is a good brand. Came fast and was as described.</li>
    <li> perfect brushes,, perfect quality, awesome price ^^&lt;br /&gt;the best thing is that the metallic part of the handle is long so when you wash your brush the water dose not sink inside it :)</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is fantastic. They really are a good value from what you pay for to what you get. Whether you are just starting out with makeup or have lots of brushes already, these brushes are must haves. The only complaint I might have is that the foundation brush is a little smaller than I expected. Amazing product though</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and makeup lover. So I have LOTS of brushes. And these brushes are great. Their dense and so soft. I didn&#x27;t need anymore brushes, but decided to give myself a set from real Techniques for my birthday...and glad I did.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of brushes for an awesome price :) the buffing brush is AMAZING for liquid foundation, it makes your skin look airbrushed. The pointed foundation brush is perfect for under eye concealer. The contour brush is great for contouring haha as expected. WELL worth the money</li>
    <li> Great blush brush. My favorite brush is the contour brush , it&#x27;s really the only one I use out of this set. If I were to buy this again I wouldn&#x27;t buy the entire set because other brands offer better concealer and detail brushes but I would definitely buy the contour brush again. No hairs have fallen out even after washing. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Probably the best brushes I have ever owned. I use the buffing brush to apply liquid foundation and it works great. I use the little brush as a lip brush. I love the contour brush as well. I will definitely look forward to buying more brushes from Sam Chapman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that they are made of aluminum so the paint wont chip off like with my more expensive brushes from Make up forever and MAC. The black paint tends to chip off of them after awhile....</li>
    <li> Quality brushes at a great price! I&#x27;ll use every one of these sizes, too. Very excited &amp; pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> i use the biggest brush (can&#x27;t remember its name) the most and highly recommend this set just for that brush, the brushes all wash well</li>
    <li> Wow amazing brushes! I love theses brushes, I gonna order few more and suggest to many friends to have them.&lt;br /&gt;Very flawless application.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I don&#x27;t know why I always used sponges before. It is my first time applying make up with brushes and i love it! My face looks so much more natural, smooth. The brushes are smooth as well and have not shed so far. I&#x27;ve had them for a few days now. The only reason why I did not give 5 stars is because I find the brushes hard to clean.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re super soft and smaller than what&#x27;s expected. I like them a lot and I&#x27;m planing to buy another real techniques brushes.</li>
    <li> I use this brush set everyday. I use the buffing brush to apply my mineral foundation. It does not shed and is so soft. Can&#x27;t say more great things about that line.</li>
    <li> if you over wash them the bristles will fall out...  other wise great!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush set. I love that it comes in a case to keep them all together and to keep them nice.</li>
    <li> good quality product!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a real techniques convert! love them!</li>
    <li> This set is fantastic! You can finish foundation, eye shadow, contour/highlight, concealer, and blush all with only one set. Really convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> bristles too firm for my taste.</li>
    <li> I love this set an utilize all of the brushes!</li>
    <li> Love this set.  Everything you&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> I have owned and used many different brands of brushes from top brands like MAC to cheap brands in CVS that look like a deal. I did my homework on these brushes &amp; I was expecting something great &amp; I definitely was surprised because my expectations were actually surpassed. They&#x27;re even better than I though they would be. These brushes put my foundation on absolutely flawlessly. I get compliments on my make-up since I have been using these brushes!! They&#x27;re super soft &amp; I have been using them everyday &amp; also washing them everyday &amp; not once single hair has fallen out of them, so the quality is really up there with the professional style brushes. I want to buy another set &amp; keep it in its packaging so that when these do eventually need to be replaced, I&#x27;ll have my back-ups ready to go. I want the entire \\&quot;Real Techniques\\&quot; Brush collection!</li>
    <li> Im a fan of Samantha&#x27;s tutorials on youtube, so as soon as I was able to buy this brushes I did, most of all because Ive seen that a lot of other makeup artists use them as well. They are affordable and soft, easy to clean, some of them have a lineal base so they stand up on vanities and desks. This particular set has 4 brushes, all with the same color (which corresponds to face) and their bristles are synthetic so they can work powders, creams, liquids and minerals:&lt;br /&gt;1. The pixel detailer brush: this is meant to be as concealer brush. however, its really tiny, so I use it for lips and also for gel eyeliners, when i dont want a perfect line.&lt;br /&gt;2. The Pointed foundation brush: This one has a triangular shape, and its flat: This one I use for concealer around my nose for example. Never for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;3. The contour brush: I love this one, specially for the size. Its meant to be for contouring, and it fits  perfectly in the hollow of the cheeks. However, my face is kinda small, so must of all the blush brushes are big for the surface I want to deal with, so this has doubled as blush brush, with incredible results.&lt;br /&gt;4. The Buffing Brush: i didnt expected to love this one but its my favorite so far. My foundation has never looked this great, and I havent changed it. Its great for powders too, but as I said, I use it as my prime foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again, though I just would want the buffing and the contour brush, its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> i am happy with it ,i reseve it on time&lt;br /&gt;i recommond it to my frinds&lt;br /&gt;i got more as gifts for my frinds</li>
    <li> Lovely set of brushes. Good quality and very useful.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money on these!!! They are fake!! i have bought real techniques brushes from the store and they are not the same quality of those!! super disappointed, just save your money and the disappointment I suggest you not even waste your time on these!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice however, I bought three sets to give as Christmas gifts and the boxes are very scratched up all over.  They are not bent or damaged but the presentation is hurt none the less. I know that the box doesn&#x27;t effect how the brushes will work but if you are buying as a gift just keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> Very Soft bristles, good for everyday uses! Love it! It is very good price for all of the great brushes :)</li>
    <li> I have a core set of stigma brushes which are almost triple the price. Ultimately I prefer the &#x27;real techniques&#x27; brushes WAY better. EXCELLENT BUY, so worth it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased good price</li>
    <li> When i received my package i was expecting something differrnt. I thought the brushes were going to be bigger.  But these are somewhat small. But other than this they are great brushes. Super soft and i love the case that comes with it but i wish they weren&#x27;t set in a specific spot. i wish i could just switch spots with brushes but anyways these are great brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice for the price.</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes for anyone who wants quality but do not want to spend too much or too little. Recommended for any beginner.</li>
    <li> For it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s a great deal!  Quality is very good and feels so soft to the skin.  I cannot be happier with these brushes.  Real Techniques are brushes that are not killing you with extra dollars.  They are reasonably priced and are fantastic for daily use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes.  A must have for anyone who uses makeup.  Once you try these, you won&#x27;t use others.</li>
    <li> Its OK. Gave it to my G&#x27;daughter as part of a little make up kit. I did wash the brushes first.</li>
    <li> These brushes are way beyond my expectations!!  The nicest brushes I have used and highly recommend anyone to purchase these!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. I was surprised at how well this brushes work and give such a great finish. Well worth the price. Learned about these brushes from pixiwoo on youtube. I am in love, I will definitely be purchasing more brushes from this line. I highly recommend them, you will not be disappointed. My makeup goes on oh so effortlessly. You&#x27;re missing out if you don&#x27;t give them a try.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. I love the density of them and that they&#x27;re synthetic and therefore more resilient when rolled in a brush roll for travel. They work equally well for cream and powder products, and they&#x27;re easy to clean and hold up well to washing every week.</li>
    <li> These brushes are made beautifully.  However, the one for putting facial powder on, is too small, and takes a lot of dabbing before covering the face.  The one for blush is excellent, and is exactly the right size for blush.  Haven&#x27;t tried the other 2 yet.</li>
    <li> Never had any cosmetics tools until now; I have to say, I just love them! Real Techniques amazing products; will continue to shop for me ;)</li>
    <li> Real Techniques are the best drugstore-priced brushes. Love every brush in this set.</li>
    <li> They work well. Very soft bristles.</li>
    <li> I do love these. I think this set is a really nice array of useful brushes. Not like when you buy a knife block and you will only ever really use one of them. I use the smaller fluffy one for contouring, the pointed filbert for foundation around the nose, the teeny one for anything from filling my brows to smokey eye looks and the bigger fluffy one for applying liquid concealer. I know thats not really &amp;#34;what its for&amp;#34; but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have held up very well to use and I would buy them again. They&#x27;re nice and soft and no animals harmed in the making!</li>
    <li> I love the contour brush( size absolutely perfect) &amp; detailer brush( used to swipe of excess makeup at corner of my eyes) as it is small enough w pointy end which i can reach any point. Plus, all brush has soft bristles.. For the amount money paid... Really worth it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set! I highly recommend brushes from RT. They&#x27;re of great quality!&lt;br /&gt;You can read my review here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I don&#x27;t like the pointed foundation that much though.</li>
    <li> she love three realtechnigues collection set. she is very happy this. she doing add new face her makeup skin beauty.</li>
    <li> Overall, these brushes are good.  The buffing brush is very nice for achieving a flawless finish with your foundation.  I haven&#x27;t yet found a specific use for the pointed foundation brush.  The lip brush is a nice shape, but applies darker lipsticks somewhat unevenly.  This may just be the fault of my lipstick - I don&#x27;t own many dark colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real standout is the contour brush.  I love the size, shape, and density of the bristles. The brush is nice and soft.  The size is perfect for applying blush, contour, or highlighter! I really wish they sold this brush separately so I could purchase multiples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - 4 stars; 5 stars for the contour brush!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so useful. I love the big one for my powder/liquid foundation, the flat one for my primer or cream blush, the small one to spot conceal or for eyeshadow underneath my eyes. My favorite brush has to be the fluffy tapered one. I LOVE this brush for blending in my under eye concealer. It&#x27;s intended for contouring (which it also works great for) but it blends concealer like a freakin dream!! I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on more of these brushes!</li>
    <li> I have given this product that is liked her a lot of to my wife, she says that it is of great quality even if the price is contained, You consignment has been in the norm it approves the distance received in Italy in perfect way. You excuse my English.</li>
    <li> So I was super excited to receive these brushes based on rave reviews. When I received the package (which came ahead of time) I was a little underwhelmed at the presentation. These brushes are smaller than say the elf brushes (handle lenght wise) and the brush portion are small, like how travel size brushes are.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how you would go about using the brushes for what they are label as because they are so small. I would call the foundation brush a large concealer brush, the contour brush is SUPER small. I have used it to set my under eye. The buffing brush is again, super small and takes me a while to do my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;They are good brushes, super soft and they do apply the product amazingly. it just takes a whle to do so due to the size.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t really recommend or not recommend because they are decent but I am not sure I would repurchase them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and great price! I have almost the whole set and they work really well with powder or cream.</li>
    <li> I have many foundation brushes and these are by far the best. They are just as good as any $40 brushes and at the bargain price of around $10 they have my vote.</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes. They are great for those on a budget. I love pixiwoo on youtube and I am so pleased with the variety and quality of these brushes.</li>
    <li> The only qualm that I have is that the actual plastic encasing for the product itself was broken/opened. This could have been in lieu of some form of quality check, but it still worried me. Nonetheless, I washed them and they are obviously the legitimate brand based on other little things. As a PMUA I can honestly say that these brushes/this particular brand happen to be one of my absolute favorites and the absolute best price/quality wise. (For the price, you are getting a very real steal considering the quality). As long as you take care of them as you would any of your more expensive brands, &#x27;Real Techniques&#x27; brushes will last you a very long time, they truly are a worthwhile investment. I used these brushes for Portland Fashion Week last year (in the Fall) and I will be utilizing them this Spring (which is why I ordered another set, you can never have too many brushes honestly).</li>
    <li> The best brushes I&#x27;ve used! When it comes to foundation, I was using MAC stippling brushes for a while. They shed rather quick and application was not flawless. These real technique brushes are phenomenal. I use the big one for my liquid foundation and it works just lovely. I couldn&#x27;t be anymore happier with this set. Plan on purchasing the other collections! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> just got these brushes, love them so far. high quality.</li>
    <li> I really wished all these brushes could be sold separately. Not all brushes work for me. But the ones that do i love and work amazing. I use the buffing brush and the contour brush from this set and i love them. They are super soft. Great quality</li>
    <li> very soft brushes and great application; no shedding so far and I have washed them once. I don&#x27;t use the little brush as it is wayyy toooo small.  I don&#x27;t know what the use for it would be, but it is not a typical concealer brush. overall good value.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes. They are as good as sephora brushes but not even close in price. I use them as a foundation brush, concealer applicator, a powder brush and a small brush that is pretty universal. It works great to contour the nose and other areas.</li>
    <li> Cant say enough about the Real Techniques Brushes. First, my sister introduced them to me; (Based on some tutorials on YouTube for a girl who owns the real technique brushes line) My sis was impressed of how much these brushes are stunning and how you would easily achieve the perfect look and how they help you to get a professional Technique of a makeup artist, So yes I decided to buy some of them and I then gifted her. She was like touching the sky with this gift. But what I&#x27;ve noticed afterwards is that perfect, neat, skillful make up application on her face. Literally; wiped off all her imperfection. So I decided this time to buy them for myself, I bought most of them and in my way to buy the rest. I am very Happy with those Brushes and I&#x27;m really enjoying that feeling of professionalism when using them. This girl who stand on manufacturing those gorgeous brushes is not Joking!! She knows well what she is doing and what we need for achieving the perfect make up!! \\&quot;I tip my hat to her\\&quot; I think her nickname is (Pixiwoo) if I am not wrong</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks but I must say, for the price, it&#x27;s INCREDIBLE ..... Love the little makeup bag it came in but I&#x27;ve saved that for when I travel. The bristles are smooth and HIGH QUALITY - and I love high quality anything. This is truly a great product and applies makeup really well to my skin. I love the variety pack it came in, and I&#x27;m so glad I found it! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Love this brush set. The buffing brush is my most used brush to date. I use all three brushes from this set on a regular basis, minus the lip brush. The quality is great, soft brushes that blend like a dream and do not shed. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> this is the second time I buy it</li>
    <li> Nice set for travel and everyday use. No fallout from the brushes and the bristles stay soft and maintain shape throughout washes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  They&#x27;re baby-bunny soft and hold a lot of foundation.  Very well made.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting with contouring, and these have been fantastic.  Well made, too: I wash them every time I use them and I haven&#x27;t lost a bristle yet.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes and the travel case/stand they come with! First, the price is GREAT for what you are getting. Real Techniques brushes are some of the best quality I have used. All the brushes are beautiful and comfortable to hold/use! I use these brushes almost every single day. The case is handy to have when you are traveling, and you can actually fit a few more brushes in it, in case you want to take a few extras with you. Cant wait to have all their brushes/sets!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I use three of them whenever I do my makeup and the other one when using certain foundations. The price is amazing but even if they weren&#x27;t as cheap as they are I would still rave. My favorite is the buffing brush, it is soft but dense and it buffs out my foundation amazingly and effortlessly leaving no streaks. I use it with all types of foundation and BB creams and the result is a flawless application. The contour brush is also awesome. A lot of people use it to apply their highlighter but I think it&#x27;s perfect for contouring. I know some people say it&#x27;s too small but I disagree. And it blends the bronzer amazingly. The detailer brush is perfect for covering spots and I&#x27;ve read that a lot of people like it as a lip brush. The pointed foundation brush is also really good but it&#x27;s a bit small for foundation. I have used it and it works magically but I do not have the patience to use it because it is so small. But I will use it for smaller areas like around my nose and under my eyes. All in all an amazing set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I only use the buffing and tapered brush. They are great brushes I just don&#x27;t have any use for the other two. I wish it would come with two tapered brushes instead it works great to contour and set my under eyes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft , and I really enjoy the powder brush !</li>
    <li> awesome brushes.....worth the money</li>
    <li> These brushes go for about 30 or 40 dollars at ulta so buying them at this price is a steal! The brush quality it amazing and i love them!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are my favorite. They are soft and work really well. I&#x27;m glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I prefer to to do the bulk of my face makeup with clean fingers. Warm skin blends foundation and concealer in a way that a brush never could. However, sometimes I do prefer the buff of a good makeup brush and I DO still need brushes for blush/contour/highlight, and these brushes work great. You could easily do a full face of makeup with these. They&#x27;re comfortable in the hand, on the skin, and apply makeup excellently. Not to mention they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
    <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;wonderful</li>
    <li> I bout this item as a result of purchasing the stippling brush from this collection. I love these brushes. They are soft and easy to use. I will purchase more items from this collection at a later date.</li>
    <li> Wow, how incredibly soft and precise these brushes are as you use them to apply your make up. My daughter discovered this brush set on a favorite YouTube channel of hers. She is very happy with the entire collection of brushes.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re soft. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out. They blend the makeup really nice including liquid foundation and concealer. They don&#x27;t irritate my skin and they look really nice. Really good quality</li>
    <li> Love this brush set. Quality and performance as good as my more expensive brushes (MAC). Especially love the big powder brush.</li>
    <li> give 5 start cause it works for me.. definitely better than the elf brushes I was using.. I rather save the bucks and put it toward this brushes.I will definitely be buying another pack of this soon for extra brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are really nice. They&#x27;re not high-end, but they have soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out when using or cleaning them, and I like the size and weight of the handles and the shapes of the brushes. I think they&#x27;ll last me an impressively long time, especially considering their price. I don&#x27;t really like the brush case/stand because it doesn&#x27;t have a flap to protect the brushes when packed, and I don&#x27;t use it as a stand because I keep all my brushes in a cup. Overall, these are great value makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> The Best brushes ever ! price is great and the quality is great too !!</li>
    <li> Every brush is excellent, the buffing brush works excellent at blending in face powder. The contour brush is designed perfectly for contouring and the foundation brush provides excellent smooth coverage. The small brush I use to highlight the inner corners of eyes and it&#x27;s a perfect fit. I love these brushes they are well made and do not fall apart or lose bristles.</li>
    <li> My friend recommends this bush set to me. After using this, I think the bush is not that soft. I will think about whether I will rebuy it</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase.Totally Quality product.I am so excited to find these great products on amazon.I am sure i will be ordering again.i have been seeking out a set like this for some time.I think i made a great choice with purchasing this one.Thanks for the Quick ship!</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice (as in soft and fairly dense, but the case is brilliant! It protects the brushes and keeps cosmetic dust from getting rubbed all over a bag, AND it is a handy stand.</li>
    <li> I use two of the brushes everyday. (The blending brush and the blush brush I think - the two bigger ones) They work really well, I just don&#x27;t seem to find the other two as handy.</li>
    <li> Decent brushes, smaller than I expected, and not dense nor soft enough for my liking. Good for beginners.</li>
    <li> I Like these brush as well as the blush brush.  They are very soft on my face and don,t leave loose brush hairs on my face.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give 41/2★ but gave 5.they are grrat brushes however I thougt they were a little small in size but over all you get very good coverage</li>
    <li> I hardly ever review products but I must say I had to write about how great and affordable these brushes are. The apply makeup effortlessly. No shedding, soft, packing came in tact and with Amazon Prime I ordered on Friday and received it on Monday. I love that these brushes are cruelty free and very soft on the skin. Seriously a MUST buy for those MUA&#x27;s as well as the everyday person who likes to wear make up. Will be purchasing more from this brand! Great work Sam!</li>
    <li> i love using these brushes also. they are so soft and just smooth the powders on effortlessly and gently. makeup doesnt cake into the brush. (and they&#x27;re really pretty too!)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for the price. Love all the brushes but especially the buffer brush. Comes in a neat little case too. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> amazing face brushes...very soft and plastic result...easy to use, easy to clean...im very satisfied!! Thank you Samantha you created a great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> these are amazing brushes!! they are sooo soft  and the sizes are awesome. you cant go wrong just try them.....</li>
    <li> Awesome set of makeup brushes !!  Defenitely very happy and excited that I bought these through amazon especially for the price I payed. They work wonderful and are very soft !!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes they are so nice they don&#x27;t shed they are amazing and so worth the money.  I love them!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes and have not been disappointed.  I did not give a full 5 stars ONLY because I have only recently received them and I don&#x27;t know how well they will hold up.  I don&#x27;t notice any shedding right away.  They are soft.  Decent size.  They arrived quickly and were packaged well.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the way the make up goes on! I never bought make up brushes before. I&#x27;m glad I waited and bought this product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! They are soft, durable and light, and do their job perfectly. They work beautifully with creams, liquids and powders. I love that they were designed by a make-up artist who knows her business.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. My foundation goes on amazing! They are super soft and so easy to clean. Fabulous job Sam!</li>
    <li> All real techniques brushes are awesome I haven&#x27;t used one that I didn&#x27;t like they pick up product very well and blend out even better</li>
    <li> So soft. So clean. Works perfectly for apply make-up. Each brush has a different job, and going to real techniques website is helpful on how to use these to their potential. Great price (I think it was about $.1 cheaper than real techniques website) but other than that I love this brand and will buy from her again!</li>
    <li> Very useful and can beat even the high end brushes that I have like mac, channel, and lancome brushes. Buffing brush is superb.</li>
    <li> These are great quality brushes at a low price. I find myself reaching for these brushes before my sigma or crown brushes. I definitely recommend these to anyone who is just starting out with makeup. I love the carrying case they come with. Great for travel, and you can use it to dry your brushes as well. Upside down of course! I&#x27;ve already ordered the other brushes in the collection.</li>
    <li> love this brush set. perfect size carry on very convenience.&lt;br /&gt;gold is my favorite color so they are perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery which well packed.</li>
    <li> I have used sigma, mac and almost all sephora brand brushes.&lt;br /&gt;BUT THESE ARE MY FAVORITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not shed. They do not smell. And they are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;These are my new &amp;#34;go too&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Makes foundation look flawless and even! I would highly recommend these babies! Suuuper cheap for the quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a Bobby Brown set of brushes but I always finish using this one!! Great quality at a fraction of the price!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love really good makeup brushes.  I&#x27;m a brush junkie but they have to be great brushes and these are.  Super soft and little if any shedding even when cleaning them.  The contour and shape of the brush bristles are perfectly flawless.  These are wonderful brushes as a base set to build on and would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> The brushes are of amazing quality for the price! I was previously using a mix of Clinique and Dior makeup brushes, but they had become worn out after years of use and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on makeup brushes again. I read about Real Techniques brushes on multiple makeup blogs and decided to give them a shot and they turned out to be wonderful! They clean easily, don&#x27;t shed, and apply makeup flawlessly! Honestly, I like them more than any high end brush I&#x27;ve ever had. One thing I will note about this set though is that the foundation brush in it is on the smaller side. Some people probably won&#x27;t like the smaller size brush, but I like it and find it to be easier to apply foundation more precisely with it.</li>
    <li> I Really like these makeup brushes. Good quality, easy to use, convenient styles. Serves the purpose they were intended for.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
    <li> i love the buffing brush for liquid and mousse foundation&lt;br /&gt;and love the contour brush for contouring&lt;br /&gt;the other brushes i&#x27;m not to fussed about, i use the foundation brush to set my under eyes&lt;br /&gt;i currently have no use for the detailer brush but its nice to have anyway&lt;br /&gt;still a good buy for the other two</li>
    <li> very good quality for less price</li>
    <li> The brushes are as described.  They are really soft and are a great set for the price.  I would buy another set!</li>
    <li> Great brushes and more!  These were worth ordering on line as the stuff at T_____t and W____t didn&#x27;t work and M__C is too expensive!</li>
    <li> Recced to me by a friend who is an ex-makeup artist -- I told her I wanted the best brushes I could get for a reasonable don&#x27;t-wear-that-much-anyway price, and this is what she sent me. Love &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> The reviews are right on these.  They are great brushes.  Check out the you tube videos from the designers....they are incredibly helpful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. So soft and they do a great job of applying my makeup flawlessly. I had some shedding after the first use, but that was all.</li>
    <li> These brushed are better than the MAC brushes that I paid a whole bunch more for!  Especially the big one - keeps its fluffiness and has a nice feel against the skin when applying foundation.</li>
    <li> This is how my brush looked when I took it out the package! I&#x27;m very upset about it because it&#x27;s not an official real technique brush. I also compared it my other real technique brushes and it looked completely different. I will not purchase this brush set again.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, use everyday.</li>
    <li> They are great quality brushes. The buffing brush is perfect for liquid foundations and the contour brush is a very multipurpose one; it works for contouring, concealing or applying highlighter, I even use it for blusher! The foundation brush is pretty small for me and the lip brush can be used both for lips and brows!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide whether to give this two stars or three stars because just to be honest, I regret buying it. I do not recommend this collection at all. The only brush I use is the buffing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The foundation brush is literally a joke, I threw it in my cabinet and haven&#x27;t seen it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bronzing brush (which I was most excited about aside from the buffing) is not used for bronzing. I feel that this brush is to wide and big to get a precise bronze just in the hollows of my cheeks. You can see my review for e.l.f. Cosmetics Blushing, Bronzing and Blending Brush which is what I use every day for bronzing. The only thing I use the RT bronzing brush for is to highlight which works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The detailer brush is what I use for concealing very small spots. I use it with my green concealer as I have to be very precise. It&#x27;s super tiny so blending takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Last but not least, the only reason this collection gets 3 stars is the buffing brush. I love this brush. I was previously using the RT stippling brush for my foundation but this brush is worlds better. I feel like it conforms to my face whereas the stippling is really stiff. The buffing brush gives such a great finish with my liquid foundation and application is a breeze. I REALLY love it. However, the RT expert face brush is almost the exact same brush, and I have actually heard many say they prefer this brush over the buffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, the expert face brush is like $9 which I would have rather gotten than this set for $18. The only reason I use the other brushes is to justify my buying them, I have many brushes that do the same thing.. So knowing what I know now, I would buy the expert face brush for half the price and not end up with practically useless brushes that take up space.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with these brushes!!!! I originally only bought the set for the buffing brush but I discovered that I am obsessed with all of them! The quality is insane and the texture is so soft and smooth against the face. I highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> Junk. There are other 4 brush sets out there for the same price that are great, these are not. Keep searching...</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft, doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy and doesn&#x27;t shed and leave strands on my face.  I use the buffing brush more than the others.  I think the pointed foundation brush is on the small side but overall it&#x27;s a great set to have for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for the price. They are soft and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out. I use the powder brush for bronzing and the dome shaped one for highlighting. Don&#x27;t spend money on unknown brand brushes because the quality is bad. Brushes are an investment and these are good starters.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush set, it&#x27;s def worth the money.</li>
    <li> love it the price is great and they are super soft and easy to clean</li>
    <li> Real techniques are by far the best brushes I have used, and I have tons. Make up glides on like never before. And totally affordable. The maker has tons of tutorials on youtube that have transformed the way I use make up and the results I get. A must have!</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast! It came earlier than expected and I was so happy! Was not damaged at all and can&#x27;t wait to use my makeup brushes! It was also very cheap! Worth every cent:)</li>
    <li> Used up the general feeling, no effect of publicity.</li>
    <li> These work great with the mineral makeup I use to dust over my foundation.</li>
    <li> Beautiful set, no hair loss after 6 months</li>
    <li> He placed 4 orders without i ask him to order it he used my credit card he is so bad</li>
    <li> Perfect set for your kit. I am a huge real Techniques fan and use them in almost all my youtube makeup tutorials. You can&#x27;t beat the texture, quality and durability of these brushes for the price.  A++ brushes.</li>
    <li> what my wife was expecting</li>
    <li> Love this set. Great bang for my buck.  Brushes are soft and wash with ease.</li>
    <li> Love every single brush in the set!</li>
    <li> I AM INLOVE WITH THESE BRUSHES ! They are very soft and VERY good quality. I am pretty sure I will be buying all of the real techniques brushes that they sell.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I felt like I was supposed to have nice brushes. I don&#x27;t ever use them, I prefer my kabuki from bare minerals. The blush brush, I prefer bare minerals brushes over as well. I literally do not use any of these.</li>
    <li> Love them! I ordered the eye brushes also and these are quality brushes as well. Highly recommended, you need these!</li>
    <li> You get the most for your money with these. Real techniques brushes are awesome. They&#x27;re super soft and leave you with a streak-free face. The bristles don&#x27;t shed either so BUY! Also the shipping was super fast, and I used standard so again I repeat BUY.</li>
    <li> After reading the rave reviews on Ulta, I was so excited to see that these products are finally on Amazon! I am fairly new to putting on makeup, and even though I&#x27;m 23, the videos Sam puts up are easy to follow, and she tells you which of her brushes she is using! These pick up color really well, and are extremely soft. My only complaint is when it comes to mineral makeup, you have to be careful otherwise it will pick up way too much product. Sadly, since I do wear mineral makeup, I have no use for the two brushes in the middle, the foundation brush and the tiny brush (I forget the name). I am expecting to receive a pallet in the mail that has a few lip glosses, so I&#x27;ll try the tiny brush with those like Sam suggests in her videos. I think for a novice or for a pro these would be great brushes. Even if they are hard to buy because they are always sold out, keep trying. I think they are worth it!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended~!! Still haven&#x27;t figure out how could I get these perfect brush with such a low cost. I will purchase more and give them to my besties as presents~!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these brushes. Have used Mac, Inglot, Manicare, Bella Pierre, Avon and Napoleon Perdis brushes previously. Have more or less left them all in the brush bag and am using this set exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are soft on the skin but the hair itself is firm enough that you can do quite precise work without losing the shape and hold of the brush hair. Because the hairs are synthetic, the brushes are versatile and can be used on all sorts of products. They work well for the task listed on the side but work equally well in other ways. I used the eye contour brush to apply eye corrector (Bobbi Brown) and concealer with a great result. The buffing and foundation brushes do a great job and the countour brush is also great for blush application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice light handles and the brushes have gone through two cleaning cycles (Sapoderm soap + isopropyl alcohol disinfectant) without any loss of quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are Fabulous! They work just as good as other expensive brushes if not better. Soo happy i gave them a shot 😃</li>
    <li> Love love love the buffing and  contour brush! My foundation goes on better than ever. I find the foundation brush and detailer brush to be too small but still, I just find other uses for it. Overall, amazing products.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup beginner and these brushes helped me in my journey to more daring things, like wearing foundation. They are very soft and easy to use. Very well made. I would recommend these to anyone who is not able to buy one single brush for 35 dollars (like me).</li>
    <li> The best ever tried, you should buy them, very good. They don&#x27;t lose hair, very easy to clean. Very useful.</li>
    <li> Love the set.  Great brushes for a great price. I also have the large powered and blush brushes.  I have been very happy with all of these HOWEVER I also purchased the stippling brush and the bristles have been falling out since day one.  Disappointed in this and wonder if it is defective as that is not the case with the other 6 real techniques brushes I use.</li>
    <li> I love the quality and the softness of these brushes. They came nicely packaged in their little case but most importantly they work great. They don&#x27;t shed either. If you are looking for nice and inexpensive brushes, buy these.</li>
    <li> Do I sound a little over the top?  Maybe.  But these brushes for the cost of just $15 for 4 are a STEAL.  First of all, lets talk quality.  They are HIGH QUALITY synthetic brushes.  I&#x27;ve washed and dried them properly over a dozen times without any shedding or quality loss.  And the brush case?  Convenient!!!  Doubles as a stand?  GENIUS.  The ferrule is covered, making the design attractive and no more wobbly ferrules!!!  Also they are lightweight and feels like a quality product in your hand.  I&#x27;m going to go over the pro&#x27;s and cons of each brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contour Brush - I use this mainly for highlighter but can work very well as a contour brush with bronzer.  Love how it picks up my powder highlighter and it&#x27;s very easy and precise to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation Brush - Way too tiny for foundation!  If you use for foundation (which I&#x27;ve done once) it spreads it nice and soft but it will take you all day.  So I recommend you use this for concealer which by the way works great.  Since these bristles are synthetic, they also don&#x27;t soak up product which means more product will end up on your face and less wasted on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailer Brush - I don&#x27;t have much use for this brush except to highlight the corners of my eyes or lipstick.  It also can conceal small areas.  All in all, good to have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffer Brush - If this set only came with this ONE BRUSH, it would be worth it!!!  This brush is OMG that good.  So if you go on YouTube and search for &amp;#34;Real Techniques Buffer Brush&amp;#34; you will find lots of people reviewing it and using it FOR FOUNDATION.  Whaaaat?  You may say?  Yes, foundation.  Don&#x27;t knock it until you try it!  I was skeptical, but used once and have been hooked ever since!  Why is it that good?  Because the super soft bristles BUFFS the foundation into your skin as you apply and gives an airbrushed appearance.  You can also sort of stipple on product and then buff. Work in small areas especially with drugstore foundation which in my opinion covers well but dries fast.  You can also use this for mineral foundation, cream foundation and blush.  It&#x27;s a multi-tasker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added other Real Techniques to my collection - such as the &amp;#34;Expert Face Brush&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Stippling Brush&amp;#34; but I keep going back to the buffer brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - high quality, great value.  Great as presents too!  You will NOT regret this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Perfekter Einstieg in die Collection von Sam Chapmans real Techniques Pinseln. Ich persönlich finde das Case super und im Gegensatz zu anderen nutze ich es wirklich genauso. Es seht bei mir im Bad am fenster, bzw an der Fensterbank und so kann es auch nicht umfallen. Ich bin wirklich begeistert.&lt;br /&gt;Die Pinsel sind wirklich gut verarbeitet, liegen gut in der Hand!</li>
    <li> This is the best set of face brushes ever! I can recommend it to everyone. Not made of animal hair, nevertheless of good quality. I prefer some of these brushes over my very expensive MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. I have all the real technique brushes I just bought these to finish my collection. Definitely a great option for the price.</li>
    <li> love the face and blush brush, the other brushes I don&#x27;t utelize too much.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t stop using it! this set is brilliant. If you dun know what to buy .. get this!!! I also bought the expert face brush and powder brush from real techniques. Those brushes can really do a great job!</li>
    <li> Great collection has every basic brush you need</li>
    <li> After purchasing the expert foundation brush, I made up my mind that I would never purchase brushes from real techniques again. But I can&#x27;t help buying them! They are so cute ! Although they are not as soft as I expected, I want to buy every product of real techniques!</li>
    <li> I love them i just got them today and i already love them 💖💖</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes! I am pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes. Very soft and easy to clean. Multifunctional, I use them a lot on my clients.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t too bad for the cost :-)</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever i had ~ :)&lt;br /&gt;i bought several brushes to my birthday friends and now i want to get it by myself.... :)</li>
    <li> 3/4 brushes are good, but the foundation brush applies streaky and uneven</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I have bought multiples of a few of them. Wish Sam would come out with more eye brushes. But at the moment the face brushes are amazing</li>
    <li> I wrote a long review on the other one but these are great for the price . I clean them with olive oil and Dawn soap</li>
    <li> What a great deal!  I love these brushes so much and at this price it&#x27;s a great find!  Must get!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. Each one has its own perk and you can use and reuse each one for different things. Awesome set</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Washed before using.  Bristles felt hard against my skin when using with liquid. I&#x27;ll try one more time, but I don&#x27;t feel very confident that these brushes will work for me</li>
    <li> These have been the only brushes I use since I got them a few weeks ago. No shedding, super soft and the case will come in handy for traveling.</li>
    <li> I am VERY particular over what type of brushes I use, and these are, by far, the best I&#x27;ve come across - for a very reasonable price. Each one gets used daily, and the packaging for them helps to keep them nice and organized. You won&#x27;t go wrong getting this kit. The blush and powder brushes are so soft and luxurious!</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite brushes! They are amazing. And they are for a great price! Will be repurchasing these in the future.</li>
    <li> So far, I have really enjoyed these brushes.  I mostly use them with my powder foundations, so I am not sure how they will work with liquid foundations.  The bristles are soft and evenly cut as well as easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes.  These makeup brushes have great reviews on YouTube, which pushed me to buy them. They pick up makeup pretty easy and give great amounts of even coverage.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t be any more happier with these brushes! great great quality.  and the shipping was good too. less than a week two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> ولقد استخدمت هذه فرش كثيرا منذ حصلت عليها منهم وأنهم لم تسلط شعرة واحدة حتى الان. رؤساء فرشاة لم يكن لديك رائحة غريبة على عكس الشعر الطبيعي ي آخر فرش سيجما. وأعتقد أن هذا لديها ما تفعله مع تقنيات الحقيقي عن طريق الشعر الاصطناعية بدلا من ذلك. عموما، أود أن أوصى تماما هذه الفرش. انهم بأسعار معقولة ونوعية كبيرة! وخاصة الفرشاة ترقط والتلميع. أخطط لتوسيع مجموعتي. أيضا، إذا كنت تحصل على أي من مجموعات السفر، يمكنك استخدام حامل لتجفيف فرش الخاص بك. تأكد من أن الشعر الفرشاة نحو الانخفاض. عبقرية التصميم!</li>
    <li> Gift was a requested item because the receipent has first hand knowledge of this brand of cosmetic application brush set.  She was very excited to receive them.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars ! Nicknamed these &amp;#34; my babies &amp;#34; ! Extremely soft , lightweight , durable , and works well for all of my products . VERY nice quality , so for the price why not ? I&#x60;m growing my collection because they&#x60;re definitely a great brand . I just hate how they are always sold out :( They are worth the wait though i must say !! Just ordered my starter set (your eyes/enhanced) and can not wait to get them in my hands . You will not be disappointed in this product ! I recommend this for any MUA whether just starting or Pro . I ordered them on a Friday and they came on Monday so GOOD shipping too .</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush set for the price - it&#x27;s very nice quality. I&#x27;ve been using them for a month and have had no shedding whatsoever, which is a pleasant surprise considering the fact that I wash them every other day. The only thing that would make this set perfect is if it came with Real Technique&#x27;s stippling brush! All of my bases would be covered, but regardless, I love this product, and will continue purchasing from Real Techniques.</li>
    <li> These brushes are as amazing as everyone says. Sooo soft. And they blend everything beautifully. I had been looking at all the pricey brushes (Trish McKevoy, etc) for some new brushes for my mineral foundation and my powder, but these were so amazing and a fraction of the cost. They really blend everything perfectly, like no other brush I&#x27;ve owned (Stila, Trish McKevoy, Sephora- terrible!, etc etc etc). Although budget friendly, none of the fibers or hairs fall out and I love that they are vegan/no animal testing. I never knew that brushes could make such a big difference to the look of my makeup, I always just bought the expensive ones. These are dense, but super soft for the ultimate, seamless blend. My mineral foundation (just switched back) has never looked so good- the larger brush included here is my favorite (I even own her stippling brush, but prefer this one for minerals). Before, minerals sort of sat on top of my skin, now they blend beautifully and seamlessly. I don&#x27;t like a heavy makeup look, I like it to look natural, but I love great cosmetics and skincare. These brushes really do give you the HD finish! And I love the contouring brush- I&#x27;ve never understood the contouring technique really before watching Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s video- love it and use it now.</li>
    <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $65 on the Lancôme brushes because these are just as good! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are silky soft on your face and really perform as advertised. I would highly recommend this over other sets especially cheaper sets with XX number of brushes. Brushes I have used in the past do not compare to the quality of the real Techniques set.</li>
    <li> I really love these and their pretty good brushes especially considering how much they cost. All of the brushes come in handy.</li>
    <li> Very good product was shipped on time and showed up sooner than expected love the brush set. would buy again</li>
    <li> I am a total make up junkie and am shocked at the quality of these brushes. They are well designed and well manufactured. This has made my make up routine so much simpler and, dare I say, even enjoyable. I have watched the Pixi Woo sisters on You Tube for a while and Carli Bybel for tutorials and love how they give such great step by step instructions. I have Bath &amp; Body Works, MAC, e.l.f. and dozens of other brands of brushes. I can confidently say I will be throwing all of my brushes away after getting and using these. They are simply wonderful. I am so pleased that I have already ordered the Blush brush, Setting Brush and eye set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these now before word gets out and the price skyrockets-they are fantastic!</li>
    <li> love these brushes have ordered many times all sizes and types, especially love the buffer for mineral foundation powder in this set.  prefer over my mac and bobby brown brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft, none of the bristles have come out, I really like these brushes,I don&#x27;t really care for the case though, I guess its good for traveling.</li>
    <li> Nice doesn&#x27;t leave bristles behind</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes for an affordable price.  I owned other high-end brushes but I like the quality of these brushes better.  They spread the foundation evenly and make your skin look flawless.  Love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> This real Techniques Core Collection Set is awesome. I adore all their brushes and this is one of my favorites! My favorite is the buffing brush - flawless makeup application and the pointed foundation brush which I use to apply my under eye concealer. Yes real techniques!</li>
    <li> help Colleagues buy it , she say no bad.oh,my poor english</li>
    <li> I got them and this set is wonderful. Great quality and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This set comes with a contouring, foundation, precision, and buffing brush. I personally like the contour and buffing brushes the best. They&#x27;re soft and get the job done. The foundation brush and precision brush are just okay for me, especially the foundation brush. It&#x27;s a little small and the material feels a little plasticky, like the eco-tools brushes (the ecotools brushes and these brushes are made from the same company and material I think). However, I still think this set is worth it, especially if you&#x27;re a beginner at makeup. I still find use for the foundation/precision brush, and the other two are great. With this price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of makeup and this was the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve purchased aside from a few random eye brushes. I read great reviews and thought these would be great for a beginner like me. Having little to compare them to, I&#x27;m not sure how useful this review is but I must say I love them! I first used the pointed foundation brush to apply my liquid foundation. It freaked me out initially because it left all kinds of makeup lines all over my face. I immediately had buyer&#x27;s remorse. But then I applied my pressed powder with the buffing brush and it took care of all the lines and left me with a flawless look! I absolutely love these brushes and would recommend them to my friends! I also appreciate that there is a website for tutorials on how to use them!</li>
    <li> I have purchased similar brushs that were alot more expensive and these are just as good of quality . I will be purchasing more from this brand .</li>
    <li> I like these brushes, but I still prefer sigma... They are soft, but they don&#x27;t apply product as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of makeup brush ,Already have a set of brush .It is great .If you still hesitate, don&#x27;t consider to take it home.</li>
    <li> I like it so much soft hair strong brush and no harm if you wash it with shampo</li>
    <li> I have the other two sets of real techniques brushes and I liked them so much I also bought this one. They are soft and easy to clean. I have not had any problems with shedding. I didn&#x27;t think I would use the foundation brush because I already had one from the travel essentials set, however the foundation brush that comes in this set is good for applying foundation,and concealer under the eyes. The detailer brush in this set is also a good lip brush.</li>
    <li> I really only use the buffing brush. The other brushes I can&#x27;t figure out what to use for, so I don&#x27;t touch them (new to makeup). The buffing brush is great for blending liquid foundation and setting powder after it&#x27;s been applied. It helps everything set quicker. I love it, love it , love it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this set. However, on my second use, the big brush started shedding and by the third use it started loosing its shape. Yes, the material is soft and the brushes are nice, but they are of poor quality. They are good for the price, but don&#x27;t expect quality here.</li>
    <li> Love these! Best brushes ever and great price</li>
    <li> These brushes are the bomb.</li>
    <li> I own these brushes and love them. A colleague that I have adopted into my family, is new to makeup. She&#x27;s just getting her routine in order and needs brushes. I ordered this for her. She&#x27;s only using foundation samples and a kit she got from Sephora. These are $11+ with Prime ($17.99 in store) so I grabbed them for her for xmas. She will have them for a long time and I know she will enjoy them.</li>
    <li> A must buy for make up fans. Flat brush is the best I used for foundation application. Round brush I use for contour. Best buy very high quality.</li>
    <li> I love all of the real Techniques brushes. They are very soft and do no irritate my sensitive skin. They apply make-up perfectly! I highly recommend this brand for brushes.</li>
    <li> the brush is soft! It looks beautiful! Apply great application! I love real techniques brushes&lt;br /&gt;Brush beautiful and wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I like the brushes, I&#x27;ve only used them a couple of times but they seem to be good quality. I was excited that they came with a case, but it is hard to get the brushes in and out of.</li>
    <li> AMAZING BRUSHES!!! I love these brushes! If you are thinking about purchasing them get two pairs awesome x 100!</li>
    <li> The brushes came in a day before and I was really excited, they brushes were great but the bronze handles were scratched which made the brushes unattractive, i was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am very pleased with these brushes. Good quality, easy to use, convenient styles, serves the purpose they were intended for.</li>
    <li> This set includes 4 brushes, all made with soft Taklon bristles.  The brushes are sturdy and wash well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Buffing Brush:  I love this brush for BB cream and Tinted Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;- Foundation Brush:  This flat foundation brush is tiny.  I don&#x27;t use it for foundation.  I sometimes use this for concealer, although I prefer the flat brush in the travel set for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;- Detailer Brush: Nice little brush if you have extra time.  I use it to apply stick concealer to cover blemishes and to add extra concealer to the small spaces around my nose.  This is great for detail work.  However, I don&#x27;t use it that much since I usually apply stick concealer directly to my face.&lt;br /&gt;- Contouring brush:  This can be used for highlighter. It&#x27;s nice but not something I use every day.  It&#x27;s too small for bronzer and I don&#x27;t always use highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;- Case:  The case is too small for travel or for at home use.  I use far too many brushes for this case and they simply won&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4.5 stars?  Not every brush is an every day brush and the case is useless.  I wish you could buy the Buffing Brush separately as that is hands down the most useful brush in the set.  However, since I also frequently use the Contouring brush, I think the set is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It is now September 2015, so I&#x27;ve had this set for 2 years.  I use 2 of the 4 brushes in this kit.  I haven&#x27;t used the detailer brush in at least a year.  Same with the foundation brush.  The buffing brush is still good for tinted moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t use it much, but I do use it and like it.  The star of this set is actually the contour brush!  I use that brush virtually every day to blend in concealer.  It really is perfect for that purpose!  I wish I used more of the brushes, but for the price 2 out of 4 isn&#x27;t that bad!</li>
    <li> I really do like these brushes. They&#x27;re the basic essential brushes that every gal needs. I just wouldn&#x27;t use any liquid for the largest brush, and i use the liquid foundation brush as a concealer brush. Also ended up using the smallest concealer brush for adding color to my water line or under it. The stand is really useful as well.</li>
    <li> After seeing many YouTube beauty gurus talk about these brushes I had high expectations and am sadly disappointed by how rough they feel. The foundation brush leaves streaks and I end up using my fingers.</li>
    <li> I love the contour brush for precise application of cream blusher.  It blends perfectly.  The buffing brush is great with Chanel Bronze Universal cream bronzer.  I actually like the larger size for blending across my jaw line and down my neck. These 2 are worth the price of the kit.  The holder is a waste of materials and time.  The other 2 brushes are okay but not essential.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and apply make up well.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush- is very small, too small to use for foundation. Instead I use it to apply under eye concealer.&lt;br /&gt;Detailer brush- perfect for spot concealing and to clean around your eyebrows and lips&lt;br /&gt;Buffing brush- smaller than regular buffing brushes but can also be used for blush or contouring&lt;br /&gt;Contouring brush- perfect for sharp contouring and can also be used to set under eye concealer with powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brushes are good. The are very versatile and can be used for manny different purposes, the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it comes with a foundation brush that&#x27;s unusable for foundation.</li>
    <li> For the price of these brushes they exceed all of my expectations they are great quality and the pectin and the performance of these brushes are superb these are definitely a must buy if you want to start your makeup collection and maybe even kit as an makeup artist i use these on clients and my clients love them especially how soft they feel on the skin</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes&lt;br /&gt;very good quality indeed excellent quality and great great prices.. I tried them for 3 mothes now I liked them&lt;br /&gt;when I got them I washed them immediatly I didn&#x27;t see any sheding easy to wash and dry .. super soft and came in variaty of sizes and types to cover every function&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;the handels are little bit heavier than regular wooden handles but it didn&#x27;t affect the performance of the brushes&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that may annoy you is the storage of these brushes since the handels are flat at the end so if you are storing you brushes like sephora it won&#x27;t work with these brushes you need to get them alone in an empty contaner or brush holder</li>
    <li> My most used set of the real techniques brushes. Such a good price and quality. These don&#x27;t shed and are great for sensitive skin like mine. Real hair brushes often break me out in skin rash so I love that these are synthetic. I recommend these ten time over!!</li>
    <li> I must say that I just love love love my brushed from Teal Techniques. I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm and aaahhh when I use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favorite Brush: the buffer brush. I use it for my liquid foundation and it gives me the smoothest almost paint brushed look. The other brushes are just awesome for contouring, highlighting and concealing spots, bags under the eyes and discolourations.  Thumbs up and highly recommendable.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes to apply your make-up, soft on your skin and awesome grip, convertible case makes it great for maintenance and storage.  Definetly a must have!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the powder brush add on because I thought I would need it. Wrong! For face makeup this is all you need. It doesn&#x27;t come with eye brushes but you can get those seperately. This set was AWESOME</li>
    <li> Not sure how I went so long without these! They are amazing. The buffer brush is perfect for putting on foundation. LOVE THESE!!</li>
    <li> My go to brushes. Does a better job than some of the high end ones like Mac and sigma. Spend your money on this. You will not regret it</li>
    <li> All the brushes have held up great after months of use! Highly recommend -- especially if you are just starting a brush collection!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  A make up artist told me about the brand and how well they work. For the price you cannot beat it!</li>
    <li> Cant believe I waited so long to get this set! Glad I finally gave in cause it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes often, I really like them. My only complaint is that the liquid foundation brush is a little small, and I use the concealer brush for my eyes, but I also have a full coverage foundation that I find I never use concealer with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all they are fabulous.</li>
    <li> The brushes are perfectly sized for my face. I like it that the handles are aluminum and not wooded. I&#x27;ve never used mac brushes but they blow all the other brushes I&#x27;ve tried out of the water.</li>
    <li> Loved it. What I&#x27;ve been looking for at a great price. Thanks for a great product. Will return for more.</li>
    <li> It is a really good brush&lt;br /&gt;It hold the product very will&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s super soft and easy to hold</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. They are actually better than my wife&#x27;s Mac brushes and didn&#x27;t cost any where near the cost of Mac.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived when expected. No complaints at all. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes and the price is great.  The case is simple to use and works really well for travel.</li>
    <li> My wife loved them perfect !!</li>
    <li> Amazing, i have done alot of reserach to find affordable brushes with great quality and i always stumbled upon these real technique brushes. They are so sooo soft and work so well. In love with them</li>
    <li> Better than I expected....I&#x27;m a critic what can I say</li>
    <li> These brushes are great they hold foundation they apply very well I will be ordering real techniques again thank you</li>
    <li> I purchase this set mainly for the Buffing Face Brush.  It is my favorite mineral foundation brush!  It allows me to apply my minerals flawlessly.  The brush is the perfect size and is incredibly soft as with all of the RT brushes.  I am able to wash them without a single shed.  Very high quality for such a small price.</li>
    <li> We belive its not original Real Techniques</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing these. You honestly get a great product for a small price. If you buy these you will be happy.</li>
    <li> I was excited to order these brushes after many reviewers raved about them but they are just any other make up brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special about them. Yes they are soft but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! The buffer brush is by far my favorite, but the contouring brush does wonders as well. The angled foundation brush was alright, but i wouldn&#x27;t boast too highly about it. The detail brush, i loved, as i used it to shape my lips, and to apply eyeshadow under my eye. I would recommend buying these brushes to anyone. I always have a foundation brush my real techniques, and im starting a real techniques collection. They arent that expensive compared to other brushes, yet they&#x27;re worth every penny! Whether you&#x27;re just starting out with makeup, or a brush collection, or you are experienced, i recommend purchasing these. They are extremely soft!</li>
    <li> I wass not familiar with this product, but had seen it used in tutorials on YouTube so i decided to order some. These brushes are great quality and are extremely useful for multiple types of makeup.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup girl. I love it to the day I die. I bought these brushes because I frequently watch youtube.com makeup tutorials and many of the folks use this. Especially with a great review by pixiwoo girls from Europe. I bought them with high hopes and was not disappointed! They pick up product and make it glide effortlessly. I have had these brushes for over a year and they have not shed. They are easy to clean and store.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to purchase the rest of their makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes work so well, I got them for a really great deal on here, and it was over all an amazing buy!!!! I love, love, love the set and highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use the contour and blush brushes a lot. I personally don&#x27;t like to use foundation brush and the lip brush you have to keep cleaning if you wanna use it with different colors. I would change some of the products, but other than that, great brushes.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. I like the variety in one set, and the stand is also a great idea. I have traveled with them, and have also used them at home. They are perfect for both. I have been able to add a few more brushes to the case, and it is just perfect for my beauty regime. I like to use a different brush for each step in my make up routine... this set made it affordable and possible.</li>
    <li> I really wanted try this brushes because I watched so many youtube... but.. it&#x27;s just regular brushes... it&#x27;s okey but not fantastic.</li>
    <li> Good. It could be better. i guess that was for someone else that i had to buy this. well it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> In love with the brushes but just a little smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Again, happy wife ... Happy life!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and great quality brushes! highly recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few months now and glad to say the brushes are still intact and the hairs does not fall. Very good product!</li>
    <li> The foundation brush hurts my face (?!) but the powder brushes are fantastic.  One day I&#x27;ll be able to afford a Charlotte Tilbury painter&#x27;s brush - until then I use this.  The handles also feel good.</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply amazing. I recommend them to anyone and rate them 5 out of 5 stars!! I am in love with them and I&#x27;m sure others are to!</li>
    <li> I love this set. And the package it came in with the case.  Use them daily!! Awsome.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Real Techniques are possibly the best makeup brushes i have ever used, they make application of makeup simple, easy and soft on the skin.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes everyday! No bristle has fallen out once and I&#x27;ve had it for seven months!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves these brushes.  She&#x27;s fussy!</li>
    <li> Professional grade brushes for a fraction the price!</li>
    <li> Great brushes and a nice set of basics.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of brushes and they seem to be good quality.  I was not sure if these would hold up or work well but I am very happy with them.  The are of a much better quality than I had expected for the price thqat I paid.  I have no regrets about these.  I had expected shedding but have not experienced that at all.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEE, best brushes I own!!</li>
    <li> My wife liked, however, was my daughter get to play, it seems that everyone likes this product.</li>
    <li> Best brushes I have ever bought and many popular makup youtubers use these. great quality and price.  Buffer brush is my fav.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. The brush looks super expensive and the bristles are super soft. This was a great buy. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. I would also gift these brushes. That&#x27;s how nice they look and feel.</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY FOR A LOW PRICE, WASHES EASILY AND DRIES PRETTY QUICKLY. I WASHED MY BRUSHES USING MY BEAUTY BLENDER SOAP BAR AND IT AS GOOD AS NEW. THE FOUNDATION BRUSH IS WAY TOO SMALL TO BE CONSIDERED A FOUNDATION BRUSHED, I USED IT TO HIGHLIGHT. I USUALLY USE SIGMA BRUSHES AND MAC BUT THESE WORK AS GOOD SO I WILL PURCHASE THESE AGAIN AND NOT THE EXPENSIVE ONES ANYMORE. IM NOT GIVING UP MY BEAUTY BLENDER THOUGH LOL</li>
    <li> Love it, total high quality product, what you see is what you get, no shedding, was delivered in a timely manner. Totally satisfied with my purchase. Good price.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes a lot since I&#x27;ve received them and they have not shed one hair yet. The brush heads don&#x27;t have a strange odor unlike my other natural hair Sigma brushes. I think this has something to do with Real Techniques using synthetic hair instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend these brushes. They&#x27;re affordable and great quality! Especially the stippling and buffing brush. I plan to expand my collection. Also, if you get any of the traveling sets, you can use the holder to dry your brushes. Be sure to have your brush hairs pointing downward. Genius design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** It has been one year since I purchased this set. Still in same form as day 1 condition despite my inclination to deep clean each brush after each use. Well worth the investment. I saw that another reviewer preferred EcoTools over Real Techniques. I would have to differ in opinion. I have purchased an EcoTools travel set &amp; bronzing brush about a year ago as well -- the durability is not the same. The metal cuff binding the hair to the bamboo shafts came off on multiple brushes; I have not purchased any EcoTool product since.</li>
    <li> I got this brush set and I did expect a bit more. The Pixiwoo sisters seem to use them more efficiently for some reason. I am learning to work with these a bit better and I am liking them more each time. The buffing brush is good for liquid foundation but I prefer the stippling one because its dense but not too dense like the buffing. I like the contouring brush as well, its a good standard size for most people. The foundation flat brush is too small so you can use it for concealer. The small detailer brush I think can be used for gel liners or lining eyes with eyeshadow. Overall I would give this a 3.5 out of 5. I must say that the Blush Brush which does not come with this set is great for overall powder and not blush. This is because its not too dense as you would like it to be. But I still recommend purchasing it with this collection. The Real Techniques foundation and face brushes do not shed which is a great aspect that you should consider. The quality is very good. Synthetic brushes usually do not pick up much color though as well as natural hair bristles. But once you get used to it, it should be fine. I would recommend watching YouTube videos to make sure that you know what these are like to have.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone. She was just starting out with make up so I thought this would be the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I love this collection but only because of the buffing brush. You cannot buy this brush individually and honestly for what you pay for this collection it is worth it. I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for the contouring brush or the foundation brush. I don&#x27;t even know how they call that brush a foundation brush. It would take you for ever to cover your face with that and the coverage would be terrible. I still have not found a good use for that one. The contour brush can definitely be used as a blush brush. The small detail brush (I think it might be a concealer brush) is too small for concealer but I find that it is good for eyeshadow detail (highlighting the inner corner or the outer v). The buffing brush is the star of this collection. It is great at buffing in liquid foundation and I have also used it for powder foundation.</li>
    <li> Quality of the brushes seems great. The bristles are soft and thick. I have not washed them yet, so I cannot attest to how well they hold up. The only minor problem I have is getting the brushes back into the holder after use. It feels like I have to wrestle them back into the little elastic holders. But they are secure in the holder so I shouldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This is a really great set. I love, love, love the buffing an contouring brushes the best. With liquid foundation, the buffing brush softly and evenly applies your makeup. I am also really into contouring now. With bronzer I use the contouring brush under my cheekbones to give my face shape and this brush really gets the job done. Great price for great brushes.</li>
    <li> Really nice and affordable brush set with quality bristles. The handles are great.  This set is best for foundation/face makeup as opposed to eye makeup.  Haven&#x27;t tried washing them yet so don&#x27;t know how they hold up.  The carrying case is well made.  Wish it could hold a few more brushes, though.</li>
    <li> brushes are so soft!!! and the buffer brush does an amazing job at blending.  best brushes ive purchased so far!</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes that are perfect distribute foundation and other cosmetic products (powder, blush). They can be good to work out not only the forehead, cheeks, but not very comfortable areas, such as around the nostrils. These brushes are very easy to clean by any means for cleaning brushes.</li>
    <li> All soft and great quality. Good value for the price. The case is nice for traveling or storage. I use these brushes daily and clean them often. They&#x27;re still in great condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of these brushes!  They work really well for all kinds of makeup application</li>
    <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft. I already have the eyeshadow brushes and the expert face brush. These brushes are great quality. Haven&#x27;t used them yet though. All in all, I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes a lot, they are super soft and the perfect size. The case the brushes come in is also really useful. They are great quality for the price as well!</li>
    <li> Personally, I hate the case that it comes in.  There are elastics around the brushes to keep them in place but those elastics are so tight and difficult to put the brush back.  The brushes themselves are fine though</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to store.</li>
    <li> Hard on my skin not good for blending foundation</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! :)&lt;br /&gt;They are really soft and put on makeup really smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the purple brushes, and those are my absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes, super soft, no shedding, easy to clean. These are an essential in every make up brush collection from beginner to professional.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Brushes feel professional without the higher price tag.</li>
    <li> Great price for these brushes, very high quality.</li>
    <li> This is my second core collection set I have purchased. I love every one of these brushes, but my most used has to be the buffing brush, its amazing</li>
    <li> Brush like Matoukat very excellent quality originals and strongly advise them and buys from you again for you excellent seller and very comfortable dealing with you</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace my cheap e.l.f. and forever 21 brushes and I love them. the stand/case works good and like it says it does but I have zero counter space so I don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, although just a bit stingy in size.  Appear to be well made and look as though they will hold up well with use.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Super soft bristles. Easy to use, easy to clean, great even application of product. Love, Love, Love, these!</li>
    <li> These are suchhhhh good brushes for an amazing price. I&#x27;m truly stunned. Will be purchasing more real Techniques brushes in the future. They&#x27;re also really lovely on your bathroom counter with the stand they come with!</li>
    <li> these brushes are a little better than the eye but nothing extraordinary can find better for this price the brushes had returned but could not do my job</li>
    <li> great products, super quality</li>
    <li> absolutely my expectations on point i love it so much i look forward to all the brushes i plan to purchase</li>
    <li> hi,i just got my brushes today,i used it,and i love it.i am gonna get more.thank you amazon and ladies who wrote the reviews, otherwise i would never try it. thank you.i am gonna get brush holder and i am gonna get more brushes</li>
    <li> Both Ecotools and Real Techniques come from the same company - Paris Presents Incorporated, and both use soft, synthetic hair (a good thing - no cruelty involved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be completely honest, it seems that the differences are in the design, colors and price. Ecotools has a very simple/basic design, while Real Techniques looks much fancier (especially its brushes&#x27; handles). I would buy Real Techniques as a present - it looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, I actually find Ecotools to be of about the same quality and softness - or even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the other difference is the price (in most cases, you can find Ecotools brushes for about half price of the Real Techniques ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my brushes regularly - the Ecotools ones have remained the same, however the Real Techniques&#x27; handles have deteorated. The black parts of the handles became somehow wrinkly (the golden part stayed intact). Expected them to be more durable due as they are more expensive than Ecotools.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  They are made by the same company that makes Ecotools.  I prefer Ecotools.  But these are pretty good brushes.  I wish that the font on the side was engraved so that the letters don&#x27;t rub off.  It&#x27;s a minor detail, but I am a bit OCD and that stuff annoys me.  Overall these are great brushes and Sam&#x27;s videos on Real Techniques as well as on the Pixiwoo channel will help you understand how to use them.  I think it&#x27;s great for people who are just getting into make-up as well as those who are experienced.  The bristles are very very soft on the skin and durable.</li>
    <li> I love Sam&#x27;s tutorials online and also found these brushes to be amazing. They don&#x27;t break down under constant washing or sanitizing! They feel amazing on your skin and they do exactly what they are supposed to do. I use these brushes for my face and another set from a different makeup artist on clients. I love them.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product....$17 for these brushes was amazing and their great quality, the brushes doesn&#x27;t shed....but they are quite small but a great set for beginners</li>
    <li> Luvvvvvvv these brushes, I have stopped using my sigma brushes !!!! iherb has them for $12.99 when you use the coupon code below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  $5.00 off your first purchase (No Minimum)&lt;br /&gt;  OR&lt;br /&gt;  $10.00 off your first purchase when you spend $40.00 or more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  USE CODE: JFD670</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine not having these in my makeup drawer!  I&#x27;m so glad I got these as well as the rest of the collection!</li>
    <li> Good deal. This brand was very recommended for your quality and price. There are lots of kits to get together</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Just as good as MAC brushes!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality and arrived very quickly!!</li>
    <li> For the price this brushes are fantastic, I have high end brushes but wanted an extra small travel set. this one is great, soft on my skin and does a good job applying the products.</li>
    <li> FELT IT WAS WAS TIME TO INVEST IN SOME NEW BRUSHES SO I BOUGHT THESE AND THEY ARE GREAT. THE OTHERS ARE GOING BYE BYE OR WILL BE WASHED WITH LIGHT SHAMPOO AND PLACED ON A TOWEL TO AIR DRY. THE COLORS BUILD UP AFTER A WHILE AND YOU NEED TO CLEAN THE BRUSHES OR GET RID OF THEM TO BE COMPLETELY SANITARY.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes! The bristles are soft and give a really smooth application of foundation and concealer. They do not shed and have a quality look.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite brushes! They don&#x27;t shed! They don&#x27;t waste your product and they blend out your makeup perfectly</li>
    <li> The most like Blusher Brush</li>
    <li> So soft and so pretty! Love how it applies my makeup and makes my skin look flawless. Ive never had a contouring brush, but this one makes it so easy to do just that. Havent had a problem with shedding either.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THEM FOR OVER 3 MONTHS NOW AND NOT A SINGLE HAIR HAS FALLEN OFF.  THEYRE NOT SREAKY AND PROVIDE AMAZING COVERAGE.,  AFTER A CLEANING, THE BRISTLES REMAINED AS NEW.</li>
    <li> These are such good brushes haven&#x27;t had no problems with them yet I&#x27;ve only washed them once and they seem ok i love them!</li>
    <li> So I purchased this set of brushes, they&#x27;re my first brushes ever and I have to say I&#x27;m really impressed. For such a low price these brushes do an amazing job of applying makeup. My only problem with the set is that the foundation brush is honestly quite small. If it was a bit wider in diameter that&#x27;d be so much better.</li>
    <li> These were recommended and I was a little skeptical because of the reasonable price. I am delighted with them. I&#x27;m replacing all my brushes withReal Techniques as I need new ones.</li>
    <li> This set is so affordable and works so well. Watch their youtube videos for makeup tutorials so you can get the best  coverage using brushes. Great product for great price!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and use these for all liquid and cream products, I prefer a buffing brush to give foundation a more natural look than flat brushes. Only con is they absorb a lot of product and take longer to clean.</li>
    <li> In fact, it is a real techniques Brush and made from good material and adorable with silky touch, a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a very good set in both quality and price. The contour brush is amazing. It fits right in the hollow of your cheeks, and the softness to stiffness ratio is great for a achieving an even blend (no 80&#x27;s make up look here). The multitask brush is also great for both foundation and blush. The foundation brush included here I don&#x27;t really have much use for. I find that these types of foundation brushes don&#x27;t give the best application. I also don&#x27;t really have a use for the concealer brush. I can see myself maybe using it when I want to use a liquid base for my contour, as they do provide a precise application for that. Then you can blend it out with the contour brush because these are too stiff.</li>
    <li> i love all the realtechniques brush range, whenever im looking around on the high street they are so expensive !! excellent price excellent quality !!</li>
    <li> These set of brushes is great for beginners and for other makeup artist out there. It is cheap and affordable and great quality. I&#x27;ll review each brush on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first brush I will review is the buff brush (it might not be called that but it is the brush on the far right in the picture). It is very similar to a dense flat top kabuki brush and I use this more for my foundation for a more natural feel/affect. I find this brush is amazing for all the different foundations out there. The dense brush helps the foundation buff into the skin better making the foundation blend better and look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer brush is smaller than normal concealer brushes that are offered at sephora and other brands. However, I live the size because the amount of control it gives making it easier to get into the creases or spot treating a certain area. I think it does the best to make it easier to blend and mix the right shade in a concealer palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush is not my most favorite because like I said I use the the buffing brush more for foundation purposes. This brush is still great because the tip makes it easy to blend near your eye and making sure you are able to get the foundation is the smallest spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last is the dome shape brush. This brush I usually use for powder, bronzer, and blush. The angle that the dome brush gives makes it easier to slip under the hollows of your cheek to help contour your cheekbones which makes it a good brush to use your bronzer. The size of the brush helps you to not make your application like you are striping color onto your face and makes it easier to blend. I guess if you want to make application quicker I guess you can use a powder brush but I think that this brush can do that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes did not shed when I cleaned them and I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time. If you take even better car I am sure that they will last even longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my ownpersonal thoughts I am not a makeup artist or makeup expert, this is my experience when handling these brushes.</li>
    <li> This brushes are excellent.  The buffing brush is amazing for liquid and power foundation.  This kit is amazing, it beats some of my more expensive brushes.  Definitely a must.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes!! I had the Real Techniques Stippling Brush and I loved the way it blended in my makeup so I decided to give these brushes a try and they are awesome! They feel great and help to apply my makeup so well!</li>
    <li> Nice set! Plan to buy more brushes from Real Techniques. Easy to wash, dry fast. Now I can use some make-up products that seemed to be not very good before</li>
    <li> Obsessed with these brushes! They work beautifully and the carrying case is a fantastic bonus that will make travel so much easier.</li>
    <li> These are really nice brushes but I would have liked larger ones.  They are a nice size for traveling or your purse.</li>
    <li> Great brush set.  Includes the most important brushes to have in your collection.  Soft yet very durable for makeup application.</li>
    <li> In all honesty I haven&#x27;t had time to use this product much with my makeup, but overall I would say that it&#x27;s a great product :)</li>
    <li> Pretty nice brushes - but there really isn&#x27;t an eyeshadow brush.  I basically only use the large brush for powder/blush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned makeup brushes from many other companies. High-end to low end, and i must say i was pleasantly surprised when i used this for the first time. I was rushing out of the house and wanted to set some finishing powder on my concealer, and so i used the largest brush, and the words out of my mouth were literally &amp;#34;woah&amp;#34;. These brushes are so soft, they pick up the contents of my powder/bronzer/etc wonderfully, and are very sturdy and firm. I love each brush in this set, and the holder just adds extra points for me, and i am going to love just being able to throw this in my bag on my next trip. I will definitely be ordering more brushes from real teechniques again.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about these brushes before I spent a fortune on much more expensive brushes.  I have so many others from MAC, Sephora, etc.  Had I known about Real Techniques, I could have saved hundreds of dollars.  These are easily just as good as the high end ones.  Thank goodness for Tanya Burr&#x27;s makeup tutorials, otherwise I would never have found out about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re super-soft and seem to hold up really well.  The foundation brushes really do give an airbrushed effect.  I&#x27;m getting married in 3 months and am SO happy I found these before the wedding!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many make up brushes from high end to more economical. This brand  is by far my favorite. Application is perfect, not scratchy and very reasonably priced! The stand/case is handy</li>
    <li> Product is amazing glad I finally got to try them the only disappointment is that I paid sooo much more for them then what I could have paid at Ulta!!:0(</li>
    <li> A very nice collection set of brushes, so soft and so easy on the skin. Very good quality brushes, I&#x27;m please that I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I just got mines today. They are really nice and sleek looking. The bristles themselves are soft BUT they shorter so you have a really good stroke, you can really rub your makeup in which i like.</li>
    <li> Super soft but substantial.  Brushes hold a lot of product and are a very nice quality.  Minimal to zero shedding when washed.</li>
    <li> Love all of it !&lt;br /&gt;contour brush is my favourite. I like to use the powder foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;Wet the powder brush and use it for liquide foundation brush, it will give you the most glowing skin ever.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> They are amazing brushes but I had A LOT of fall out. Every time I use these, they shed, and it&#x27;s just really disappointing because I had heard so many great things and no one had this much fall out.</li>
    <li> I would generally expect to pay at least $130 for a brush set like this, so it&#x27;s definitely a fantastic value!  Each brush has at least 3 purposes and they are soft, dense and well weighted. I love how easy they are to clean. Great for all mediums. I recommend this brush set most highly, no matter your skill level.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these brushes.  I have had them for months and have not seen shedding yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use them heavily though and I do clean them often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one pet peeve: the case.  I never bother to use it as a stand (as it&#x27;s shown on the picture) and it only adds bulk when I travel.  I&#x27;d prefer something slimmer.</li>
    <li> I wear makeup everyday, and these brushes have been my go to set for about 3 years now. Every since i have purchased them, I&#x27;ve faithfully washed them everyday after use, and they have kept their shape and texture.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good set of brushes that aren&#x27;t going to cost me an arm and a leg. After plenty of research I settled on these beauties and I&#x27;m glad I did. The bristles are super soft yet firm enough. They pick up an incredible amount of makeup and apply it flawlessly. They are very versatile as well. I like the synthetic brushes better because A. they are animal friendly and B. my face doesn&#x27;t get itchy after using them. I have a couple of brushes from bare minerals and I&#x27;m not exactly sure what type of hair is on them but every time I use them, my face stings and is itchy. I don&#x27;t have that problem with these brushes. If you are looking for good quality brushes I would definitely recommend these. I also picked up the eye kit as well.</li>
    <li> The buffing brush and contour brush are amazing brushes. The other two aren&#x27;t all that, but it&#x27;s worth getting the set for these two brushes alone. High Recommend</li>
    <li> Im not gonna lie, I have allot of brushes and from different brands. But Real techniques brushes are something to talk about lol. There sooooooo soft and durable its rediculous! I have the whole line, except the angled foundation brush! And thats only because I have so many from other brands. I will definitely recommend these brushes to all Makeup lovers! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They work very well and are so reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good quality and the bristles are soft and dense.</li>
    <li> I love everything about real Techniques brushes. I own basically every single brush they sell.  They&#x27;re very sturdy and the synthetic bristles work great with powders or creams.  They wash up very nicely and don&#x27;t shed at all. High quality brushes for a very reasonable price. I threw out all my old brushes and replaced them all with this brand. I just love them all.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> I have brushes by MAC, Bobbi Brown, Bare Minerals, Sonia Kashuk, etc.  I tried these brushes as a budget buy and was very pleased.  They are great for application and blending and wash like new.  These are better than some of my higher end brushes.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes love them but had to wait a while to get the brushes even though they were placed with another order i got the rest of my order but had to wait an extra week just to get my brushes.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these brushes , I&#x27;ve been using them for a month now and they&#x27;re amazingly good for powder/liquid foundation or even contouring .. I cleaned them using the baby shampoo and they turned back as if they were new again . Highly recommend for such  good price as well.</li>
    <li> I do not buy any other brushes.  These are top quality and an awesome price.  they blend perfect and clean super easy. What else could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes for a really amazing price.</li>
    <li> Okay, for the price I payed.</li>
    <li> I love that these brushes are good quality and look and feel expensive - even though they are not! Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use the case, but it&#x27;s a nice bonus. I am so excited about these brushes!</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes my foundation glides on I use the concealer brush for my brows the contour brush is perfect for the apples of my cheeks great set will be repurchasing for my kit</li>
    <li> your basic brushes in the one collection, so good!</li>
    <li> I was looking for quality brushes at an affordable price and viola! I found just what I was searching for in these bad boys. The bristles are soft on your face but not flimsy. Holds and applies make up well and evenly, easy and comfortable to hold too! The case is a plus for easy and clean travel, that way your brushes aren&#x27;t touching everything in your makeup bag. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought them for my daughter. She loves them. Shipping was fast and I&#x27;m sure she will get a lot of use out of them.</li>
    <li> very good ,the custom love it</li>
    <li> These are my daughters favorite brand to use, they are well made and last along time if taken Care of. It was a good deal too</li>
    <li> Of course these brushes are amazing! They are widely used by all the gurus on YT. The two bigger ones are definitely my favorites because I haven&#x27;t really found much use for the other smaller ones. So I have had these for well over a year and they are in great condition. I use them every time I do my makeup. Whether it&#x27;s for stage or everyday, Sam and Nic provided us with great quality brushes for sure!</li>
    <li> Omgggg can&#x27;t convey in words how much i love these brushes! They blend liquid foundation like a pro!</li>
    <li> My wife loves these brushes, that is all that needs to be said.</li>
    <li> My daughter raves about these brushes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping amazing feel on these brushes</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes, but I don&#x27;t like the case.  When you use a brush, it is hard to get it back into the little elastic holder.  I do like the brushes, they seem to be quality material.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of brushes for flawless application.  The buffing brush is by far my favorite in the kit.  You can use it to apply and buff in foundation, apply face powder, blush, bronzer and contour.  It&#x27;s just so versatile!  The contour brush is a little more pointed and tapered and works nicely to set concealer, highlight and contour.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of flat foundation brushes but that&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference.  The brush head on the pointed foundation brush is quite a bit smaller than most other brushes of its kind but it does the job.  It&#x27;s a nice brush to use for spot concealing especially larger areas as well.  The tapered tip helps blend product to make it look more natural.  There&#x27;s also a really small brush in this kit, the detailer brush, which is useful to conceal small areas or to highlight under brows and the inner corners of the eyes.  The detailer brush can also be used to line the lash line as well as work as a lip brush.  The kit also comes in a handy brush case that folds back to form a brush stand with slots for additional brushes.  The brush hair on all brushes are very soft and comfortable on skin.    A detailed review and photos are available on my blog: [...]</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES SHED THE FIRST TIME USING THEM. I wish I had stuck to eco tools but they came on time atleast</li>
    <li> a little more cheaper than the normal price at stores but still good quality. im very happy with my new brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this set especially the buffing brush. they are super soft and easy to use and the travel package it comes with is a perfect fit for my busy lifestyle since I need to go on business trips a lot</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about a month and they are fine.  Nothing special.  They were a good deal. Wish the big brush was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Dense and easy to use, and wash. Great for putting on any kind of make up and making it look super natural.</li>
    <li> I bought this set mostly for the foundation brush. The foundation brush is my least favorite of the set, unfortunately. It&#x27;s just a little too small; my last foundation brush was bigger, and it applied the foundation faster. This new smaller brush takes longer. Not a bad brush though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the other brushes in the set quite useful, and the case is super handy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As real Techniques claims, the brushes don&#x27;t &#x27;hold on&#x27; to a ton of your product. This is nice. They are soft and high quality.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price</li>
    <li> got them on time, i love these brushes they are my favorite i can&#x27;t wait to have all of the real techniques collection.</li>
    <li> So awesome! I bought these because the Pixiwoos on youtube use them (I later found out that Sam Chapman is one half of Pixiwoo) they are such good brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty! Synthetic, cheap in price, the quality is good, super soft. Also, I have washed them twice so far and I have not seen any shedding. They are really nice because I got a set of animal hair brushes- I know...very bad but I got them as a gift and didn&#x27;t know- but with those brushes, they shed like CRAZY even before I washed them!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use the smallest brush... that&#x27;s all I got.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  While they are all synthetic so I can&#x27;t really compare them to my Bobbi Brown collection they are more than half the price and get the job done!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by several friends and it really is great. Brushes are nice and light and pick up make up very well..Price is great too!</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply perfect. They are incredibly well-made and apply makeup perfectly. I would have liked it even more if one of the brushes was a blending brush for eyeshadows, but I think that&#x27;s too much to ask. It&#x27;s a really really nice kit, and I cannot complain about anything. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say this is the best brush you can find on this price. I know the really expensive brushes are better than these, but I really do not want to pay that much money. This is the best balance you can find between the price and the quality.</li>
    <li> Great Brushes at an affordable price. Definitely comparable to Mac brushes. Would order these again and was very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> These brushes pack a nice punch and great bang for the buck. I am obessessed with makeup and recently discovered real Techniques brushes. I must say for the bargain and quality these real Techniques brushes are little hidden gems. I am currently using the buffing brush from this core collection set for a dewey finish or the stippling brush for a more airbrushed look for foundation application. You won&#x27;t go wrong. I like the deluxe creash brush from the starter set for concealer application. The brushes all offer great coverage. They also clean well without shedding. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very suprised on how well they actually work, i underestimated this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using the buffing brush was amazing my make up came out looking flawless.</li>
    <li> The only brand of brushes I will buy anymore. Everything else just ends up shedding on me or is too expensive. I &amp;#60;3 real techniques brushes. The buffing brush is great. I haven&#x27;t really used the foundation or concealer brush yet and the highlighter brush is a little bit on the small size for me but maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing lol</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m make up junkie and have way to many brushes. I stumble on these watching some tutorials and then read the reviews online. For the price I had nothing to loose. I was rather skeptical. After first make up application with these I&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- super easy fast application of my liquid foundation,&lt;br /&gt;- immediate airbrushed effect (I love my beauty blender but I love buffing brush more now!)&lt;br /&gt;- perfect for blending the contouring lines (I also have setting brush for highlighting),&lt;br /&gt;- less foundation is used than with fingers and sponges (better coverage and more natural look),&lt;br /&gt;- zero shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- as with every eco brush with synthetic hair it takes long time for them to dry (overnight), but I wipe them after every use and spray with antibacterial brush cleanser/spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use case (maybe will for traveling), just keep them in a brush holder cup, easier to reach (instead of using both hands to take them out and put them back in a robber slot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I look for mirror all the time because I love the way my skin looks! Love them and don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, they are very good quality, super soft and perfect size/weight. One more time- do not hesitate, one of the greatest buy for me!</li>
    <li> Makeup brushes are crazy expensive these days, so it&#x27;s not always easy to find a set that doesn&#x27;t break the bank. I purchased these for use with a liquid foundation, and the larger brush works perfectly for that. They are a great set. I also like that the storage container converts from a stand to a travel case by folding up in the back. Keeps the brushes clean and protected in my luggage.</li>
    <li> I had been eyeing real technique brushes for a while so i just bought them. I tried them and loved them! the next time i&#x27;m going to order some eye shadow brushes.</li>
    <li> I really liked these brushes. I use them every day. The starter set is really good too. I bought both :D</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes!! They are great quality and make all the difference in my make up routine. I had recently bought an expensive Mineral foundation that I have loved in the past and was not impressed with how it was going on my skin. I decided to by new brushes and am so glad I did. The buffing brush is worth the price of the whole set in my opinion! It helps get the the coverage I need from my mineral foundation with out looking cakey. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding at all. The contouring brush had become a favorite too. It gives you great control. I have used the foundation brush to conceal and blend under my eyes and the detailer brush for more controlled concealing. The case is a great bonus. I like that it will protect the brushes for travel and then opens up to a stand. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes. You will not be sorry for buying them!</li>
    <li> The large kabuki is great for both my BB cream and powder foundation. The contouring brush is a great shape. The two smaller brushes I don&#x27;t use often, but they are all well made, and I don&#x27;t see them wearing out anytime soon. I recommend this brush set!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite brush kit from RT, but still great quality like their other products.  I love the contour brush and the buffing brush, but I find the pointed foundation brush a little to small/ wimpy to use.  I don&#x27;t find myself using the detailer brush too much, but it certainly has its purpose. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Soft&lt;br /&gt;-Precise, detailed HD finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-None! lol. I just want more brushes from real techniques. These are my favorite brushes ever. My makeup looks so much better when applied with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this particular set to beginners. It&#x27;s a great starter set.</li>
    <li> Great brush set, at an amazing price, and comes with a good brush holder. As soon as I received these in the mail, I washed all the brushes, let them dry and proceeded to use them when I was going to a wedding and needed to put on lots of makeup. The brushes are amazing! I have not experienced any shedding at all with them. They work very well and are very soft on the face. They apply makeup very well and blend it in seamlessly. For such a great price, they are a steal and well worth even double the price. My favorite is the buffing brush which I prefer to use for liquid foundation because it buffs it in so well. The pointed foundation brush was the only one I didn&#x27;t like as much, but used as a concealer brush it is much more functional. The detailer brush was good for covering little blemishes, have not used it as a lip brush. The contour brush was great for my blush, and applied it very well. I was surprised that it was so good for blush. All the brushes can be used for other uses, they don&#x27;t have to be used exclusively for concealer, foundation, etc. Highly recommended set, especially if you just need basic brushes, or are just getting into makeup. At the price of less than 4 dollars a brush with a case, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> After getting one of this type, bought the set.  Seen at ULTA for more.</li>
    <li> All last one of these brushes were awesome!!! When it done with your make application your face will look flawless!!</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever!!!, they don&#x27;t come apart, but most of all they leave my complexion flawless</li>
    <li> Nice. Love these bruses</li>
    <li> as excepted , fast shipping , great item , high recommend :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft, high quality, and work very well. I love them. I&#x27;ve used them daily since they arrived. I&#x27;ve washed them many times, and I have not had any bristles falling out. They maintain their shape and softness. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE THESE BRUSHES! I have bought quite a few Real Techniques brushes lately, and they are running neck and neck with my Sigma, and other higher priced brushes. I can&#x27;t get enough of them. They are sturdy, easy to clean...and makeup goes on effortlessly! The little case is nice too, keeps them from getting smushed. When I travel, and I&#x27;m trying to avoid bringing EVERYTHING, I grab a couple of my RT collections&amp; have my face/eyes covered. I rec these brushes to anyone who loves makeup!</li>
    <li> I love these eye make up brushes, they are the best.</li>
    <li> Love these... great especially for a beginner!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!! This is a great deal and I definitely needed a starter set. I love the blending brush for my liquid foundation. I wasn&#x27;t sure about using it at first because I was so used to using my MAC foundation brush. But after watching some YouTube videos, I was convinced to try it. I am really glad I did because it&#x27;s amazing how well it works and it&#x27;s SO easy. It blends so much easier and quicker. I&#x27;m in love....</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of all things make-up and these brushes are a good set for beginners or pros in my opinion.  They are very decent quality and give a nice variety for a decent price.  I use at least one of these brushes every single day in my make-up routine.</li>
    <li> Absolute favorite makeup brushes! Such high quality and even better than some high end brushes that are way pricier!</li>
    <li> Loving the buffer brush! I mainly got this set because of it and I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to friends, family and anyone interested in a good basic brush set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing. The softness of the bristles are wonderful as well as the sturdiness of the ends of the brushes. The packaging is informative and the case included is very practically useable. 5 out of 5 easy rating! This core collection is a must have! Wish I could buy them all though!</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price. I&#x27;d purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes. I use them every day. I just LOVE them. I recommend all my friends to buy this set</li>
    <li> great quality and I was so impressed with them that I ordered again to get my daughter in law a set! she loves them too! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  I tried this brand after seeing it on a YouTube video.  They were well.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality and well designed. The travel wallet that they come in is handy&lt;br /&gt;As good if not better than more expensive brushes</li>
    <li> Ordered for a friend, came on time, nothing broken, everything looked great.</li>
    <li> I live for this set. I love Real Techniques. I had already bought the Starter Set and Travel Set and I just had to have this one too. Im so glad I bought it because it applies makeup like a dream. I use the buffing brush with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and it blends soooo well. The highlighter brush is perfect for powder highlight and the pointed foundation brush is just the right size for concealer (way too small for applying liquid foundation all over the face). I keep the detail brush in my purse for concealer touch ups. Would definitely recommend this set!</li>
    <li> They are just brilliant, so easy to use and cheap! This Core Collection set is also perfect for travelling :).</li>
    <li> For a starter set, this collection is ideal.  The case itself I do not use because I would be constantly taking them out.  But for travelling, the case is great for storage.  They hold their shape and softness even after cleaning.  I use a mild baby shampoo to clean mine.</li>
    <li> Love! Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I have purchased individual Real Technique brushes from Ulta and Kohl&#x27;s and have had them a bit longer and they have been washed a number of times with no issues.  This core collection I purchased from Amazon already has wording completely off of the contour brush and the other 3 partially coming off?  makes me wonder if these are really real techniques or fakes.</li>
    <li> Durable, pretty, and high quality makeup brush. Great for countouring, Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really love the brushes they are amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is great and the size is perfect&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good!</li>
    <li> Exact what I ordered, soft bristles, and very high quality!!</li>
    <li> i use this everyday, my favorite brushes! i have the eye makeup brushes and they work wonderfully as well.</li>
    <li> Great!!!!!!! I recomended. xc xc xcx c xc xc xc xc xc mmc x c x c x c xm</li>
    <li> Quality brushes, inexpensive, soft and no fall out. The concealer brush is really small I lost it the first week in my couch. Other than that really great brushes! I recommend this brand of brushes to everyone.</li>
    <li> All of these brushes for foundation, none of them for eye shadows.</li>
    <li> Such great quality brushes and so soft! I will order again!</li>
    <li> Brushes are great, they don&#x27;t shed, but some are very small in my opinion. I use the buffing brush and the contour brush the most, personally. The buffing brush is great for foundation, and the contour brush is tapered in a way that it&#x27;s easy to sweep a contour shade into the hollows of my cheekbones. The foundation brush is too small and thin for me to use, personally. The detailer brush is great for applying concealer to pimples and small areas (cleaning up lips or brows) or applying loose glitter on top of your eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I purchased these on Dec 11th 2014, and as of Jan 10th 2016 my buffing brush has started to shed a tiny bit. These held up an entire YEAR before they started shedding, and even then it was just a hair or two. These are a wonderful staple set to add to your collection!</li>
    <li> Every brush can be used to many more purposes, and the softness alone would make me buy this again to have them last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;They lose no hairs, they are soft to die for, they dry so much faster than other face brushes given they&#x27;re synthetic. No allergies, perfect handling, and so dense anything is put on the face with the intensity that is imagined.&lt;br /&gt;P-E-R-F-E-C-T</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best! I use the buffing brush for an everyday foundation brush. I love the flawless finish it gives. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Really soft and good quality brushes. My favorite is the contour brush its perfect for bronzer it blends it in really nicely.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I use the buffing brush and contour brush for my makeup every single day. Never had a issue with shedding and these are very soft. I&#x27;m in love with the brushes and the price! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this set and the real techniques starter set together to get a good set of brushes. Absolutely love them! Amazing value for the cost and very soft with no falling apart. Love Love LOVE them!</li>
    <li> When I tried using this, I first noticed its softness. Also, you don&#x27;t have to hold the brush firmly to get the shading or the shading style you want to make.</li>
    <li> i received a knock-off different color and the bristles hurt. I&#x27;m highly disappointed !! I do not recommend at all !</li>
    <li> These brushes will change your life if your into makeup. The buffing brush is my daily must for foundation application. They are good quality brushes! They are extremely soft and they dont shed one bit.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of brushes with protective case. They are very soft and dense.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cheap.And very effective.</li>
    <li> great quality. i love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Real Techniques brushes are the best!!! Great quality and even better prices!</li>
    <li> I am in school for esthetics and have been an aspiring MUA for years. I was first recommended to Real Techniques by a makeup artist that did my sister&#x27;s makeup for her wedding last year. I looked them up on Amazon and ordered them immediately. I am so amazed that brushes at this great a price are so incredibly great! And now after purchasing them I see pro makeup artists using them all the time! Highly suggest!!!</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes. They&#x27;re soft, durable, and hold product very well.</li>
    <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;Very very nice</li>
    <li> I am a beginner at makeup so from my point of view these are really some good brushes ,I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them and they are really light weight in your hand.</li>
    <li> These brushes are superb quality. The best is the buffing brush. It is ideal for applying liquid makeup and powder. It is extremely soft and excellent quality, leaving a perfect finish. The foundation brush is tiny but works great for applying concealer under the eyes and on the sides of the nose. The detailer brush is perfect for working on small imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended, great quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> Just used these brushes today and it was amazing my make-up looks flawless 👏💁</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
    <li> They are super soft and awesome quality.&lt;br /&gt;I love all four of them&lt;br /&gt;They are very handy to use&lt;br /&gt;Price quality very good</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes. They are super soft apply my makeup great too. I do find the brushes to be small but its great for traveling and a night out with friends or my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. The design is very good and the bristles are very strong. The good thing about these brushes is it does not shed like mine Sonia Kashuk brush. I love my real technique brushes and will be repurchasing in the near future.</li>
    <li> i love it , they blend well , they gave me a flawless &amp; nice look . , I recommended it to anyone .</li>
    <li> Was so excited to eat these brushes but they just don&#x27;t cut it for me at all... Not great quality, not well shaped, just not what I expected from pixiwoo.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are great quality and they are so gentle on your skin!</li>
    <li> Took only 3 days to get to Amsterdam, The Netherlands. These are the best brushes ever!</li>
    <li> Wish I could exchange some brushes for others</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes for the price.  I have bought almost all the Real Technique brushes and I&#x27;m impressed with how they perform and how they have lasted wash after wash.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love this</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and do not shed.</li>
    <li> Hi I&#x27;m from Caracas Venezuela, I love my brush set and shipping was fast ... recommend this kid with closed eyes, is excellent and the softness of the brush is unique ...</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They&#x27;re very soft, easy to clean, and are perfect for applying my makeup!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and met all expectations.</li>
    <li> These are the best drugstore brushes. I use the buffer and contour brushes everyday. The foundation and concealer brushes are both really small, but I still use them from time to time.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. The foundation brush applies foundation and blends without streaks. I use all of these brushes daily and will probably buy another set for my school makeup kit.</li>
    <li> A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! great quality, the shape is just perfect for the face!</li>
    <li> Just what we wanted arrived on time</li>
    <li> I love them . you must try</li>
    <li> I bought this because some of the brushes only came in the kit, and I liked the case.  I ended up purchasing a few other brushes idividually from this line and like them more than what is in the kit.</li>
    <li> very good quality, every single brush can be used for a lot of things</li>
    <li> One of my friends had these brushes and I loved the way they felt. After doing research I decided to buy them since I&#x27;m new at the whole makeup thing. They&#x27;re great brushes and I love the color!</li>
    <li> Great soft brushes. I&#x27;ve had them for over a year and they are still perfect. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Soft, no shedding, no odd smell, the case comes in handy, the brushes look professional. What more can I ask for? The brushes are the right size too.</li>
    <li> love my set use for work and for personal use every chic diva and divo needs a set</li>
    <li> Love these brushes mac aint got nothing on these</li>
    <li> Everyone should get this brush set.  Its a must have!!!  I love that they are soft, apply makeup flawlessly and they don&#x27;t shed!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes feel very soft on the skin. The biggest brush works great for mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought it for someone else, she&#x27;s thrilled with it! I will get for myself, too.</li>
    <li> Best brushes I have ever owned! I was a little worried because they are smaller than the normal brushes I have used but it turns out it applies my make up even better! No shedding!</li>
    <li> Wow. I absolutely love this brush. The best makeup brush I have used. 💗💗</li>
    <li> I have a few other name brand brushes such as M.A.C and EL, but these brushes work the same if not better. Totally worth the money. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Very nice, have been using for a while now. soft brushes quality is good, wouldnt say superb, but far better then the ones ive had before which ofcourse were on the cheaper end since they are expensive to get from stores. its too bad it didnt come with an extra small brush since i use more small and large ones than the medium sizes.</li>
    <li> The eye makeup brushes are my favorites. I apply all of my makeups with these brushes. They work very well and aren&#x27;t too harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am not one of the makeup experts, but am just learning. These brushes are really good, very soft hair and easy to hold. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> It is a nice set and it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than other sites that I&#x27;ve found. However, I find that I only use one of the brushes (sometimes two). I use the buffing brush, which you can use to put foundation, powder, etc. The counter brush is decent but it&#x27;s hard to blend with it. The other two brushes, I think is useless.</li>
    <li> Of Fair quality only, its all about the brushes not the makeup, save your money and invest in a quality product.</li>
    <li> Awesome set. Worth the price even though I don&#x27;t really use one of them.</li>
    <li> This is the best feeling to use on the face for all sorts of things associated with applying makeup or what you need for the day.  Easy to clean too....I use Dawn.</li>
    <li> The brushes are just okay. It didn&#x27;t provide the flawless coverage I&#x27;m used to with other brushes. I do have to say the new line of brushes from real technique is awesome.</li>
    <li> very good material. lasts long. and higher quality than i thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I love tis product so much. It&#x27;s so soft and easy to use for anyone. I recomend this brush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice quality for the price, these brushes hold product and apply a flawless application. I purchased these brushes because I wanted extra makeup brushes to apply different colors. My main brushes are from MAC, these are a good substitution on an occasional bases.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this set! Now I am buying more because they are perfect! Everything the budding makeup artist needs to glam herself up with a professional edge!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny spent..my make up looks amazing!</li>
    <li> If you are like me and need great quality brushes to build your collection without breaking the bank, then get these! I am slowly getting all of the real techniques brushes and I have no complaints about any of them! Very soft, dense, easy to clean, and they work wonders! A must have!</li>
    <li> These brushes came on time. I fell in love when I opened them! They seem to be really good and professional. They are so soft for my skin, doesn&#x27;t itch me at all. I think they&#x27;ll last me for a good while cause I don&#x27;t wear that much makeup. I&#x27;m just glad I got them for a great price 👍</li>
    <li> Great quality and such a low price! I just washed them for the first time and they held up perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love them. So soft and help with make up blending ! Buy them. Worth it</li>
    <li> I seriously only use the flat foundation brush. The others i never use. So if that brush came by itself, i would have done that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! The quality is amazing for the price. I would recommend them to anyone, but especially someone just start to build a brush collection. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars only because I still haven&#x27;t figure out what I&#x27;m gonna use 3 of these brushes for.&lt;br /&gt;But the one I&#x27;ve been using, the contour one - which I use for concealer, is amazing! I really love it.</li>
    <li> Love this set. They are very high quality and the case is perfect for travel</li>
    <li> I liked my large blush brush so much that I broke down and bought this set. Use it everyday...and best part! NO hairs on my face! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles do stay put!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and very versatile. Great for beginners and those who already have a lot of brushes</li>
    <li> I am 24 years old and these are the first makeup brushes I have bought. Ever. After reading some buying guides over on reddit at /r/MakeupAddiction, I decided that this set would be best for both my budget and my skill level (basically zero). I went on the real Techniques website and they had so many tutorials and guides for their products!!! It makes using the brushes very simple and straightforward...they made applying makeup a lot easier for me, which is great! I will definitely be buying more of their brushes in the future. Oh, the standing case is also a nice feature and it works fine. I was weary that it&#x27;d be flimsy and fall over but nope, there&#x27;s a drawstring with a clamp to help it stand in place. You can&#x27;t get a better deal on a beginner makeup brush set than this one right here.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft yet sturdy. I love them. The price is great for the quality and there is no shedding of the bristles.</li>
    <li> Second purchase.. Love these rushes</li>
    <li> Real techniques are the best affordable brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.great price buying through Amazon have seen them much dearer in stores.</li>
    <li> The foundation brush is incredible. Great at blending!!! It&#x27;s my favorite brush now</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Better than some of my really expensive brushes!!! Cannot recommend enough! Great quality!</li>
    <li> These are hands down best brushes for the money</li>
    <li> These are synthetic and don&#x27;t make my skin itch. They&#x27;ve held up nicely through makeup application and washing. They also fit inside all of my clutches.</li>
    <li> I mostly use these for powders. I Don&#x27;t use them for liquid makeup because they don&#x27;t blend all that well, but they can be used for it. They are synthetic so they are good for any type of use. I have washed them many times and I&#x27;ve seen minimal to no shedding. The one thing I have to complain about is that they are not soft. They are rough on my skin. Maybe I am just used to my sigma being so soft. They serve their purpose and blend powders well. If i found something better for the same price I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. However I don&#x27;t know of anything out there at this price point that would be softer and equal in quality.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for new makeup brushes, and in the 15 years since I last bought my set of MAC brushes, their prices have gone up exponentially...out of my price range.  So, I did my research, looking for makeup brushes that were excellent quality, were a nice weight in my hands, didn&#x27;t shed, were affordable, and were attractive.  I knew I could always buy a case, but if the new brushes came in a nice case, that would be a bonus.  Everything I read put Real Techniques in the top 5 brands for the things that I was searching for.  So I bought this set, the Travel Essentials Set, and a Stippling Brush.  When they came (in a timely manner!), I washed them with brush shampoo and let them air dry, prior to first use.  24 hours later I put the brushes to the test, and they EXCEEDED my expectations!  Well constructed brushes in well made cases (I can even easily fit the Stippling Brush in the Core Essentials case!), the quality is exceptional, there&#x27;s no shedding (I use them daily, and spritz them with Brush Cleaner after each, then gently wipe dry), they feel very nice in my hands, and they are beautiful to boot!  For the price, you just can&#x27;t beat these brushes.  I&#x27;ll be back to buy the set for the eyes, and that will complete my set!  I&#x27;ve had them now for a few weeks and they have not disappointed me at all!  I have not had one brush shed even a little, and they hold their shape!  DO NOT GET SEDUCED BY THE \\&quot;35 BRUSH SETS FOR $17!\\&quot;!  Most of us, who wear makeup regularly use roughly 12-13 brushes...so I bought what I needed, paid only a little more than those cheap sets that contain too many brushes to keep track of, let alone use, and got EVERYTHING I WANTED!!  As an extra plus, the official website has tutorials on how to use each brush, and how to achieve certain looks with makeup.  I don&#x27;t normally use these, but I had no idea how to use a Stippling Brush (I just knew that it was for foundation, and used to achieve the \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot; look), so I watched that tutorial, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I really do have that airbrushed look now, AND I use less foundation (about 3/4 less than I had with a flat foundation brush)!!  Thank you Real Techniques!!!!</li>
    <li> I was curious about these brushes when my friend bought a set, she told me how soft yet effective they were. So I had to try it. I absolutely love these brushes, and I want to get the rest of the set as well.&lt;br /&gt;They actually hold the make-up in the bristles long enough to blend it to your face perfectly, all while remaining soft and durable.</li>
    <li> I recevied my set today and im in love with it already.. its so soft and picks up the right amout of color. A bonus is the price! its awesome :)</li>
    <li> Nothing special but okay for travel case.  Case is cheap looking so don&#x27;t buy the brushes for the case as it is a throw away.</li>
    <li> I was deciding between these and the Sigma F80 flat top kabuki brush. but i got this set because the reviews and comparisons are better and its a great value.</li>
    <li> Soft and pretty. I would buy this just for the Buffing Brush alone. I use it lightly to build my foundation. I bought the beauty blender and came back to using the buffing brush.</li>
    <li> I use all of the brushes in this set. They are very soft. The price was great as well. Would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best! I couldn&#x27;t even think of buying very expensive brands than this one. Highly recommended purchase!</li>
    <li> Brushes are good for the price nice soft and get the job done I like the case possibly for when traveling but don&#x27;t see that I would use this on a daily basis at home. I would purchase other Real Techniques brushes in the future</li>
    <li> good quality , thanks.</li>
    <li> All these makeup brushes perform as well as expected. There are similar brushes from more expensive brands, but these will do. Plus, they are portable. I tried the concealer brush (pointy one) for mineral makeup and powder foundation, and it works.</li>
    <li> I bought these to throw into my briefcase when I travel. I wanted something light weight, inexpensive but of decent quality. The buyers reviews convinced me and they were right. The bristles, unlike some other inexpensive brushes, are not rough nor do they fall out. Very happy with these.</li>
    <li> these are my favorite brushes! I never really understood how people could LOVE brushes but now I do - they stay firm and no bristles left on my face! LOVE</li>
    <li> I love this set, I use all of them and if you would like to see me using them you can find me on youtube at TheOtherSideOfAlex. I love these brushes and I really recommend them</li>
    <li> These are my first real Technique brushes and once I figured out what I like them for, I love them.  I will list my uses for each:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small domed brush: Contour and highlighting. I Love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat, small foundation brush: Applying under eye concealer.  Honestly I don&#x27;t use this one that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very small detailer brush: Cleaning up eyebrows with concealer, applying shadow to the bottom lash line, outlining lips with concealer when wearing dark lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medium sized, slightly rounded-top powder brush:  You can use this to apply liquid foundation but I use it to buff in my setting powder and I LOVE IT FOR THAT! The brush is really soft and does a very good job at buffing in the powder (for pores and imperfections).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> Love!! Great brushes.</li>
    <li> So soft and no shedding! I love the contour brush, I&#x27;ve seen it featured in many beauty channels such as Casey Holmes and Nicole G. Love this set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, blend well and very sleek</li>
    <li> another set of really easy to use and study brushes. brushes can be use for multiple makeup applications.recommended for flawless foundation application.</li>
    <li> good core collection love real techniques</li>
    <li> I love the way my makeup looks using this brush set. It looks very smooth. The brushes don&#x27;t shed which I love!</li>
    <li> I received this set for Christmas last year. It was on my Wish List. I love all the brushes in this set and have used them all one time or another. They are well made and I have not had any bristles fall out while using them. This is a great starter set for someone just learning about make up or looking for quality brushes. I have since then purchased other brushes from the real Techniques line and have been very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Good quality, but you need to remember which brush is for what. The description is on the packaging by not on the brushes.</li>
    <li> Loooveeeeee these brushes</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for our granddaughter, who loves it.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.</li>
    <li> Super soft,easy to work with and clean!</li>
    <li> The holy-grail set! So amazing - and so much cheaper than buying it at Ulta!</li>
    <li> Great brushes of good quality (especially for the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bigger brush and use it to buff in my foundation. It leaves a flawless &amp; streak-free layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only brush I have yet to get major use out of is the flat concealer brush, but not because it is bad brush but because I simply have no use for it. Also, the stand thing is totally useless (IMHO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend and will be buying more when I&#x27;m stateside.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. You can&#x27;t beat the price. The quality is great. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> i have tried every single type of brushes out there.&lt;br /&gt;these are by far the best i have seen.&lt;br /&gt;they are affordable, provide excellent coverage with foundation.&lt;br /&gt;i have mac brushes, which are good but not as perfect as these.&lt;br /&gt;- what is also nice is that the creater of these brushes (sam) has a youtube chanel which is dedicated to helping and supporting each one of us buyers use these brushes in a professional way.&lt;br /&gt;- you will not find any hair bristles falling out of these brushes. they are sturdy and of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;- i specifically loved the travel bag, if you are a big traveling person like me , you will love the convenience of this bag, since your brushes will always be neat and prepared for your travel which holding them safely in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, you will love them.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product 10 stars. This set is so affordable and the quality is top notch. I&#x27;ve only used 2 brushes out of the set so far -- the buffing brush and the detail brush. I use the buffing brush for foundation application and it really gives a nice even coverage. The bristles are so soft and has the perfect density to glide the make up over your face. I wasn&#x27;t planning to use the detail brush since I figured I&#x27;d use it for concealer but I just don&#x27;t use concealer that often (not because I don&#x27;t need to but because I&#x27;m lazy). I actually found a great use for it, digging into nearly empty foundation bottles to retrieve that last bit. I use it to apply the remaining foundation to any spots as I would a concealer and then buff the foundation on with the buffing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They clean up really well. I use diluted castile soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) and they dry so fast! I give them a few good shakes against a towel and they&#x27;re practically dry. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with colors staining the white tipped bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have real Techniques brushes outside this collection and I love those, too.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes, they are dense which is great for holding product. I love the tapered one and the blush brush. the concealer brushes small and big are ok. they work great but I don&#x27;t really need to use these.</li>
    <li> i love this set and will be buying many more. I reach for my buffing brush more then my way more expensive MAC brush</li>
    <li> I got the brushes after about 3 weeks, they were smaller then I expected, especially the concealer brush. But they work really well and I am glad that I bought them. Although I think they are a little overpriced.</li>
    <li> I love every one of these brushes and I have almost all of them! They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is soft and high quality. It is very easy to use for applying liquid foundation and concealer to create a flawless makeup.</li>
    <li> The are so soft and apply products very very good .. Best brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just dont like the pointed foundation brush..</li>
    <li> these brushes are so soft.  they make applying my makeup so easy.</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with my brushes. Real techniques is an affordable brand but really high quality they feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived well packaged and sooner than expected ;).</li>
    <li> Real technique brushes rock! They apply and blend well and are easy to clean. I can&#x27;t imagine a luxury brush being any better than these and I love that I was able to get a great product for a great price. I highly recommend these brushes and would buy again.</li>
    <li> The BEST brushes I have ever owned!!! I use them everyday!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the buffing brush that came in this set. It finishes the foundation with a well-blended coverage for a flawless finish. Brushes were really soft and did not feel scratchy on my skin. I also love the fact that most of the brushes has a wide end base that could free-stand on a flat surface.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great brushes! Defiantly good quality, and would recommend to anyone in search of affordable and great brushes.</li>
    <li> I am just getting into make up. I love these brushes! They&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve ever had and they don&#x27;t shed every much. They are not the fanciest brushes I&#x27;ve ever seen but they&#x27;re nice and soft and apply make up nicely.</li>
    <li> I got these after hearing lots of people talk about them and sooo glad I did. They are some of my favorite brushes I have in my collection. They are affordable, soft, easy to clean and dont shed. I use mine everyday. And the stand is pretty handy too.</li>
    <li> I wanted these brushes so badly that I went out and bought liquid foundation just to use them. I LOVE them. The buffing brush alone is worth the price for how easily it works the product into your skin. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with foundation looking cakey or layered on and this helped the makeup look like it was just a natural part of my skin. A little goes a long way with these brushes, too. My second favorite in the bunch is probably the pointed foundation brush, which I use to work concealer into the tiny corners of my face and over my brows. Absolutely love these!</li>
    <li> Very good brush set.  My daughter had MAC but they cost a ton and the bristles kept coming out.  Have had these for well over a year with no issues.  Very soft and well made.  The base of the brushes are cool as you can stand them up on the counter.  The travel kit also acts as a stand.  For the money, theses are great.</li>
    <li> I love this set. It is very compact for easy travel and great for applying makeup in a hurry. I have found uses for all of the brushes. My only gripe is that the foundation brush is much too small apply foundation to your entire face. I instead use it to apply concealer under my eyes or on problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company has good brushes so I will buy the contour brush next. I would recommend the product because of the ease of use, compact packaging, quality brushes and affordable price. It would be great if the company resized the foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Great set for travel. All brushes are easy to use, clean, and store. The case is great for drying the brushes (as they should dry upside down).</li>
    <li> Super soft, doesn&#x27;t shed and love the sleek design. I also like the carrying case, it helps with not squishing the brush heads.</li>
    <li> I am learning how to apply makeup properly and I found that you need the right brushes. These are pretty, they display well in my makeup console and the seller identifies each brush and its use.  Of course, you do need a make up expert to tell you how to use them.  Maybe instructions would be helpful.  Other than that, I love them.</li>
    <li> i love the packaging of this item. it was well organized and well wrapped. the brushes were as displayed in the picture on the website.  i recommend it for all make up lovers. the brushes are so soft and they don&#x27;t smell. i was looking for a good brushes for a long time, this is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Great for anything basically!</li>
    <li> I didnt know what to expect about this product but i love it so far and would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I love these eye make up brushes, they are the best. I can easily, precisely and quickly apply all of my eye make up perfectly. I also use Skingenixx Eye Gel [[ASIN:B00VSBDR78 Skingenixx Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea and Matrixyl 3000 Super Peptide Complex]] - it has really helped my eyes look brighter and younger. I have told all of my friend to try these products for amazing eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these sets so far.  The buffing brush is the only brush I&#x27;ll use with my mineral foundation.  I just use it to press the mineral foundation into my skin and it gives flawless coverage.  The other brushes are fine too, but really, it the buffing brush I want.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for the price! They are soft but firm and hold up after washing. I have not had any shedding and have washed them three times so far. The buffing brush is a nice size and density. I use it for mineral makeup or setting with a powder. It might be good for applying liquid foundation, but haven&#x27;t tried it. I use the contour brush for just that-perfect for under the cheekbones. The foundation brush is a bit small for applying foundation, but is good for getting into finer areas or concealer. The detailer brush is small, and is good for concealer or around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great kit. I find the quality better than some of my MAC brushes and they are much less expensive. I use most of them every day. All are fluffy and soft, but pick up product well. I am glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> Very nice set! It was my choice for contouring palette and I use it daily now. It is quality for money and I am very happy with the choice.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every time I apply makeup. Keep them clean and you will have no problem with them! There is an extra slot for more brushes if you want to add them.</li>
    <li> I really like this set very much!</li>
    <li> My gf love these brushes but the pointed foundation brush is a disappointment the bristles are falling out.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t try it yet, but it looks good</li>
    <li> love this set. it has everything you need for a flawless face.</li>
    <li> Just the perfect brushes for what my wife needs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set with the realTechniques Lash/Brow Groomer and the Starter Set and I love them all! The handles are bright and colorful in my makeup bag which makes them easy to find. The brushes are soft and pick-up color nicely. The buffer brush and the contour brush are my favorite!</li>
    <li> Was in a brand new box but the brushs text ... were barley seen . Meaning the text of the brushs were faded?! Why!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good brushes and for a very godd price! I highly recommend these brushes, they are great and the quality is not behind the branded ones! Real Techniques products are all very good and have never let me down! All the products I have purchased were amazing and for a little price!</li>
    <li> these brushes are so worth buying...if you are a makeup guru you must have these brushes in your collection...they are excellent to work with</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned M.A.C., Sephora, IPSA, Shu Uemura brushes. Real Techniques brushes is the best overall. If nobody had told me the prices, I would have guessed at least $20 each. Yet it is less than that for a WHOLE SET! The pointed foundation brush saves me a ton of product and time. The contour brush is amazing. I followed the advice on the box and used the detailer brush as a lip brush.... And I just love how they are color-coded (purple for eye brushes, gold for face). Don&#x27;t even THINK about it. BUY NOW!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m love this product so an owner is kind.&lt;br /&gt;The product are authentic100% and the best item for me.&lt;br /&gt;Quickly shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;My name is Namtarn from Thailand.</li>
    <li> Contour brush: soft and good shape/size for highlight. Buffing brush: bigger than the Expert Face brush and the bristles are bit longer too. Pointed Foundation brush: too small for face but a much better shape than their Foundation brush. Detailer brush: good for small area and for concealer too</li>
    <li> The buffing brush is a must have. Best brush ever invented. You don&#x27;t even know how good your makeup will look. The bronzing brush is effective but nothing to write home about. The detailed brush is just stupid small. I would&#x27;ve paid this price for just the buffing brush, so I consider the others freebies. If you don&#x27;t have other brushes, this is a good starter kit. I&#x27;m married to my Chanel blush brush and MAC bronzing brush but for foundation the buffing brush is a must have. Only 3 stars because the other brushes are in my makeup graveyard of spares.</li>
    <li> So far, so good (no shedding, easy to wash, etc.)</li>
    <li> No shedding, good for all sorts of basic face makeup application.  I&#x27;ve used the contour brush for powder highlighter (excellent), the pointed foundation brush for liquid foundation (very good), and the buffing brush for cheek-apple blush.  I haven&#x27;t used the little brush yet, but I&#x27;m sure it would be excellent for concealer.  RealTechniques are really the best brushes for your money, bar none.</li>
    <li> Works well with low price.</li>
    <li> They shed don&#x27;t purchase</li>
    <li> This entire line is amazing. Soft brushes, no shedding.</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredibly professional and are of amazing quality. They do not shed and I use them every day and have had no problems with breakage or bending or stiffness. I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> perfect! the brush is really soft!</li>
    <li> Great Qulaity! Great bargain for the price</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every day and the quality is amazing. They are soft and never shed!!!!! I washed them and they go back to there original shape and softness.  &amp; the price makes even more amazing. It&#x27;s a must !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect as always... I give them to my sister cause she is beginning</li>
    <li> flawless finish. use the big one for my liquid foundation. use the contouring brush for blush and bronzer and use the application brush for concealer. its perfect.</li>
    <li> Great quality, excellent price. One small issue is that the brushes are smaller than I expected. They are great tools for what they do, but they are a bit small. The case is a great part of the set, and when folded the other way, it is easy to carry in my purse. I will be buying more real techniques products. They are stylish, functional and inexpensive. I can skip Sigma and MAC &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; from now on.</li>
    <li> Good brushes,buy with Techniques Starter Set,competent for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for well over a year and i must say, i love them! They do not shed one bit and my make up goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to purchase.</li>
    <li> I own almost every brush MAC makes and I cant tell a difference in between the two!</li>
    <li> Sturdy brushes have it for over a year!!! Love them.. They&#x27;re super soft. Apply makeup on smoothly and blends easily.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes...very good product!</li>
    <li> great when used to apply make up , and soft on the skin</li>
    <li> buffer brush is awesome!! the others are okay and do their job. def worth the price tho!</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes :)</li>
    <li> Love the Real Techniques brushes!  They are the best!</li>
    <li> good price, ok quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for liquid, cream and powder use. Very soft and Easy to clean, I would definitely repurchase if I need to. Can&#x27;t wait to add more to my collection!</li>
    <li> I love every brush in this collection! The bristles are sooo soft and they blend perfectly. My makeup looks very natural!</li>
    <li> These are awesome brushes. I am a makeup artist and this is my fave brand. I use them every day! Perfect for applying foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than i image</li>
    <li> These brushes are insanely amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased expensive brand name brushes in the past and these are comparable to them if not better!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for quality brushes on a budget then do not hesitate to purchase these.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice set you get 3 bigger brushes and one small one for lip or eyeliner. The bigger brushes are a great set for contouring and blending!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are a bit stuff but there is some movement in them which I love!</li>
    <li> The brushes are a little bit smail but soft and beautifuls!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad these were finally on sale as I have been hunting for these brushes for ages! They&#x27;re not as soft as other brush sets I&#x27;ve used before but they apply makeup beautifully. The white tips make it easier for me to see how much product I&#x27;m loading and the denser shape helps me to apply makeup with a much lighter hand.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, I truly love them!</li>
    <li> Deceiving price point for the quality of these brushes. Perfect for building coverage with an airbrush effect. Recommended to me originally by a friend and I&#x27;ve passed the recommendation along to everyone.</li>
    <li> Thanks a lot more things that I liked</li>
    <li> These brushes are easy to use and versatile. Watch the video from the company&#x27;s website for a detailed demonstration of each brush. They are easy to maintain. (Buff excess product onto a clean cloth/tissue, or spritz cloth with a solvent based brush cleaner, then buff the brush head until clean for daily maintenance. Shampoo for deeper cleaning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these brushes just to have the Contour brush for blush, for its&#x27; petite size and unique shape. (For working a small area.) The rest of the collection ended up impressing me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Contour brush is great for blush when you do not have a large area to apply (think apple of the cheek only and then another color for the contour of the cheek bone). I use it for highlighting and for easy eye shadow base color application. (I use my the Balm highlighter for both.) You can just utilize the tip for shading your brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pointed Foundation brush is excellent for corrector/concealer. It navigates around the eye area with precision and is gentle to the skin. Utilizing its&#x27; point to apply corrector around the mouth and nose works perfectly. (I have another brush I really like for foundation because it covers more area with every swipe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detailer brush can be used for general concealing, lips, or eyes. I use it mainly to apply shadow to the tear-duct area of eyes for highlighting. Then I finish my eye make-up application by sweeping the brush under the lower lashes to &#x60;clean-up&#x27; a bit, &#x60;fanning-out&#x27; a bit on the outside of the eye (with whatever residual product is left on the brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Buffing brush works well as designed, but admittedly, gets used much less than the others. Works well for apply bronzer around hairline. 12/03/12 New--saw tutorial using this brush for cream to powder foundation application, works very well, gets used much more now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This Core Collection, is just that, the core brushes to make precision application effortless.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soooo soft and blends the powder and liquids very well. I have MAC and Sigma and other brush, but these by far the best face brushes I own. They are really good quality brushes, no shedding whatsoever and for the price.. OMG!! You cannot beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Sam really knows what she is doing..Get them!</li>
    <li> Great brushes at a great price!</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Very fast delivery! I&#x27;m impressed! :)) and I&#x27;m so excited to received it yesterday and try it today... I&#x27;m pleased with the quality....so soft and very define...and with price?? really amazing! It&#x27;s way better than Sigma brushes where my eyes got irritated! I have also MAC brushes, but for me, these would be my fav! :)) I bought all the collections! LOVE IT! :)) highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes after a review I saw on them on YouTube and I was very happy I found out about them. They are very affordable, soft, made exceptionally well and are great for applying your makeup. I especially love the buffing brush for applying my cream foundation. It does not streak or put too much product on my face and waste my foundation. Then the way it make me look airbrushed is like nothing I have EVER experienced before. I am 31 yrs old and have been wearing .makeup since I was 15 so it&#x27;s easy to say that I have some experience when dealing with different makeup and brushes and out of ALL the brushes I have EVER used in that time these were by far the best! I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. I would suggest you buy them and see for yourself what all the fuss is about. I can almost guarantee u WON&#x27;T be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really good brushes, very soft. Work super well with both liquid and dry products which is what I love the most, but unfortunately the labeling rubbed off just after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> decent set of brushes, a little expensive for the quality.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to any of my friends. sorry.</li>
    <li> This set was listed at a great price that I couldn&#x27;t beat. I am happy I picked this up, and can&#x27;t believe I am just now getting on the RT bandwagon. Better late than never though. These brushes are comparable to MAC brush and Sigma brushes...or maybe even better (depending on preference). I used to pick up ELF brushes from Target from time to time, but that adds up. It&#x27;s nice to get great quality brushes for a good price.</li>
    <li> They were brand new. It was for a great price. I was very pleased with the product as well. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;real techniques&#x27; brand makes really quality products at really low prices.  It also helps to know these brushes are endorsed by a makeup artist who is REALLY popular on youtube (pixiwoo), and does really nice work.  She uses her brushes often while applying the makeup, so you know that it isn&#x27;t something that doesn&#x27;t work, and is worth the money.  If it&#x27;s good enough for a high-profile makeup artist, I guess it&#x27;s good enough for me.  This set in particular is my favorite because you get a little of everything you need.  You can put on foundation/primer with one, eyeshadow with another, blush with one, and concealer/highlighter with another.  They are very soft, synthetic bristles, which means they last longer and you can clean them more often than animal hair products.  I&#x27;ve had these for about two weeks, I&#x27;ve washed them once, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any hairs falling out.  The handles are metal, so you are getting a really durable product.  I like the white coloring at the top because then you know you&#x27;ve cleaned them well.  I recently bought another brush from sephora&#x27;s line, and it really doesn&#x27;t come close to these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus- they come in a carrying case and they are labeled for people like me who are totally new to makeup and has no idea WHAT is going on.  Also, if you need helpful tips on applying or cute looks for a job interview or night out, you can check out pixiwoo on youtube, which is fun to watch and really informative.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, although they are affordable they preform like some of the more expensive ones .They really do apply makeup very well and after using them for a while now and cleaning them, there has been no fall out. I definitely do recommend trying them out!</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about these brushes - they&#x27;re good but they&#x27;re not the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  They are nice and sturdy, the bristles are soft and semi-dense, and they don&#x27;t shed.  The brush heads are a little small for my taste.</li>
    <li> While my YT guru is Lisa Eldrige. I have to give mad props to Sam for these brushes, they rock, so soft and stylish and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Good for temporary use.</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and easy to use. Just a heads up, they are not for heavy foundations as they are easily weighed down.</li>
    <li> I just purchased these brushes on Sat Feb 2 for $15.99 on Amazon.com. I came back today to buy my lil sister a set and the price has more than doubled??????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love these brushes and I bought the expert face brush, powder brush, blush brush and setting brush to even out my face brush collection. They are very nice quality for a good price. I would probably invest in a different set at the $34.99 price I see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get these brushes on drugstore.com for $17.99 btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the price jump I am very excited because these brushes are synthetic but have the soft feel of an animal hair brush and they work great with powders and liquids. Great brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also at ULTA for a cheaper price as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for brushes to apply my makeup with but those high end brushes cost too much. I decided to purchase these after seeing some YouTube beauty guros swearing by these. They work awesome. I&#x27;ve used the buffing brush the most &amp; it give you an airbrushed finish. I&#x27;m going to purchase a backup set.</li>
    <li> This has everything you need for your face! The buffing brush is my absolute favorite, it is dense and soft for perfect application.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes and great little carrying case that does sit upright like the picture shows.</li>
    <li> These are super soft brushes! The case is a great idea but probably not something I will find myself utilizing much.</li>
    <li> These are the best cheap brushes I have ever bought. NO need to spend your money buying sigma or mac brushes.. These are the best!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for my sister and she absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. But for some reason i feel like the store kind are better. They just didnt feel too sturdy at the bristles, particularly the buffing brush.</li>
    <li> Despite the price of these brushes being so low, you are getting a really nice set of brushes! No need to spend money on high end brushes. These are the essential face brushes. I use them as  follows: buffing brush for my foundation. It can blend out very little product (which saves you money) and can build up your coverage as you see fit. The highlight/contour brush does exactly what it says. It&#x27;s very soft and fluffy. I love that little thing. I used the pointed foundation brush only once and did not like how stiff and scratchy it felt on my skin, which is why I gave only 4 stars. I like to use the precision concealer brush (the smallest one) on my lips. NONE of these brushes shed. I think I&#x27;ve seen one fiber come out. That&#x27;s it. For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I received my makeup brushes so fast and the company was very professional! I will be ordering more products from this company.  The makeup brushes are the real deal!</li>
    <li> Love these so much, I&#x27;m going to order more, as back ups. And give my sister a set.</li>
    <li> They work great better than any other brush Ive used, no shedding so far or any other problems. Deff recommend this items</li>
    <li> Even you are starter or a professional.  I purchased this kit twice.  Real Techniques started limited editions and I hope Amazon will try to sell them.  I do not know or heard anywhone in the world who regretted purchasing these brushes.  Love them.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is important to understand that these brushes are not very big but the bristles are lovely. The case &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; is quite interesting but it does feel a bit cheap (and this was a very affordable set of brushes.) I consider them good and affordable. Not as soft as EcoTools but the construction is lovely and they get the job done. The eyeliner brush is miniscule. I would recommend them except that who is going to take the time to re-insert the brushes into their stretchy wrap when a cup would be quicker?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe these are the real thing because the bristles are much more coarse than the same brushes I bought from Ulta. Also, the lettering rubbed off of all of them within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;Still for the cost, these brushes are well made and get the job done. The maker of them should just manufacture and sell them as their own.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used the powder brush and liked it. although, i kind of wish it was a flattop brush so i can more evenly apply the mineral powder. i think im going to get the expert face brush regardless.</li>
    <li> These brushes were recommended by my makeup instructor for a class I was taking.  I now have two sets for my kit.  I really like them</li>
    <li> I was looking for an essential brush set that was soft, durable and affordable. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> For the price, these couldn&#x27;t be better.  I was looking for some decent brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune (I&#x27;m not a model... why would I spend $50 for a brush!)  This was perfect and I feel like I get a pretty precise application when I need one.</li>
    <li> These are better than brushes that sell for many times the price.  The buffing brush, is particular, is exquisite for the application of foundations such as Studio Tech.  Previously, it would crease into lines.  Now, it just looks gorgeous.  Important because Studio Tech is the only foundation that has a perfect match for me, and this brush makes it possible.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes :) the handles are very easy to grip and the bristles work amazingly with any profuct and blend beautifully</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these brushes.  I have only ever used cheaper brushes (and never natural hair) so I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience to compare these to, but I find them to be very satisfactory.  I wish all the handles tapered a little more, but they&#x27;re designed to stand up so they are fat all the way down.  They get a little bulky in my brush cup for this reason- especially since I have a couple other large RT brushes.  All of those big bases take up a lot of room.  The brushes wash well and I have not lost a single hair in 5 or so washings. I use the contouring brush for contouring and blush (I need to get the blush brush stat!); I use the flat foundation brush for concealer because it is tiny, I use the detail brush for lips or spot concealer, depending, and I use the buffing brush to smooth and blend everything out.  I think the brushes are a little odd looking by themselves but once I added the eye set and a couple others, they all look cute together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is super useless, so I laugh when people point out how great it is in video reviews.  It sucks. The only time it would be good is if you&#x27;re traveling, but a standard case would work just as well because the stand is lame.  It&#x27;s a good concept but the brushes are really hard to remove from the elastic, especially with their rubberized bases; the case is flimsy, cheap and lightweight, and it would be a PITA to put each brush back in the elastic.  However, I have discovered that people will actually buy these cases on ebay.  So I was able to make a bit of money back on each of the sets I have (this one and the eye set).  The case concept might be a good idea in heavy leather with better quality elastic- then you wouldn&#x27;t have to hold down the case to pull each brush out.</li>
