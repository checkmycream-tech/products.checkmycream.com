      <li>The clippers work well and cut the hair nice and evenly.  </li>
      <li>NICE COMBO FOR THE PRICE</li>

      <li>When they do get a bit warm, I have a clipper cool\lubricant spray</li>

      <li>They work great, they provide a clean cut.</li>
      <li>I am a professional, and these are the best clippers I have ever owned.  </li>
      <li>- It does the job quite well  I cut my own hair, so that there saves me a ton of cash, since barber shops in Canada are quite pricy, to me, as compared to those in Guyana, which do the job for more than 1/2 of the price.  </li>
      <li>THESE BY FAR ARE THE BEST PAIR I FOUND</li>
      <li>OVERALL THE TRIMMER AND CLIPPER ARE GREAT FOR A GREAT PRICE</li>
      <li>Also, the guards for the clippers were very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>Very high quality clippers, for a great price.</li>
      <li>Definitely better than Wahl &amp; ConAir brands.</li>
      <li>Perfect for an individual or family.  </li>
      <li>They cut nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Love the carrying case to.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they will get the job done.</li>
      <li>and Amazon deliver was great thanks a lot</li>
      <li>but they were infinitely better than this product.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for an individual or family.</li>
      <li>They were functional, but I wanted better.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THESE CLIPPERS</li>
      <li>As we say in Barbados &amp;#34;It wukking&amp;#34; No regrets,just love it........to be continued.</li>
      <li>Once he started using them he was completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Extremely happy with the new clippers.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with not only the fast shipping, the perfect packaging but also the over feel and performance of this product.</li>
      <li>The Clippers are Fine, but no matter how many passes you do with the Trimmer it will not fully remove hair.</li>
      <li>really well i would recommend this product to any one who is looking for a good set of clippers to cut their hair.</li>
      <li>- It does not shutdown on me when I use it  - It is easy to manage  </li>
      <li>Also, the motors in each unit are not as strong as you&#x27;d expect from andis.</li>
      <li>Very nice clipper set cut my husbands hair regularly and it works much better than the one we had before</li>
      <li>i have to get new clippers because they just do not do a good job at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quiet, easy to hold, a joy to use.  </li>
      <li>day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously had an Andis cordless trimmer that I loved, and I&#x27;d say this isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
      <li>AND IT FITS COMFORTABLY IN MY HANDS.</li>
      <li>Thank you Andis and Amazon (and the company that shipped me it through Amazon) for such a great product.</li>
      <li>Finally, the packaging as well as the storage case and clipper accessories are all great quality.</li>
      <li>We kept buying those cheap sets of clippers from Walmart.  </li>
      <li>so far so good, I&#x27;ve not had any problems as of yet.</li>
      <li>- The noise level is not too loud, which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>So far I can&#x27;t complain and very satisfied.</li>
      <li>So far I can&#x27;t complain and very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Oil, clip, brush clean, and oil...</li>
      <li>i get a really clean cut on both my boys.</li>
      <li>For many Andis is a company that produces top of the line clippers for professional barbers.</li>
      <li>Andis is near top if the line for a guy on the go!</li>
      <li>Its taking to much time to get shiped please its necesary to get ship, beacuse its very important the time</li>
      <li>This is a decent product for the price, but the Wahl Sports clippers we found in the free box in college work better.  </li>
      <li>I would defiantly recommend these clippers to anyone who shaves their own head, a friends, and even on a professional level.</li>
      <li>but overall a good buy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the easiest on the skin without the attachments to protect you, so I really wish it was better at that.</li>
      <li>The regular clippers do not cut as good as i think they should for a decent hair cut (leaves areas of the hair longer than the rest)!!!</li>
      <li>I wanted good quality clippers at a good price that would last him a long time.</li>
      <li>well - and quickly.</li>
      <li>When he first used it he couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it cut without grabbing...</li>
      <li>The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
      <li>The trimmer attachments are pretty good for body hair lengths (and short head trimming) and can \\&quot;fade\\&quot; sections</li>
      <li>When I first used these clipper I absolutely fell in love with them.</li>
      <li>The smaller clipper is great for sideburns, a beard, &amp; general light trim jobs between haircuts.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price and its for two items.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful!  Although only used once thus far, I could not be more pleased.  The quality appears to be near professional grade, instructions are clear and concise, the equipment performed flawlessly and will pay for itself in no time.  I am actually looking forward to my next haircut, and my wife really had fun being \\&quot;the barber\\&quot;.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For how cheap these are, I was impressed. I use the little one for my beard and the big one for haircuts -- have not been disappointed with them yet.  The clipper guards lock on tight to avoid accidents.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product for the price, but the Wahl Sports clippers we found in the free box in college work better.  If you want some really good clippers, buy something a little more expensive.  These don&#x27;t cut fast, and they actually get REALLY hot to the touch - almost so much that it burns my skin during a haircut.</li>
    <li> This set is miles ahead of other clipper/trimmer combos I&#x27;ve used in the past.      The motors are quiet and the cut is quick and consistent without tugging or pinching.  It cuts dry and wet hair equally well.  They remind me of the sound and feel of having my hair cut professionally at a shop.    Also, the motors do not become warm until well into use and they are never hot or uncomfortable.  I read so many reviews on various products where people complained about \\&quot;hot to the touch\\&quot;, \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot;, and \\&quot;unsatisfactory\\&quot;.  This Andis set is nothing like that.    My wife uses them on me and she says they are very high quality and feel professional.  She is not a hair-stylist by trade, but our results look like she is.      I thought the price is very reasonable.  After three cuts, we&#x27;re already saving money and time over going to a shop.      Finally, the packaging as well as the storage case and clipper accessories are all great quality.</li>
    <li> This was a nice set, however, the trimmers did not shave as close as i wanted them to.  Even after I adjusted them.  Also, the guards for the clippers were very cheaply made.  You get what you pay for, I guess...</li>
    <li> NICE COMBO FOR THE PRICE, I CUT MY SON&#x27;S AND BOYFRIEND&#x27;S HAIR AT HOME IN ORDER MONEY TO SAVE. I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL CLIPPERS OVER THE YEARS (ONCE A YEAR)AND THESE BY FAR ARE THE BEST PAIR I FOUND, THEY DON&#x27;T GET HOT NOR CUT THE SKIN WHEN EDGING.</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged and wonderful clipper and trimmers. Theyre quiet, consistent, powerful, and professional. You will receive a grade A hair cut and line. I would recommend these to anyone. I recieved them five days ahead of time and I have already made back the money i spent on them!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product based on reviews I read on amazon. It is quiet &amp; has a precision haircut, but it does get pretty hot if you use it more than 5 minutes continuously. The smaller clipper is great for sideburns, a beard, &amp; general light trim jobs between haircuts. Would recommend, just be cautious about the heat. Definitely better than Wahl &amp; ConAir brands.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re amazing! Heavier than expected, but the motor is quiet and they&#x27;re easy to manipulate and maneuver. I love them!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews for the clippers I bought a pair for myself. Long story short- they barely cut. With all the fancy features it list and so forth you&#x27;d think it would be able to run laps around my cheap Wahl clippers, yet it was those same cheap Wahl clippers I had to run back to just to finish my hair cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to factor in that maybe because I&#x27;m mixed the clippers won&#x27;t work as well on hair like mine compared to those that are white. Anyway, if you&#x27;re not white and/or don&#x27;t want to make a $50 leap of faith, find something else. I&#x27;m going to go try and pawn my pair off now.</li>
    <li> Great buy but was no longer needed when the product arrived so i had to return but i definitely will recommend</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with not only the fast shipping, the perfect packaging but also the over feel and performance of this product. I tested both the clipper and trimmer and found them both to be so quiet and sturdy, nothing flimsy about them at all.</li>
    <li> I WAS WORRIED AFTER READING  A FEW REVIEWS CLAIMING THE CLIPPERS GOT HOT QUICKLY AND DID NOT CUT VERY WELL BUT THE CLIPPERS PROVED THEM WRONG THEY DON&#x27;T GET HOT AT ALL I USED THEM FOR 30 MIN CONSTANTLY AND THEY JUST GOT WARM THE CLIPPERS ARE STURDY AND HAVE A HEAVY FEEL TO THEM AND IT FITS COMFORTABLY IN MY HANDS. THE TRIMMER STRAIGHT OUT THE BOX DOES NOT CUT CLOSE IT DIDN&#x27;T OUTLINE VERY WELL AT FIRST BUT AFTER REMOVING THE THE BLADE AND ADJUSTING IT I GOT THAT SHARP CUT I WAS LOOKING FOR. OVERALL THE TRIMMER AND CLIPPER ARE GREAT FOR A GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> When I first used these clipper I absolutely fell in love with them. I shave my own head and it works flawless. Very high quality clippers, for a great price. Comes with a lot of nice attachments. Also, they are very rugged. I would defiantly recommend these clippers to anyone who shaves their own head, a friends, and even on a professional level.</li>
    <li> Ever since I got this product, I decided to put it on a trial to see just how well the NEGATIVE reviews stood.  Results are in:  - The whole idea of it getting hot must be a myth, because I never got to the point where it felt hot to the touch  - It does not shutdown on me when I use it  - It is easy to manage  - The noise level is not too loud, which is a good thing. In the end, the trimmer has moving parts, so if it is too quiet, it must be dead... &gt;_&gt;  - It does the job quite well  I cut my own hair, so that there saves me a ton of cash, since barber shops in Canada are quite pricy, to me, as compared to those in Guyana, which do the job for more than 1/2 of the price.  I got this product particularly for the Trimmer. Why? I was using disposable razors and needed a change, fast! I had a case where disposable razors caused damage to the underside of my chin. I discovered that the Andis T-Blade type trimmer, that was used on me in a barber shop one day as I was cutting my hair (in Guyana), reduced the razor bumps significantly. Since then, I wanted to get hold of the Andis product, especially the trimmer. Since using it, my face and the underside of my chin has cleared up a great deal! I was quite close to seeing a dermatologist, but that&#x27;s a thing of the past for me. Thank you Andis and Amazon (and the company that shipped me it through Amazon) for such a great product. You saved my face from total destruction by disposable razors. ^_^  I would recommend this product to anyone who might be having razor bump troubles and need a way to relieve the pain from those ingrown hairs, and also to those who cut their own hair as a way to save money.</li>
    <li> I always used Walh products.So I was a little afraid to purchase this clipper trimmer combo. All I can say is I love them, they run smooth, quiet and cut well!</li>
    <li> Was impressed on the speedy delivery &amp; was even more impressed on the quality &amp; performance. My son was very pleased indeed.</li>
    <li> I am updating my review, ill give this 4 stars, I got my trimmers adjusted by a friend &amp; they are sharpe &amp; cutt very well now. Now I can shave my face &amp; give myself an edge up. I stil haven&#x27;t cutt my hair with the clippers but I&#x27;m sure they will get the job done. I do recommend this set.</li>
    <li> Its taking to much time to get shiped please its necesary to get ship, beacuse its very important the time tha its takes</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing, and so is the trimmer. They are whisper quiet and very powerful. Oil, clip, brush clean, and oil... follow these simple instructions and you will have a long lasting set. The only downside is the clipper attachments, it shows every attachment your used to in the booklet but in the package its different. It skips sizes 4, 6, and 8. Maybe you can just extend the clippers for attachments 3, 5, and 7 to get the correct sizes but then why would it show all the sizings with pictures in the booklet? Weird. Other than that, it is an amazing set, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> so far so good, I&#x27;ve not had any problems as of yet. my son and nephews have very thick hair and the do well.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of clippers for the price. Quiet and doesn&#x27;t get hot quick. Love the carrying case to.</li>
    <li> i got this clipper/trimmer in my cosmetology/barbering kit from school and i have to say i hate them... i have to get new clippers because they just do not do a good job at all. It left bunched up hair on the head (that i could only get off with water) the motor on the trimmer stops if you hit an area of hair that is thick. The regular clippers do not cut as good as i think they should for a decent hair cut (leaves areas of the hair longer than the rest)!!!</li>
    <li> well I don&#x27;t use the shop online but my son and I both thought the product was good pricing was good and it was exactly what we saw on this play the delivery was great on time and Amazon deliver was great thanks a lot</li>
    <li> PROS: Sweet travel kit - sharp unit - adjustable speed - easy maintenance - I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber every week because of this unit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Skips a few numbers for the hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: BUY IT NOW!</li>
    <li> This set was purchased to replace a well worn out set of another brand.  I purchased this set based on price, reputation, and reviews.  The favorable reviews are right on track.  They work wonderfully. One drop of oil on the cutters after each use and they will last.</li>
    <li> Great hair clippers! Cut very well! Excellent value!</li>
    <li> I like the color, but let me get to the point, the clippers do cut well. The combs and guides are a plus, along with a nice zip up little storage.</li>
    <li> The Clippers are Fine, but no matter how many passes you do with the Trimmer it will not fully remove hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this pair. The color is great, but the quality and accessories make it much better than looks. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be the vibration to me that other reviews complain about. It&#x27;s noticeable, but I&#x27;m not sure I would have noticed it if not mentioned in many reviews.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut great but only had odd number guards (1,3,5). Makes it a challenge to do a fade but overall a good buy</li>
    <li> works really well i would recommend this product to any one who is looking for a good set of clippers to cut their hair.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for my husband. He loves the color and the quality of work of Andis brand. He really like the traveling bag it comes with to help store the clippers and accessories.</li>
    <li> Came on time works great and an excellent price brought it for my husband and he Loves it Great for any Barber.</li>
    <li> The kit works great but does not come with size No. 2 or 4 combs. I feel that the kit was incomplete without those sizes.</li>
    <li> I was sold back in 2000 when I purchased my first Andis trimmer/clipper.I am in the police force and perfer the close shaves and bald head.The andis trimmer does it just right.The special deal on this combo wasn&#x27;t bad either .For those of you commenting on the heat.....well there is a motor in there,what do you expect after excessive use? As we say in Barbados &amp;#34;It wukking&amp;#34; No regrets,just love it........to be continued.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance for Valentine&#x27;s day bc he was always complaining about his old one. When he first used it he couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth it cut without grabbing...very satisfied</li>
    <li> Its Andis so can&#x27;t go wrong with the product of andis..not my fav color but it works well. Will always buy andis.</li>
    <li> I bought these for body hair maintenance rather than my head. I only use the smaller Trimmer, but this was a better deal to buy the set and gives you lots of flexibility as well. (Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to a self-made buzz cut some day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously had an Andis cordless trimmer that I loved, and I&#x27;d say this isn&#x27;t as good. However, the cordless trimmer stopped being able to keep a charge after a year to two, so I decided to switch to an Andis corded trimmer, after using Wahl for all trimmer/clipper needs prior to my recent Andis I liked. The trimmer attachments are pretty good for body hair lengths (and short head trimming) and can \\&quot;fade\\&quot; sections well - and quickly. It&#x27;s not the easiest on the skin without the attachments to protect you, so I really wish it was better at that. (Granted, this is not what it&#x27;s designed for.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usual problem with this trimmer is dealing with the cord. It&#x27;s very think and not loose or flexible. It&#x27;s pretty short, too. Really short. I&#x27;m only 2-3 feet from the plug and have issues. Because of it&#x27;s \\&quot;folded-ness\\&quot;, it gets caught on the counter corners and toilet paper roll mount all the time. But, that being said, I was afraid to invest in another cordless trimmer if it would die on me too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had issues with the heat it generates in the hand. The \\&quot;coolest\\&quot; I&#x27;ve owned, actually. Also the quietest I&#x27;ve used. All-around pretty good, especially for the price and the occasional user and average buyer.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find the perfect christmas gift for my father for him and I thought about buying him cliipers, since his old clippers were falling apart. I didn&#x27;t want something expensive and would fall apart quickly and also I didn&#x27;t want to search store to store. I wanted good quality clippers at a good price that would last him a long time. I found these clippers online and they are great! He loves them so much and he couldn&#x27;t stop smiling.Once he started using them he was completely satisfied. They cut nice and smooth. Sharp trim lines every time.</li>
    <li> I am a professional, and these are the best clippers I have ever owned.  It includes attachments that more expensive clippers don&#x27;t even include.  It&#x27;s quiet, easy to hold, a joy to use.  Also, the color is very attractive.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Perfect for an individual or family.  Quiet, smooth and have not felt the unit heat up like others I used in the past.  Well worth the price and its for two items.  So far I can&#x27;t complain and very satisfied.</li>

    <li> Best set of clippers we have ever owned.  We kept buying those cheap sets of clippers from Walmart.  Extremely happy with the new clippers. We would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are really nice clippers i get a really clean cut on both my boys. But they get really hot by the second haircut. Also would be nice if they came with a no. 2 guard.</li>
    <li> Andis is near top if the line for a guy on the go! Clean cutting and easy to use!</li>
    <li> They work great, they provide a clean cut. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I recently made the move from Wahl to Andis after dropping my clippers on the floor lol.  The clippers work well and cut the hair nice and evenly.  They do get a bit warm but not to the point where I need to stop the haircut.  When they do get a bit warm, I have a clipper cool\lubricant spray and I apply and it helps out.  The T Line trimmer cuts sharper than the Wahl trimmer I had so that&#x27;s an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Good set but it gets hotter than its advertised quality of not getting hot. Also, the motors in each unit are not as strong as you&#x27;d expect from andis.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend.  He generally seems to like it.  He does have a small head so he uses the smaller &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; as clippers.  He did say, however, that the trimmer is not sharp enough to be used as an edger.  Are trimmers and edgers the same thing?</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t work well for my needs so I gave it to my barber he still uses them and loves them I need something much smaller for a very tender area around my ostomy.</li>
    <li> I either needed to buy a new head for my old clippers or buy a new clipper. I chose to purchase a new clipper as there was very little price difference. This product has 2 motors and several settings for each. I use it to trim my cocker spaniel and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He has an interest in cutting hair. I myself cut hair and find this ideal. The only thing that confused my son were the combs, they are numbered differently.</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper set cut my husbands hair regularly and it works much better than the one we had before</li>
    <li> But performance not what expected for an Andis product</li>
    <li> I find these clippers perfect for the non-professional user.  There in low noice and they do not get hot, even with back to back cuts (max done 3).  Plus the low noise and vibration is great for my Austic child as that is very difficult to deal with even before you place it against the head.  I have told many,friends about Andis clipper and I am very satisfied wth their products.</li>
    <li> top notch products, always great prices to compare. will recommend to every one! comes in handy when cutting and styling hair.</li>
    <li> Brought this for a friend and he loves it. Good for shaping up and shaving your face.... I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The shipment process was what i expected,  I knew this would be a good product to purchase and was excited when i received it.</li>
    <li> For many Andis is a company that produces top of the line clippers for professional barbers. Thankfully, these clippers have long been available to the public -- previously through beauty shops and now through online avenues like Amazon. Unfortunately, this particular set is not up to the standards Andis has set for itself. This set isn&#x27;t terrible, it&#x27;s just run of the mill. Perhaps it was created in an attempt to compete with the inexpensive home clipper sets by companies like Wahl. I don&#x27;t think Andis should be in that business, as it brings down its overall reputation, but what do I know? Gets the job done, but not like you might expect. Probably okay for the casual home cut. Far from good enough for a professional set up.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. I expected a bit more fron this product. Its average, not the best and not the worst</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough.  Speaking of cutting close didn&#x27;t Keith Sweat have a song with a fledging group called Kut Close back in the 90s. They didn&#x27;t make it but they were infinitely better than this product.  The song was &amp;#34;twisted&amp;#34; by the way.</li>
    <li> I have used whal clippers for 10 years.  They were functional, but I wanted better.  Lately the guides have been falling off during use and after my second oops moment I had enough and ordered these as a replacement.  I have used them once and I already notice the difference.  They are quiet, and cut well on first pass.  The guards attach solidly and I do not see them falling off like the whal guides.  The guard sizes that are included are only the odd numbers, but I think the even numbers are made up with the blade length adjustment.  I would recommend these to anyone.  The only negative so far is that the power switches are not solid and the turn off with the slightest touch.  Could be worse issues.</li>
    <li> The andis pivot clippers I need to change my rating the smallest one have stop working.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GREAT THING FOR ME TO PURCHASE. I LOVE THESE CLIPPERS,I CUT MY OWN HAIR NOW, INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE BARBER !!!!!!!!!</li>
