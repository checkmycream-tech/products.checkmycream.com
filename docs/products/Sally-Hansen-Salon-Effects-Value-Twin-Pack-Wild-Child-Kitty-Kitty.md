<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to discover and try these nail polish strips.  They are amazing and easy to use.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever manually polish my finger nails again.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors/designs.  Price is unbelievable.  WalMart can even beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have slowly converted into using these all of the time. I tried it once on a trial at CVS and have been hook ever since. They last pretty long and my friends are always impressed with the details in them. They all ask me where I get all of my cool colors and how I can afford them....AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the price- in the store these can run $5-$11 individually</li>
    <li> When i tried exactly how they said and it didn&#x27;t work at all. So i highly don&#x27;t recommend this product at all for any of their products. And i have a witness.[[ASIN:B006WZ8U6I SALON EFFECTS REAL NAIL POLISH STRIPS (METAL HEAD) By SALLY HANSEN]]</li>
    <li> I use these as &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34; nails. I paint my nails one color and then leave one of my fingers bare and add these strips to them for something fun and unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last about 4-5 days if you are using your hands a lot. I type everyday, use my smart phone, wash my hands a ton, etc. So mine usually last about 4 days and I remove them on the 5th day when they start to really chip. You can chip away at it and peel it off after a few days, but it&#x27;s best to soak in acetone.</li>
    <li> the leopard print nail stickers were in good condition but the zebra ones were not. They were dry and brittle, broke immediately. I could not wear them.</li>
    <li> My friend bough theses and we did them together. We got the cheetah ones and you have to cut them to fit, which is annoying, b.c. they&#x27;re never perfect and we put clear nail polish over them to help them last longer. The SECOND day they came up on the sides even w. a layer of clear nail polish over it. Every time I brushed my hair or even touched it, my hair would stick to where the edged came up and it would pull strands of my hair out, which obviously hurt. One the third day I couldnt stand it anymore, they were messy looking and coming up more on the edges and all around my nail so I peeled them off since they DONT come off with nail polish remover. It hurt to take them off and left my nails sticky and brittle. To get the residue off i had to use nail polish remover and wash them w. soap and water, and they looked rough and gross!</li>
    <li> My daughter  recommended them to me.  I started to doing gel sets about 6 months ago. I liked the gel set but I hated the soaking off the polish and the time it took. It is even costly when you factor in the tip. I even thought it weakened my nails but I committed to the gel set because I was tired of having  man hands.  When I first but on the salon effects  a couple of them did not stick well. My daughter them advised me to clean my nails with nail polish remover and swipe them with the emory board a little.  I now apply them and finish it of with a topcoat. They last me 7 days because I work in a clinical lab and I  wash my hands alot even though I[[ASIN:B0076L73BK Sally Hansen Salon Effects Value Twin Pack - Wild Child / Kitty, Kitty]] wear gloves.  My daughter takes hers off with nail polish remover. I peel then off with my teeth. They peel off clean and my nails look better without the strong acetone. I love the  product!!!</li>
    <li> I love these dang things, they are so awesome and I am addicted. I have a horrible time painting my nails because I do not have the patience to apply all the coats/wait for them to dry...and if I do, they start chipping the next day. But these are great, they are so easy to put on and you get a lot of wear out of them too. I recommend cleaning your nails really well before applying and also put a top coat on after for extra protection. But no waiting for them dry, you can literally give yourself a manicure in less than 20 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: I did have a bit of a problem with the strips lifting on the edges, but I found that if you use a tiny bit of nail glue and use a cuticle tool to smooth the edges down, these suckers will stay on GREAT and they still come off with nail polish remover! :)</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product!!  I followed the directions to the letter, but I did do two things differently.  First, I took the advice of someone and put two coats of a matching color underneath, so if some of it pealed or scraped off in the week, it wouldn&#x27;t be noticed.  I used a good quality brand (OPI).  Secondly I used a clean over coat to help the decal not get scraped off easily.  This has enabled my decal to last over a week!  I&#x27;m hard on my nails.  I clean, cook, bake, clean some more and I even painted my deck with this on and it&#x27;s still not chipped, scraped or pealed off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my nails and I definitely plan on getting more patterns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;If you clean your nails thoroughly first with alcohol or nail polish remover, they should stay on better. Also, if you use a clear top coat over it, it makes it last for a week or more. If you&#x27;re having trouble taking it off, you can soak a cotton ball and let it sit on your nail for 15-30 seconds and then rub it off. It should come right off :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to do what I did and use a matching color underneath, make sure you use a quality nail polish.  Paint one or two coats on and let your nails dry thoroughly.  Then apply the nail decal as directed.  Smooth it out and scrape off excess, then put clear over coat on and let dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when applying - don&#x27;t cut them to fit your nail. Apply it and then pull down off the nail - it tears to the shape of your nail. I use the rest on another nail, since mine aren&#x27;t that long. I will use a tooth pick or nail stick to scrape off any excess and then file some of the ends that need it :)</li>
    <li> TAKES a little patience but once it is on  it stays. Nice to look at .  even use these on my toes to match.</li>
    <li> I love these. My daughter used them first then told me about them. They are great! No more waiting in the nail salon all day for me ! And shipping was very fast! Thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Love these nail strips. They stay on for about a week on me with a top coat (I&#x27;m moderately tough on my nails). The patterns are definitely eye catching and I always get a ton of compliments whenever I use these.</li>
    <li> Amazed at only paying $4.12 for 2 designs when each design ranges from $8-$10 in stores. I bought a total of 2 boxes (4 designs) and only payed $11.90 Yes shipping and handling was a part of that final price. Alot better than paying like $35-$40  for exact same order in store. My strips came intact and and spanking new condition. For those who tried to reuse, remember to place strips back in tightly sealed  ziplock bag. Remember the nail polish dries out if left out and any laquer would do. I also added sally hansens diamond flash 60 second top coat with strengthener. Im sooo amazed! If u have short nails just cut the strips in half so u can get double use. :) Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Stick on nail polish isn&#x27;t new, but Sally Hansen has some really cool designs, which would easily cost me a fortune at a nail salon. I tried the Love Letter pattern (see pictures). It takes a little practice, some of my edges look slightly ragged in spots at my nail bed/sides of nails, but I have very narrow nails, so they went over the edge just a bit for me. It took me about 15 minutes, the only down side is there is no good way to store the extras, if they dry out, they don&#x27;t work AT ALL. I suggest using warm hands (as instructed) and I use my fingers to smooth the strips down, then I stretch/bend them over the edge of my nail, then gently file off the excess. I finished with a top coat (I used the Sally Hansen Diamond Flash fast drying top coat). The first set I tried, I had a base coat on and that was a really bad idea, they didn&#x27;t stick very well at all. This second set seems to be holding up better, I started with clean, dry nails that I had swiped over with polish remover to make sure there was no lotion residue or anything on my nail. The busier patterns would be much easier to patch with other pieces if you tear it in spots. Also, if you have shorter nails, you really could use one set, and cut them in half, to get two sets from one package, it would just require that you get really good at trimming the excess off your nails.</li>
    <li> easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;withstands dishes and other cleaning&lt;br /&gt;lasts for weeks! the longest I have worn them is 3 weeks and usually as an accent (one finger, just the tips, corners). they could have lasted longer, but the polish on the rest of my nails was wearing thin. actually had difficulty with removal, but no damage to my natural nail which is a huge plus for me!</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews before buying these and *thought* I understood how to follow the directions, but my first try at using Sally Hansen Salon Effects Real Nail Polish Strips did not go as well as I had hoped. I understood some of the complaints, actually. But as I watched the wear pattern (chipping and lifting) I realized that the reason I wasn&#x27;t having a good experience was probably because I hadn&#x27;t prepped properly. So, the second time I tried them I went very slowly and paid particular attention to roughing up the sides of my nails along the cuticle edge, as well as the tops. I was much more generous with the nail polish remover for the final pass. When applying, I was very careful to place them well inside my cuticles. I too only used half the strips, so one package definitely gives two manicures. They have good staying power and do not chip easily. I am really satisfied with them, and highly recommend them: especially for women who can&#x27;t apply bottle polish for any reason.</li>
    <li> I had a slightly difficult time applying the nails, but I think it is because I hadn&#x27;t tried them out before. Once I got them on though I received a compliment at least once every public outing! Mine lasted looking great for about 5-6 days. Then they still looked fine, but I noticed the imperfections. Getting them off though is a pain, but that could be because I have cheap nail polish remover. You have to rub really hard and long to get them off with cheap nail polish remover. All in all though I prefer this over fake nails (because fake nails hurt if I bump them) and painting my nails (because painted nails chip within a day).</li>
    <li> Considering the two peels per sticker that you have to do and how easily they tear at the cuticle line if you have to do any trimming/touching up there, these are a big headache in my book.  Granted, they have some funky patterns, but that&#x27;s the only advantage I can see.  I used these several times thinking I&#x27;d be able to improve my speed and deftness, but it just didn&#x27;t happen for me.</li>
    <li> frankly I don&#x27;t think these types of nail sheets are any easier than using liquid nail polish, but the designs and the convenience can&#x27;t be beat.  I applied these to my nails while waiting in a long line outside a venue.  gave the other set to a friend who is not very good at painting her nails but does a decent job of applying these.  the color will only last if you utilize similar techniques of preparation and care that liquid nail polish usually requires.  there is a slight solvent odor so I wouldn&#x27;t use these inside a enclosed space with people you don&#x27;t know, like in an elevator or with polite company.</li>
    <li> I love using these they hold up a lot better than I expexted</li>
    <li> I love animal print, and I love nails. I also love getting what I pay for. The boyfriend, family, and friends loved them. Did not chip for four days. Tip: Only use one as an accent finger if you like. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product as usual. Easier than the OPI nail apps. Although sometimes you do get a funny odd batch or box that the stickers won&#x27;t peel off properly.</li>
    <li> They look really great on the nail, but they dont last long at all. I followed all of the directions as described but the stickers started chipping the second day that I had them on.</li>
    <li> Product works well, however needs to be stored in a cool environment.  Heat destroys the adhesive.  I have it professional applied and it works for me.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d too well applying on my own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy.  I know that.  You know that.  Folding between layers of who we think we were, who we feel like now and who we wish we could be.  And it is not simple to have the things we want.  But there are short cuts.  I can hold a hand so that I can kiss a mouth. And then maybe I won&#x27;t be alone.  That can be a short cut.  Or I can wait.  I can memorize your phone number.  Remember your birthday.  And maybe on the night of the day you were born you will let me kiss your cheek.  And I can be so happy then because I know I have invested my heart strings in something that took time.  Something that could be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hensen Salon Effect Stickers are short cuts.  If I went to school to learn how to paint cheetah print onto tiny human 1 inch canvases I wouldn&#x27;t need the Salon Effects- but I didn&#x27;t go to school to learn how to paint cheetah print.  Each time you adhere the \\&quot;sticker\\&quot; know that while you may be achieving an instant reward, you have sold yourself short.  You are capable of so much more.  Maybe life isn&#x27;t about fancy Salon Effects.  Maybe we&#x27;ve lost sight of the glimmering possibility of basic red nail polish that we diligently brush against our nail-beds, nervous the whole time we will spill the bottle on the carpet.  Maybe there is magic in that.  Maybe we don&#x27;t need to have photoshopped lives.  We can have chips in our polish, school loan debt and people who ultimately gave up on us.  Maybe that&#x27;s what makes us humans.  Maybe that&#x27;s what makes us build bridges and learn math.  Maybe if we forgive ourselves long enough we won&#x27;t even care about Salon Effects anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Short cut&lt;br /&gt;Detailed/Immaculate design&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t stain carpet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Discourages technique&lt;br /&gt;Does not last&lt;br /&gt;Reinforces fear</li>
    <li> I Love em,  fun to wear, long lasting and a good price on amazon.  Follow the directions and if it would make it easier have a friend help you.  Clear coat over the top and you&#x27;ll enjoy them.  The only draw back I can see is they last so long and I like to change my nails often but these are so unique I don&#x27;t mind wearing them a little longer, and they do last if applied correctly for at least ten days.</li>
    <li> I am in deep, deep love with the Sally Hansen Salon effects nail polish strips!  I&#x27;ve been using them for about a year or so, so here&#x27;s the straight dope.  Reasons I love them: 1. WAAYYY faster than nail polish to apply!  According to the other reviewer who said it wasn&#x27;t, sure, if you&#x27;re only counting actual application time, it&#x27;s about as fast to slap on a coat of polish.  BUT, with the Salon Effect strips, THERE&#x27;S NO DRYING TIME!!  I don&#x27;t know a any girl who doesn&#x27;t know the frustration of waiting an hour or more for your nails to dry, only to find that if you bump them the wrong way, they will still dent or smudge or mark.  It takes many hours to get a dent-resistant finish with wet polish, and who has that kind of time?!?! And when you factor in the fact that these last AT LEAST 10 days, and I can only get about 4 out of regular polish before they start to chip, these save at least one, if not two more manicures!  2. LOVE all the different patterns!! I like to mix and match.  When I got this set, I did every other finger zebra/leopard. So fun!  I was one of those stuck-up corporate types who got a gel French manicure every time for 15 years, so in my more-secure-with-myself 40s, I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying having fun, crazy fingernails.  The trick, in my opinion, is to keep them very short.  You can get away with it better than if you have crazy long nails and then try to do crazy colors, too.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments everywhere I go on my nails, and lots of questions about them.  TIP: don&#x27;t follow the directions about tearing off the tab at the end.  Just take of the clear protector, peel them from the backing holding the strip, and secure the OTHER, non-tab end to the cuticle end of your nail.  Rub it all over with your finger so it&#x27;s well stuck, and then carefully use your thumb nail to take off any excess around the edges.  (If you use the supplied orange stick for this task, they can tear more easily.)  Sorry for the long wind, but I&#x27;m truly a fan!  And here onAmazon they are SO much cheaper than the $8.50-$9.50 in the store.  So ladies, buy in confidence--you&#x27;ll be glad you did!  :)</li>
    <li> OMG I love this so so much, is so easy to aply and the strips are so so cute and rare and nice, I just love it and recommend this for everyone. Good seller and it came the day it was supposed 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I just applied this product to my nails for the first time tonight.  I put a top coat on it and I am trusting it will last at least a week as people say in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I love it:  I keep trying to paint my own nails and I just can&#x27;t get it down right when I paint because I can&#x27;t paint evenly and I paint my fingers, and then even with all the appropriate coats, regular polish still chips in a day or two.  I simply can&#x27;t afford salon services these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives me something affordable that I can do for myself.  It&#x27;s amazing that I can apply this product neatly to my nails . . . even on my first try with using this product. My nails really need help because they are weak and short.  Now, they at least look pretty with the Salon Effects polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased and used two packs from a local drugstore and two packs from Amazon from two different sellers. I would strongly suggest NOT buying them on Amazon (sorry! I love Amazon and wish I could order everything from them!) The ones I bought on Amazon didn&#x27;t stretch properly over the nail, ripped when I pulled off the clear plastic, and didn&#x27;t file down smoothly. There was a definite difference in ease of application + final appearance. Perhaps this is because they tend to be older or because of changes in temperature during travel.</li>
    <li> Love it and get plenty of complements but its tricky to remove sometimes but otherwise its def worth the money</li>
    <li> for those of you who actually know how to use these right and make them last, this is a steal!! Spent so much less on this than i would have in store. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> They are the coolest things ever! I work in coporate america and they are kind of unprofessional BUT i LOVE them!</li>
    <li> As much as I love having nice looking nails I never have the time to sit down and paint them and let them dry as I am an extremely busy college student. Lets just say I work an average of 13 hours a day every day on my studies.&lt;br /&gt;I am also really really rough on my nails being an art student basically every nail polish I have ever tried has not met my standards as most chip with 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say these make it so easy for me to have nice looking nails without the drying time and they instantly look amazing in about 15 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;I can get a full set of finger nails and toes in one little pouch so out of 1 box I can get 2 manicures and 2 pedicures. Somehow I was able to use every bit and they look awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I also put a top coat just to be sure they stay nice and it seems to work as they lasted 11 days!! The only reason I changed them was I got tired of looking at the same design for 11 days.&lt;br /&gt;If I were only able to get one set of nails out of 1 box I would say that they are way too expensive but its much more affordable using every piece you can.&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain its impossible to get off but not if you use ACETONE!!&lt;br /&gt;Just one quick swipe of acetone and it easily wipes off completely simple.&lt;br /&gt;I just cant say enough how easy these are IF you follow the directions carefully then these are sooo simple if you choose to ignore any step then they probably wont work.&lt;br /&gt;side note if you opened up a pouch and have a couple left over they wont be any good anymore once you open a pouch use it or the glue/nail polish will dry out and it wont stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must have! I absolutely can not say enough good things about these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******Edit from 5 star to 3 star*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing these on my finger nails for 2 weeks they have completely ruined my nails they are now so brittle and have so many cracks ugh my nails look worse right now than they do after taking acrylic nails off.  I will continue to use them on my toe nails as they have not really done much damage to my toe nails as they have to my finger nails. So over all 3 stars because they still work well for my toesse them on my toe nails as they have not really done much damage to my toe nails as they have to my finger nails. So over all 3 stars because they still work well for my toes</li>
    <li> I have gotten these decals a couple times in the store and paid twice as much for one design! This is such a great deal being the twin pack. The designs are really cute, and last alot longer then they say on the box! A must have for any girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came in mail on time !</li>
    <li> These were priced so low how could you not buy them? I love these things! They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward. They last almost a full two weeks and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
    <li> These stickers did not stick, stay, or do anything they claimed. I followed the instructions by the letter. They are awful</li>
    <li> love these! they work so well! they stay on for a very long time. loo great! easy to remove. my new favorite!</li>
    <li> my g/f loves these things. she said there great. shipped quick. no issues. thats about all. thanks. have a good day</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recently started selling a similar product from another company.  I decided before trying them at that price range that I would start with the Sally Hansen brand first.  Im glad I did and I probably wont bother trying the more expensive brand.  With some of the strips I had to stretch them to cover my nail beds, but right in the directions it says that they can be stretched for length (which I definitely didnt need) so I figured why not stretch for width.&lt;br /&gt;I did top off with a top coat to hopefully help preserve them longer.  Glad I did!  Tomorrow night will be a full wk since I have put these on.  They dont look as good as last week, but they still look quite amazing!  If an edge does happen to lift up or chip off I just put another swipe of top coat over that spot to seal it from further damage.&lt;br /&gt;Im definitely going to purchase more of these.  I normally get bored of plain old painted nails after two days.  I&#x27;ll never get bored of these!  I cant believe I can make them look this good at home!  Wish I could get them to last for about 3 weeks LOL!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal on a great product! I get complements every time I use this product and people are shocked to hear I did them myself at a fraction of the price of  going to a nail salon.</li>
    <li> Tried all of the twin packs,,and i ADORE it ,,, the glittery ones took more time to remove but i just wrap each finger with acetone wet cotton pads for a few seconds and then it removes easily,, also when i put a top coat it stays longer,,, what i like about it( if you&#x27;re good in arts and crafts) my nails aren&#x27;t so big so i can cut and paste on my nails , if i open a pack i can do my toe nails too which is pretty cool,,,, also it turns out that if you still have a few left they dry out,,, i thought i could save some for later but if you open a pack you have finish it or dispose the rest coz it wont stick,,,, but i did something i consider smart ,,, i wet my finger tip with some nail polish remover and wet the strip ,,, i used it and it worked lolllllll,, love this product</li>
    <li> I had so much fun with these, just wish they lasted longer! they chip off easy. But still a good buy</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, but didn&#x27;t realize the amount of time involved. I prepped my fingernails according to the package, but the strips will not stick to my fingernails. After an hour of frustration I gave up. I thought this would be a fairly straightforward process, but it was not. Sticking to regular fingernail polish!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok! I like it because is very easy and fast. I dont like when i have to wait so much</li>
    <li> I really do love these nail stickers!! They&#x27;re one of my most favoite nail products I&#x27;ve ever used, and I don&#x27;t have many! They look SO nice on and really last long! And they&#x27;re MUCH better than nail polish!! My favorite pattern is the leopard, (#320 kitty kitty)! The leopard really made my nails stand out and I got a lot of compliments!! I also used these on my toe nails easily with no problems! People where surprised when they seen I also did my toes with it too and loved them! They last even longer on your toe nails. I reuse the pieces I cut off from my finger nails and use those pieces for my toes, and use the biggest strips for my big toes. The one thing I&#x27;ve noticed was the solid colors are hard for me to work with! If I try to stretch the solid color strips and they rip or the polish seperates, it&#x27;s hard to patch my nail up because you can clearly see where you tried fixing it! But the patterns are very easy to work with! If you fix your nail with another little piece, it blends in. And I don&#x27;t have big wide nails so I&#x27;m pretty sure many women have to stretch them to fit. But now, instead of really stretching them, I barely stretch them and if the sides of my nail aren&#x27;t covered I cut little pieces to match the sides and it looks perfectly fine! I still plan on buying more of these nail stickers in different patterns! They&#x27;ll always be a big favorite of mine and something I&#x27;ll wear for as long as I can!</li>
    <li> Great, fast and perfect. They came as described. The product got here fast and on time. Everything went well. The box was a little touched up</li>
    <li> These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
    <li> These nails are really the best. Once you put them on they stay forever. My best time: 9 whole weeks. not a chip.</li>
    <li> I only used these to add designs to already painted nails. They last very long and look very natural. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> These are really great! I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve never used them, but I decided to give them a try and boy am I glad I did! I actually used them on my toes, not my fingernails! They really weren&#x27;t too hard to apply. I put one coat of clear nail polish over them and they lasted for 4 weeks!! Normally I wouldn&#x27;t leave them for 4 weeks (they&#x27;re starting to grow out now) but I&#x27;ve been super super busy lately and haven&#x27;t had time to change them. I can&#x27;t believe how well they help up! I&#x27;ve already purchased more. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Well,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these a few days ago from amazon... AND THEY STINK! First of all if you don&#x27;t like the design, you can&#x27;t take it off with nail polish remover, you just have to scratch them off!&lt;br /&gt;And 2nd of all, they are messy and and don&#x27;t cut with scissors!!!!!!</li>
    <li> they are some wild colors&lt;br /&gt;but they do look good&lt;br /&gt;my grand daughter loke them too&lt;br /&gt;they  keep on good</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t what I was expecting at all! First of all, they&#x27;re nail stickers, not actual stick-on nails. Also, they are impossible to get on without damaging them! I ended up having to throw them out.</li>
    <li> They are best Purchases I&#x27;ve done! , easy to use and they arrive fast! I bought like 10 different  designs of the brand</li>
    <li> cute but won&#x27;t stay on</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, just a pain to get off.  Lasts about 2 weeks. Love it for those last minute parties when cute nails are preferred.  No dry time needed!  But put a top coat on or the edges try to peel away quicker.</li>
    <li> they look amazing and are really easy to put them on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT when you open a package must be used very fast or it will dry and will be useless</li>
    <li> I love love love Sally Hansen nail effects - and I especially love the twin pack. It costs about a quarter of what you will pay in the store and you can&#x27;t even get  the double packs in the store. The quality is the same too. If you can&#x27;t figure out how to use them at first, it can be a little hard but once you get the hang of it they are awesome. They last for a very, very long time. Tip for removal: hold a cotton ball on your nail for about 30 seconds and then rub it off. Using pure acetone also works SO much better as well.</li>
    <li> I tried these strips for the first time last week and they are pretty brilliant. Very easy to use/apply. What people may not know is these are NOT stickers. They are essentially pre pressed nail polished that&#x27;s sealed. So when you put the strip on, it&#x27;s really nail polish. It moves and molds and stretches. I love the concept and the styles but what I DO NOT love is the smell. You know how nail polish smells? Well these strips smell just like that. But forever. The smell NEVER goes away. I did my nails 6 days ago and I can smell the nail polish fumes alms it as fresh as the first application. And I smell it all day. I wash my hands often and that doesn&#x27;t help. Next they do not last as long as the box/package says. I kinda expected that though. Like how nail polish will say chip free? Yeah, no. Lol. Currently as a stay at home mom not doing any dirty hands in work like a mechanic it something, I have 4 of 10 nails in tack. I&#x27;m going to give these another try because the designs blow regular nail polish out the water. And for a special event, this are super affordable and quick.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product on various occasions because the ease of use and the results are always amazing!  I never fail to get a compliment on my nails when I use this product.  If you want a flawless result, it is imperative that you follow the easy step-by-step instructions otherwise the application will only last a few days and possibly &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; on your nails.  Only complaint I have is that they require some extra elbow grease to remove.</li>
    <li> I love these strips. They actually saed me a ton of work. I would buy them again. Love the versatility</li>
    <li> The cheetah pattern is my second set of Sally Hansen Salon Effects.  The twin value pack is a great deal on Amazon.  Though my nails are somewhat long, I was able to do both hands with one set, leaving me enough for a future application.  These are surprisingly easy to apply.  Just follow the directions and make sure you buff lightly and clean your nails thoroughly with nail polish remover before attaching the strips.  My nail beds are small so the strips were a bit large, but I was able to remove excess from the sides with the pointed tip of the orange stick that&#x27;s included.  Make sure you use the blunt end to smooth the strip to avoid wrinkles and bubbles. I finish with two coats of top coat to add shine and protection.  My last set lasted about 10 days and I got tired of them before they were badly chipped.  The adhesive is a bit difficult to remove.  Best to use remover with acetone.  Nails are left in great condition!</li>
    <li> I was bored with the basic patterns and didn&#x27;t want to spend money or time at a salon. I gave this product a shot and very pleased with the result. They look so real and i got lots of compliments on them. One down side of this product is that they SMELL bad, just like nail polish but worst and the smell continue to the next day. I had to open the door while putting this on because the chemical was so strong. First, I had difficulty putting them on to fit my nails because i have  small nails. Once i knew the trick, the rest was easy. I even cut one in half and used on 2 nails. They are like flexible stickers. You just put them on your nails one at a time and use the wooden thing it comes with to poke along the edge and tear them off. The results are different on my finger and toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger nails: They only lasted like 3 days for me. They got caught when I play with my hair or wash my hair ( I have really long hair). I also picking on them while watching TV (Bad habit). I also did some light cleaning like dishes or vacuum. They are not fading away, just I can&#x27;t help but pick on them. If you don&#x27; have this habit, it should last you longer than 3 days but I doubt its gonna be 10 days because we do lots of activity with our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toe nails: OMG they are fantastic (since they are hard to pick on). They are still there after one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I am very pleased with the result and will continue using this product on my toe nails since I can&#x27;t really smell the chemical as much. PS. Amazon has the best price around and it costs twice as much at a local drug store.</li>
    <li> This item shipped fast and came in a convenient package of two designs. The stickers adhere to your nails easily and you just file away the excess with the file provided. It comes off easily with nail polish remover! So many cute designs and less than the price of the salon!</li>
    <li> Usually my nailpolish doesnt last long. And chips on the second day. I really like these Sally Hansen salon effects, they last long and look great, I recieved a lot compliments while wearing them. Its a little bit tricky at first, or it was for me but after seeing some videos I find my own technique and the third time I use them, looked great.</li>
    <li> i love this combo because i have dresses in both of these patterns and they&#x27;re a fun accessory.  try it</li>
    <li> Although the packaging says twin pack, there is only ONE set that comes. When i received my \\&quot;value pack,\\&quot; it looked like a value pack, but when I opened it, I realized that one set of nail strips was already opened and used. So there is only ONE full set, NOT two.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME BUT SHIPPING TAKES FOREVER. AFTER ORDERNG THIS PRODUCT THE SHIPPING EXPECTANCY DATE WAS ABOUT 5 DAYS LATER. BUT I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT 7 DAYS LATER. I AM GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!! AWESOME PRODUCT EVEN THOUGH THE SHIPPING PRICE IS THE SAME AS THE PRODUCT, ALL TOGETHER THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS CHEAPER THAN IN STORES. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS PRODUCT, DON&#x27;T HESITATE ORDER IT. ITS WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> Package looked unopened, but strips were dry. This does make it much harder to apply them, and I have to say I was not thrilled. I have used these strips before, and they are great when fresher (not dry). Great pattern, speedy shipping, and decent price.</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions, and they started pealing up after one bath. Also, it took me forever to put these on. So much easier to paint them, but I understand the appeal of all the designs. Guess I just don&#x27;t have enough patience, and I was willing to get past that, but within hours they were pealing up. Just not a winner for me.</li>
    <li> Great price for a double pack ; )</li>
    <li> This stuck to the plastic covering. I found that if you wait a few hours, it gets a little drier and it&#x27;s easier to put on, but it stretches or rips as you peel it off... I bought these in a store and they were fine. You can&#x27;t really tell if they&#x27;re gonna work or not. Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting these for a while, finally got them for a great price but I cannot apply them unfortunately maybe I am doing something wrong but it looks like it not as easy as it supposed to be !</li>
    <li> I love this nail strips, they just look amazing, there is no way they last 10 days, but what I do is to apply clear nail polish and then they last a lot ! Rally easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had a hard time painting my own nails, so I bought stickers some where else and they look like children stickers. Someone recommend this product and I love it I bought  another one of these and the numbskull; I will stock up on these. This is a must by the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you still have spaces of your nail showing so I used nail polish to cover it in..... Again great product must by</li>
    <li> These prints are so much fun and are really durable. They are very easy to put on and look instantly good. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Im literally in love of this stickers so perfect and easy to use the shipping was little slow but Thank you so much Perfect Conditions and exellent product im very happy</li>
    <li> I LOVE these strips.  My mani is 9 days old and there is some wear on the very top edges but other than that, they&#x27;re still great.  Nail polish does not stay on my nails.  I wash dishes, take care of a baby and my day to day routine requires a lot of hand washing so polish usually chips/ruins in like 1-2 days.  These strips are way more durable.  They are easy to take off.  NOTE:  If you take them off by peeling them off as other reviewers have mentioned, you will peel some of the top layer of your nail off as well so that is not recommended.  Also, they do have the smell of polish straight out of the box and I find they need time to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and set up on your nail.  They are dry to the touch but I find they need a couple of hours to set and air out.  Also, if you plan on keeping the extras in the bathroom, I recommend putting the open ones in a ziploc because they are quite strong after sitting there a while and they dry out.  All in all, they are fabulous and I plan on buying a lot more.  No more chippy polish for me, although getting a manicure helps the strips to look really nice and neat.</li>
    <li> I carefully apply these being sure to press down the edges.  I put on a top coat and my nails look great for 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I thought I was only getting one of each design, which normaly you get 2 in each box. Turns out you do get the 2 in each box total steel! I got 6 different styles for $11.40 plus tax and shipping, if i had bought them in stores it would have cost me $65.70 plus tax. Do buy!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about these nail polish press on tabs, but they work great!  They apply easily and they&#x27;re easy to shape.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I love the sally hansen salon effects, I use them while on vacation instead of lugging around all my nail art supplies. I just wish there were more thin strips!</li>
    <li> I love these nail strips! They take minutes to put on and last for days, Plus my nails r small so i get two uses out of each box instead of just one.</li>
    <li> Got what I expected. Loved it. Going to keep ordering these because it makes painting my nails 100% easier! :D</li>
    <li> I have ordered several sets of Sally Hansen Salon Effects and find that they are great buys. These packs are much more expensive in retail stores and the online price is far more acceptable. They come with instructions on how to apply them and I have had no difficulty in putting them on. They look cute and I have received many complements when I have them. They last me between 1-2 weeks (I do not do any difficult work with my hands though, but I do wash them extremely regularly because of my work). I find that the quick application time is great, as when I apply regular nail polish I often end up smudging it because I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for it to dry completely. I do still put a top coat on top of these every time I apply a set. Additionally, most strips are long enough that you can use them for two nails if you cut them in half first (I do not grow my nails out too long, compare to your nail before you cut them so you don&#x27;t waste a strip). I find this way I get two sets of nails out of each set.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit difficult to remove and take a little more time to get off than regular nail polish, but considering the short application time I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I just bought some of these at my local Rite Aid today and I tried them out. They were difficult to get to stick to my nails and not long after I had applied them, they started to chip at the chips. I put some clear coat on them and for some reason they curled up at the top.</li>
    <li> The Kitty Kitty ones went on better than the wild child ones. I have found with these sally hansen salon effects the semi-transparent ones are more flexible and go one better. whereas the white one/white based designed aren&#x27;t as pliable and crack and don&#x27;t last as long. So I would shop for ones that don&#x27;t have a white base, try to go for ones that are semi transparent. They went on easier and lasted about 7-9 days compared to the white ones, like the wild child that lasted about 3 days before chipping.</li>
    <li> I got a box on clearance for less than 4 bucks at Target.I don&#x27;t see the pattern on Amazon that I got so maybe it&#x27;s discontinued, hence the price. It&#x27;s brown and gold snake skin pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were super easy to follow but the actual nail strips didn&#x27;t quite fit my nails to the \\&quot;t.\\&quot; I had to cut a small piece of strip on a few of my nails for a perfect fit and to fill in the gaps. The whole application lasted longer than I would&#x27;ve liked, at least 30 mins. Anyway, it lasted a good 2 days before i noticed the tip of my nails showing through the polish. By day 5 it chipping. After a week, I could peel off the polish with ease. Trying to remove the strip polish takes more effort than regular polish, so it&#x27;s probably a good idea to soak your nails in remover if you don&#x27;t want to rub and rub, and..rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very pretty on my nails though while it WASN&#x27;T chipping, and a great alternative since I don&#x27;t get my nails done at a salon. I&#x27;m gonna get a regular box next time, or just use the strips on 2 or 3 of my nails per hand. I hope that the box I got was a dud, because judging from the reviews these strips should last longer than a week.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using these and I LOVE them. They were super easy to apply and stayed put very well. I applied a matte top coat over them simply because I love matte nail polish but they had a nice sheen like applying normal nail polish. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tryed these !! Make sure your nails are clean and free of dirt and oils super important. Yes these do smell like real nail Polish because they are it&#x27;s not a sticker ,but yes in sticker form. ( look on their web site ) also apply a top coat to seal the edges. After wait a good hour before u shower to make sure they are fully dry let chance of lifting.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great variety, lasts for two weeks or more if you don&#x27;t mind that they grow out from cuticle. Cheaper than buying from Walmart, other brands or salon.</li>
    <li> These take a little know how to get positioned and applied correctly. However, end result is tres chic!  Lasts longer on toes than fingers. Better than polish stamps to achieve artwork look.</li>
    <li> These were almost impossible to apply to my nails! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I found a twin pack for only $5 when only one is usually $10 in stores. I would recommend this purchase to everyone.</li>
    <li> These are easy to put on. They last a while only if you&#x27;re not doing lots of dishes and cleaning. Though, to remove youll need pure acetone to be able to remove fast. I like to put them all on and even sometimes just on one nail or cut them and just on tips. Mettalic ones like the cheetah seem to last longer</li>
    <li> I used to paint my nails and the next day a nail was always chipped. I found salon effects and they last 10 days. They do not chip. I love this product. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen is the only brand I will use of these nail polish stick ons. They&#x27;re easy and last long and the prints are adorable!</li>
    <li> They say that these don&#x27;t chip for days. Haha that&#x27;s funny. Mine chipped in a matter of hours. They smell like real nailpolish and give you a head ache as soon as you open the box. And when you put them on, you have to smooth them out of else you get wrinkles in the polish. I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and super durable.  The package says 2 weeks but if you put a clear coat of polish over it lasts longer. I actually have to use polish remover then file the remaining sticker off! LOVE THESE!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay, don&#x27;t last very long when you work on a keyboard everyday but it is very easy to apply</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great price, but it seems that these are expired or had some heat damage? I&#x27;ve used many of this and got them from the store and all of them usually last me until my nail grow in, but this ones since the beginning, when ever I would try grabbing the sliver paper that is attached to the actual nail paint strip, it would rip and I would end up taking double the time to try to put them on. And also they didn&#x27;t last as long, as what I&#x27;m used too.</li>
    <li> THese were a splurge/experiment purchase and I actually really love them. We are going to have more girls&#x27; nights actually admiring our nails instead of painting and drying :) Great product!</li>
    <li> First off, don&#x27;t expect these to stay on as long as polish.  That is why I only gave them 4 stars.  That being said, they give a beautiful and unique look to the nails and I am a repeat buyer of the Sally Hansen nail wraps.  I have to use a tiny pair of sharply pointed grooming scissor to get the wraps to fit just perfectly, but you do get an assortment of sizes.  I also use the scissors to trim the ends of the wraps rather than filing the excess off.  When I try to file the excess, it pulls the wrap out of place.  I may not have the technique down just right.  My grown daughter talked me out of some of the wraps because she loved them so much, too.  I am 50 and she is 26, so you can see that these are appropriate for a wide range of women who love to show unique nails.  I have even switched up the patterned wraps to accent my ring finger and my 56 years old husband stated he loved the look!  Go figure!!!  I would recommend this product for a fun night out but not for a manicure that you want to last the whole week.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.The box said last 10 days it did.It was my first time using it, was a lil nervous . Anyone can do it.When finished they looked great.Just what I wanted.Saves you time and money.I even got a second order. Love...</li>
    <li> They take kind of awhile to put on, but are actually pretty easy. I was really doubtful about buying these but I&#x27;ll DEFINITELY buy them again. Not sure how long they are going to last, as I just put them on today, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I work at Subway and when I paint my nails with regular polish, they chip A LOT at work. These definitely are way stronger, and barely chip. If I didn&#x27;t work at Subway I think they would last even longer! AHHH these are the best.</li>
    <li> Very good price and easy to apply once you get the hang of it! I highly recommend this trendy product</li>
    <li> ok, ok, that was the worst joke ever, but seriously, these types of nail products are fabulous to have in your repertoire. Why? Because you can totally add some pizzazz to your nails by adding one of these little babies as an accent nail. It is awesome. believe me. Re-reading this review, I know I sound like Blanche from Golden Girls, but whatever-it is a super fun product. Buy as many of em as you can afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/29/2013: I decided to deduct a star from my original review because the boxes I have been opening are all dried out. There is no &#x27;use by&#x27; date listed on them, but be careful to get a fresh pack, or else they are just crumbly &amp; hard to work with. I still love them though.</li>
    <li> These 2 were the cutest of them all to me because I love animal prints, I will definitely reorder in the future</li>
    <li> very good price for two&lt;br /&gt;lasts long and very easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;will buy product agian.&lt;br /&gt;very cool</li>
