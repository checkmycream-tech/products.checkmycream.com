      <li>Have to believe it&#x27;s being enjoyed.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>awhile my favorite perfume was Juicy Coutoure Viva La Juicy, but this perfume has taken its spot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>MK Jasmine is now my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance</li>
      <li>It is a very clean but not overpowering smell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with his original scent!</li>
      <li>Love it... arrived in original packaging and safely packed.</li>
      <li>I like the nice and gentle floral scent of this perfume; it does not have an overpowering scent and can be used confidently even during the day.</li>
      <li>At first the scent is so nice when you spray it on</li>
      <li>Amazing, soft, lovely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fresh, so clean, SOOO youthful!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite scent for sure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alot of perfume for the price, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>Its original.</li>
      <li>Its a sweet smell, but not a sickley sweet.</li>
      <li>Anyone will be delighted to have this as a present,</li>
      <li>This is such a good deal rather than buying it from Macys or JCPenneys.</li>
      <li>another man actually committed that I smelled good.</li>
      <li>It is just described and shipping was fast :)</li>
      <li>I have Michael Kors Glam Jasmine and Sporty Citrus---they are both clean, crisp fragrances that aren&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I just got a small sample of this and it smells beautiful.</li>
      <li>Christmas will be a success.</li>
      <li>The price is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>I immediately had to have it because it smelled amazing &amp; lasted a long time on my wrist!</li>
      <li>Definitely one of my hot new favorite scents!</li>
      <li>I bought exactly what she told me to buy.  </li>
      <li>But it was exactly what was desired and requested.</li>
      <li>This stuff should have a warning sign, &amp;#34;warning: all men will do what ever you ask and will most likely never leave your side once you wear this!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Arrived today, in original packaging and very well packed for shipping, love this scent, will have to try some other Michael Kors now!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know as it was a gift.</li>
      <li>Fast arrival and quality product</li>
      <li>I wear it all the time and get compliments left and right!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re expecting a product that actually has the clean, fresh, romantic scent of jasmine- forget it.  </li>
      <li>I was able to buy this product from our local beauty store and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
      <li>Use it sparingly its potent Parfume (not like a EU de toilette) a little dab will do the trick for hours.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>like my perfumes to be loud, and floral and this is exaclty what it is.</li>
      <li>but then slowly I started to like this one better.</li>
      <li>Scent is exactly the same as more expensive bottles in store......</li>

<li> ; Seriously, this is no joke.</li>
<li> The scent lingers on for at least 5-6 hours!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

It&#x27;s my new favorite scent for sure.</li>

    <li> GREAT scent!  I love jasmine and this is not overpowering.  I hope Michael Kors keeps this one around for a long time!</li>
    <li> This stuff is kryptonite for men. I bought some for my fiancé and the moment I smelt it, I went blank. My nose and mind was flooded by this amazing smell. I have never smelled a smell quite like this one. This stuff should have a warning sign, &amp;#34;warning: all men will do what ever you ask and will most likely never leave your side once you wear this!&amp;#34; Seriously, this is no joke.</li>
    <li> my wife loves the smell! As well as her.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Arrived today, in original packaging and very well packed for shipping, love this scent, will have to try some other Michael Kors now!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my girl as a gift. She is very impressive.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re expecting a product that actually has the clean, fresh, romantic scent of jasmine- forget it.  This has the scent of bug repellant and some other scents not identifiable.  Very disappointed.  Would not recommend it.  Could have bought a can of &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34; and saved a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know as it was a gift. It was what she wanted but I never got to even smell it. But it was exactly what was desired and requested.</li>
    <li> I was able to buy this product from our local beauty store and I would definitely recommend this. The price is worth every penny. It smells so good, wonderful and  refreshing. MK Jasmine is now my favorite scent. Anyone will be delighted to have this as a present,</li>
    <li> Daughter loved it. That&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!!!  Wish there was lotion to go with it.</li>
    <li> smells great my girlfriend loved it</li>
    <li> I had gotten the Jasmine in a sample pack and absolutely loved it.  My husband got me a big bottle for Valentine&#x27;s day.  I have had so many compliments about the fragrance and inquiries of what fragrance it was.... My husband and I were out the other night and another man actually committed that I smelled good. lol  It is a very clean but not overpowering smell.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Better price than purchasing at Macys, or Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For awhile my favorite perfume was Juicy Coutoure Viva La Juicy, but this perfume has taken its spot.&lt;br /&gt;I like my perfumes to be loud, and floral and this is exaclty what it is.
