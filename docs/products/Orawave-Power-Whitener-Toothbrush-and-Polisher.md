      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I am so thrilled to find it, and I looked everywhere.</li>
      <li>so I ordered this inexpensive item with modest expectations but hoping for the best.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
      <li>it looked like the battery casing had been filled with vasaline!  </li>
      <li>OK, I thought, I&#x27;ll change the batteries....</li>
      <li>I like the brush attachment really well, it does a great job of cleaning your  teeth.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to pay more.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product after doing some research on the internet and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t see result until after many uses.</li>

      <li>I love coffee, so this is very helpful in keeping my teeth bright.    </li>
      <li>and I use the toothbrush head each and every day and do enjoy it and am glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>it is easy to control and does not \\&quot;run\\&quot; the way a brush with a circular motion might.  </li>
      <li>It shipped very quickly too.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been very happy with a little baking soda &amp; paste.  </li>
      <li>The vibrating cup moves smoothly on the tooth surface and then edges gently but effectively between the teeth to remove the hard-to-reach stains.  </li>
      <li>For the price range, just get a braun vitality and have something more useful and powerful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>An awesome little product for the money!  </li>
      <li>I looked and looked, then here at Amazon finially, success!  </li>
      <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t used it much as its not that powerful.</li>
      <li>Overall is good.</li>
      <li>It is a great little tool for cleaning your teeth in between dental checkups.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great little product.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised and pleased</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t touched this think in months because frankly, its not that useful.</li>
      <li>It would have been nice to get a couple of extra polishing heads.</li>
      <li>far as the polisher is concerned, it works okay for the price.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush proves you DON&#x27;T have to spend almost or over $100 for a power toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The product was priced incredibly right</li>
      <li>This is the closest I could find and the polisher works fairly well, but does not get a lot of the dark coffee/tea stains off.</li>
      <li>This is definetely not as good as getting your teeth professionally cleaned in a dentist office, but I guess may help a bit with minor staining on teeth.</li>
      <li>The Dental Mart was kind enough to send a new one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it every other day right now until I&#x27;m satisfied with the whitening.</li>
      <li>Ok so I will look around and find another, not that easy, they are hard to find.</li>
      <li>Drink lots of coffee and red wine and at age 60, teeth really get stained easily</li>
      <li>Does what it is supposed to do very well.</li>
      <li>Very effective at removing stains without irritating gums.  </li>
      <li>I had a tooth polisher that I dropped and broke, which I had used for years, so I thought I would go back to the store, I bought it from originally, and get another.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t provide enough abrasion or friction to clean teeth.  </li>
      <li>The vibration is enough to clean without worry of over use &amp; damage.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush part is OK although the bristles are a bit too hard for my teeth.</li>
      <li>This device completely solves that problem.</li>
      <li>Nearly dentist quality results inexpensively.</li>
      <li>That being said it is basically the only one in its class, so really if you need a polisher you don&#x27;t have another choice.</li>
      <li>Does not go fast enough to polish well</li>
      <li>The tooth brushes that come with this unit seemed a little large and stiff for me, but the round rubber polisher, which is what I looked so long for, works great!</li>
      <li>I had to use Pronamel toothpaste to calm down the sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of toothpaste &amp; baking soda mixture but just can&#x27;t afford expensive professional whitening.  </li>
      <li>It also is a bit tedious as the tip is quite fine and a bit under-stiff making it difficult to apply the right pressure to get it to work effectively.</li>
      <li>I like the clean slick feel of teeth like when they have been cleaned at the dentist.</li>
      <li>The need for disposable batteries just makes it even more of a poor choice as an electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I only use that part about once a week and my regular extra soft toothbrush the rest of the time.</li>
      <li>body is a bit odd to use since it isn&#x27;t very ergonomic</li>

<li> I used baking soda and water with the polisher and got a few stains off, but the problem was my teeth became SO sensitive to hots, colds, sweets and chewing in general for about 3 weeks.</li>
<li> I tried to use the polisher but not sure if it really works.</li>
<li> If you have hard to clean teeth, or are like mine with lots of bonding, just take a little baking soda and this polisher, and you will have clean slick feeling teeth in a few minutes.</li>
<li> I have a lot of bonding on my teeth and regular brushing does not clean them well enough for me.</li>

<li> Prior to getting this tooth polisher, by the time I got to the dentist for a cleaning I&#x27;d been walking around for weeks with less than sparkling teeth.</li>
<li> Perhaps they do work, but mine was a complete and total waste of money!!!</li>
<li> and it has a wide taper.&lt;br</li>
<li> and when I received the product, it did everything I expected it to do.</li>
<li> I had some stains on my front teeth and with a little toothpaste and a slight bit of baking soda mixed, the stains are gone.</li>
<li> won&#x27;t recommend this device for any reason other than that you&#x27;re in need of a polisher and are on a budget and/or have money to waste.</li>
<li> I had a small calculus region which I removed, but it was rough where it was;</li>
<li> I took a chance on this little polisher.</li>
<li> The battery compartment also had a missing piece, so it couldn&#x27;t be used at all.</li>
<li> It seems like a bad choice for an electric brush (the head size alone is enough to make me not want to use it).</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchase it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Drink lots of coffee and red wine and at age 60, teeth really get stained easily so I ordered this inexpensive item with modest expectations but hoping for the best.  It delivers on its promises and then some.  The vibrating cup moves smoothly on the tooth surface and then edges gently but effectively between the teeth to remove the hard-to-reach stains.  Re. earlier review that fretted over the vibrating cup - it is easy to control and does not \\&quot;run\\&quot; the way a brush with a circular motion might.  Very effective at removing stains without irritating gums.  All in - a great purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after doing some research on the internet and I am glad I did. The product was priced incredibly right and when I received the product, it did everything I expected it to do. It is a great little tool for cleaning your teeth in between dental checkups. I had some stains on my front teeth and with a little toothpaste and a slight bit of baking soda mixed, the stains are gone. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased and I use the toothbrush head each and every day and do enjoy it and am glad I purchased it. I would recommend it to everyone and again, the price is so good. It&#x27;s a great little product.</li>
    <li> I had a tooth polisher that I dropped and broke, which I had used for years, so I thought I would go back to the store, I bought it from originally, and get another. To my surprise they no longer carried tooth polishers. You can hunt for hours through all the brushes, but no polishers. I have a lot of bonding on my teeth and regular brushing does not clean them well enough for me. I like the clean slick feel of teeth like when they have been cleaned at the dentist. Ok so I will look around and find another, not that easy, they are hard to find. I looked and looked, then here at Amazon finially, success!  The tooth brushes that come with this unit seemed a little large and stiff for me, but the round rubber polisher, which is what I looked so long for, works great! I am so thrilled to find it, and I looked everywhere. If you have hard to clean teeth, or are like mine with lots of bonding, just take a little baking soda and this polisher, and you will have clean slick feeling teeth in a few minutes. I use mine every week, and love it!!!! Thank you Orawave. I would have given 5 stars, just for the polisher. I did not like or need the brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this unit with polisher and dual-head.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchase it.</li>
    <li> I bought this ONLY for the polisher tip. I had a small calculus region which I removed, but it was rough where it was; I wanted to address it. It seems like a bad choice for an electric brush (the head size alone is enough to make me not want to use it). The need for disposable batteries just makes it even more of a poor choice as an electric toothbrush. For the price range, just get a braun vitality and have something more useful and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body is a bit odd to use since it isn&#x27;t very ergonomic and it has a wide taper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the polisher is concerned, it works okay for the price. I honestly haven&#x27;t used it much as its not that powerful. It also is a bit tedious as the tip is quite fine and a bit under-stiff making it difficult to apply the right pressure to get it to work effectively. That being said it is basically the only one in its class, so really if you need a polisher you don&#x27;t have another choice. In the end, it helped a roughness somewhat after a lot of use and a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t recommend this device for any reason other than that you&#x27;re in need of a polisher and are on a budget and/or have money to waste. I haven&#x27;t touched this think in months because frankly, its not that useful.</li>
    <li> Good polisher for the price paid. Gave it 3 stars because the battery melted in the package. Overall is good.</li>
    <li> Comes with batteries pre-installed.   They leaked inside the package and got acid all over everything.  The battery compartment also had a missing piece, so it couldn&#x27;t be used at all.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool. I bought it for the polishing tip, but have used the brush and I like it too. I use a special compound for my teeth, but good old baking soda, salt and lemon juice make a great polish. It shipped very quickly too. You still need to floss, but this tool could almost put flossing out of business.</li>
    <li> I take some herbal concoctions that inevitably stain my teeth. Prior to getting this tooth polisher, by the time I got to the dentist for a cleaning I&#x27;d been walking around for weeks with less than sparkling teeth. This device completely solves that problem. BTW, you can get tip replacements from the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I have finally found my receipt!  I was looking forward to using this tooth polisher, but when I got it, NO POWER.  OK, I thought, I&#x27;ll change the batteries.... it looked like the battery casing had been filled with vasaline!  I tried to wipe it out and replace the batteries, but no luck!  Perhaps they do work, but mine was a complete and total waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I have always had a yellow film on my teeth. I&#x27;ve tried every kind of toothpaste &amp; baking soda mixture but just can&#x27;t afford expensive professional whitening.  I took a chance on this little polisher. I&#x27;m still trying to find a great paste/polish to use with it but I&#x27;ve been very happy with a little baking soda &amp; paste.  I&#x27;ve seen a vast difference in the yellowing &amp; my teeth feel 50X cleaner after 3 uses. The vibration is enough to clean without worry of over use &amp; damage. I&#x27;m using it every other day right now until I&#x27;m satisfied with the whitening. I also take care so that I don&#x27;t damage my gums. An awesome little product for the money!  And you get the bonus of the brush head also.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thing and when it came I requested a refund because it didn&#x27;t work.  The Dental Mart was kind enough to send a new one.  Once it arrived, it was determined that this just doesn&#x27;t work.  It looks like the device would have the brushes spin - which seems like it would work.  However, that&#x27;s not how it works.  Instead it just shakes back and forth.  This doesn&#x27;t provide enough abrasion or friction to clean teeth.  The bottom line is this thing doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush proves you DON&#x27;T have to spend almost or over $100 for a power toothbrush. It works GREAT!!     Your gums will be a bit soar, if you have never used a power toothbrush before, but only for a week or so. The cleaning results will not go un-noticed.    It also comes with a polisher. I love coffee, so this is very helpful in keeping my teeth bright.    A great power toothbrush at a great price. You don&#x27;t need to pay more.</li>
    <li> I like the brush attachment really well, it does a great job of cleaning your  teeth. the polishing cup im not so happy with, it doesnt spin it just vibrates which does not remove the stains etc. from your teeth with a dental paste for that purpose.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  Nearly dentist quality results inexpensively. Even the batteries are included. It would have been nice to get a couple of extra polishing heads.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist but I no longer am doing this profession. I was looking for a product that could polish my teeth the way I was used to doing for myself at the dental office. This is the closest I could find and the polisher works fairly well, but does not get a lot of the dark coffee/tea stains off. I used baking soda and water with the polisher and got a few stains off, but the problem was my teeth became SO sensitive to hots, colds, sweets and chewing in general for about 3 weeks. I had to use Pronamel toothpaste to calm down the sensitivity. I may have overdone it trying to get the stains off that never did come off. This is definetely not as good as getting your teeth professionally cleaned in a dentist office, but I guess may help a bit with minor staining on teeth. The toothbrush part is OK although the bristles are a bit too hard for my teeth. I only use that part about once a week and my regular extra soft toothbrush the rest of the time.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well for very long.  Does not go fast enough to polish well</li>
    <li> I had bought this to use as a polisher. Then my battery powered toothbrush broke and now I use this one as my toothbrush because it comes with a brush head. Works great &amp; does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I tried to use the polisher but not sure if it really works.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does what it is supposed to do very well. Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more. Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This product works o.k. You need to use a white toothpaste in order to see results. You won&#x27;t see result until after many uses. It&#x27;s o.k.</li>
    <li> Excellent I have 3 of them take the batteries OUT when you are not using I had battery acid everywhere but bought 2 more removes stain inbetween visits to DDS</li>
