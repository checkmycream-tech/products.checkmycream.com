<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this the last couple of days and so far I like. I&#x27;ve been using it on a cotton ball and wipe on my face after I wash it.  Feels soft I know that.  :)</li>
    <li> Good quality, and at a good price. I use this on my face everyday after washing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost exclusively as part of my DIY toner.  I&#x27;d use it for other uses if the bottle were bigger.  I&#x27;ve had the Rosewater from steam distillation of organic roses but those Rosewaters tend to be pricey and have expensive S&amp;H and although that is my preference it is a heavy cost for the budget buyer who is purchasing for personal, not commercial use (i.e. small business).  The Heritage Store Rose Petals Rosewater brand works in a pinch and  is very good for its price point.  My only quibble is that finding a larger size seems to be a challenge.</li>
    <li> Great product I Was Very Happy</li>
    <li> Lovely scent, but use this as a toner. Great price point and as far as I can tell great quality.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is part of my daily routine to freshen up and moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! I love how leaves my pores closed!! I&#x27;m now using it to clean my daugthers face and she loves it too, exellent product!!</li>
    <li> this water is ultra pure and soft. I mix it with alum for a cleansing and tightening regimen on my face.</li>
    <li> Love the rose water, I love the smell it relaxes me after a long day at work.</li>
    <li> I use this for making my own toner. I mix it weigh witch hazel and a tiny amount of glycerin. Smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful, I will order again, smells so heavenly, good for my skin, my hair etc. thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  I put this in a spritzer bottle and use it to set mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> Softens and balances skin when used as a toner. I have Rosacea and rose oil always calms my skin when I&#x27;m having a flare.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have made my own rosewater from garden roses but it does not even compare to this stuff. The smell is full and delicate. It leaves my eyes clear and bright after a long, puff inducing sleep and soothes the red out. I keep it in a little spray bottle and douse my face and neck morning and night after I wash it. It&#x27;s an incredible toner that tightens the skin without drying it. I also use [[ASIN:B005XP4YNQ Watts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben &amp; Alcohol Free / Multi-use - 60ml]] which keeps the skin super hydrated due to its ability to attract and store moisture. If I ever feel my skin getting a little dry during the day I simply give my face a few sprays of rosewater to remoisturize the hyaluronic acid and bring my skin back to the dewy glow that I love. This stuff is the real deal, the best quality I&#x27;ve ever found and it has so many uses and benefits. I love it.</li>
    <li> I adore this rosewater. It smells beautiful and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. I mix mine with a little witch hazel and spritz on my face, neck, and chest after my morning shower. I&#x27;ve also used it, watered down, as a hair rinse and love the soft subtle scent that lingers in my hair after.&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend that dilutes it 50/50 with distilled water and uses it as a linen spray. I plan to try that shortly when my current lavender linen spray runs out.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as it was described. My first experience using Rosewater as part of skincare routine. I LOVE IT. And I will most definitely buy this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> This really makes your hair grow.  I add some to Infusium 23 and my hair is growing like crazy.</li>
    <li> I just started using it as suggested by a friend, love Rosewater and this brand works well for me.</li>
    <li> I love applying it on my skin before going to bed. It&#x27;s refreshing, but I wish the rose scent lingers on longer on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would give it 3 stars because I expected the rose scent to be stronger.</li>
    <li> arrived on time.  great product</li>
    <li> Love it. Great as a body splash. Was in for a shock when it says in the fine print &amp;#34;recommended in the Edgar Cayce Readings&amp;#34; Never thought my body splash could be tied into the occult. Eek!</li>
    <li> This product is gr8 and has a very good aroma and natural. A good toner and it refreshes and calms my skin. This product suits my dry acne prone skin. Delivery was quick. Thanks to Heritage for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and its soothing as a face toner. I even put it on my baby.  Great! I wish the rose smell last longer</li>
    <li> I use this to spray in my room. It really relaxes me and I love the smell!! The smell doesn&#x27;t last long because it&#x27;s water but it&#x27;s nice to just breathe in for a minute.</li>
    <li> very nice item, smell very nice</li>
    <li> I like to use the rose water in spritzes when I do my twist outs. It leaves my hair, not only smelling great, but nice and soft. It also enhances the curliness of my twist outs. I&#x27;m ready to buy more of this!    The rose water sold by Heritage has no unnatural ingredients in it. There isn&#x27;t an artificial rose scent added to make it \\&quot;smell like roses\\&quot; while not containing actual roses. This brand uses mainly European roses -- I believe. It is also made organically. I was surprised, also, to not have an allergic reaction to this brand of rose water, when I have sensitivities to perfumes.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try rose water because I&#x27;ve heard a lot of things lately about the benefits of rose water and rose essential oils for skin. I searched through several different brands of rose water on Amazon.com before settling on this one based on reviews and price. I admit, I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product. The only ingredients are Vormag-water (water that the company says has been &amp;#34;vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t care about that, but perhaps some purchasers do), and Hydroessential Rose Flower Oil. I put it in a spray bottle and occasionally spritz a little on after a shower. It leaves a nice scent for a little while and seems to even leave my skin a little softer, but I can&#x27;t be positive. Other reviewers have mentioned that the bottle is unattractive, but I&#x27;ll happily take a plain plastic bottle if it keeps the cost of the product reasonable. I have enjoyed using the product and will probably purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love the scent; I bought it  for use as a facial toner, but it&#x27;s strong enough to use as a perfume splash.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time. It smells wonderful and works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful too. I use it as a toner.</li>
    <li> This rose water smells beautiful. It&#x27;s very subtle, but sweet. I sprits my face with it morning and night, after I clean my face with raw honey or coconut oil. I also sprits my armpits before I apply deodorant. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of rosewater! I mist my face with this morning and night. In the winter, I add a little glycerin for extra moisture.</li>
    <li> I spray it on my face and in my hair. It makes me feel rejuvenated! Good quality!</li>
    <li> spritz all over, love the gentle smell</li>
    <li> You can smell the roses!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive correct item; instead I got rosewater with glycerin in an atomizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still happy with product, chose not to return.</li>
    <li> I use the Heritage Rosewater in conjunction with distilled water for making DIY face serums.  It is especially nice in my DIY toner (distilled water, Heritage Rosewater, a few drops of geranium oil, a few drops of lavender oil, and two drops of honey).  I use this spray after applying my mineral makeup or when my face needs a bit of moisture.</li>
    <li> I use this in my families hair mositurizer and we all love it. My husband uses it more than anyone lol. But I will surely will be buying rose water again</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a spritzer/sprayer on top, like my original bottle had; but then I tried screwing my old top onto the new bottle, and it worked! So I was glad I had not thrown out my empty bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray my face w/it after shower, and when I go into public, people always sniff the air, looking for a bouquet of flowers; then they ask what I&#x27;m wearing? It has very pleasant fragrance, and makes people around me feel happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought/wear the &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; fragrance, and it has the same affect on me and the people around me.  calming and soothing.</li>
    <li> This rosewater is very nice. Lovely fragrance. Very light. Great for misting in your hair. I definitely plan to order it again :-)</li>
    <li> In my pursuit to find an affordable facial toner that I actually like, and to use more natural, sensitive-skin-friendly products, I stumbled across a few recommendations online for rose water. This discovery was particularly exciting for me as I have a strange (if not mildly freakish) affinity for rose-scented things. So whether or not this worked out for me as a toner, I would find it worth the $8 for something wonderfully rose. I ordered the 8oz bottle.  Delivery was fast with the product in perfect condition. I hold all rose-scented things to a certain standard: the smell must be comparable to Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s Rosewater products. Though it&#x27;s not *perfect* like Crabtree, it is indeed delightfully rose.  As a toner, it works. It lightly cleanses, freshens, and clarifies dry, sensitive skin. My face is not left feeling parched, just clean and ready for moisturizer.  It works during makeup application by helping to smooth and blend foundation and concealer. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but when I do, this product easily and seamlessly erases any trace of the dreaded \\&quot;orange line\\&quot; without smudging or wiping the makeup off. It just helps to blend. It&#x27;s also effective for cleaning up tiny eyeliner and mascara errors.  I&#x27;ve also used this in my hair with great results. I have quite curly hair, so I often wake up with the Medusa look and need to spritz my tresses to detangle and refresh my curls. I filled a small spray bottle with water, half rose and half tap. Now when I touch up my curls, I have the added benefit of that light, soft flower scent. How refreshing!  Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. The scent is good but overwhelming and only lasts for a second. The only real problem I had was how it arrived. The bottle was bent in and the safety seal was already half way off when i opened it.</li>
    <li> Love it and will order more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use as a face refresher and toner. I use it to calm my irritated skin, and also serves as a soft body splash. All natural!   The bottle is pink, the water itself is clear, but smells like a bouquet of roses. Great product!!! Great!</li>
    <li> tiene un olor muy bonito, se absorbe muy rapido es la primera vez que uso agua de rosas y creo qeu no lo voy a dejar ; )</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Use it on my face all the time with great results.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I love rose tea and can no longer find one brand that tastes just purely like rose petals...without any other flavors added to it.  I decided to purchase this and add it to my green tea.  It closely resembles the tea I used to drink years ago (brand forgotten).  If you like rose tea, this is perfect.  I have also used it on small acne break-outs which actually seemed to help! (I had read it on the internet as a possible treatment)..  Overall a good product for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Natural glycerine free as well and i love the smell, use it as a toner and after bath Allah and hair conditioner</li>
    <li> Great natural scent, love sparing it on my face before bed and in the morning, it makes a great &#x27;toner&#x27; !!  Will order again...</li>
    <li> i mix equal parts of the rose water and vegetable glycerin and rub into my extremely dry and cracked feet every evening before bed.  after 1 week this works better than the medication the doctor prescribed.</li>
    <li> This is a superb rose water, suitable for the body, rooms, and cooking.  I have tried dozens of rose waters and this is the best for quality and price.  If you are looking for a beautiful bottle to enhance your vanity table this isn&#x27;t it though.  Buy this product and pour into a beautiful container.  Other rose waters which cost five times the price and come in lovely glass atomizers have so far disappointed me in terms of the rose scent quality.  I trust this company to NEVER put anything other than high quality, pure rose absolut essential oil into this product with water. It is certified by periodic laboratory testing to be free of pesticide residues and it is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. And I refuse to use any other brand. It&#x27;s great for my skin and it&#x27;s great for my hair. I would highly recommend everyone to give it a try and for the price you really don&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is strong without being overpowering.  Good quality Rosewater.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my homemade vitamin-c serum.  Also use on my face after I get a shower.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Light rose fragrance, but does not burn. I use it twice a day as a toner. When I break out, I mix it with witch hazel to help with mild breakouts.</li>
    <li> I use this on my curly/wavy hair. It leaves it softer than distilled or tap water. I also mix it with aloe gel or juice if I&#x27;m looking to cut down on frizz. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> use this as toner and I love it! Smells great.</li>
    <li> Rose petal rosewater is great on my face after working out in the garden, I come in and clean my face and then use the rosewater to feel clean and refreshed. Not really a perfume, but the rosewater has a wonderfully light fragrance.  Rosewater is excellent as a facial treatment.  I have purchased from Heritage Store many times, and they put out a great product.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing for my hair and skin. Love the smell. I will use this on my natural 4b hair this winter!</li>
    <li> When I received my package I realized there was liquid in the plastic bag and the lake was discolored. When I took out out of the bag the top fell off and the seal was completely broken which explained why 25% of my product was missing our out of the bottle... the product didn&#x27;t seem to promising so I mixed out with some other products in hopes it will help...</li>
    <li> useful carrier for aromatherapy activities.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of other rose waters over the years, and never quite thought much of the fragrance. Recently someone suggested rose water to me again, so I went to Whole Foods and found this stuff.  The fragrance and the simplicity of the formulation has grabbed me. There is a depth to the fragrance that I did not notice in the other 2 brands.  I keep coming back to this for my face, as a base for moisturizing, and as a finisher after I have \\&quot;made up.\\&quot;  I spray this in my son&#x27;s hair. I use it on my body, and on the linens. The fragrance reminds me of my dear Nonnie&#x27;s heritage roses, and has been a hopeful uplift during these last lingering days of winter. I can only hope that the mag vortexed water that carries the scent is subtly working wonders on my skin. My DH raises an eyebrow at this, but I don&#x27;t care. I am glad that someone out there is forward thinking, and I like thinking about the possibilities for goodness that this water brings to my daily life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this brand a few days, but it works just as well as one of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used. The scent is light and fresh. It arrived on the expected delivery date with  intact packaging. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> as far as rosewater goes I would guess this is as good as any.  I use it to make a facetoner</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> It smells like an entire vase of roses.  It is light, yet, full.  I have only had it two weeks.  Hopefully, my review will not change.</li>
    <li> I use this product in the winter time.  I find that it is not as harsh or drying like the other brands.  I only use it on my face. I can&#x27;t imagine ingesting it but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful rose smelling air spritzer which smells very natural and not artificial or soapy like some chemical-laden air freshener. I also use it as a linen freshener before I make my bed, and its wonderful as a room freshener. I love all of the Heritage products and also have been using their Aura Glow body oil for around 22 years and never found a reason to use anything else. I&#x27;ve been using this rose air freshener for around 10 years. Absolutely wonderful !!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product I use it in my hair. Its healthy and it smells wonderful too. Between you and I, I&#x27;ve used it as a quickie perfume too. In that capacity it&#x27;s not an all day thing but the first couple of hours got me complements.</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater. I use it as a facial toner and add it to my hair oil with glycerine. It gives my face a great glow and smells great. My face looked so much much smoother on the first day! I will definitely be buying this again</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> Pricey, but effective. Delicious, potent rose fragrance lingers on hair and skin days after use.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smell and exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> A lovely rosewater, but the smell is fleeting - perhaps because it&#x27;s made from oils but then diluted with water rather than just being essential oils/extracts from petals? I don&#x27;t know - this was a hypothesis given to me by my masseuse who swears by roses&#x27; purifying powers. In any case, it&#x27;s totally benign and has not stained anything - I spray it all over my face and neck when I need to switch gears from one mode to the next. Highly recommend and less expensive on Amazon than at Whole Foods.Beware, however, that it does NOT come with a sprayer - that you&#x27;ll have to rob from one of your existing bottles or buy separately.</li>
    <li> really love this toner. Use it in the evening after cleansing and in the morning instead of a cleanser to wash off the cream after a night out and to make skin tone. I especially like that after rosewater on my face appears flushed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this rose water at my local health food store, and I must say I am impressed! It has a wonderful, fresh, almost citric rose aroma, and is incredibly anti-inflammatory both in my eyes and on my skin. It also seems to refine pores. As for a flavoring for food, I&#x27;ve never tasted another rose water, but I would love to try this one!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, shipped quickly, and I received exactly what I was expecting.  I use this rose water in conjunction with a serum. The serum is great for my skin, but leaves it just a bit tight after it fully absorbs. I apply a bit of the rose water after the serum, and it refreshes, locks in some moisture, and prevents that tight feeling from occurring. Also, smells divine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing to spray on my face after a long workout or just have in my purse on a hot summer day.  It&#x27;s so refreshing and it&#x27;s a natural toner.</li>
    <li> Excellent shipment.  Like the way it feels on the skin nice and cool.  The smell is very lite and only lasted for a minute.  It would have been nice if it lasted a little longer.</li>
    <li> Rose water and glycerin - I mix about 1/4 rosewater to 3/4 glycerin (bought both on Amazon) - I use it as a moisturizer when I get out of the tub - or to clean my face in the morning. It&#x27;s easy t apply with a spray bottle.  Both are good, natural ingredients - good for my skin and a pleasant reminder of happy childhood days spent with my Mamaw.</li>
    <li> I use this product to moisturize my skin.  I also like to spray my linens with this before ironing.  The fragrence is long lasting.  Some of the products on the market that you can find are artificial and the fragrance does not last.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use as tonic water for my face.  The smell is very rosy and lovely.  The water itself is very mild because my skin has no reaction at all unlike other tonic water.  Although I don&#x27;t see the difference in my skin from using this tonic water, I like the smell and it&#x27;s very pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from such a simple ingredient but I think this stuff has really turned around my skin.  And it smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this rosewater by itself, with witch hazel, and with witch hazel and glycerin.  Each time my skin has come out touchably soft.  My pimples have dried out faster, and my skin just looks better.  Plus, now that I&#x27;ve started using this, I can add other skin care products to my regimen and I don&#x27;t break out like crazy, which was the result before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I read a review for Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosewater &amp; Glycerin toner that explained the benefits of using toner.  It convinced me to finally get this rosewater to make my own toner.  Before that, I had been planning to buy rosewater for some time because I read that French women spritz it on their face to keep moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my skin could talk I think it would say it loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is great Rosewater. It smells lovely and worked perfectly for my homemade facial care recipes. It does not smell perfumey or fake. The rose scent is ideal and not too overpowering. I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing  i switched from the Moroccan  rose  water and this stuff works just as good</li>
    <li> The product is what i expected.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy some rose water after hearing of its many uses. The scent is incredible and brings back childhood memories of smelling the roses in my grandpa&#x27;a garden. I&#x27;ve been using it with distilled water as a facial toner and it makes my skin refreshed and smoothed. I&#x27;ve also used some in my hair and it makes it really shiny. The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t overpower. Rose water is definitely my new product addiction</li>
    <li> This product has a very nice scent and I use it as a natural air freshener. I originally got it to use as a toner and to add to my face masks, but it is nothing special for either. it is the same as using regular water. so it is useless as a toner, but nice for a natural fragrance.</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best deal out here for this product! Can not live with out this, poured some on a little spray bottle so i can always keep it with me in my purse. Delicious and refreshing</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! This is my first time using Rosewater, and I will be a lifer. My skin shows improvement after using it only two times as a facial toner. Already less oily, less flaky, smaller pores, acne diminishing. My skin feels so soft. I am not a big fan of the rose scent in general, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and definitely worth all the benefits.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my rose water. I&#x27;d never used it before. I was planning on putting it on my hair (mixing it with my hair products).     It really does smell good. I would say soooort of like roses lol. And it made my hair smell really good.     But all in all, its just water. I just bought some nice smelling water lol. And I knew that from the beginning, but its all so special until you get it. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Really good smell. Authentic rose water. Use with sandalwood powder on face for baby soft skin :)  will buy again</li>
    <li> Bought this because of all the good reviews I read about this product. Smells good, seems to make my skin on my face feel very smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> good value. keep my skin refreshed. the smell is nostalgic.</li>
    <li> I spray this in my hair and on my face.  It is refreshing and the scent reminds me of the scent of roses wafting in the air when you walk by a rose bush on a beautiful summer day.  This product is intented for angels and butterflies only.</li>
    <li> If you want to purchase this for the smell, then its a great product... It really does smell good, but for me it didn&#x27;t work for the reason I bought it for.  I was told by couple people that rose water works great to reduce redness on the face for breakouts.  Didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
    <li> I have bought like 3 of these already. I mix it with ACV and it does wonders on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like this Rose Water smells really good I use it with my oils for my hair and skin I wish the smell would last longer though.</li>
    <li> this stuff is terrific!!!! the older middle eastern women in my family always told me to use rosewater on my skin to tone (we use it a lot in flavoring dishes and desserts too) but I always would rather buy stupid expensive store cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;i bought some recently from my sprouts supermarket after reading some reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower and sprayed some on my face and hair. i love the fresh and angelic smell of it so i sometimes use a little too much before bedtime. i have been so busy lately that i did not even notice that within a few days of using this stuff my face has almost like no damn blemishes!!! i stopped using moisturizer on my dry flaky cheeks and chin because this stuff left me as soft and dewy looking as a rose. the other day i was going out and went to put some makeup on and i glanced in the mirror and was like oh shoot, i dont even need it hahaha. and it leaves my curls with no frizz and super soft so it easy to skip other nasty hair products.&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is so wonderful and i am adding it as a must have in my beauty regime now. plus it smells sweet and is all natural. should have listen to my grandmas and aunts a long time ago lol.</li>
    <li> I mix this with aloe vera juice, a bottle of rosewater with glycerin, spring water and this bottle of rosewater. Works great to moisturize my hair daily and then I seal with jojoba and caster oil and my shea butter. Smells great but the scent does not last long. I have been using for about 2 months and my hair loves this much better than just plain water. My daughter took my first batch so I had to purchase another one for myself. Great for if your hair is in braids too.</li>
    <li> This rose water makes an excellent facial toner.  It minimizes pore size, softens the skin, and gives off a radiance. Also, the rose water is refreshing on the skin.  The aroma of roses is smells natural and does not have a overly pungent manufactured scent.  I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough how much I love this product. It is great for makeup application, it is great to spray on your face to give it a dewey appearance after foundation application, it is great to spray all over o a hot muggy day after a cool shower, it can be used a a fragrance, I use it conjunction with underarm deodorant, and have used o my hair as heat protectant. I hated the scent of rose fragrances before I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a princess when I use this/ as a finishing spray,  used as a substitute for mac finishing spray....just smells better</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and tons of uses</li>
    <li> Came fast, smells great, thank you TOTALLY satisfied!</li>
    <li> My bottle did not come with a spritzer came as shown in the picture. The rose scent is nice but I was not overly impressed. I used it as a toner and in the bath. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin and the scent gets lost when put into a bath.</li>
    <li> I use rose water to wash my face and as a carrier for products such as oils that I want to spray on my hair (mix rose water with a few drops of oils in a glass spray bottle and shake vigorously every time before you spray your hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff most definitely smells like rosewater, so I assume it is and isn&#x27;t some ripoff fake stuff that tries to pass off as some kind of heavenly aromatic rosewater made from the petals of thousands of roses that gave their life just so you could wash your face in it. In fact, I subtracted half a star because it smells so strong that it&#x27;s almost too much. The smell does fade quickly. Should I put half a star back on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other half star that I took off is because of the very weird stuff on the bottle about how the rosewater was made and what it&#x27;ll do for you. It sounds like woo and not like science, and woo always gets stars knocked off of products.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and feel of this rose water.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it daily!</li>
    <li> I mix this product with sweet almond oil to moisturize out of the shower.  Feels and smells great!!!  (If you do mix it, you have to shake it before use since it is oil and water mixed).  The rose smell is perfect and quite enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Just like this rose water, amazing smell</li>
    <li> For those of you that use Wen you will find this rose water as a good alternative when your favorite replenishing mist is sold out. Mix a few of your favorite essential oils and your hair will smell lovely.</li>
    <li> Very nice fresh rose scent. I think it would work well as a room spray, skin spritzer, or linen water.</li>
    <li> I use this mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar and Witch Hazel for a toner. It makes it smell better and makes my skin soft. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because a little had leaked out during the shipping process.</li>
    <li> I spray this on everything! I even mix it with my vitamin C. Love it. I go through several bottles a month. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and I like how it makes my skin feel.  I am on my second bottle and will be buying more when that is gone.</li>
    <li> It was not at all helpful to my skin. I am a person that used to look for answers to skin problems and this was not it. I found my answer but, it is not Rosewater. This sits under my sink and maybe i&#x27;ll mix it with my Indian clay or something. May work for some but, not me.</li>
    <li> I use this as a base for my home made hair tonic. I mix a bottle with glycerine, and several drops of lavender, rosemary, and tea tree oil. It keeps my hair soft, shiny, moisturized, and tangle-free.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. I have been using it for years to spritz on my face throughout the day when my skin feels dry or oily and I don&#x27;t have time to wash it, and it&#x27;s very refreshing. I also use it after I apply my makeup to set my powder foundation. It smells lovely. I can&#x27;t handle &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; perfumes (not that this product is really trying to be a perfume at all) because I am sensitive to strong, lingering scents, and they usually give me headaches. So I use this instead for a natural little spritz of scent that is refreshing, lifts my spirits, and isn&#x27;t too strong. Makes me happy. And no chemicals or yucky stuff that I try to avoid.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time  Great price and timely delivery</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dual-purpose rose water and I have realized, after the fact, that what I really need is a true hydrosol. Since I read the consistently high ratings for this brand at the time, though, and the budget friendly price, I decided to go with this one. I received it yesterday and used it last night in my face cleaning routine. The smell is okay. Maybe I just don&#x27;t like roses as much as the next person. It was by no means offensive, but I personally wouldn&#x27;t want to wear a perfume that smelled like this. I transferred this into a fine-mist spray bottle and spritzed it on after cleaning my face and neck and applying Hyaluronic Acid, and before my moisturizer. Since I have several steps in fighting the melasma, wrinkles, and adult acne, my face gets dry by the time I&#x27;m ready to put on my moisturizer. I will definitely continue to use it, as it does seem to keep the dryness at bay while I go through my routine. It is refreshing on the skin and I had no negative reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;For the dual-purpose part: I had Lasik eye surgery 10 years ago and I&#x27;ve been suffering from extremely dry eyes for about two years. I wanted something without all the synthetic ingredients that all the OTC drops have. Many people have commented that rose water drops are very good for dry eyes. Turns out, this rose water is just distilled water with rose essential oil added. I need to do some further research, but I don&#x27;t think this is going to work. For skin moisturizing purposes, though, it&#x27;s fits the bill.</li>
    <li> I have never used rosewater before, but I actually used a few drops in some lemonade and was very impressed. Lovely scent.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but seemed like mostly water with some Rose ingredient.  Not quite strong enough, but, I will still use it and it fades quickly, but maybe not meant for cologne.</li>
    <li> Have bought this several times over the years. Smells great! I will add to bath water or splash on face/hair. The only downside is the scent seems to fade quickly but smells heavenly before it fades. The bottle used to come with a sprayer top which I like better than the &amp;#34;squeeze/pour out&amp;#34; top it has now.</li>
    <li> great water, I use it every day before the cream, it make me feel refresh and l like the smell, not strong but nice.</li>
    <li> I use this rosewater blended with facial oil as a moisturizer. It smells wonderful, and I prefer it over most expensive hydrosols I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product smells divine!</li>
    <li> smells great and has a lot of great benefits.</li>
    <li> I always heard a lot about rosewater and how good it is for the hair. I tried this product and didn&#x27;t notice softer or more manageable curls. My hair just felt the same. I think aloe vera juice is much better than this.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, I use it in a body cream that I make, works perfectly.</li>
    <li> My favorite rose water that I am never without. The smell is so perfect. Great for cleansing the face and body. Refreshes the spirit as well.</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater. It&#x27;s very fragrant and light and feels great on the skin. I do decant it into a small spray bottle so I can spritz onto the skin. So refreshing on a hot day or when you go to the beach.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of roses and this water has just the right amount of fragrance. I keep a spray bottle at home and at my office.</li>
    <li> First off I LOVE the smell of this rosewater! I would mist it on my face and body as a toner after showers.  As refreshing as it felt on my skin I did start breaking out.. I do have sensitive skin, so alcohol and drying agents really irritate my skin. I give it 3 stars just as a honest review  because it didn&#x27;t work well for me and my skin.</li>
    <li> Clears, softens, and tones my sensitive skin. I needed something bc everything else I have ever tried is either too expensive (Clinique) or ineffective.</li>
    <li> I purchased the rose water during my transition from relaxed hair to natural hair. It smells good, but I didn&#x27;t find it to make a difference if I used it or not.</li>
    <li> smell great. i always feel like i&#x27;m in the garden.</li>
    <li> I am new to rose water and find I enjoy the fragrance and use it to freshen up skin and over makeup to set foundation</li>
    <li> Packaging was not done very well but I love the product. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> So good to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is like a gorgeous Rose Garden.</li>
    <li> This is just what i was looking for - a natural rosewater to use as a facial toner. It smells fantastic - just like roses - and will last a long time. It feels really nice on my skin and doesnt cause any irritation. Shipping was also fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I got this so I can have a natural scent and use it in my homemade cleaning products. This product is light and fresh! I am in love! The color comes from the bottle there is not pigment added to this product. It is sweet, light and lasts for an extended period of time. A little goes a long way and I like that it can be used instead of essential oils. A+ product and price. We will be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosewater as a toner and as an additive to my bathwater and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s a very refreshing toner if you&#x27;re not looking for an astringent (it&#x27;s not drying like witch hazel) and a small amount adds a beautiful fragrance to bathwater. If you&#x27;re looking to add rosewater to your beauty routine, this is an excellent, affordable option.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Rose water, and this is a great brand for the price. My new favorite use for Rose water is to rinse my hair with it after I shampoo/condition in the shower. Just pour a capful or so over my wet hair and it makes my hair crazy soft! I spray it on my daughters long hair before bed too, it feels like an indulgent little nighttime luxury even though it&#x27;s not expensive at all. And our hair is soft and pretty smelling :)</li>
    <li> No problems with ordering or receiving this product !!</li>
    <li> not sure about the vor-mag water used as described by the Heritage Store, but this rosewater smells great and works well as a facial toner, which is why I purchased it. Yeah the bottle is kind of cheesy, but I don&#x27;t care about that. I want the product itself, which meets all my expectations. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is not rosewater by itself.  It has a bunch of other stuff in it.  I didnt realize this when I ordered.  I was looking for rose water only as I use it on my face as a toner.  You cannot do this with this product as it also has oil &amp; other stuff.  I would say this would be more like a splash</li>
    <li> Good product.  Smells nice and makes my skin feel fresh  I splash on my clean face and immediately apply glycerine and let it assorb while I dress and then massage in and blot off any excess.  Only items I use for moisturizing</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into rose water, and while initially I thought it to be nice for both face and flavoring, it turns out this is not REAL rose water at all. Authentic rose water comes from the distillation process of making rose oil as a pure byproduct. Heritage &amp;#34;rosewater&amp;#34; is simply distilled water with rose oil added - NOT the same thing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After visiting some Indian and Middle Eastern markets and purchasing the REAL thing, the scent, performance and flavor of the Heritage product doesn&#x27;t compare at all. Do yourself a favor and buy a $3 bottle of 100% natural distilled rose water and experience the difference. Reading the labels is paramount.</li>
    <li> works great on sunburns, peeling skin, dry skin or if you will mix it with apple cider (with the mother) you will have a great skin spritz!  try it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for the summer. I&#x27;m not a fan of perfumes for the way that they linger. This rosewater is a nice refreshing boost when you&#x27;re feeling overheated or kinda greasy. I started using it when I was working in a kitchen and would spritz it on after my shift to smell less like cooked meat. People have complimented me on it&#x27;s light scent so it must be working.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for the sake of creating my water-aloe vera juice-rosewater mixture for my hair, and this product has not failed me yet! It has a very pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t very overpowering unless you have a sensitive nose.</li>
    <li> Used this rosewater and added 1 drop of chamomile essential oil as an eye soak for an infection of my lids.  It was gentle and soothing . I found it cheaper at a natural food market.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. added to my moisturizer it left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> Love this. Rosewater smells divine. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> So far its helped my skin stay moisturized. I use different things for my skin when it comes to cleansing it. This is a good alternative to witch hazel and my apple cider vinegar mixture.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water! I have natural hair so I use the Rose water to &#x27;refresh and wake up my curls&#x27; each day. Keeps my hair well hydrated and soft to touch. It&#x27;s also a great body spray and good for the skin. Smell is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money you pay for it! It may be more cost efficient if you by rose fragrance and add it to your own water mixer for spritzing your hair to keep it moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural toner. It is mild and refreshing. My husband uses it for oily skin and my skin is dry so it is great for all skin types. The fragrance alone is refreshing. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I use this as a facial toner and I love it. It has a soothing smell and can be used for aromatherapy. It&#x27;s two ingredient make it simple and trustworthy to use all over your body in a bath or steam. Since I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, I&#x27;ve noticed a more even skin tone and softness to my skin. This restores your skin&#x27;s natural PH balance. Also works great as a makeup setter!</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s my new favorite toner. I have acne prone skin and this does not make me breakout. It actually lightens my acne scars a bit. My favorite and the smell is not too strong. I love it.</li>
    <li> The label says its water + rose water essential oil.  This is NOT rose water, nor is it digestable.  AVOID!</li>
    <li> tHE ROSE WATER REALLY SMELLS VERY GOOD AND ALSO GOOD ON SKIN WHEN MISED WITH MULTHANA MUTTI AND IT WAS SUITABLE FOR MY SKIN TOO.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, which I use as a toner with a cotton ball after washing.  It&#x27;s gentle for my face for I have sensitive skin but am prone to breakouts.  Also, if you want a subtle scent to spray on before bed with your sweetie, this is it: The scent wont last so do it just before bedtime because it&#x27;s not a perfume but as I said a subtle scent.  I carry a small bit in a spritzer in my purse, too, to freshen up throughout the day for hydration.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either:  I&#x27;ve paid this much for just 4oz at wholefood stores.  Nothing is more feminine and gentle than rosewater, and I&#x27;m not an old lady but European, and we love our lavender, rose, lilac and other floral waters because we don&#x27;t tend to like harsh products and toners.</li>
    <li> This product ...rocks!!!</li>
    <li> The container design is daggy as all get out, but the product inside is lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really smells wonderful and makes a great toner or just a refreshing spray to use to spray yourself with all over on a hot day or when you feel a bit ill. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it in cooking as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice spray bottle too, it works well and never clogs. A glass bottle would be healthier to use but would add a lot to the cost I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for products that say rose water but are really made with synthetic fragrances. This one is the real deal but some others are not! The synthetic versions are horrible, and taste awful if you ever spray it near your mouth accidentally too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds&#x27; Foundation for M.E.</li>
    <li> Best rosewater out there!</li>
    <li> Love this! Better than any other toner for my face!</li>
    <li> I used this in my hair, but it seemed to make it tangled and nappy. Sprayed it on my face and besides smelling like roses, it was no more effective than plain tap water. Wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I tried it though.....</li>
    <li> I had heard ladies talk about spraying rosewater on their hair but never purchased it until now.  I plan to use it in a body spray mix.  This water has a VERY strong petal smell. It smells so fresh!  I will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t real rosewater. It is something called \\&quot;Vor-mag Water(water that has been vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration that we believe to be more beneficial) and Rose Damascena (Hydroessential Rose) Flower Oil\\&quot; as listed under ingredients. Seeing as oil and water don&#x27;t mix without a binder this is also a waste of money and false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would probably explain why this product hasn&#x27;t worked for me. I have used rosewater based products like Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Alcohol-free Witch Hazel toner which has rose water as the first ingredient with great success, but this doesn&#x27;t work form my acne-prone sensitive skin at all. The only thing I can say for it is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but then again neither does tap water. If you plan on buying rose water and you aren&#x27;t familiar with the brand or product I would suggest you look at the ingredients beforehand, otherwise don&#x27;t bother purchasing it at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this rose water because of the good reviews but I was shocked when I saw the ingredients and actually smelled the product. There is nothing natural about it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like rose water and it doesn&#x27;t feel like rose water.&lt;br /&gt;It was big disappointment and waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use real steam distilled rose water on a daily bases, so I know how it smells. The real rose water I buy has only one ingredient and that is steam distilled flower water. The Heritage Rose Water is not supposed to be called rose water at all. I have very sensitive skin and would not use this questionable product on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m using for facial toner. Thank you, Heritage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant scent, and multipurpose which is what I&#x27;m all about.</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven. I use it as an astringent. Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling and makes me feel like I&#x27;m giving my hair a treat!</li>
    <li> this rosewater is lovely! im shocked there is negative reviews! if you dont like the smell of wild roses- dont buy it! this is a very floral-y sent. smells just like \\&quot;fresh cut roses\\&quot; Yankee candle. for me i love it. i use it as a body spray and got so many complements. also works great to set my makeup. definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a rose water toner from Sephora for $ 38, it smelled nice and I liked how it felt on my skin. I however felt like it was totaly overpriced, I am glad I found this product on amazon. as the smell compared to the almost 4 x more price is amazing. It really smells like so many other reviewers stated amazing like you walk past a rose bush. It feels great on my skin and I definitly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful smelling toner for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con was that it did not come with a spray nozzle, it was a bit confusion as some reviews stated they spritzed it on , so I expected it to come with a spray nozzle, but I went to a local beauty store and refilled it and voila&lt;br /&gt;it works amazing.</li>
    <li> I have the most sensitive skin in the world...I break out in rashes if I use something new to the point it looks like I have some sort of disease. It&#x27;s really terrible. But this stuff is great. I love the smell of it, I completely trust the ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin...it&#x27;s one of my beauty products I can&#x27;t live without. If you have sensitive skin, or acne, or anything like that, try this stuff as a toner. I put it on when I get out of the shower and then apply moisturizer. You will love it!</li>
    <li> This is no longer manufactured by Heritage House -- it&#x27;s now manufactured by something called &amp;quot;Seychelles Organics, Inc.&amp;quot; and it&#x27;s no good anymore. There&#x27;s no rose scent whatsoever -- it&#x27;s just plain water. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t spend money on this now. It&#x27;s just like plain spring water in a spray bottle. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I adore the scent of roses. My family has a special connection to it, and it always makes me smile. There is a very calming quality to the scent, which is probably why people use it in aromatherapy. Heritage Products has a wonderful product in their rose water. It has a delicate note to it, without being overpowering. What&#x27;s more, if you are having a skin allergy/redness of any kind, just dab a small amount on a cotton ball, and it resolves your issues, while leaving you feeling as fresh as a rose garden. I like to drip a few drops on my clothing, and my pulse points. Highly recommended and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells like roses, which is pretty much all I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;Clean light scent for body/hair etc</li>
    <li> This rosewater smells exactly like what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s not powdery at all. I use it as a toner after oil cleansing my face. I want to put it in my spritzer bottle next.</li>
    <li> This smells very good. It has a very light rose scent. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. It is a great addition to your home made masks, as a cleanser and toner. Love the beautiful smell and it not harsh on your skin. Did I mention it smells great?</li>
    <li> l purchased this for misting my skin after derma rolling and moisturizing with hyaluronic acid.  It is fabulously scented, yet light and refreshing.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Its good.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a couple of bottles. Its good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money spent :-) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try it.</li>
    <li> I has a very strong rose fragrance.  And it really works as an astringent.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve owned it for over a year and still have almost a full bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> great for use in facial toners and washes.  pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I spray this on after cleansing face, then apply moisturizer. Do not have to use as much moisturizer. Also great to spritz on face during the day for hydration and for spraying on hair or body before bed. Use on bed sheets as well!</li>
    <li> Rose water is so good for your skin and smells heavenly.  This is a good quality and I use it as a facial toner (I do add some essential oils).  It leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated.  I have purchased this particular rose water many times and just love it!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of rosewater. It&#x27;s so clean and refreshing. It reminds me of the country with a garden full of roses.</li>
    <li> This product smells great ... at first. But the smell fades quickly. I was hoping to use it as a body spray but I don&#x27;t think it lasts quite long enough for that. However, it truly does smell just like a rose.</li>
    <li> I was looking for rose water that wouldn&#x27;t brake the bank, I am glad I found this brand it smells heavenly. I put it in a spray bottle for whenever I need a pick me up. Great for your face too</li>
    <li> Received quickly, packaged to not leak. Ordered to complete a toner receipe I have. I like the fragance and enjoy the feel on my face. The price was the selling factor at first, I would order again.</li>
    <li> The item arrived and my husband and I could not understand what the awful smell was in our house. Needless to say, when I opened the box, the water had leaked out of the bottle. This rose water smells awful and does not do anything but make your face smell bad. I will not be purchasing again. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this to add moisture to my dry hair.  Its suppose to add strenght and shine.  I havent seen either result, but I like it better than using water to re-wet my hair as I roller set.  It also smells just like roses!</li>
    <li> I have always used rose water for lots of things. It&#x27;s great for facials, mixed with other ingredients of course. If you look up rose oil &amp; rose water on your computer you will find lots of info about it. And again, I trust this brand.</li>
    <li> Must have. Makes my very sensitive skin soft without any burning or breakout. Mild and genital. Smell is soft not strong at all. Rosewater is one of the best for your everyday skincare.</li>
    <li> Wonderful rose smell. Great for homemade skin toner and perfume.</li>
    <li> I know that people say (and my local health-food grocery swears) that this is edible, but it makes my tongue feel tingly and numb, even when diluted 50% with water. Recommend Cortas brand instead for cooking. This is fine for external use only.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used this for years. I have sensitive skin so this is great to as it does not dry or irritate.</li>
    <li> I recently went natural and I purchased loads of essential oils to mix w/my shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the recommendation on some one else.... have not used yet!&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS GOOD!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and I put this in a spray bottle to refresh my curls every morning.  Not a strong smell, does not weight hair down nor does it makes your scalp greasy.  Most important of all, cheaper than purchasing expensive curl refresh spray that does all of the above.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use this after I cleanse my face, and it is amazing how it has helped my skin. I love the smell as well, like a fresh cut &amp;#34;real rose&amp;#34;. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Used in my homemade lotion!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the ugly container fool you, this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Many different ways to use this.&lt;br /&gt;As a toner after cleansing and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;As a refresher (decant into a spay bottle and mist).&lt;br /&gt;As a cleanser (in the morning to awaken my face, I cleanse thoroughly at night).&lt;br /&gt;As a hair moisturizer (spritz into hair and then add coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;As an anti-antiperspirant (it&#x27;s an astringent, so spray under air before using natural deodorant, works fairly well in AZ).</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I saw that the ingredients were some kind of fancy, distilled, de-atomized water thingy, and rose oil. From what I know, real rose water is just crushed rose petals, so if that is something you need, don&#x27;t get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this to mix some crazy volcanic clay into a face mask so for me, I didn&#x27;t crush me that this was not true rose water taht was crushed by a unicorn in eden. It smells nice and there&#x27;s lots of it so that now I can do multiple facials and not worry that it costs an arm and a leg. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - very refreshing and inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this back from the States and now wish I could purchase it again here in Australia.</li>
    <li> its great for face toner, and I love the price, i am reordering. not tested on animals and natural product</li>
    <li> Used every day as a toner.  Great smell!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Been looking for a long time for this.  I use it as a toner and a spritz to freshen my makeup.</li>
    <li> I use this as toner now and my skin glows!!!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite but not bad either.</li>
    <li> I used this rosewater as a day time toner. I feel so classy every time I use it. It smells so good and it soothes and gently cleanses my face before I apply my moisturizer and makeup. I have yet to use it for my hair but plan on doing so in the near future. For the price, this is a value.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month with extremely acne prone skin. I recently started a holistic skin care routine. I tone with this and moisturize with rosehip oil. Although I&#x27;ll still have occasional breakouts my skin has never looked or felt better. My breakouts are small and disappear faster. This stuff is great for acne prone and sensitive skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. added to all of my lotions , including hair lotion I mix together to manage my hair. wonderful product to use to mix with lotions.</li>
    <li> What a lovely clean, fresh scent. At a minimum price.  Absolutely love this rosewater. I spritz it to refresh my face a couple of times a day and sometimes onto my pillows. (I changed out the cap for a spray nozzle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re an energy worker type, don&#x27;t pay more (you know what I&#x27;m talking about).</li>
    <li> I ordered this 8oz bottle to go into a homemade facial toner.  It arrived smelling fresh and uneffectived by the intensive Phoenix heat in which it had to be delivered.  This product was for the bulk of my toner, along with some lemon juice, almond oil, and witch hazel. My face looks great and I will be purchasing from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> My allergies make me too sensitive to wear perfume but I can wear this and I love it.</li>
    <li> Oh my!  I have used this on my skin and hair with great results.  It is refreshing on the skin and literally takes out my dry frizzy ends due to bleaching without weighing down my hair.  Oh and the smell... is fresh!  During the day, I catch myself smelling a fresh light airy scent and realize that&#x27;s me!- well the rosewater in my hair!  this is a product I will not be left without.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I suppose I should start by saying I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting into before I ordered this. I had read it would be nice for facial masks and thought why not.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this in and put it on my face and got the worst scent-related headache I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I&#x27;m going to find a more appropriate use for the rest of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after visiting a Moroccan restaurant where they washed our hands in rose water.  This has the same scent, and I love that it&#x27;s naturally astringent.  I use it in the bath, and as a toner.  I also put some in an atomizer, diluted with water, and use as a room spray.  Very nice, high-quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rose water every day since I got it, and I&#x27;m not waking with flaky skin in the mornings. It is the only change I&#x27;ve made to my routine. I massage it in after cleansing and toning, and before the Shea butter I use for moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been dealing with Sahara skin for years because of my thyroid, and it feels like I&#x27;ve won a prize to wake without flakes after all this time. My makeup goes on like a dream now, and this smells heavenly. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This arrived in a sturdy package and is leak free. It has a lovely scent and I use it in making body products. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Very nice- the sent is wonderful.</li>
    <li> this arrived quickly and smells super good if you like the scent of roses, which I do. The bottle is really big too.</li>
    <li> A little high priced for rosewater but it does smell really good and it will be put to good use.</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater - ordered it for the third time! Smell is amazing:  pure fresh rose aroma! I like to use it in airplane; it refreshes, calms and moisturizes your skin. Neighbors are always pleased with this scent and even sometimes ask you for complementary spray.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I prefer to dilute this product with spring or mineral water 1:1.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try this in a recipe.  have a small glass bottle of rose water that I purchased years ago, and it smells just as good as the new bottle.  Is this a testament to its shelf life?  Not sure, but I&#x27;m only going to use it for scent in the shower or sink drains, just in case.  The only problem with this new bottle is that it leaked a bit, and had gotten outside of the shrink wrap packaging.  Luckily, it is not oily and nothing was damaged.</li>
    <li> I use this in my locs. The actual packaging is pink and the water is clear.</li>
    <li> Got it for Mom. She always loved it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by the lady who gave mea facial. It is lightly scented and feels lovely on my face. It is an excellent price.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth bottle and it works just great.</li>
    <li> i pour it into a spray bottle and mist all over my face morning and night as a toner.  My toddler also loves it when i mist her too.  It smells sooo soft and nice I wish I could wear it as perfume.  I met a girl out who had the&lt;br /&gt;most glorious skin and she said this was her secret.  Ive already gone through a whole bottle and I do think it gives my skin a glow</li>
    <li> A luxurious product for my skin and hair. I add a bit to my milk baths and to my self-made hair sprays. It makes everything feels so soft and moisturized. I feel a HUGE difference in my hair and skin while using this product.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily toner. Smells great! Works nice as a pre-lotion toner. I put it in a sprayer and mist it over my entire face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love using rose water and glycerin as a moisturizer...and love just using rose water as a toner and perfume. But, wish it came in a spray bottle instead of a squeeze bottle...I know this probably helps keep the cost down,but would be so much more convenient. Heavily scented...if you love the smell of roses as I do (reminds me of my grandmother), then I highly recommend this for you.</li>
    <li> I use this as a face toner. It smells good, light, and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is really quite phenomenal.  For the longest time I&#x27;d searched for something to address my dry, patchy (facial) skin.  Nothing worked. Sometimes I&#x27;d discover patches while out and about after having thoroughly moisturized before leaving home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can simply spray this rosewater product on my face in the morning and I&#x27;m good for the day. I carry the bottle with me in order to refresh throughout the day-- as desired, but the dry patches are gone!! My face has taken on a smooth, even texture I only dreamed of a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any woman who&#x27;s every struggled with dry facial skin knows what I&#x27;m talking about when I say my self-confidence has spiked because of this nominally priced, food grade cosmetic.  I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formerly, I had purchased another rose petal based product which costs twice as much as this item. Now, I use less of that one. Or, I use it as part of my night time routine after spraying my face with this product. And, this brings me to the reason I&#x27;ve only rated it 4 stars.  It didn&#x27;t come with a sprayer.  When I called Heritage Products a representative explained that this particular bottle is meant for culinary use. It&#x27;s the very same product inside the bottle, it&#x27;s just that the bottle with the sprayer is intended for cosmetic use and this one is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, next time I&#x27;ll know.</li>
    <li> Timeless classic, love this for all over</li>
    <li> Cheap and smells synthetic.</li>
    <li> Smells great! However, that was about it, the fragrance did not last in the bath and I didn&#x27;t think it was much better than regular witch hazel.</li>
    <li> I use it as part of an Edgar Cayce skin recipe (along with other oils). It smells very pretty. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This rose water smells really nice and fresh, it smells like fresh cut roses, I mix it with glycerin and spritz it on my hair every morning it makes my hair really soft  and manageable.</li>
    <li> I would rather order it, than make it myself. Great for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Gentle with a great natural aroma. Gave up using a commercial toner once this product was recommended on one of my favorite blogs. Danielle LaPorte shared her simple &#x27;how-tos&#x27; about facial skin care routine and it has totally made a difference. Improved the glow of my skin. Always used after washing my face/neck. Even when I just want to freshen up I&#x27;ll pour a little on a 100% cotton square and wipe my face. So refreshing!</li>
    <li> wonderful for hair and body. i spray this on my hair and it makes it smell wonderful. spritz  little on your body and smell like field of roses.</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous, good price.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face as a toner. It smells wonderful, and leaves my skin looking radiant. I will be buying more of this product!</li>
    <li> Lovely smell. I use it to take my makeup off at night, doesn&#x27;t work any better than plain water, that&#x27;s what it is, but it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
    <li> Just  pure Water will never order again</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and even makes a nice air freshner.</li>
    <li> I love this, I use it in my hand made body cream formation.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products I love to use to take off my makeup. The scent is intoxicating, it keeps my skin balanced and blemish free.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! I love to spray this on (mixed with water) when it gets  hot out. Its refreshing and smells great!!! I&#x27;ve purchased from this company before and have never been disappointed with the quality.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and all of the things I can do with it! The price fits my budget, too!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use several times a day on my face,  love the scent.  I spray all over and use with the rose oil</li>
    <li> Smells great. It&#x27;s just like the rose oil I bought in Turkey.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this rose water. It just the right amount of rose scent, not too overpowering and not too delicate. I love using it has a toner or mixing it with my almond oil for a nice hair treatment. Too bad the smell doesn&#x27;t linger or else I would use it as perfume.</li>
    <li> Definitely smells like roses.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to add rose water to my skin care routine and am so glad I found this on amazon, is a great toner and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any major difference after using the rose water on my face twice a day,  though the scent is pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a superb quality rose water, wonderful for body, and room freshening. I love rose waters and this is the best for quality and price for the best scent. The bottle is not fancy enough to enhance your vanity but looks are deceiving with this little bottle. Pour this rose water into a beautiful container and anyone who didn&#x27;t know would think you paid much more than this for such a potent rose water. Other rose waters which cost ten times the price and come in fancy glass atomizers are disappointing to me in terms of the rose scent quality. This one is top quality. We love this scent and the high quality, pure rose essential oil they put into this product to create this water. The best part is it is certified by laboratory testing to be free of pesticides is not tested on animals. A heavenly scent!</li>
    <li> Fast and great price!</li>
    <li> I just like the stuff. Smells good, and is a nice layer of moisture before putting on moisturizer. Reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance! I use this before and after doing my makeup, as well as after getting out of the shower... and it is great for extra pick-me-ups! The scent of this rosewater is great, but not overpowering. 8 oz lasts a long time, too, so I feel like this is a great value. I will note that I switched the top of this bottle (a click cap - the kind usually on body lotion bottles) with a squirt nozzle from an old body spray that I had, which makes it a lot more functional. If you don&#x27;t have something like this around the house, you could find one at the dollar store, easy peasy.</li>
    <li> Great product for clean face. It smells natural and made my skin soft.  The power of roses!</li>
    <li> This is great Rose water.  I use it in a spray bottle for my face and hair.  It feels and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Best makeup setting spray ever. Safe for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use [[ASIN:B005VEE5YM Vitamin C Powder (L-ascorbic acid) Pure - 1.8oz / 50g]] to make my own vitamin C serum.  I used to make the serum with distilled water, but now I use this rosewater instead.  What a remarkable improvement!  The aroma alone is delightful, but I&#x27;m convinced the serum is more effective made with this rosewater.  It&#x27;s an amazing value at this price, and will be lasting me a good long time.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not real rose water but it&#x27;s not bad, either. real rose water is expensive. very expensive and usually comes from places like Bulgaria. even so- I love this stuff. I have very dry skin and I use it as a final touch to give my skin a glowy look and feel. I also spray it in my hair. it just feels nice. highly recommend but if you&#x27;re looking for the major benefits of rose water I&#x27;d pay more money for the real stuff.</li>
    <li> It  is very for moisturizing hair. I love it</li>
    <li> I had no expectations when I bought this product but was surprised.  Firstly, it&#x27;s vor-mag water---that is water that has been vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy of the water.  Secondly, it&#x27;s Rose Damascena essential oil.  When I saw the picture I didn&#x27;t know why the liquid was colored but when I received the product only the plastic bottle is colored pink not the liquid inside.  The pink bottle adds to the whole energy of it nicely.  I&#x27;ve got an atomizer spray nozzle and have been spraying it on my face and body at any and all times.  It is so refreshing and uplifting, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good value and has many cosmetic uses. It has a nice aroma and I use it as a refreshing toner as well as make-up sealant.  It is a natural, inexpensive homeopathic treatment that I use for wrinkles and other skin issues.</li>
    <li> This is a great rosewater!  The aroma is very rosy and uplifting to the spirit.  I use it in some of my homemade body care recipes.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase!  The fragrance is wonderful!  I would definitely purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> love the smell. Makes my skin so soft. :)</li>
