### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>This is the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels wonderful.  </li>
      <li>The best lotion ever.  </li>
      <li>As a LMT this massage lotion would be best for Myofascial work..</li>
      <li>I am so happy to have come across this lotion!  </li>
      <li>This massage cream is great.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizing lotion for massage.</li>
      <li>I recommend anyone seeking a good massage lotion buy a bottle of this.</li>
      <li>Organic ingredients are what makes this massage lotion superior to the others I have tried , still not the glide I was hoping for .</li>
      <li>This is the best lotion I have worked with so far-nice glide and doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The lotion itself is great, not greasy or oily but goes on smooth and lasts.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Currently I make my own massage whipped butter, and every once in a while I run out , hence the backup .</li>
      <li>Tried this out because others wrote good reviews, and they were right!</li>
      <li>Works great with hot stone massage.</li>
      <li>Its ok, it does not have a very good glide, one must apply too frequently!</li>
      <li>My clients love it.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff and so do my clients.</li>
      <li>I love that this is vegan and has no nut oils, making it safe for all of my clients.</li>
      <li>this lotion is ok.  </li>
      <li>Sacred Earth Botanicals was at the top of my list.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, So much better than oil</li>
      <li>yes, I know, envy me, for sure...</li>
      <li>Great lotion for sports and deep tissue work.</li>
      <li>The peppermint cools the skin from the inside and with the pores still open after showering your skin will feel like you&#x27;re your own refrigerator and wearing warm clothes will not help since it&#x27;s cooling the skin from the inside.</li>
      <li>nothing special but does the trick.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is more like hand or body lotion, not offering much glide.</li>
      <li>Good for deep tissue or Swedish massage.</li>
      <li>Natural ingredients and scent free!</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I love peppermint oil since it gives a nice cool feeling, but i don&#x27;t recommend using it until at least 20-30 minutes after you&#x27;ve showered.  </li>
      <li>Most massage lotions just absorb so fast, I feel like I have to reapply, and reapply, and reapply, this one has a bit more &#x27;slip&#x27; to it, and a little longer lasting, nice texture, nice overall product.</li>
      <li>Keeping it real for the US of A . !</li>
      <li>and my skin is so much softer!  </li>
      <li>On a positive note it did arrive in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>I used Therapro for many years but never liked that it&#x27;s not paraben free</li>
      <li>for the lotion itself, it works very well.  </li>
      <li>But for massage, it isn&#x27;t really what I like.</li>
      <li>Absorbs into the skin and really moisturizes.  </li>
      <li>and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I doubt i&#x27;ll put it to too much use.</li>
      <li>It does not leave any greasy feeling and it absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this massage lotion.</li>
      <li>I also used so much of this product per client that the cost is not feasible. .</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but I think masseuse had to use a little more as a result.</li>
      <li>While this product does not contain any added fragrances ,it is made with Extracts and Oils which naturally have a scent.</li>
      <li>While the natural scent is not overpowering ,it is pleasing ,however not UNSCENTED or desired for sensitive</li>
      <li>Silky and soft.</li>
      <li>(I hate the feel of oil) and gives a great glide!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m a new nail tech still testing out different companies and their products.</li>
      <li>Lotion good, bottle bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff, So much better than oil (I hate the feel of oil) and gives a great glide! My clients love it.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and works well with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients and scent free! Great lotion for sports and deep tissue work.</li>
    <li> Massage lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky all over, just moist and dewy. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I used Therapro for many years but never liked that it&#x27;s not paraben free however I could never find something non-greasy that allowed glide and deep tissue work AND was truly scentless. This did the trick. Love it! I will not be switching back from using this product.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is great, not greasy or oily but goes on smooth and lasts.  The pump was a different story, never could get a drop out of it!  I had to take it off and tip and shake the bottle to get any out.  Lotion good, bottle bad.</li>
    <li> I really like this massage lotion. I&#x27;m used to using creme, and it seems like Sacred Earth massage creme smells like Bacardi (and I&#x27;m not the only one who has pointed that out!). I had used Lotus Touch lotion before, but it always picked up on dead skin, fuzzballs from my sheets, etc.     I have already started using this, and ended up ordering a gallon for refills!</li>
    <li> No scent. Great! Not very greasy after use but I think masseuse had to use a little more as a result.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have come across this lotion!  It does not leave any greasy feeling and it absorbs into the skin very well. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and my skin is so much softer!  After i pump some lotion into my hand I add a few drops of essential oil and mix it together and it works really well. I bought two bottles and added peppermint oil into one of the bottle and mixed it.  I love peppermint oil since it gives a nice cool feeling, but i don&#x27;t recommend using it until at least 20-30 minutes after you&#x27;ve showered.  The peppermint cools the skin from the inside and with the pores still open after showering your skin will feel like you&#x27;re your own refrigerator and wearing warm clothes will not help since it&#x27;s cooling the skin from the inside. Waiting it out until your pores close (about 20 minutes) may be the only option.&lt;br /&gt;As for the lotion itself, it works very well.  I also bought the half gallon refill too.</li>
    <li> My husband is a massage therapist..yes, I know, envy me, for sure... and I hate the greasy feel of oil. This is the perfect solution. It still allows the glide necessary for long Swedish massage strokes, but doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy, I need a shower, feeling.</li>
    <li> Not enough slip or glide . I was looking for a back-up massage lotion. I did a lot of research  to find the few that I would try. Sacred Earth Botanicals was at the top of my list. No parabens , vegan, Organic ingredients  and made in the USA. Keeping it real for the US of A . !&lt;br /&gt;Currently I make my own massage whipped butter, and every once in a while I run out , hence the backup . Sadly this product is severely lacking in the slip department, I found myself applying more product to get the slip,to no avail. I also used so much of this product per client that the cost is not feasible. . 1/3 of the 8 oz bottle is gone after 2 clients.&lt;br /&gt;Also website states it is unscented.. which is deceiving . While this product does not contain any added fragrances ,it is made with Extracts and Oils which naturally have a scent. : Organic Lavender Extract, Organic Arnica Extract, Organic White Tea Extract, Organic Chamomile Extract, Tocopherols, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Tamanu Oil. While the natural scent is not overpowering ,it is pleasing ,however not UNSCENTED or desired for sensitive clients.&lt;br /&gt;The Organic ingredients are what makes this massage lotion superior to the others I have tried , still not the glide I was hoping for . As a LMT this massage lotion would be best for Myofascial work..</li>
    <li> Most massage lotions just absorb so fast, I feel like I have to reapply, and reapply, and reapply, this one has a bit more &#x27;slip&#x27; to it, and a little longer lasting, nice texture, nice overall product.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing lotion for massage. Little goes a long way without feeling oily. Tried this out because others wrote good reviews, and they were right!</li>
    <li> The product is as described: A 8oz bottle of vegan lotion. But for massage, it isn&#x27;t really what I like. The consistency is more like hand or body lotion, not offering much glide. I keep it in my room in case I get a request for something vegan but other than that I doubt i&#x27;ll put it to too much use. On a positive note it did arrive in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I love that this is vegan and has no nut oils, making it safe for all of my clients. It is not at all greasy and a little goes a long way, without the clients feeling like they are oily and yucky. Works great with hot stone massage. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This massage cream is great. Well worth the cost. Lasts a long time. I add essential oils if I need a scent.</li>
    <li> this lotion is ok.  nothing special but does the trick.  i use it as my back up</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a new nail tech still testing out different companies and their products. i love this stuff and so do my clients. i would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have worked with so far-nice glide and doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly. Good for deep tissue or Swedish massage. Plus, it gives me peace of mind that Sacred Earth products are organic and avoid harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever.  Absorbs into the skin and really moisturizes.  My skin looks and feels wonderful.  Silky and soft.</li>
    <li> Its ok, it does not have a very good glide, one must apply too frequently!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always gonna use this product. It relaxes my body and my mind. I recommend anyone seeking a good massage lotion buy a bottle of this.</li>
