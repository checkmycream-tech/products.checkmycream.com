      <li>Absolutley love love love it!!  </li>
      <li>Most impressive was what it did for my daughter&#x27;s very wavy and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I have use this conditioner-treatment since I (again, over and over) bleached my hair, the story of my life, and one day I saw this product in CVS for damage hair and since I didn&#x27;t have a GOOD conditioner I said, &#x27; why not&#x27;, it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I loved how it improved my hair.....</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>I jumped at the chance because I love using products like this.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s a 3-pack</li>
      <li>Works ok but made my scalp itch.</li>
      <li>Make sure to rinse thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I love their deodorants-</li>
      <li>I truly recommended. :-)</li>
      <li>Most seemed to like it, but my brother wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>I love their deodorants-</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>This conditioner is perfect for daily use.</li>
      <li>Most seemed to like it, but my brother wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use.</li>
      <li>However I was hoping this would be a more intensive type of Cream Rinse</li>
      <li>This conditioner works way better than any others I have tried.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and</li>
      <li>I dont love them</li>
      <li>I also learned that brushing your hair and towel drying could cause up to 23% more damage?</li>
      <li>and it gets straightened most days, so an intensive conditioner was just the thing for me.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job of conditioning and washes out easily but didn&#x27;t do anything all that special for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Its good for every hair wash and will get results within a few weeks so loving it and enjoying it smelling great</li>
      <li>Best treatment ever for the price.. start out with damaged split ends, and end up with smooth super soft hair.</li>
      <li>I have atopic dermatitis and can&#x27;t leave most conditioners on my scalp for any length of time, but this one works so well that even after just 15 seconds of use, my hair is tangle-free, smooth, shiny, and static-free.</li>
      <li>It smelled nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>It has a great, fresh scent and really does the job of \\&quot;healing\\&quot; hair.  </li>
      <li>.it works fine on damaged hair like split ends and hair that break out easily .after</li>
      <li>Its smooth and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>and I have two huge bottles of Dove in my bag</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a few weeks now and am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Even though the conditioner has great results at the beginning, I think that the changes fade over time, even with continued daily use.</li>
      <li>I received this product for free in order to test it because I&#x27;m a bzz agent.  </li>
      <li>I got a free bottle of this conditioner from Bzz Agent, for test purposes.  </li>
      <li>The ends aren&#x27;t as smooth and they don&#x27;t seem as moisturized when I use this product.</li>
      <li>But this did make my hair silky smooth sleek and shiny and manageable</li>
      <li>I also received some sample packs and coupons, which I handed out to some friends (no one seemed particularly excited, although I can&#x27;t say any of my friends are the sort to get excited about hair care).</li>
      <li>any of my friends are the sort to get excited about hair care).</li>
      <li>My hair is not too damaged, and honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a very great difference between this conditioner and other conditioners such as Pantene.  </li>
      <li>and I was right!</li>
      <li>I loved the daily conditioner.  </li>
      <li>But I DO NOT feel that it should be relied upon for damaged hair in need of true repair.  </li>
      <li>colored blonde hair that&#x27;s subjected to a fair amount of heat</li>
      <li>And because it is a &#x27;daily&#x27; conditioner, as the name shows, I do think it is good for a quick rinse out conditioner.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve smelled Dove products before, you know the smell is always fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>So when I received the Dove Intensive Repair Daily conditioner, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how well this would work on super damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I purchased this wanting a quick mask to condition my bleached hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using the conditioner almost daily for a couple of weeks and at first, I really liked it!</li>
      <li>But those aren&#x27;t extraordinary.  </li>
      <li>It also contains the normal conditioning agents that most conditioners have like cetearyl alcohol and behentrimonium chloride.  </li>
      <li>After testing this one against other conditioners for a year I came to the conclusion that it is the one that works the best for my hair, so far.</li>
      <li>I gave this five stars because my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this good in a long while.</li>
      <li>I love this new line of hair care products from Dove.</li>
      <li>It is not a product you have to leave in your hair a long time to get results, just use like regular conditioner and the results are wonderful!  </li>
      <li>It is def worth the buy.</li>
      <li>Dove sent me a sample of the product: Conditioner - Dove - Daily Treatment Conditioner, Intensive Repair (8.3 ml), I really liked the result on my hair.    </li>
      <li>I noticed right away smoother softer hair.  </li>
      <li>I suppose it makes sense, considering how much hair I clean out of my brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was super soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this a friend of mine</li>
      <li>With the sample, I got a hair extremely soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>With this conditioner you only need to leave it on your hair for about a minute, with most others I have used</li>
      <li>my hair didnt feel smooth and soft even though followed the instruction to let it moisture for 1 minute....</li>
      <li>Even after the first use, I noticed an improvement in the texture and softness of my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and it smells divine.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I can love myself for my natural beauty Thanks to God first and thanks to Dove second</li>
      <li>and I personally like it a lot better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty damaged, but since using this it&#x27;s starting to get better.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more later on</li>
      <li>[I even order several bottles at a time] and it has kept my hair as soft, healthy, and growing!  </li>
      <li>I have very long, very fine hair</li>
      <li>and I always get tons of split ends and frizz and every other kind of hair damage imaginable.</li>
      <li>and I had noticed some real damage as a result.  </li>
      <li>However, besides having my ends bleached, I don&#x27;t do much else damage to my hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Dove site boasts that this conditioner is fortified with \\&quot;fiber actives\\&quot;. What is that?  I question it because I don&#x27;t see anything in this conditioner that is going to repair hair and rebuild protein.  It is full of things that COAT hair: mineral oil, petrolatum, multiple silicones, an acrylate polymer......um hello?!?!  I don&#x27;t see any protein in this product - NONE.  Maybe I missed it and I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if someone proves me wrong because I really want to like this conditioner, but I don&#x27;t see ANY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is VERY perfumey in my opinion. I thought it smelled really good while I was using it in the shower, but as the day went on, the scent was overpowering and became annoying.  It smelled like I had rinsed my hair with fabric softener or something.  Considering fragrance is pretty high on the ingredient list, I am not surprised.  TURN DOWN THE PERFUME DOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain Gluconolactone, which I had never heard of until now and it looks like it might help with hair moisture and help those who have hard water (like me). It also contains the normal conditioning agents that most conditioners have like cetearyl alcohol and behentrimonium chloride.  But those aren&#x27;t extraordinary.  Based on the claims on the Dove site, I just assumed this was a product that contained actual ingredients that repair hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed my hair it did \\&quot;feel\\&quot; nice. But I know this is because of all the ingredients that coat and give the illusion of repair. And I guess there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that when needed.  And because it is a &#x27;daily&#x27; conditioner, as the name shows, I do think it is good for a quick rinse out conditioner.  But I DO NOT feel that it should be relied upon for damaged hair in need of true repair.  Try to find something that has protein in it because I think the results from this one are just a cover up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner twice this week and am very happy with the results. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy. Its smooth and easy to manage. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Dove&#x27;s Daily Treatment Conditioner from Bzz Agent. My hair is thick, wavy, and tends to frizz. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a few weeks now and am very happy with the results. Less frizz without weighing down my hair. This conditioner is perfect for daily use. It feels too heavy when first applied, but it does rinse clean. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical that this product would actually help prevent damage in my hair when I first got it. I live outside in the summer, under the sun and in the pool and I always get tons of split ends and frizz and every other kind of hair damage imaginable. After using it for a few days I could feel a difference in the texture of my hair, it&#x27;s smoother, sleeker, and shinier than it was before and it keeps improving. I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone who has damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Dove conditioner from Bzz Agent - as a bzz agent myself, I get samples from time to time to try.  I loved the daily conditioner.  It has a great, fresh scent and really does the job of \\&quot;healing\\&quot; hair.  My daughters have been in swimming and I had noticed some real damage as a result.  When we tried the Dove Daily conditioner they only had to use a little - and I was skeptical about the quarter sized amount being enough.  It was enough, and once their hair was dry, it felt like \\&quot;salon hair\\&quot;.  It was super soft and smooth.  The tangles were gone.  I love this new line of hair care products from Dove.</li>
    <li> Typically I am not picky about my conditioner, but when I saw that this one is meant to help damaged hair, I decided to give it a try on my color-treated hair. I was so pleased after my first use; the directions indicate that the conditioner can be used as a short leave-in, which is what I usually do with conditioner anyway. Usually, when I rinse out a conditioner, I don&#x27;t feel much of a difference in my hair. This one, however, leaves softness and smoothness that I can feel even after I rinse. When I don&#x27;t use this conditioner, I can tell a difference in my hair. The ends aren&#x27;t as smooth and they don&#x27;t seem as moisturized when I use this product. Dove has won another fan with this one.</li>
    <li> Buzzagent, I have dry thin hair and because of that I experience a lot of breakage. After using the product today, my hair is soft, shiny, and bouncy. Any my hair looks fuller.  I gave this five stars because my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this good in a long while.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of the Dove Daily Treatment Intensive Repair condition from BzzAgent to try and review the product. I have been using the conditioner almost daily for a couple of weeks and at first, I really liked it! My hair felt noticeably softer and smoother after one use. I love the smell and how the conditioner doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat or greasy like many other conditioners do. After using the conditioner for a while, though, I noticed that my hair appears to be getting frizzy again. Though it still feels soft, it is a little bit coarser than before. Even though the conditioner has great results at the beginning, I think that the changes fade over time, even with continued daily use. I&#x27;m not sure that I will buy a new bottle of the Intensive Repair when my bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is perfect for my hair. I have awfully bleach damaged hair, and this product really helped me make my hair conditioned and detangled. A great feature that I liked most is that when you rinse it you feel your hair is non greasy.</li>
    <li> My hair feels softer and smoother since I started using this conditioner. I&#x27;m very picky because my hair has been very dried out before by other conditioners (Pantene Suave don&#x27;t like those) It helps me to love my natural curls instead of having to straighten it I&#x27;ve been natural for a long time and have gotten used to getting my hair wet everyday. I like the things of this world I dont love them bc The Bible says be not of this world. But this did make my hair silky smooth sleek and shiny and manageable and I&#x27;m glad I can love myself for my natural beauty Thanks to God first and thanks to Dove second I can have the long curly hair that I&#x27;ve always dreamed of my hair is my glory and pride and I am so so so so so so happy that I tried this and I have two huge bottles of Dove in my bag I carry it everywhere I go I plan on buying more later on and I use it everyday I use the conditioner as a leave in. This is the softest my hair has ever felt in my opinion I could see myself trying something new also but not giving up Dove ever. God bless u all and have a nice day.</li>
    <li> Absolutley love love love it!!  I have very long, very fine hair and I have problems with other conditioners/treatments making my hair greasy.  This product takes a tiny amount even for all my hair.  It makes my hair the silkiest its ever felt and if I don&#x27;t wash every day still lasts that second day.  Will continue to use this product! 5 stars[[ASIN:B002VA4FWG Dove Damage Therapy Intensive Repair Conditioner, 8 Ounce (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> I got a free bottle of this conditioner from Bzz Agent, for test purposes.  My hair is not too damaged, and honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a very great difference between this conditioner and other conditioners such as Pantene.  It does a good job of conditioning and washes out easily but didn&#x27;t do anything all that special for my hair.  I think with my own money, I would go with a cheaper brand.</li>
    <li> I received the Dove Intensive Repair from BzzAgent to try. It worked great for my hair which is thick and straight and it left it shiny and soft. Most impressive was what it did for my daughter&#x27;s very wavy and frizzy hair. It left it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> After running out of my regular conditioner I had a free sample I received from buying my Dove soap and I already see a difference after one time use on how soft my hair feels from what I was using before.  I will by this as my regular conditioner from now on.</li>
    <li> i RECIEVED THE dove conditioner from bzzcampaign and i love it it smells great and works great on all kinds of hair .it works fine on damaged hair like split ends and hair that break out easily .after the use of this conditioner it leaves hair shiny and silky through out the day .I have never tried the product before until i recieved this sample so i guess i might wanna buy another when i run out of this conditioner.Its good for every hair wash and will get results within a few weeks so loving it and enjoying it smelling great</li>
    <li> I have problems with dry hair.  My hair tends to get tortured with hair drying and coloring.  I belong to Bzz Agent and I was asked to try this product.  I was a little skeptical at first.  I often feel that to get that \\&quot;salon feel\\&quot;, you need to buy their products.  So when I received the Dove Intensive Repair Daily conditioner, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be satisfied with it.  I was wrong.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  Even after the first use, I noticed an improvement in the texture and softness of my hair.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have use this conditioner-treatment since I (again, over and over) bleached my hair, the story of my life, and one day I saw this product in CVS for damage hair and since I didn&#x27;t have a GOOD conditioner I said, &#x27; why not&#x27;, it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I loved how it improved my hair.....SO I found out that amazon was having a special on this conditioner and again after bleaching my hair, this has been the only conditioner that has revived my SO dagame hair from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use this conditioner and nothing else and it has done wonders. I truly recommended. :-)</li>
    <li> Best treatment ever for the price.. start out with damaged split ends, and end up with smooth super soft hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with the result....my hair didnt feel smooth and soft even though followed the instruction to let it moisture for 1 minute....not worth the money...Don&#x27;t buy it....</li>
    <li> Good conditioner. Works ok but made my scalp itch. I used this after I bleached my hair. But when I ran out I went and bought the 3$ Aussie 3 minute miracle conditioner from Walmart and I personally like it a lot better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently put my hair through a lot. It&#x27;s pretty damaged, but since using this it&#x27;s starting to get better. I love that it&#x27;s a 3-pack so I won&#x27;t run out any time soon and continue treatment of my hair.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in order to test it because I&#x27;m a bzz agent.  I jumped at the chance because I love using products like this.  I have shoulder length hair that gets pulled back a lot and it gets straightened most days, so an intensive conditioner was just the thing for me.  After using this conditioner for a week or so, I did notice that my hair was soft.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in fly aways though.  I will add that I had already been using a deep conditioner by another company before I used this one, so that could be a reason I didn&#x27;t notice as big a change as others.   I do like this conditioner.  My hair is left very soft and I like knowing that it&#x27;s being protected from all the straightening I do.  It&#x27;s definitely a deep conditioner I would buy again.  With this conditioner you only need to leave it on your hair for about a minute, with most others I have used I would have to wait 3-5 min, so the wait time is much more attractive for me with this product.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample of Dove&#x27;s new Fiber Actives intensive repair conditioner as part of a BzzCampaign and have been regularly using it for a couple of weeks now. Generally I use Head &amp; Shoulders products, but I&#x27;m always willing to try something new, and I had actually been considering trying a different conditioner. I&#x27;ve got curly hair that tangles like a champ so I wanted to find something to help me de-tangle my mess. Unfortunately, I inherited my dad&#x27;s oily hair, so I have to be careful about what conditioners I use because some make my hair look oily faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has patented micro moisture serum and fiber actives that treat hair from the inside out, and prevent split ends. The fiber actives treat hair from the inside by getting in through the porous hair and the micro moisture serum strengthens the hair from root to tip. I&#x27;m not hair savvy, so I have no idea how I could possibly verify whether my hair is stronger... although I will say I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less hair in my brush (however this could be due to the de-tangling or strengthening... I have no idea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I did Dove&#x27;s Damage IQ hair care quiz, and I&#x27;m a total failure... of 8 questions I got 2 correct! Did you know that aside from split ends, other signs of hair damage include lack of body, flyaways, and static? I just figures flyaways were annoying random hairs that refuse to cooperate! I also learned that brushing your hair and towel drying could cause up to 23% more damage? I suppose it makes sense, considering how much hair I clean out of my brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the Dove conditioner! I hair feels really soft, and hardly tangles anymore! The conditioner smells incredibly good, and the smell lasts a while (I was driving down the road one day when my hair flipped in my face and I could still smell my conditioner from my shower the night before). I also received some sample packs and coupons, which I handed out to some friends (no one seemed particularly excited, although I can&#x27;t say any of my friends are the sort to get excited about hair care). Most seemed to like it, but my brother wasn&#x27;t a fan. He said his hair didn&#x27;t want to cooperate as well as it typically does when he uses his Head &amp; Shoulders conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Dove! I highly recommend their new conditioners and all of their other products, while I&#x27;m at it... I love their deodorants- they&#x27;re one of the few brands I&#x27;m not allergic to.say any of my friends are the sort to get excited about hair care).

    <li> From BzzAgent, I received a full-size Dove Damage Therapy Intensive Repair Daily Treatment Conditioner. I was excited to try it, because I have been considering trying silicones again occasionally. I have naturally curly, dry hair that is graying (I&#x27;ve stopped coloring it).  My hair loves moisture and conditioners.  For those that are concerned about ingredients, this conditioner has dimethicone and amodimethicone; possible other silicones.  It also has petrolatum and mineral oil -- ingredients that aren&#x27;t usually in products I use.  Well, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the end result of this conditioner in my hair. It smelled nice and fresh. It absorbed well into my wet hair. When my hair dried, the curls looked stringy (not a good thing). My curls when wet seemed to hang heavier and looked less springy than they usually do.  It also looked a bit greasy when dried. I have used the product a few times in the past week to see if my hair would like it better with more use; I will try it a few more times to see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> I am a Bzz agent and am currently trying this product.  I LOVE IT.  It is not a product you have to leave in your hair a long time to get results, just use like regular conditioner and the results are wonderful!  I noticed right away smoother softer hair.  I really like this product, you should give it a try!</li>
    <li> Dove sent me a sample of the product: Conditioner - Dove - Daily Treatment Conditioner, Intensive Repair (8.3 ml), I really liked the result on my hair.    I bought the product, but the result was not the same as I got with the sample. I&#x27;ve compared the ingredients of the sample and the ingredients that I bought here on amazon. Why the sample contains a different ingredient Polyacrylate-1 Crosspolymer. Why? is possible that this ingredient makes any difference in the final result in hair.    With the sample, I got a hair extremely soft and smooth. But with the product I purchased: Dove - Daily Treatment Conditioner, Intensive Repair (236 ml), got a similar result, but not so soft. I&#x27;m disappointed.      ingredients of the sample:    Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Lactic Acid, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Dipropylene Glycol, Amodimethicone, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Gluconolactone, Potassium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Trehalose, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-150 Disterate,, PEG-7 Propylheptyl Ether, Cetrimonium Chloride, PEG-180M, Adipic Acid, Sodium Sulfate,  Methychloroisothiazolinone, Polyacrylate-1 Crosspolymer, Methylisothiazolinone.

Compré el producto, pero el resultado no ha sido el mismo que el  yo obtuve con la muestra. Yo he comparado los ingredientes de lamuestra y los ingredientes del producto que yo compré aquí en amazon. Por qué la muestra contiene un ingrediente diferente Polyacrylate-1 Crosspolymer. Por qué? es posible que ese ingrediente haga alguna diferencia en el resultado final en el cabello.    Con la muestra, yo obtuve un cabello extremadamente suave y liso. Pero con el producto que compré:  Dove - Daily Treatment Conditioner, Intensive Repair (236 ml), obtuve un resultado similar, pero no tan suave. Estoy decepcionada.          ingredientes de la muestra:    Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Lactic Acid, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Dipropylene Glycol, Amodimethicone, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Gluconolactone, Potassium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Trehalose, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-150 Disterate,, PEG-7 Propylheptyl Ether, Cetrimonium Chloride, PEG-180M, Adipic Acid, Sodium Sulfate,  Methychloroisothiazolinone, Polyacrylate-1 Crosspolymer, Methylisothiazolinone.    ingredientes del producto:    Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Lactic Acid, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Dipropylene Glycol, Amodimethicone, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Gluconolactone, Potassium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Trehalose, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-150 Disterate,, PEG-7 Propylheptyl Ether, Cetrimonium Chloride, PEG-180M, Adipic Acid, Sodium Sulfate,  Methychloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
    <li> I am a great fan of Dove Products, and still am with this product.  However I was hoping this would be a more intensive type of Cream Rinse but it is not.  It works for everyday use, but considering the size and price your much better off using their larger size bottles they offer for a damage control rinse.</li>
    <li> Best. Conditioner. Ever. I have atopic dermatitis and can&#x27;t leave most conditioners on my scalp for any length of time, but this one works so well that even after just 15 seconds of use, my hair is tangle-free, smooth, shiny, and static-free. I&#x27;m in my late-forties with below-the-shoulder, colored blonde hair that&#x27;s subjected to a fair amount of heat, so I need and recognize a good conditioner, and at even 10 times the price, I haven&#x27;t found anything better. There&#x27;s another Dove conditioner with a similar name and graphic design that&#x27;s sold in a rigid plastic bottle as opposed to this toothpaste-style tube. Don&#x27;t mistakenly buy the version in the rigid bottle--it&#x27;s vastly inferior to the one pictured here.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy thick frizzy hair, mostly in good condition with minimal split ends. I was looking for a conditioner that would make my hair nice and soft without heavy olis. Well, this conditioner did the job for my type of hair. Some other contidioners have oils that make my hair look crazy and dirty (I wash it out very well). After testing this one against other conditioners for a year I came to the conclusion that it is the one that works the best for my hair, so far. Granted I don&#x27;t use regular shampoo with it, but a non sulfate one, and almost never use the flat iron. I do have hennaed hair, and the product has not affected the color either. The most important thing is that it does not weight down the hair, and I have less frizz after using it than with other more expensive conditioners I have used. Ah, it also smells good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wanting a quick mask to condition my bleached hair. Dove products have never let me down so I thought this would be a good conditioner and I was right! It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and it smells divine. If you&#x27;ve smelled Dove products before, you know the smell is always fresh and clean. It leaves me hair feeling soft and not straw like from the bleach. However, besides having my ends bleached, I don&#x27;t do much else damage to my hair so I don&#x27;t know how well this would work on super damaged hair. Also, I have typical, straight asian hair, just as an fyi :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner has TRANSFORMED my hair.  I have dry, damaged, processed [bleached] hair that needs constant treatment to stay manageable.  I use this conditioner every day [I even order several bottles at a time] and it has kept my hair as soft, healthy, and growing!  I recommend this conditioner to anyone with some serious damage that needs rejuvenation -- it works!</li>
    <li> I like this product because of the results - ever time I used it especially after swimming, my hair comes back with the silky feeling and touch.</li>
    <li> made my hair dry and brittle with first use. I even added oils to my hair and it was still dry and breaking. never again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works way better than any others I have tried. I think because it has some oil in it, it smooths down flyaways. It is obviously not too heavy though because it rinses out clean. Make sure to rinse thoroughly. Do not be fooled and buy the bottle of this because it is not the same thing and does not have the oils in it. I am a middle aged woman with gray hairs that tend to have a mind of their own. I always have issues with them sticking straight up or otherwise misbehaving. With the Dove Treatment the fly aways are tamed. The scent is nothing to write home about but this stuff works so well, the scent is a minor detail.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this a friend of mine asked,\\&quot;What happened to your hair? It&#x27;s flat!\\&quot;  Yes, flat, dull and lifeless.  And too much frangrance for me.  Sorry I bought three.</li>
    <li> Im actually letting my hair sit in this conditioner right now... Sort of as a pre- treatment. This is really good conditioner by dove. I have coarse but thin hispanic hair. It is def worth the buy. I want to try others but its so expensive. For the price, this product is effective.</li>
