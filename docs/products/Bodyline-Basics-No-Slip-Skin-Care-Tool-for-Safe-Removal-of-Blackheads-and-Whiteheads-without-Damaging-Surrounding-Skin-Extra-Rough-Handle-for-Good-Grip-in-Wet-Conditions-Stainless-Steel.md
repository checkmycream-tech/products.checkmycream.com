      <li>I wish it had more detailed instructions.</li>
      <li>The thing about this tool is that it easily pushes the blackhead from the bottom up.</li>

      <li>directly onti face with the pimple in the loop.</li>
      <li>As gross as this might seem this tool helps so much.</li>
      <li>Gets rid of the occasional pimple without bruising or scaring of my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I was a little nervous at first about scarring.</li>

<li> tool end with the smaller hoop is angled and then flat at the end.</li>
<li> it took me a while to realize pressing the flat end to my skin doesn&#x27;t work and it just hurts more.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> DO NOT press the flat end</li>
<li> You will have a slight red mark for a very short period of time.</li>
<li> Let me begin by saying that I have tried countless other skin-care / pimple-removal tools - Walmart Brand, Tweezerman,</li>
<li> You need to press on the tip of the tool with the flat end not touching your face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this tool for a little over a month now</li>
<li> Ive had other brands in the past that didnt seem as sturdy.</li>
<li> tool does hurt because you do need to press firmly.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little hard to use if you&#x27;re a newbie like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Even at my age, I still get small whiteheads, probably caused by make up.</li>
<li> I was very skeptical but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to describe but just watch some videos...</li>
<li> O bought this for my son who finds it hard to use.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this tool if you want to get rid of those terrible blackheads.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about painful and ugly black/white heads to pop up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for this item. Didn&#x27;t work how i was hoping it would. Shipping was fast as always though</li>
    <li> This works great to remove white heads.  It works just as well as the tools they use in the office for facials.  I&#x27;ve been using this right after my shower while my pores are still open to get the best effect at removing white heads.  I would definitely recommend this product to others. I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> A little too large for most bumps.</li>
    <li> work well a lot better than squezing</li>
    <li> O bought this for my son who finds it hard to use.  I tried to show him how I would use it but it just didn&#x27;t really work out.  I wish it had more detailed instructions.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, good quality. Make sure to sanitize it in alcohol, and clean your face well before using. I wish the instructions were more clear but I got the hang of it after a while. I like it. Better than other tools I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
    <li> Good, quality tool. Very well built and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I like this tool. It&#x27;s a little hard to use if you&#x27;re a newbie like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Use rubbing alcohol to clean up after and in between extracting pores. Use it on the tool as well to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;Open your pores up before using the tool.&lt;br /&gt;This tool WILL leave your face red a bit. Do not use before going out in public.&lt;br /&gt;The tool end with the smaller hoop is angled and then flat at the end. DO NOT press the flat end directly onti face with the pimple in the loop. You need to press on the tip of the tool with the flat end not touching your face. It&#x27;s hard to describe but just watch some videos... it took me a while to realize pressing the flat end to my skin doesn&#x27;t work and it just hurts more.&lt;br /&gt;This tool does hurt because you do need to press firmly. Be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective tool. I would buy it again with different hoop sizes too. I would recommend one with smaller hoops than this one to get a better center on acne.</li>

    <li> Does what it promises</li>

    <li> Let me begin by saying that I have tried countless other skin-care / pimple-removal tools - Walmart Brand, Tweezerman, you name it!&lt;br /&gt;But this is the ONLY one I have purchased that is of any quality at all. It is made VERY WELL, and it works incredibly! I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and i plan on purchasing several to give to friends and family for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bodyline Basics for providing a QUALITY product and excellent customer service! You guys rock!</li>
    <li> I get plenty of ingrown hair and bumps that irritate my life. I like to pop them so they can go away, but I bite my nails and can&#x27;t always pop them. As gross as this might seem this tool helps so much. I don&#x27;t have to worry about painful and ugly black/white heads to pop up and I can&#x27;t get. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have blackheads around the sides of my nose and used different skin care products to try to get rid of them until I came across this skin care tool. The thing about this tool is that it easily pushes the blackhead from the bottom up. I found out the best time to do it is after a hot and steamy shower. I always sterilize my tool in isopropyl alcohol to ensure no bacteria is transferred to my face. Then I place the extractor loop and by pressing gently the blackhead comes out like a charm. I absolutely LOVE this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent instrument.Even at my age, I still get small whiteheads, probably caused by make up. It&#x27;s fast and painless.This is something I used to have to go to dermotologist and pay big bucks for.It works on blackheads too.You will have a slight red mark for a very short period of time.I was a little nervous at first about scarring.No problem, and I have typical Anglo Saxon fair skin.This was a great investment for a great low price.Highly recommend.It exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!! This product is easy to use, store, and light weight. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and so is my 14 yr old daughter!!!!</li>
