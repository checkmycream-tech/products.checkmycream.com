<ol>
      <li>But regardless, this brush is awesome.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for people with curly hair that want to straighten it while blow drying without making it TOO</li>
      <li>It works perfectly..</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this brush.  </li>
      <li>OMG, it turned out great!!!</li>
      <li>I have had a Conair straightening brush for years and loved it!  </li>
      <li>This is a really great product.</li>
      <li>I have used one of these for year with good results.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this brush!</li>
      <li>Be sure to use a smoothing serum!</li>
      <li>I love this item!</li>
      <li>This is a all around nice brush.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if I want to spring for that much money, but I had to be honest and say this is a great product.</li>
      <li>I have had a brush like this for many years</li>
      <li>100 times better than the Denman brushes and way better for your hair than a straightening iron.</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>Then the top layer in 2 sections.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many of these over the years.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I must say it works wonderfully while blow drying or flat ironing your hair.</li>
      <li>It is kind of cool to look at, but when you use it with a blow dryer, like it advertises, makes your hair smell burnt.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and this brush is the best thing for blow-drying hair straight!</li>
      <li>its not that easy to use as they say.</li>
      <li>will recommend this one for the ones who really have patience and the time to blow-dry their own hair.</li>
      <li>My original cost about $7-8.</li>
      <li>I bought my original about 10 years ago....</li>
      <li>and i love it because instead of grabbing the hot hair with my fingers and burning them..i can use the brush to grab it.</li>
      <li>I have slightly wavy hair and this brush is ideal for straightening it.  </li>
      <li>product lets me go from pubey-looking curly frizzy hair to sleek and straight sexy hair in under 15 mins.</li>
      <li>Not bad at all.</li>
      <li>straight, smooth bangs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hopefully it works just like my old one - which was GREAT while using my flat iron.</li>
      <li>super straight.  </li>
      <li>I get pretty good results from this but wanted to cut it down to one appliance (I tried the Remington Wet2Dry straightener and did not like it).  </li>
      <li>I do my hair in six sections: Clip up the top 2/3rds of my hair, straighten the right and left sides of the bottom layer.</li>
      <li>I used to have one of these when I was a teenager and LOVED it for my long thick hair, helped me keep it nice and smooth whole blow drying my hair...</li>
      <li>When I first do a pull through it&#x27;s fine for the top of the strands, but when I get down to the bottom the dryer just blows it around anyway so that the straightening doesn&#x27;t stick.  </li>
      <li>I must say the Conair definitely worked better than the Chi.</li>
      <li>My hair was so shiny and got so straight!</li>
      <li>Straighter and shiner than I&#x27;ve ever been able to get it with the flat iron by itself.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why other companies haven&#x27;t jumped on the bandwagon with an idea like this.</li>
      <li>I am able to pull my hair straight from root to tip, therefore getting my hair as straight as possible.  </li>
      <li>Found it EASILY on line and bought the Scalpmaster Ceramic Thermal Hair Straightener as a back up.  </li>
      <li>, my hairs does not look sleek as when I really work on pulling the brush trough my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really have the patience.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this because I really want to use one product on my hair -</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair, and I tried to use this with a blow dryer once and it just made my hair poofy and frizzy.  </li>
      <li>They attempt to gently comb out my hair with a blowdryer, then try to comb it with a straightener.</li>
      <li>right now I blow dry quickly and then use a straightener.  </li>
      <li>I bought this brush a really long time ago (2 or 3 years), because I do not like the hair blower directly on my hair; really that was the main reason for me to bought this one, I like the results when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair, its really light and really easy to use and the fact that is double brush</li>
      <li>I like it because the bristle area is about 1 1/2\\&quot; wide and grabs my very curly short hair nicely.</li>
      <li>But like I said, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>and I have to get a new one.</li>
      <li>Same exact thing.</li>
      <li>It is the only way I get my hair straight!</li>
      <li>The only downside is they don&#x27;t last more than a couple of months with regular use.</li>
      <li>1/21/15 Available at Rite-Aid for about half what I paid here.</li>
      <li>I was devastated when my first one broke after about 4 years, but after searching high and low, I finally found it on Amazon and bought two.  </li>
      <li>Well, this is not the way to go - since the brush is like a straightener itself, you really need 2 hands to do it properly but then there&#x27;s the dryer.  </li>
      <li>I went back to using the 2 appliances and will just have to live with that.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t dry my hair straight without it.</li>
      <li>have to be very careful because it happens that when I&#x27;m going to close and start doing my hair it will pinch my hand in an intend for me to stay away from the metallic part that gets really hot when blow-drying.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>and it finally had a stress brake near the swivel spring.</li>

<li> and it finally had a stress brake near the swivel spring.</li>
<li> The bristle base is much wider on the new one and it doesn&#x27;t collapse for easy storage.</li>
<li> Let down half of what&#x27;s clipped up, repeat with rhe right and left sides.</li>
<li> I bought this because I have silver/gray hair and the flat iron was turning it yellow.  </li>
<li> However, like the above poster, I decided to try it with my flat iron--</li>
<li> I use this product when flat ironing my hair</li>
<li> Use this to straighten my hair without the damage of the flat iron heat.  </li>
<li> This appears to be the same style, so hope it lasts as long.</li>
<li> Once I blow out my hair, I use this to hold the section of hair as I run over it with a flat iron.  </li>
<li> Its takes too long for me</li>
<li> and I can go to the other side without changing the brush only the position of my hands.</li>
<li> I have had this brush for years, and it finally broke the other day.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t remember how many visits to the beauty salon have left both the stylist and myself frustrated.</li>
<li> if I let it air dry.</li>
<li> /&gt;The secret to straight hair is heat + tension.</li>
<li> No thanks.</li>
<li> My hair isn&#x27;t all that thick but has some natural curl and wave.  </li>
<li> other negative fact is that if I pressed together too hard I end up pulling my hair;  so I have to do it gently</li>
<li> If I recall correctly, I paid less than $10 for the brush I purchased.</li>
<li> I would like to get a replacement, but I think the cost is a little steep.</li>
<li> My hair ends up looking frizzy and fluffy.</li>
<li> I put a little smoothing gel on my bangs, then pull them taut with this brush and aim the hair dryer at them...and voila!...</li>
<li> what I do is take a really small amount of hair so that I can pull hard (with less pain), but</li>
<li> I remember buying one at like target forever ago for no more than $10.</li>
<li> no more burned fingertips</li>
<li> how hard it would be to find it in a store.  </li>
<li> The bristles are not too hard.</li>
<li> really do want to replace my broken, duct-taped brush, but I am shocked at the price of $29.00 for a non-electric hairbrush!</li>
<li> I found it very hard to coordinate both.</li>
<li> but unfortunately it broke.</li>
<li> Crap.</li>
<li> And that&#x27;s all I have to say about this crap</li>
<li> I HATE bangs that curl up!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a all around nice brush. The bristles are not too hard. Of course you should use product on hair to help with gliding process.  I love the color. Its lightweight.  The only con would be that it stays open and doesn&#x27;t close. A simple fix with a hair tie or rubber band.</li>
    <li> I bought my original about 10 years ago....and it finally had a stress brake near the swivel spring. This appears to be the same style, so hope it lasts as long. I like it because the bristle area is about 1 1/2\\&quot; wide and grabs my very curly short hair nicely. My hair is so curly, kinky and wavy if I let it air dry. I&#x27;m thinking Conair must have discontinued this style because I could only find it on Amazon. My original cost about $7-8. Now over $20. But I like how it handles.&lt;br /&gt;Upadate: 1/21/15 Available at Rite-Aid for about half what I paid here.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! I was planning to use this with my blow dryer as the instructions say but found it to be awkward for me because of the bulkiness of the blow dryer and my own dexterity. However, like the above poster, I decided to try it with my flat iron--OMG, it turned out great!!! My hair was so shiny and got so straight! Straighter and shiner than I&#x27;ve ever been able to get it with the flat iron by itself. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this item! It is the only way I get my hair straight! The only down-side is that it breaks about every 3 months and I have to get a new one.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years and then I stepped on it and it broke.  I had no idea how hard it would be to find it in a store.  Found it EASILY on line and bought the Scalpmaster Ceramic Thermal Hair Straightener as a back up.  This is perfect for people with curly hair that want to straighten it while blow drying without making it TOO super straight.  I use it to straighten my bangs. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have silver/gray hair and the flat iron was turning it yellow.  Use this to straighten my hair without the damage of the flat iron heat.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it breaking.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, and I tried to use this with a blow dryer once and it just made my hair poofy and frizzy.  HOWEVER: Once I blow out my hair, I use this to hold the section of hair as I run over it with a flat iron.  I am able to pull my hair straight from root to tip, therefore getting my hair as straight as possible.  I was devastated when my first one broke after about 4 years, but after searching high and low, I finally found it on Amazon and bought two.  So even though it doesn&#x27;t work for me as described, I still found an invaluable hair straightening device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many of these over the years. Can&#x27;t dry my hair straight without it. The only downside is they don&#x27;t last more than a couple of months with regular use. The bristles get damaged with the heat and start falling off, at which point I need a replacement. But like I said, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> The only way I can straighten my hair is with this foolproof brush!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush a really long time ago (2 or 3 years), because I do not like the hair blower directly on my hair; really that was the main reason for me to bought this one, I like the results when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair, its really light and really easy to use and the fact that is double brush I can finish blow drying one side and I can go to the other side without changing the brush only the position of my hands. Because of the way it is designed the hair runs through it and so the blow dryer does not make contact with the hair; I end up with almost no frizz on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be very careful because it happens that when I&#x27;m going to close and start doing my hair it will pinch my hand in an intend for me to stay away from the metallic part that gets really hot when blow-drying.&lt;br /&gt;The other negative fact is that if I pressed together too hard I end up pulling my hair;  so I have to do it gently and when that happens the results are not the same, my hairs does not look sleek as when I really work on pulling the brush trough my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now what I do is take a really small amount of hair so that I can pull hard (with less pain), but Its takes too long for me and I don&#x27;t really have the patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this one for the ones who really have patience and the time to blow-dry their own hair.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this brush.  I have slightly wavy hair and this brush is ideal for straightening it.  I have used one of these for year with good results.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I love it.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these when I was a teenager and LOVED it for my long thick hair, helped me keep it nice and smooth whole blow drying my hair... I forgot about it for the last 10 years and recently thought about it and wanted to by another. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores ANYWHERE. I remember buying one at like target forever ago for no more than $10. I googled it and this Amazon posted came up... But for $24? No thanks. That&#x27;s way over priced for something that&#x27;s basically just a brush... So I did some looking around and found one on Ebay, for $9.99! $3.somethin shipping, so it came out to $13. Not bad at all. Same exact thing. Everyone go check out the ads on Ebay. But regardless, this brush is awesome.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why other companies haven&#x27;t jumped on the bandwagon with an idea like this. I have had this brush for years, and it finally broke the other day. I currently have it taped up with duct tape so I can keep using it. But it is in dire need of replacement at this point, and I couldn&#x27;t find it at the drugstores (where I bought my current one). I have naturally wavy hair, and this brush is the best thing for blow-drying hair straight! I especially use it on my bangs, every day, b/c I HATE bangs that curl up! I put a little smoothing gel on my bangs, then pull them taut with this brush and aim the hair dryer at them...and voila!...straight, smooth bangs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do want to replace my broken, duct-taped brush, but I am shocked at the price of $29.00 for a non-electric hairbrush! Don&#x27;t know if I want to spring for that much money, but I had to be honest and say this is a great product. Kudos to Conair!</li>
    <li> It is kind of cool to look at, but when you use it with a blow dryer, like it advertises, makes your hair smell burnt.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many visits to the beauty salon have left both the stylist and myself frustrated. They attempt to gently comb out my hair with a blowdryer, then try to comb it with a straightener. My hair ends up looking frizzy and fluffy. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to straight hair is heat + tension. This brush gives the tension to make the straightener effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lets me go from pubey-looking curly frizzy hair to sleek and straight sexy hair in under 15 mins. I do my hair in six sections: Clip up the top 2/3rds of my hair, straighten the right and left sides of the bottom layer. Let down half of what&#x27;s clipped up, repeat with rhe right and left sides. Then the top layer in 2 sections. Done. Be sure to use a smoothing serum!</li>
    <li> this product is not as claimed. its not that easy to use as they say. I would not recommend to buy this.  if I could return it I would.</li>
    <li> I have had a Conair straightening brush for years and loved it!  When it broke I couldn&#x27;t find another one in stores so purchased on line.  The brush I received is not the same as the one I had before or as pictured.  The bristle base is much wider on the new one and it doesn&#x27;t collapse for easy storage. I haven&#x27;t used it yet - so can&#x27;t speak to how it performs.  Hopefully it works just like my old one - which was GREAT while using my flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have had a brush like this for many years and I must say it works wonderfully while blow drying or flat ironing your hair. It recently broke and I replaced it a similar brush by Chi, about $15. I must say the Conair definitely worked better than the Chi. If I recall correctly, I paid less than $10 for the brush I purchased. I would like to get a replacement, but I think the cost is a little steep.</li>
    <li> I had this awhile ago but unfortunately it broke. I use this product when flat ironing my hair and i love it because instead of grabbing the hot hair with my fingers and burning them..i can use the brush to grab it. It works perfectly..no more burned fingertips</li>
    <li> I bought this because I really want to use one product on my hair - right now I blow dry quickly and then use a straightener.  I get pretty good results from this but wanted to cut it down to one appliance (I tried the Remington Wet2Dry straightener and did not like it).  Well, this is not the way to go - since the brush is like a straightener itself, you really need 2 hands to do it properly but then there&#x27;s the dryer.  I found it very hard to coordinate both. When I first do a pull through it&#x27;s fine for the top of the strands, but when I get down to the bottom the dryer just blows it around anyway so that the straightening doesn&#x27;t stick.  I went back to using the 2 appliances and will just have to live with that.  Also, don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s $25 on here - they sell it at the drugstore for $10.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well.  My hair isn&#x27;t all that thick but has some natural curl and wave.  I tried this with the hope of straightening it and getting rid of frizz.  No luck.</li>
    <li> Crap. And that&#x27;s all I have to say about this crap</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! 100 times better than the Denman brushes and way better for your hair than a straightening iron.</li>
