### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>You changed your formula and ruined the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just perfect!!</li>
      <li>Best part: the price is better than in the stores and it was delivered to my door!</li>
      <li>Great price for the size</li>
      <li>I must say that this shampoo and condition is really great.  </li>
      <li>makes my hair feeling great, tried a sample size before</li>
      <li>Is just what he ordered at a good price.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to do this in over 10 years!</li>
      <li>Best shampoo ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Loving the new formula...</li>
      <li>I have used Joico shampoo for many years and continue to love it.  </li>
      <li>But this is still okay.</li>
      <li>Pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Many shampoos have a strong herbal or chemical scent which makes me sneeze.  </li>
      <li>I tore open&lt;br /&gt;the box and plastic wrapper and found that the bottle top was not attached securely.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine</li>
      <li>I bought this again from Amazon seller &amp;#34;Green Dishes.&amp;#34; It was a huge mistake...</li>
      <li>This is a huge feat for me since I&#x27;ve been greasy all my life and tried everything to no avail.</li>
      <li>Great Daily use shampoo</li>
      <li>This is a new formula--not the one I&#x27;ve been using for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>Also, pregnant and nursing while using this.</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a mild scent.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent with almost a hint of pineapple that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses as I am extremely sensitive to odors.  </li>
      <li>I really liked it and decided to try some other products.  </li>
      <li>It strips every ounce of life right out of my hair, making it so darn squeaky clean that I can barely get a comb through it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cleans very well and does not strip my hair.</li>
      <li>I tried clarifying, gentle shampoos meant for babies, cowashing, skipping, and all sorts of rinses.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t probably purchase again for my hair type although it claims to be for normal hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair with natural volume</li>
      <li>Completely misleading advertising.</li>
      <li>So I am very upset and want my money back!  </li>
      <li>My hair are much cleaner and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most shampoos either makes my hair too dry or weighs it down.  </li>
      <li>The previous Daily Care had an enriching conditioner combined in the same bottle, and I was able to use a single product daily, I have normal hair type (not dry, colored or oily).</li>
      <li>the old formula for Joico Daily Care!</li>
      <li>This one builds up too quickly, making my hair feel heavy and gross.</li>
      <li>If you compare the ingredients to the old formula you can see that the quality has decreased significantly.</li>
      <li>The postman will be really upset when he sees the mess that this shampoo bottle with the lid unscrewed left in his post office box!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a new formula--not the one I&#x27;ve been using for many, many years.  It strips every ounce of life right out of my hair, making it so darn squeaky clean that I can barely get a comb through it.  I&#x27;m no longer a Joico customer--last week I switched to a Matrix/Biolage product.</li>
    <li> I have used Joico shampoo for many years and continue to love it.  It has a light scent with almost a hint of pineapple that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the senses as I am extremely sensitive to odors.  Best part: the price is better than in the stores and it was delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> Arrived with a broken nozzle. Had to send back</li>
    <li> The postman will be really upset when he sees the mess that this shampoo bottle with the lid unscrewed left in his post office box!&lt;br /&gt;Even though the bottle was wrapped in plastic, the shampoo flowed into the Amazon box and then into my mailbox!  I tore open&lt;br /&gt;the box and plastic wrapper and found that the bottle top was not attached securely.  I had bought this shampoo to match the&lt;br /&gt;green Joico Conditioner bottle that I had at home.  However, this Joico shampoo bottle was dark BLUE!  So I am very upset and want my money back!  The product spilled into the box and the container is the wrong color than was advertised!  Disgusted!  I rate it a&lt;br /&gt;ZERO but am forced by the system to give it a ONE.</li>
    <li> Great price for the size</li>
    <li> Great Daily use shampoo</li>
    <li> Not happy they changed the formula from the old triage. But this is still okay. Feels a little like it builds up over time. The triage didn&#x27;t feel that way to me! Don&#x27;t need to condition as often with this formula. My hair is fine but I have a LOT of it. Also, pregnant and nursing while using this. May make a difference...</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well for me.  I have thin hair.  Most shampoos either makes my hair too dry or weighs it down.  Not this one.  Many shampoos have a strong herbal or chemical scent which makes me sneeze.  This shampoo has a mild scent.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feeling great, tried a sample size before and so thankful I came across this product. Leaves my hair with natural volume</li>
    <li> Packaging was poor so product leaked. Left hair feeling a bit oily. Wouldn&#x27;t probably purchase again for my hair type although it claims to be for normal hair.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I bought this again from Amazon seller &amp;#34;Green Dishes.&amp;#34; It was a huge mistake...the shampoo did not foam, was so watery it fell through my fingers, and was so bad that I had to wash it from my hair with a different shampoo. I THREW OUT the bottle and will never buy shampoo online again. The experience was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring back the old formula for Joico Daily Care! Just like another reviewer stated, this one strips my hair and leaves it flat and without volume. The previous Daily Care had an enriching conditioner combined in the same bottle, and I was able to use a single product daily, I have normal hair type (not dry, colored or oily). I also ordered the &amp;#34;grey bottle color&amp;#34; here on Amazon and had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve talked with local beauticians and beauty supply stores and they as so confused with the color-coded bottles, name changes and re-branding of this company products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has suggestions for an alternative to this product please advise in comments below. I am looking for a product that can be used daily, add volume, and not strip my hair. Thank you!</li>
    <li> A salesperson at a hair product store recommended the spray on conditioner/detangler to me.  I really liked it and decided to try some other products.  I must say that this shampoo and condition is really great.  It leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shampoo and it arrived as promised... Is just what he ordered at a good price. Pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This was not what was advertised.  The color of bottle advertised was tan which is the discontinued shampoo and conditioner. I received the current blue bottle which replaced the product.  Would not have ordered it if I knew this, I can get the same thing from my hairdresser for less money.  Completely misleading advertising.</li>
    <li> This one builds up too quickly, making my hair feel heavy and gross. I would not buy it again. Pitty</li>
    <li> I seem to be the only one who likes this shampoo. Judging by previous reviews, I have been using the reformulated version. This has been my HG shampoo since 2014 and the reason I come back to it is because it&#x27;s made my scalp LESS OILY. This is a huge feat for me since I&#x27;ve been greasy all my life and tried everything to no avail. I tried clarifying, gentle shampoos meant for babies, cowashing, skipping, and all sorts of rinses. Typically, I wash my hair in the evening and its oily by late next morning. It took about 1 month of daily use to notice a difference but now I can skip a wash if I wanted to. I haven&#x27;t been able to do this in over 10 years! It truly is balancing. It&#x27;s cleans very well and does not strip my hair.</li>
    <li> Terrible!!!  I used this shampoo, almost daily, for five years.  It leaves an awful build-up over time and feels terrible when shampooing.  If you compare the ingredients to the old formula you can see that the quality has decreased significantly.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Loving the new formula... My hair are much cleaner and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using it for a while now and it&#x27;s just perfect!!</li>
    <li> What have you done?  You changed your formula and ruined the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
