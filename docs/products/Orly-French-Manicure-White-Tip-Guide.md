### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best tip guide I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>Loved them!!!</li>
      <li>and I thought these would be the perfect aide.</li>
      <li>I was so happy so use these.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for an at-home manicure that you can easily touch up yourself!</li>
      <li>/&gt;And OMG, it worked amazingly!</li>
      <li>looks AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Will buy more!</li>
      <li>I love these stickers!  </li>
      <li>Better then the Sally Hensen (sp?) Brand!</li>
      <li>A steady hand and good eye for proportion are all you need to apply them and get excellent results.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to know how many stickers in the package I&#x27;m ordering!</li>
      <li>Most of the time I can get them to stick fairly well -</li>
      <li>They are a perfect guide and stay \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; while you paint, but easily peel off and don&#x27;t leave much residue, if any!  </li>
      <li>That being an indication that I am far from a pro, I can do a perfect American/French manicure using these guides.</li>
      <li>I switched over to the clear gel and started painting the tips on by hand, but that took forever to get the perfect C curve.</li>
      <li>Love these, makes at home frenches perfect and professional!</li>
      <li>What a great product to make my life and nails quick and easy, without sacrificing the salon look I love.</li>
      <li>They should be more like a Post-</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Most people have 10 fingers, what use would I have for the 2 remaining guides?</li>
      <li>A better, nicer-looking curve.  </li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I think that they worked better then the Sally Hansen stickers.  </li>
      <li>Left perfect lines &amp; people though I went to the salon to get then done, I did silver tips with 2 coats of OPI Crown Me</li>
      <li>It stays in place and creates a very clean line.</li>
      <li>Useful and cute!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done non-gel free hand and had better results.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased that Orly makes these available without the kit.  </li>
      <li>they removed easily and kept the polish color from bleeding through.</li>
      <li>Ruins the perfect manicure.  </li>
      <li>I was super excited to receive this product in the mail, as I love the tip look.</li>
      <li>once the LED light has it set -</li>
      <li>These stick better than the generic kind I got at Ulta.  </li>
      <li>Much easier than using acetone/polish remove and a brush to shape the tip/moon (which takes even greater steadiness and eye for proportion than these.)    </li>
      <li>For french manicures, or other types of two tone nails, they help make a more perfect result than just estimating.</li>
      <li>Super easy and fast.  </li>
      <li>I allowed it to dry for a good hour.</li>
      <li>And, the adhesive really worked well!!</li>
      <li>look since that is the only thing I&#x27;m authorized to wear in the military, but it never look flawless.  </li>
      <li>let it dry until its tacky, then apply the sticker to the tip of their nails and trim the edges, then put a clear coat over them when the polish dries and you have a perfect professional looking manicure!</li>
      <li>They are as good as any other brand for their purpose.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, if you really press these on and are okay with minor smudge you can&#x27;t remove, these are okay.  </li>
      <li>it peeled parts of the nail polish right off the nail bed.  </li>
      <li>I tried them and maybe I didn&#x27;t use them right</li>
      <li>These worked pretty well for doing my own french tip manicures.</li>
      <li>They help reduce the time it takes to create the perfect french tip look, which is extremely important to a mom that works and lately people have been asking where I get my nails done.  </li>
      <li>these tips were easy to apply, really made it look like a professional job and were just the right price for every budget.  </li>
      <li>First off, the package contains 52 guides.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to attempt using them once more with a different polish, however, I do think the pack should come with either 50 or 60.</li>
      <li>They were exactly what I was looking for (a replacement for the Sally Hansen stickers that are no longer sold).</li>
      <li>I have not tried, or even thought of until reading the first two reviews, doing a moon manicure.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use, only slight bleed through which is not a problem with the gelish polish as anything under the tip is not set by the light and easily wipes off.  </li>
      <li>I think the key is to find the right gel polish, one that applies easily and doesn&#x27;t bleed/</li>
      <li>Pressing down firmly after applying makes sure your edge is nice and clean looking.</li>
      <li>I am very particular about details, so it&#x27;s not that it just \\&quot;looks</li>
      <li>really wanted to do this at home but was wondering how the heck i was going to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>What is there really to say.</li>
      <li>These nail guides have too much adhesive.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I place the guides on, paint my tips the cool sparkly blue green I liked, pull off the guides and BAM.</li>
      <li>Being very dominantly right handed, I am not good at doing my own nails.</li>
      <li>But when I used them I waited for them to dry, and when I took them off, the polish had bled unerneath, not giving it a smooth line like it should have done.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a steady hand</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t stick and the curve was too high to use on my nails.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I totally fudge the right hand whenever I do color (getting it into cuticles, etc.)  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper than paying for french tips at a salon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional cosmetologist and do nails through out my work day, and always recommend these to my clients.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to completely eliminate bleeding underneath.  </li>
      <li>but I kept having leaks because it was not flat on my nail.</li>

<li> suggested we use these little french manicure stickers.</li>

<li> Once in place, press on firmly to prevent polish from seeping under.  </li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> A few weeks ago, I ordered those 10-package set from China.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried really pressing them on, applying before any product is used, putting on a coat of base polish at the tips, then applying the white tip from side to side.  </li>
<li> I do have to adjust the curve for some of my smaller nails, but I haven&#x27;t found that very difficult to do.</li>
<li> Consequently, it leaves a residue behind.  </li>
<li> I was not impressed with these, maybe I did them wrong.  </li>
<li> I suggest they paint their base color,</li>
<li> fade into the base coat.  </li>
<li> These are horrible.  </li>

    <li> I love these stickers!  They are a perfect guide and stay \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; while you paint, but easily peel off and don&#x27;t leave much residue, if any!  (Use a little alcohol if you do have residue-I usually don&#x27;t have any left on the nail when I take the sticker off)  Perfect for an at-home manicure that you can easily touch up yourself!</li>
    <li> Being very dominantly right handed, I am not good at doing my own nails. I totally fudge the right hand whenever I do color (getting it into cuticles, etc.)  That being an indication that I am far from a pro, I can do a perfect American/French manicure using these guides. I am very particular about details, so it&#x27;s not that it just \\&quot;looks OK.\\&quot;  A steady hand and good eye for proportion are all you need to apply them and get excellent results.  Once in place, press on firmly to prevent polish from seeping under.  Even on my first time or two, I did not encounter any problems other than the guide removing a tiny bit of base coat from one nail.  Much easier than using acetone/polish remove and a brush to shape the tip/moon (which takes even greater steadiness and eye for proportion than these.)    I have not tried, or even thought of until reading the first two reviews, doing a moon manicure.  I think I will and, using these guides, approach it with confidence.    I am pleased that Orly makes these available without the kit.  Preferring American manicure over French (tips are too unnaturally white for my taste)and having plenty of base, top and colors already, I would not use the other products included with the kits.</li>
    <li> The hottest manicure around is the moon manicure!&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to do this at home but was wondering how the heck i was going to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;Then I was reading instyle magazine online yesterday and they had a &#x27;how to&#x27; on the hottest manicures of the season.&lt;br /&gt;They suggested we use these little french manicure stickers. So I ran out and bought some to try it.&lt;br /&gt;And OMG, it worked amazingly! I love it. I&#x27;m going to try to upload a photo of my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;It looks AMAZING! Try it!</li>
    <li> What is there really to say. They stick well &amp; do their job. Much cheaper than paying for french tips at a salon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing nail sets for about 8 years.  Within the last 3 months I&#x27;ve started doing my nailes at home.  I use teh IBD gel set.  I started with the white and pink for the french tip look since that is the only thing I&#x27;m authorized to wear in the military, but it never look flawless.  I switched over to the clear gel and started painting the tips on by hand, but that took forever to get the perfect C curve. I just started using these tips and I love them.  They help reduce the time it takes to create the perfect french tip look, which is extremely important to a mom that works and lately people have been asking where I get my nails done.  Super easy and fast.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried them and maybe I didn&#x27;t use them right but I kept having leaks because it was not flat on my nail. So I ended up having to just do it by hand which was tough because I don&#x27;t have a steady hand. I&#x27;ll try again and next time I think I may just cut them slightly.</li>
    <li> these tips were easy to apply, really made it look like a professional job and were just the right price for every budget.  I would definately use these for every french manicure i wanted to do.  they removed easily and kept the polish color from bleeding through.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with these, maybe I did them wrong.  But when I used them I waited for them to dry, and when I took them off, the polish had bled unerneath, not giving it a smooth line like it should have done.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> These worked pretty well for doing my own french tip manicures. I would buy again. The only negative is that after you peel them off you need to go over a few spots with nail polish remover sometimes because its not perfectly clean each time but this was how its always been for me with every nail strip ive used. Id buy these again!</li>
    <li> I was so happy so use these.  They were exactly what I was looking for (a replacement for the Sally Hansen stickers that are no longer sold). In fact, I think that they worked better then the Sally Hansen stickers.  They stuck well and kept nail polish from sneaking under which is a problem with some products.  A few weeks ago, I ordered those 10-package set from China.  I opted for the cheaper product and got what I paid for!  They didn&#x27;t stick and the curve was too high to use on my nails. I will definitely buy these from Orly the next time I need them!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  These nail guides have too much adhesive.  Consequently, it leaves a residue behind.  When I used it over a nail polish - I was trying to do a nontraditional manicure- it peeled parts of the nail polish right off the nail bed.  My niece also tried to use them and had the same experience.</li>
    <li> These are horrible.  The nail polish leaks undernieth them and they are too sticky so that the polish lifts with them.  They should be more like a Post-It note sticky but they are sticky like masking tape.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Loved them!!! And, the adhesive really worked well!! Left perfect lines &amp; people though I went to the salon to get then done, I did silver tips with 2 coats of OPI Crown Me Already over the silver and 2 coats of Seche Vite, total time was 25 mins and lasted 10 days!! Will buy more! Better then the Sally Hensen (sp?) Brand!</li>
    <li> Much better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  A better, nicer-looking curve.  Also easier to remove.  Work well.</li>
    <li> They are as good as any other brand for their purpose. No complaints.  For french manicures, or other types of two tone nails, they help make a more perfect result than just estimating.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done -- whether you want a half moon mani or a french tip mani. Useful and cute!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, only slight bleed through which is not a problem with the gelish polish as anything under the tip is not set by the light and easily wipes off.  What a great product to make my life and nails quick and easy, without sacrificing the salon look I love.</li>
    <li> It would be nice to know how many stickers in the package I&#x27;m ordering!</li>
    <li> This is the best tip guide I&#x27;ve ever tried. It stays in place and creates a very clean line. I use it to paint my nail tips colors instead of just a french nail look. I do have to adjust the curve for some of my smaller nails, but I haven&#x27;t found that very difficult to do. Pressing down firmly after applying makes sure your edge is nice and clean looking.</li>
    <li> These stick better than the generic kind I got at Ulta.  However, I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to completely eliminate bleeding underneath.  Most of the time I can get them to stick fairly well - but then there&#x27;s that one spot on 2 of the nails... Ruins the perfect manicure.  I&#x27;ve got a steady hand and I am going to experiment with different gel brands to find the one that I don&#x27;t need a guide.  Guides may or may not let color bleed under, color I can&#x27;t remove once the LED light has it set - but I can&#x27;t see it until the guide is removed.  I&#x27;ve tried really pressing them on, applying before any product is used, putting on a coat of base polish at the tips, then applying the white tip from side to side.  But I still have 2 nails with a smidge of white mistake.  I&#x27;ve done non-gel free hand and had better results.  I think the key is to find the right gel polish, one that applies easily and doesn&#x27;t bleed/fade into the base coat.  I&#x27;ll let you know what works.  In the meantime, if you really press these on and are okay with minor smudge you can&#x27;t remove, these are okay.  And... if anyone knows how to get these on 100%, so that no white mistake seeps under, please share.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this product in the mail, as I love the tip look. I&#x27;m always looking for different color, style combos to do with my nails and I thought these would be the perfect aide. I&#x27;ve only tried them once, and I am severely dissapointed. First off, the package contains 52 guides. Why would someone need 52? Most people have 10 fingers, what use would I have for the 2 remaining guides? Next, I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;. I applied my base coat, a nice neutral beige color. I allowed it to dry for a good hour. I place the guides on, paint my tips the cool sparkly blue green I liked, pull off the guides and BAM. There goes my beige color. The guide ripped the polish off. I gave the item 3 stars, because it could be a solid product. I&#x27;m going to attempt using them once more with a different polish, however, I do think the pack should come with either 50 or 60.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional cosmetologist and do nails through out my work day, and always recommend these to my clients. But not in the traditional way!! I suggest they paint their base color, let it dry until its tacky, then apply the sticker to the tip of their nails and trim the edges, then put a clear coat over them when the polish dries and you have a perfect professional looking manicure! Love these, makes at home frenches perfect and professional!</li>
