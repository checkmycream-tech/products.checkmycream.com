### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great pricing!</li>
      <li>Best product for at home hair coloring!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with he way</li>
      <li>and she said they work great.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also not so great</li>
      <li>the dispenser isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>I guess I am still searching for a good dye stain</li>
      <li>The wipes work WONDERFULLY (moisturizing, and smell good too), but getting them &amp;#34;started&amp;#34; through the lid is too much of a challenge, and because of this I would not buy again!</li>
      <li>I dye my hair, they kind of have a strong smell</li>
      <li>These wipes removed most of the color on my neck</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I have used these and they work for the most part.</li>
      <li>Removed excess dye from skin and counter top</li>
      <li>These work pretty good</li>
      <li>They work really good and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>They easily remove hair color from your skin.  </li>
      <li>It does have a really strong smell so you will have to wash your hands 2-3 times with soap after using it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do a very good job of removing my dark auburn hair color from my ears &amp; forehead</li>
      <li>I was looking for the individually wrapped hair color remove wipes, but these will do nicely!</li>
      <li>And there are several wipes for the good price.</li>
      <li>miracle in a tub, these work great even on black</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t tend to get contact dermatitis from products, and my scalp was perfectly happy even after 2 sessions with hair bleach (which was not near the affected spot), so I was surprised to have a reaction from the wipe-off.</li>
      <li>They work very very well</li>
      <li>I have used a variety of different dyes to dye my hair bright red/pinkish red and these wipes have nearly always been able to remove the dye from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>I gave 2 stars because they do actually work for the most part.</li>
      <li>They do a decent job removing color though! ^_^</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something that really  removes dye stains, this is not it.</li>
      <li>but for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat since they work really well.</li>
      <li>It removes about as much stain as soap and water.</li>
      <li>Very well thought out.</li>
      <li>Because of this, I can&#x27;t really say I would recommend them.</li>
      <li>This is good for removing stains on the skin, but it is a very small container and each wipe is about 2 inches x 2 inches.  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest trying this for people who color their hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So maybe be careful and gentle, especially if it&#x27;s on your hairline around your face, or on more sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I just wish the actual wipes were a larger size and the container was a little more user friendly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I do not have sensitive skin and never have.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>They wipe off any haircolor on her skin easily without rubbing hard.</li>
      <li>I also like the narrow profile, making them easy to store flat in a drawer.</li>
      <li>Barely works.  </li>
      <li>But I rubbed the towelette to get the stain off my neck, and apparently that made a difference.</li>
      <li>I hope the product does not dry out in its package.  </li>
      <li>I am a pretty messy person when it comes to hair dye</li>

    <li> This product works like a dream. I just wish the actual wipes were a larger size and the container was a little more user friendly. The hole that the wipes poke out from was really small so it was sort of hard to get it all set up but for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat since they work really well.</li>
    <li> Smell is terrible, but does what it says on the box. Removed excess dye from skin and counter top pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 downsides. 1) the smell lingers 2) the dispenser isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> I bought them because I split some colour drops sometime. They remove the colour on skin and on the towel.</li>
    <li> They work really good and the shipping was fast. I will be using these everytime I dye my hair, they kind of have a strong smell but it is not to bad.</li>
    <li> I discovered that these remove scuff marks and newspaper ink from semi-gloss painted surfaces.  And, hair dye. I also like the narrow profile, making them easy to store flat in a drawer. Class 5 recyclable container.  Has parabens and not made in the USA.    No one listed all the ingredients when I bought this, so I&#x27;m including them:     Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s on my label  \\&quot;aqua, sodium laureth sulfate, benzyl alcohol, sd slcohol, propylene glycol, triethanolamine, glycerin, fragrance, polysorbate 80,methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, phenoxyethanol, sorbitan monooleate, ammonium hydroxide, polyaminopropyl biguanide, allantoin, bisabolol, pathenol, aloe extract, xanthan gum\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a very good job of removing my dark auburn hair color from my ears &amp; forehead</li>
    <li> I was shoced this worked so well.  I am very happy with he way it removed dark brown color from my face and skin.  The wipes have a very low odor and don&#x27;t feel like I am using harsh chemicals.  I highly suggest trying this for people who color their hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback, the wipes are tiny.  Like the size of a dollar bill folded in half.  They are very thin.</li>
    <li> Barely works.  These are very small wipes.  If you color your hair, you know you would like these to be bigger than 2x2  (or close).  They&#x27;re also not so great so I ended up using quite a lot of them to remove the excess color on my face, ears, and the drips around my hairline.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the individually wrapped hair color remove wipes, but these will do nicely!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mother and she said they work great. They wipe off any haircolor on her skin easily without rubbing hard. And there are several wipes for the good price.</li>
    <li> They work okay. One glop of semi-permanent vegetable dye had dripped onto the back of my neck. I used the towelette on it, and the rubbed spot was a flaky scab the next day. I don&#x27;t tend to get contact dermatitis from products, and my scalp was perfectly happy even after 2 sessions with hair bleach (which was not near the affected spot), so I was surprised to have a reaction from the wipe-off. I had used it for a spot or two on my wrist, no problem. But I rubbed the towelette to get the stain off my neck, and apparently that made a difference. So maybe be careful and gentle, especially if it&#x27;s on your hairline around your face, or on more sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These remover wipes work.  I wish they were a bit bigger.  They easily remove hair color from your skin.  I tried rubbing alcohol and when that did not work, I found these wipes work well.</li>
    <li> I used this to get the purple hair dye off of my hands after dying my daughter&#x27;s hair. I am a pretty messy person when it comes to hair dye and it got every bit off of me. It does have a really strong smell so you will have to wash your hands 2-3 times with soap after using it. But it does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> The wipes work WONDERFULLY (moisturizing, and smell good too), but getting them &amp;#34;started&amp;#34; through the lid is too much of a challenge, and because of this I would not buy again! Argh.</li>
    <li> This product works and does not smell.  I hope the product does not dry out in its package.  Very well thought out.</li>
    <li> It does remove the stain/dye from my skin.  Hope that it would remove the stain/dye from my carpet, but it didn&#x27;t. :(</li>
    <li> I gave 2 stars because they do actually work for the most part. I have used a variety of different dyes to dye my hair bright red/pinkish red and these wipes have nearly always been able to remove the dye from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not have sensitive skin and never have. These wipes seem to chemically burn my skin, leaving irritated scabby marks on my neck and face. Because of this, I can&#x27;t really say I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have used these and they work for the most part. I apply a petroleum product to my hairline and ears to minimize the use of these when possible.</li>
    <li> These wipes removed most of the color on my neck but my neck then started to burn and now looks like it&#x27;s starting to get a rash. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so this is a little strange. Oh and it does get color out of the tub and tile if you have no choice but to rinse off in the shower.</li>
    <li> It took a while to receive but the item worked quite well for removing &amp;#34;splat&amp;#34; hair dye that I had used.</li>
    <li> I think a damp cloth would work just as well.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that really  removes dye stains, this is not it. It removes about as much stain as soap and water. I guess I am still searching for a good dye stain remover-- if it exists.</li>
    <li> These work pretty good but they burn my skin a little bit. They do a decent job removing color though! ^_^</li>
    <li> miracle in a tub, these work great even on black</li>
    <li> This is good for removing stains on the skin, but it is a very small container and each wipe is about 2 inches x 2 inches.  I keep it in a small zip-lock bag to prevent the wipes from drying-out.</li>
    <li> These will remove color from your body as well as the countertops, tub etc!  They work very very well</li>
    <li> Best product for at home hair coloring!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great pricing!</li>
    <li> burns your skin!! bought it to remove eyebrow color off my skin.</li>
