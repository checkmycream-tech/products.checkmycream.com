<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this moisturizer every day for about one and a half weeks...then i started getting little bumps all over my face that really itch. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m allergic too but something in this!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream and nice moisture leaves in the skin</li>
    <li> I found this cream last spring and I love it.  It dissolves into my face skin amazingly!  Very good quality and makes me feel healthy.  Nice citrus fragrance.  I use this cream for Spring to Autumn.  After October, I switched to their night cream (Purple design) which has lavender fragrance for day time use and it was also great!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because it&#x27;s one of the best as far as ingredients go, but I&#x27;m afraid it leaves my skin a little dry. I still prefer it to other lotions because I know that when I am using it, I am not poisoning my body :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so light and not greesy I loved it .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it or hate it...it had a strong citrus scent which is a bit too overwhelming for me, and it had a slight &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; residue if you glide your finger on your skin after application. Not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> love it. I&#x27;m 33. My skin is happy</li>
    <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out but I don&#x27;t have the feeling it is doing anything good either. My skin stills feel dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cream! If I run out, I definitely notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I am blown away by this product line. I have used EVERYTHING, including very expensive lines. This is my all-time favorite. I purchased 6 products &amp; find each of them superb.</li>
    <li> This cream is already brightening my complexion.  I love the citrus fragrance, non-greasy, tightening, light texture.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff! Only one con - that it wasn&#x27;t very big. It does tell you that, though, 1.75 oz. I just wish for the money that there was more.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, it&#x27;s very rich and has the BEST beautiful citrusy smell without being even kind of drying. It&#x27;s so dense and nice.&lt;br /&gt;My skin smiles every morning with this cream. If it lasts more than a month, I&#x27;d say definitely worth it - and it looks like it should!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a discernable difference in how firm my skin is too, and I also have some rosacea on my cheek that seems to be fading (maybe from the citrus?).</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased this product from another seller and I was in love with it. Bought it on Amazon since I have Prime and pretty sure it was watered down. The seal was on as it should have been for a new product; however the color is lighter than it should be, more white than the usual yellow, and the lovely distinct citrus smell it should have it very faint. Since the price is the same with other sellers I will purchase it elsewhere next time. I has not done anything terrible to my skin so far after a months or so of use.</li>
    <li> Great smell and texture. I am a fan!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different &#x27;clean&#x27; no additive daily moisturizers and this by far is the best. Feels great, lasts long, fresh scent. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, it was just what my granddaughter wanted.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent on this cream.  Moisturizes nicely.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Found out about this product in Birchbox or ipsy and fell in love. It&#x27;s a thick cream that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily or greasy. It absorbs into your skin well and lasts all day. Definitely expensive at $14-$17 for less than 2 oz. but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I have used on my face.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cream! Light, not greasy...and has a clean, citrus smell!! I use it every day under my makeup. Love that it has clean ingredients, with no toxins. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this cream, I m not a typical buyer, that write a review but for this product I feel I should. Works wonderful .</li>
    <li> This smells nice and citrus-y.  I have no idea what Chlorella is or what stem cells have to do with anything, but it goes on smooth and wears well under makeup.</li>
    <li> Our local organic market had samples of this at their bi-yearly skin and vitamin product sale. Fell in love with this. Am 68 years old. This product has diminished lines in my face and gives it a fresh young glow. Love that it is made of organic products. Amazon has the best price I can find. I plan to purchase more of their products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this day cream, would be better if it had SPF in it though!! Acure please come out with a product with natural SPF!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and feels great. Hopefully it will make a difference</li>
    <li> wonderful smell..makes your skin feel like silk...</li>
    <li> This has been working wonders for me. My face looks a lot more youthful, and I can even get away without wearing my once necessary concealer. It smells fantastic (like an orange peel) and I love knowing how natural it is. I&#x27;ll be buying again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many skin care protects and have found this line to be my favorite.  The price and quality are great.  I would consider it mid-weight with no greasy or waxy feeling.  The smell is a light orange carrot cake scent.  It is a light scent so it doesn&#x27;t linger on your face all day.  I would highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great day cream and nice smell too. Can get a bit too greasy in the summer if you live in a humid place.</li>
    <li> I love the cream I have sensitive skin and  I have such a hard time finding cream that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and this one&#x27;s great and  I love the smell it&#x27;s kind of citrusy almost</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion.  It does not irritate my skin. Instead, it looks and smells fresh and moisturized. It&#x27;s the best I have used on my face since the original st ives formula of the callogen elastin lotion. The acure facial day cream always had a nice light yellow look and smells citrusy. However, the two I received yesterday looks white and not light yellow like the old formula. The old formula that was light yellow had a nice citrusy smell and looks like it&#x27;s filled with good citrus carroty stuff. In this batch, something is less than usual and for this reason, I am returning it. I cannot stand when companies sneak in an inferior batch of their product when they either ran low on an ingredient or secretly change the formula. I really expected every ingredient to be scientifically the same, but my senses tells me that it is not. Lost one star for inconsistency. Please see image I have attached. Note the difference in colour.</li>
    <li> I will never use any other product line. This product has a light citrus scent that I love! My skin is combination, and after using this I feel my skin is more balanced and toned. I highly recommend this day cream.</li>
    <li> I did not like this moisturizer. It was so thin, that I did not feel I got any moisture from the application. The smell also bothered me. I returned this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate this cream, but I don&#x27;t love it like I had hoped I would either. It smells like oranges, which is pleasant and it isn&#x27;t greasy, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel soft while it was on.  It is a decent moisturizer, but nothing special. I also got small, red bumps on my face, but not sure if it was the Aure Day Cream or possibly the Acure Night Cream, using the Serum over it as recommended by the manufacturer. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! Smells amazing and makes my skin feel so healthy. Just keep it far from your eye are, it tends to migrate a bit and it stings the eyes!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and moisturizers often do not work for me. This works great and it&#x27;s vegan! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and that is smells so good, but it left my face very greasy and I only used a small amount. Too bad; I really wanted to love this cream. Looks like I&#x27;m still on the hunt for an all natural, lightweight face cream :(</li>
    <li> I have now tried 4 different skincare products from Acure and I love this brand! I just purchased their mask and am sure it will be surpass my expectation!</li>
    <li> i love the smell and the feel of this cream. it smells like oranges and citrus fruits. it&#x27;s a little thin compared to the night cream. my only issue with its a little oil and looks like i just rubbed Nivea body lotion all over my face. but it&#x27;s a good base for my concealer and an over all good cream.</li>
    <li> This is my second Acure day cream order. So far I have really enjoyed this product. I have fair, sensitive skin and this product has not caused me any sensitivity or breakouts.</li>
    <li> i have very fragile sensitive and allergy prone skin i decided to try something new it was a mistake, my skin looks like it&#x27;s burnt, red and swollen, it may be a good cream for other type skin, both the night and day was terrible for me. i will never try anything new again. c k.</li>
    <li> In a last couple of years I have developed multiple food and chemical allergies and sensitivities. I had to stop using all traditional cosmetics and look for safer options. I am extremely happy about this product. I am able to use it safely without exacerbation of any of my symptoms. There is a subtle orange fragrance that makes this product much nicer than unscented creams available on the market. That fragrance is very gentle though and does not cause any allergic reactions for me. I wish the price was lower. If I find a similar product for a lower price I would switch for that reason only.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after a lot research on environmental sites... I am not much impressed. I have been using it for a while and it didn&#x27;t do anything special to my skin. I have dry skin. Feels like a waste of time because I wanted my skin to feel better at least, if not look better.</li>
    <li> The texture of this cream is light and I love the coverage. Few little drops , its all I need for my face and neck. The cream smells fresh and natural, no  fake  floral smell here. Overall, I like the cream a lot and will order again.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought it, so there&#x27;s gotta be something about it, right? My skin absorbs it in second and it feels great! I 33 and my skin looks great! Of course, what you eat matters, but this moisturizer just supplements what I eat.</li>
    <li> I used this product before, from Whole Foods, thought I would order it instead.  Great product to use on your face!</li>
    <li> Excellent day cream.  Blends well, no unpleasant fragrance and great moisture.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face lotion from Acure, smells great</li>
    <li> I love this day cream.  I use it with the Seriously Firming Serum every morning and it just makes my skin feel great.  I do have super dry skin and it&#x27;s perfect.  Love love that this company is also cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I love how this smells. Like oranges! It feels pretty cooling and is very moisturizing. I skipped around moisturizers for a while and finally decided I liked this one best.</li>
    <li> It is not smooth enough.  A little sticky.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t break me out! I hate synthetic fragrances, this moisturizer is perfect and I have difficult skin.</li>
    <li> A great all round lotion for your face. Love this clean smelling lotion, penetrates the face fast. My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s great for my skin.  Smells great and does the job too.  What more could you ask for?  Yes it&#x27;s not got a lot of buzz marketing behind it but I am so pleased I discovered this brand.  My skin looks the best it ever has and I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really makes your skin soft and youthful. Very pleasant citrusy smell. The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream!  I have combination complexion; that is, T-zone still rather oily (and I am old!) and the rest, normal to dry.  I can use this cream as a base for my makeup or, used more generously, as a night cream.  It soaks in rapidly and feels great.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It feels great and it actually smells like oranges.</li>
    <li> Definitely not creamy enough for me and leaves skin looking dull and I hate that. Might work well for someone looking for less shine.</li>
    <li> This is a great daily moisturizer. I started using this brand from seeing their stuff at whole foods, and I love all their products. This one is one of my favorites though. I put it on a few times a day. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, has a nice fresh orange smell - and of course, all the ingredients are organic.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrongena anti-wrinkle cream for over ten years, and it was past time to make a change. I am very pleased with this. It has a pleasing scent, isn&#x27;t too heavy or too light, and it works. My skin isn&#x27;t flaky or patchy. It is a moisturizer, plain and simple. I still have the wrinkles and brown patches I had before, and I didn&#x27;t expect not to. All I wanted was to have soft skin, and this has ensured that.</li>
    <li> I love the light orangey scent. My skin is looking more hydrated and happier. A very small amount does the trick.</li>
    <li> I tried this day cream on my face for about a week, but found it was too greasy-feeling for my skin type. It&#x27;s great on my hands, though, very moisturizing with a great citrus smell. I was initially a little put off by the color of the cream---it&#x27;s yellow-ish, off-white?---but the texture is smooth and it absorbs easily. I won&#x27;t be buying again once the tube is used up though, too expensive just to use as a hand cream.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels. Very good product and the smell also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and still look forward to applying it every morning. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin, very light weight with a subtle yet rejuvenating scent.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! It makes your skin feel so perfectly balanced. Not dry and not oily. Just soft and smooth. Even after removing my make up at night I can still feel it on my skin!! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has erased the tired dull look my skin had a few months ago,  furthermore; this is the only moisturizer that has noticeably reduced acne.  Lastly I have not had a rosacea flair up since using this moisturizer. (I am using an EO protocol in conjunction )</li>
    <li> This is a great facial cream for me. And I love the smell....a great citrus wake-up. Feels good, looks good, and my skin likes it. I continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> The scent is just perfect and it was one of the best I have used on my dry skin. Lasted a few hours before I reapplied. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I do love this product but it did have a tendency on drying out certain areas of my face. It did calm my acne as well give my skin a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only lotions that do not leave my skin looking greasy. I have extremely oily, trouble prone skin and trust me on this, this is hands down the best moisturizer I have used! (since I can&#x27;t think of any other alternatives at this moment). I had to write this review so more people use this and it won&#x27;t be discontinued like ever since I don&#x27;t think this product is mainstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight but hydrating (although you might want something heavier in winter or drier times) and certainly does not cause any breakouts. Highly recommend! Great to wear under your makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ok, I did write a review raving about CeraVe moisturizer before which I completely forgot about till now... Just to clarify, while CeraVe is also great, it left my skin looking greasy. This, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t do that. I wonder what ingredient makes that difference. If you have normal, healthy skin, I think you can use pretty much any product out there. But if you have sensitive, breakout-prone, oily, shiny looking skin I&#x27;d say try this one out.)</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product at a conference, and I fell in love with the way it feels on my skin and how it smells. I am using this as a replacement for my Lancome moisturizer, which at $80 an ounce I am glad to find a substitute! Skin feels great after a week of use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE acure organics. Im so glad i found out about this brand. I use their argan oil, have used 3 of their face washes including the brightening scrub which does leave your face super soft, the wipes. This lotion smells good and it isnt too greasy.</li>
    <li> Took me forever to find the perfect moisturizer! But I finally found it!</li>
    <li> It smells fruity and goes on really light and smooth. I really love Acure products and this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> I had to buy the oil control version of this cream since this left my face too oily. The oil control version is excelent and a great product. Just for reference I have normal type skin.</li>
    <li> --------&lt;br /&gt;INTRO&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;Love Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products. As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days and that&#x27;s where Acure excels and makes their products exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;About 60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream. People often forget that our skin is our largest organ and we need to protect it just as we need to protect our internal organs. There are zero harmful ingredients in their line of products and they travel the globe in search for the highest quality ingredients.  Everything they make is free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, harmful preservatives, mineral oil and artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;QUICK REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;I received this day cream because my skin has become more and more dry as I go through harsh winters. This past winter was the first winter I noticed my skin becoming very dry and flaky and was in need of an organic moisturizer, as I have acne prone sensitive skin. As with other Acure products, this came nicely packaged. I use this product each morning after using the \\&quot;Balancing Rose and Red Tea Facial Toner\\&quot;. I use about a pea-sized amount which seems to cover my skin nicely. The smell of this product is very nice, almost citric (like an orange). This product does a nice job of moisturizing my skin throughout the day without that greasy feeling. I personally will use it when the weather starts to cool down in the fall and winter months, and then use something a little lighter in the warmer spring and summer months. If you are looking for an organic facial cream to moisturize your skin daily in those harsh winter months, I would recommend buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;* sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;* cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;* Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;* Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;* PEG free&lt;br /&gt;* Petroleum free&lt;br /&gt;* Phthalate free&lt;br /&gt;* Silicone free&lt;br /&gt;* Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* 100% biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;* All skin types&lt;br /&gt;* Recyclable packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Effective, but don&#x27;t expect Botox type results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.se harsh winter months, I would recommend buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;* sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;* cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;* Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;* Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;* PEG free&lt;br /&gt;* Petroleum free&lt;br /&gt;* Phthalate free&lt;br /&gt;* Silicone free&lt;br /&gt;* Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* 100% biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;* All skin types&lt;br /&gt;* Recyclable packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Effective, but don&#x27;t expect Botox type results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have normal to dry skin, this product works well, absorbs quickly and nourishes the skin. Added bonus is the light uplifting scent.</li>
    <li> I originally found this moisturizer at Whole Foods and was more than pleased to find it on Amazon.  The shelf life was into next year which pleased me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a about 3-4 weeks now.  I love it.  It&#x27;s not oily and absorbs very nice.  My skin feels moist all day and soft.  I am not breaking out at all and have noticed that some of my lines have decreased and my skin looks smoother.  It also has a wonderful smell.  The only down side is that it&#x27;s a bit expensive but if it works I will spend the money.  Planning to give the night cream a try after using this for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  This is the only face cream that doesn&#x27;t give me GIANT pimples.  I have been using it for a few weeks now, &amp; my skin tone/texture is more even.  I just put a couple more in my cart.  I will keep one &amp; give the other to my sister.  I use this cream at night because I don&#x27;t like the feel of having lotion on my face during the day.  With this cream, I get results without pimples.  I am a very satisfied customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 22Jan2014&lt;br /&gt;I guess I spoke too soon.  It did give me giant pimples a few days after I submitted my original review.  I apologize to the people who thought my original review was helpful.  I had given it 5 stars, but I am taking 2 stars off the rating.&lt;br /&gt;This might work perfectly for people with dry skin, but it isn&#x27;t for me unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Especially the light citrus fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I wear it under my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t cause acne and leaves my face feeling really soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, my favorite facial lotion. Subtle orange scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23. Sensitive skin. At the end of the day my face usually is real greasy and shiny. But not when I use this stuff. I love this cream. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or dry. All day perfect moisture. It smells nice and it makes my skin feel and look so healthy. I love Acure products. Win.</li>
    <li> I needed to find a replacement for my favorite caudalie products after I was informed they are no longer cruelty free and I saw this line in whole foods and it caught my attention. I have to say this day cream is EXACTLY what I needed. It is so soothing and the lotion goes on like silk I absolutely love it. I put on a drop of argan oil first as my serum and then this over and my skin drinks it up and stays moisturized all day! Absolutely love this !</li>
    <li> Very pure and good for skin. i really like this cream</li>
    <li> I love this day cream, however it is ridiculously small for the amount of $$ you pay for it.  The plastic squeeze tube container makes it difficult to get the last of the cream out as well.  It is very hydrating and feels great in the winter weather, I would plan on purchasing one for every 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> nice smell, lightweight for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I love the light weight feeling of this lotion.  It also smells nice, fresh and citrusy.  My skin is soft after use and it is perfect to wear under makeup!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These products are great!!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the cream, but it just keeps breaking me out so I can&#x27;t really use it. May be it works better for people with dry to normal skin, I have Oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I used to be a loyal customer of 30+ years of Aubrey Organics - Until - they changed their products and started adding stuff in that I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was and they began charging 2 &amp; 3 times the price. (Enough said about Aubrey)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with the Radical Wrinkle cream which was nice but wasn&#x27;t doing much for me so I switched over to this product and I love it. It has such a lovely light natural smell of oranges and it goes on very smoothly. It has taken several weeks of daily use and all of a sudden boom, I am really seeing some great results. Smoothing out of my skin, a more soft and silky texture and it has helped relief me of some bumps and marks on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just loving this product. I also use the Ultra Hydrating Cocoa butter unscented for my body and really enjoy that too. I am very pleased with this company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments after using this product it is amazing</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer - feels good on my skin, smells good as well.  Not to mention, at 58, I can actually go out without makeup and feel pretty good about myself - at least no one seems to run away in horror, so far anyway.</li>
    <li> I put 4 stars for the size. I ran out of the first tube in less than a month while using it just once a day. It&#x27;s a very nice cream, which is great for use under makeup. The citrusy smell is very pleasant. My skin feels soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Every Acure brand product I have used has amazed me. I just barely started using this moisturizer. It is a lot thicker than what I was previously using, but absorbs thoroughly and wears really well under makeup. I am waiting to see the effects on fine lines and skin texture. It smells like a hint of citrus which is totally delicious!!</li>
    <li> So far so good...just switched from dermalogica because I wanted to try something more natural. I love all their products so far; I&#x27;m using the face wash, the scrub and this cream.</li>
    <li> Rarely do I love a skincare product but this stuff is great! I love the way it smells and feels (moisturizing but not greasy). I am periodically using this on my hands.  I have noticed that my hands look wrinkly but I am not sure that this is from the lotion yet.  I need to use it more consistently and longer to really see if it is making a difference.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Great citrus scent. Goes on smooth. I can apply foundation immediately after without worrying about clumping. Have only used for a short time but can already tell that my skin is brighter and more even.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Its clearing my skin up. Im African American and have a difficult time finding products that work, but this brand is a winner!</li>
    <li> Have used this item before - it is a very nice moisturizer and smells GREAT! I enjoyed it more when it was in a glass bottle Now it&#x27;s in a tube and you have to watch that you don&#x27;t squirt to much out :-)</li>
    <li> Smells like citrus and clove, which reminds me of being a kid and putting cloves in oranges at Christmas. The combo is bright and warm and elicits nice memories.</li>
    <li> Great smell &amp; it moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My facial skin definitely feels smoother and looks more hydrated - considering how much I abuse my skin with weekend-vices. Have had been using Acure day cream for over 6&lt;br /&gt;Months and I can truly see/feel the difference - this is in comparison to using Estée Lauder daily moisturizer, it&#x27;s not harsh at all and does not contain alcohol.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and did wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this creme after borrowing the ACURE Shampoo &amp; Conditioner from my cousin&#x27;s shower during a Winter Break visit. We both have curly, dry hair now that we are older and with all this cold weather my hair &amp; skin is so wanting moisture . . . but I hate that slimy,sticky feeling some products leave you with so I started with the day creme and WOW the way it soothes &amp; blends so quickly is great… and it smells lovely too.&lt;br /&gt;This size is perfect for travel. I would go for it!!!</li>
    <li> Really excellent cream with complete absorption and absolutely no greasy, heavy feel. ACURE brand is a winner, and I really love all their natural products!!!</li>
    <li> My skin is dry with blotchiness, black heads, and frequent acne. I&#x27;ve tried many products and am so far most pleased with Acure products. I have also been using the facial cleansing cream argan oil, eye cream, and night cream. This day cream is light yet moisturizing, absorbs well, angels good (with a hint of orange), and best of all.... all natural! Have been using for a week so far, and have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> so many good reviews here... and I love my Acure Cleanser, but this makes my skin greasy and broke me out a bit. I will finish it on my hands.</li>
    <li> I love the weightless formula, it&#x27;s super absorbent Yet feels rich and luscious , my skin just loves it day in and day out, versus  other products that  left my skin greasy shiny which makes it impossible to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again definitely.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I find the tube too small.</li>
    <li> Great day moisturizer.  I have dry sensitive skin and I use coconut oil at night, but this is great for during the day under makeup.</li>
    <li> I use this cream every day. It&#x27;s great for dry, sensitive skin. The whole line is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this whole line.  I&#x27;ve had oily skin my whole life, but advancing into my late 30s, it was becoming drier but did not react well to certain oils.  Acure products have not broken me out while giving my face adequate moisture.  I generally try to go for all natural cosmetics, so of course that is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I WISH THIS FACE CREAM HAD SPF IN IT... OTHERWISE, ITS A NICE LIGHT CREAM... HAVENT USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE AN OPINION ON HOW WELL IT WORKS....SO FAR, SO GOOD.....</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know if my dry skin will change however one friend said my skin looked moister after only a few applications. What I noticed was the fantastic smell, like fresh oranges, absolutely lovely!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful my skin looked just after a day or two of use. I am ordering more. Excellent product! I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff will always repurchase this. I&#x27;m a Le Mer girl but I use this for my day cream. This makes your makeup just glide on if you have a problem with cakey foundation.  This will solve your problem.</li>
    <li> not moisturizing enough for me.</li>
    <li> I am new to Acure and overall really like their products.&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed in this one, however.  There&#x27;s nothing specifically wrong with it, I just don&#x27;t feel like it moisturizes as much as it should, especially given it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;normal to dry skin.&amp;#34;  And my skin isn&#x27;t crazy dry, either, nor do I live in an arid locale.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it smells nice (citrusy) and hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation, and who knows - maybe I&#x27;m getting other benefits and just haven&#x27;t noticed it yet.&lt;br /&gt;As I said like Acure as a brand so will be trying a different one from them and hope for better results.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this cream. The smell was also very lovely. But, after prolonged use, it clogged up my pores and caused me to break out. Very disappointed because I love how the pure and natural ingredients in this line.</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer as a sample in my Birch Box collection and was so happy I found it here for less. It&#x27;s my favorite moisturizer. I have combination skin and yet this lotion absorbs right through my skin, leaving it soft and prepped for my foundation application. I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and is not harming my skin. Has a light, refreshing smell and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This cream works better than most.  Keeps my face hydrated all day.  Winter months need an extra layer but thats with all face lotion.  Love the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Originally got to try a sample in my Birchbox and been hooked since. I deal with acne and this cream helps heal my spots up much faster. Even better than treatments specifically formulated for that purpose! I love the citrus smell and it doesn&#x27;t linger and interfere with my other fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is the second or third time I bought this lotion. I really liked it, however this time the lotion is clumpy and it leaves pieces of dried lotion everywhere. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. I&#x27;m hoping I just got a bad batch and this isn&#x27;t the norm now.  I&#x27;ll probably give it one more try. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> My daughter had given me a tube for Christmas a year ago. I was sad when it was gone because it was very beneficial to my face. Don&#x27;t live in an area that sells products like this, so went online and found it at Amazon. Cheaper than what my daughter paid for it in the store. So, we each got a new tube and are both happy. It isn&#x27;t greasy and my skin under my eyes loves it. [[ASIN:B003Z4QHP0 Day Cream: Gotu Kola Stem Cell + 1% Chlorella Growth Factor]]</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for about a month, my friends can tell a difference saying my skin looks  younger than my 60 years. I plan to continue using Acure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiehl&#x27;s for years but decided I wanted to get chemicals out of my skin care.  no more parabens, SLS etc etc.  I spent an hour at wholefoods reading every healthly skincare lines looking for a non-gmo organic line.  Almost all of them had Phenoxyethanol in it.  A another bad preservative to replace parabens, no thanks.  The ones that were completely safe didn&#x27;t have Phenoxyethanol the cost was like $45 for an ounce.  too expensive for my budget.  Then I found  Acure Organic, no chemicals, organic, non-gmo and the price is very reasonable similar to Kiehl&#x27;s.  Well it&#x27;s been two weeks since I started using cleanser, day cream and night cream, I can&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks.  The Chlorella growth factor is amazing,  its almost like its giving me brand new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This day cream, it perfect for wearing under makeup, a great primer cause it&#x27;s not too greasy.  Whatever the carrots in this product is doing to my face, I love it.  Soon I won&#x27;t need any makeup,cause my complexion is getting so even &amp; smoothe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about the Acure Organic skincare line,  I highly recommend to give Acure a try.  And no I don&#x27;t work for Acure.</li>
    <li> very happy, as I knew I would be. this is my 9th acure item. I love everything I have tried so far. absorbs immediately and leaves you with a dewy looking sheen, even though it is no longer wet to the touch. I love it. smells like a fresh cut sweet orange. and u know it smells like fruit because fruit is in it! not faux fragrance. the only thing Im mad at is that it didnt come in the glass bottle like pictured. It came in the tube. wack. Thats really amazons fault for not updating the photo, so I wont let it take away from the product rating, but I really wanted the glass bottle :-(. I guess I shud also be mad at the company for the cut back. [dont judge me, i KNOW im not the only person that cares about pretty packaging]</li>
    <li> I have used the face wash cream, eye cream, radical resurfacing, and now I have added the day cream.  I love them all.  I love how they make my face feel.  I swear the radical resurfacing has dome more to reduce my sun damage than the bleaching serum that I bought from the esthetician.</li>
    <li> As my former love (100 percent pure) came to its last squeeze I rushed to Amazon once again to reorder. I found myself browsing the \\&quot;organic moisturizer\\&quot; section on a whim. I would say that while my other moisturizer was great, with all prerequisites met, i.e. organic, fair trade etc... It still left my skin a bit greasy and appeared to be more of a topical cream than one that penetrates. I decided to try something new, and common, how often does some product actually have all reviews at 5 stars? I figured why not- and boy am I glad I took the leap. This cream is incredible, and THAT, my friends, is an understatement. After opening the quaint bottle, I found a light and refreshing cream with a scrumptious citrus scent that is in no way overbearing. I lathered my face and there was no turning back. Non-greasy, and very hydrating. I find myself wondering when my face will be \\&quot;dry\\&quot; again so I can apply more. THAT, should speak more than any words could ever express.</li>
    <li> great but not for oily skin</li>
    <li> Love it!  Makes my skin so soft and clean feeling.  No greasy feel</li>
    <li> Excellent cream love it!</li>
    <li> As with my other reviews for Acure products, I have found the day cream to be of consistently high-quality and to produce positive results on my skin - though not dramatic ones as I&#x27;ve been using high-quality organic products for years.</li>
    <li> nice &amp; light for day time. my skin feels soft &amp; it smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the smell (but I love citric smelling scents which this one smells like fresh oranges).&lt;br /&gt;Of course I&#x27;m a fan of Argan Oil, and Acure has great formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not very oily at all, it leaves your skin feeling moisturized and of course with the ingredients you just feel like its a great every day moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on well under CC creams as well, and in fact I&#x27;ve used Argan Oil before using this and this one takes off the shine from the Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> I find this moisturizer to be just the right weight for what I like to wear during the day.  It goes on smooth and provides a nice base on which I can apply my mineral powder makeup.  The one thing I will say is that it has a bit of a citrusy smell to it.  This is not a deal breaker for me as I don&#x27;t notice it much past the initial application.  (I&#x27;m not one to like to wear a bunch of conflicting scents on my body during the day.)  When I purchased this facial cream I was looking for a quality organic cream and this one fits the bill!</li>
    <li> Our favourite face moisturiser</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, overly-reactive skin, but this product does wonders.  It doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation or breakouts, absorbs quickly (no greasy feeling), and keeps my skin extremely soft.  I&#x27;ve been using Acure Day Cream for nearly 7 months now with very consistent results long term.  Love this product and hope it will always be available for purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very impresed with the quality of this moiturizer for the reasonable price. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream.  Smells great.  I also use it on my face.  Absorbs nicely, no oily residue.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Love the smell.  Ingredients are good.</li>
    <li> I read some good reviews of this product so I was really looking forward to trying it out. Unfortunately, despite being &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and etc my skin turned red immediately after applying it. I do have sensitive skin but not to a severe degree. I use Acure shampoo and conditioner and up to this point I was happy with the brand. Unfortunately, their skin products are very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I am new to using this line of facial products, and I have to say I love every one of them.  I am 49 and honestly have not spent a lot of money or effort on skin care products.  I was so pleased to find wonderful products without all the chemicals at a great price.  I love the smell, the feel, and how well they work. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally push products (other than my art), but I&#x27;ve had skin issues for awhile now. I had perfect skin up till I turned 40 and then it went to hell in a hand basket. I tried Clinique (expensive) and then Nutragena and finally Burts Bees (I wanted something natural), but I still had acne popping up daily, dry patches and angry red spots. I have OCD and am a picker, so it was a double whammy. It really effected me emotionally too as each day I would promise myself to leave my face alone, then the OCD would kick in and I&#x27;d tear it up. I felt ugly. Now....I&#x27;ve found a new skin care line and I kept the receipts, boxes and bags because I am used to returning skin care. I found it at Whole Foods. It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Acure&amp;#34;. After a month of use, my skin is flawless again. I kid you not. The acne is gone! The dry spots are gone! The angry red patches are gone! And most importantly, there is nothing to PICK!! Yeah! I know how important good skin is to folks, so I thought I&#x27;d share. I currently use the eye cream, day cream and sensitive cream at night. I am going to add the serum soon. I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ACURE IN ANY WAY!!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with sensitive skin for forever - since elementary school I&#x27;ve been fighting the good fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole skin care line has done me wonders. It&#x27;s part of my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; list. I use the eye crime, night cream, and this day cream. I wash my face with Dr Bronners Tea tree, and use diva wash on my body with a natural loofah. I remove my makeup with a few drops of grapeseed oil on a washcloth. It&#x27;s changed my life! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is very moisturizing, smells good and is cruelty free. It&#x27;s a smaller tube, but a little product does go a long way, so the tube lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but broke my face out. I have very sensitive skin, so no surprise there.</li>
    <li> Subtle fragrance, non oily feeling, very lightweight does not cause break outs. Been using Acure products for a few months love how their proceeds go to sustainable/environmental causes</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels and looks a lot better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> This company has become my fast favorite. All the products i&#x27;ve purchased so far have been outstanding across the board. This particular cream is light and non greasy which for me is a big help because even though I&#x27;m 46 I still have oily skin. This cram doesn&#x27;t have sun protection though, I usually only use this day cream if I&#x27;m wearing my foundation which has an spf of 15, otherwise I use a day cream with an spf of at least 8 on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m in love with this product.  after reading all the other reviews i really wanted to try this day cream and honestly i have no regrets.  I have very sensitive and dry skin with red patches.  after applying this product you see a difference within 24 hours.  I love and highly recommend.  no regrets and i am on this product for life will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it arrived lightening fast.</li>
    <li> I used this product every day for two weeks.  The texture of the lotion is very thick, so a little goes a long way.  Unfortunately, I started getting little itchy bumps all over my face, and now I am dealing with blackheads all over my temples and forehead.  I normally don&#x27;t get acne, and this is the only product I switched recently. One pro is that it smells nice, I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I use this day cream every day .It is gentle and not greasy . I am very happy with it and have been using it for 6 months or so .</li>
    <li> feels nice. wish it had sunscreen in it though...</li>
    <li> I was using Acure products since 2010, and never had a problem before, but this one irritates my skin if I use it 2 days in a row.  Did they change the ingredients when they got big?  sold the company?  I noticed that several other people had the same problem.</li>
    <li> my skin appears nicer with this product. I would buy again</li>
    <li> I sometimes break out using this, so I&#x27;m careful not to put it on too thick. Has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using Acure Oganic&#x27;s Day Cream for just over a week now and I am blown away by the results! I am in my mid-thirties and beginning to notice signs of aging. I was previously using rosehip seed oil on my face and eyes, but found that it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough during these winter months. My skin was so dry that applying any kind of makeup just made my dry skin more noticeable. I purchased this moisturizer based on organic ingredients, user reviews, and the reasonable price. This moisturizer relieved the dryness immediately. Within just a few days the texture of my skin was noticeably improved  and my skin actually glows! In fact, I have noticed that I barely even need makeup. It gives my face an almost dewy radiant look, but without any oiliness or greasiness. And my skin is noticeably softer to the touch. I really can&#x27;t say enough about this moisturizer. I recently bought the night cream at Target and I will be adding a review under that product as well. The night cream is slightly thicker and heavier than the day cream and takes a little bit longer to absorb, but that is fine by me since I don&#x27;t need to put anything else on my skin after I apply it. Once it absorbs it feels amazing. I always worry about breaking out when trying new moisturizers and neither the day cream or night cream caused a single pimple. I would absolutely recommend this moisturizer!</li>
