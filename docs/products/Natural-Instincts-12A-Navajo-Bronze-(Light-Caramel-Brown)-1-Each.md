    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find my color for a few months - scary.  I was talking with my husband, Jorge, and he suggested that I look on Amazon. Well, what do you know - there it was and in a six-pack non the less.  I don&#x27;t have to look for color until Halloween.  Thanks a million Amazon!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a medium reddish brown that didn&#x27;t fade to bright red before recoloring.  This shade is just about perfect for me - maybe a little dark the first week, but very close, and by the time I&#x27;m ready to recolor (3-4 weeks), it&#x27;s lighter but still not garish.  My hair is now almost totally white, which probably makes a big difference in how it looks - if your hair is brown, the red in this shade might not come out enough.</li>
    <li> One of the three boxes was damaged and the product leaked out.</li>
    <li> I bought this twice in a package of three and each time the liquid had leaked out.  Since I was unable to use, I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Natural Instincts products! They were the original semi-permanent hair color producer and they still are the best!! For those who are wondering, semi-permanent is definitely they way to go. I have tried permanent hair color and it dries out your hair and leaves a line when your hair starts growing. :( Semi-perm slowly fades away after about 30 washes so there is no drastic change or awkward lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this specific color, Navajo Bronze, it is my absolute favorite! It took me about 3 or 4 experiments with other shades before I found this perfect one! I used the old formula and I disagree with other reviewers that this one is bad. My hair has taken to this new formula the same way and the 2 week color refresher is nice!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get complements on my hair color. I mean like every day!! People always ask if it&#x27;s natural, and I don&#x27;t mind telling them that yes, it&#x27;s natural, Natural Instincts!! Hehe!! People also comment on how it really brings out my blue eyes! Other shades seem to wash your face out, but this highlights your greatest features!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains no ammonia and makes your hair feel and look silky smooth for weeks!! I love coloring my hair and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to look and feel beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I ALWAYS have to add conditioner to my hair color products because of my fine hair. Also, color always looks darker on my hair.</li>
    <li> The only product I will use for hair color.  Have used it for years.  Does not make my hair dry or brittle.  Coverage is excellent.</li>
    <li> Perfect it is just my color</li>
    <li> WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  THE COLOR TURNED MY HAIR RED AND BRASSY.  I HAVE BEEN USING&lt;br /&gt;natural instincts previously and did have this problem.</li>
    <li> This has been my goto color for more than 10 years.  I love it!  I hint of red, without overdoing it and looking fake.  Fake is fine, but not at my age!</li>
    <li> woo hoo!  this is the color that I needed and so convenient to have to go to every Wal-Mart or Target in a 40 mile radius to find it.</li>
    <li> Love this color--- get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Always makes my hair soft and shiny. Natural looking color. Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Getting harder to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and it remains the best option for me. No burning. No rashes. No sinus &amp; lung irritation. What a relief!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.  I&#x27;ve never had a single issue or compliant.  For those complaining of the color refresh perhaps that&#x27;s why the instructions say to test your hair first.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many.  I love it.  Yes, the color slowly softens but that&#x27;s what makes it look more natural.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t cover hardly any gray and I don&#x27;t have a lot but they are all in front and this didn&#x27;t cover them. So if you&#x27;re looking for hair color to do that try something else. It did make my hair feel super nice after conditioner but no good for me.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and it covers grey without having the growing out look, I use it every 5-6 weeks.  It takes 10 minutes and you are done.  I wash my hair every day and it last just that long.  I have it on autofill, so I don&#x27;t miss them - it&#x27;s fool prove!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this color for years, sometimes mixing with another Clairol Natural Instincts to give more red, and have always been completely satisfied.  Have had many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Healthy Look. (No longer available)  Otherwise I like it.</li>
