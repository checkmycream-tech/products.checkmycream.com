<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used MANY lotions and this one is by far the best I have tried in a while.  First of all, finally a lotion that smells good!! It has a clean and refreshing smells that does not make you stink like a walking tanning bed. It is very moisturizing and I think it does the trick.  There is no tingle in this lotion, which is my preference.  It is just a good amplifier with bronzer in it.  Good quality for the price.  I saw this bottle retail for three times this price!</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome and the bronzer works great, leave on skin for 2 hours after tanning and the bronzer really brings your skin to another level of dark.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pale. started tanning about 2 weeks ago with this lotion and have a beautiful tan. everybody notices the difference. would def recommend</li>
    <li> Belleza is my favorite lotion ever! It smells amazing before and after you tan, and it works great! It&#x27;s a light scent and it&#x27;s not greasy! It gets you really dark and it works great! I love love love Belleza, and for this price I can actually afford it! :) I will definitely buy this lotion again, it came super fast and it was crazy cheap! Very happy!</li>
    <li> So I just got this last night. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but my initial thought is that it is VERY perfumy (is that a word?). I wish it had a milder scent. Will repost after use.</li>
    <li> Bellezza works very well.  It gives immediate results with the bronzer, is very moisturizing, and really does extend the life of your tan.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is the scent.  Smells nice, but I prefer a fruitier/tropical scent.</li>
    <li> Had decided on this lotion to try and was very pleased with how quickly I received it and I am very happy with lotion.  Will use this seller again..</li>
    <li> Bellezza is really good! It smells amazing! This lotion is one of my favorites and would buy it again! It works really well.</li>
    <li> Bellezza is one of the BEST lotions I have used so far. It&#x27;s NOT at all greasy and dries on your skin velvety smooth leaving no streaks (doesnt turn your hands/body orange unlike some lotions out there). Gave me great dark/even color from one use &amp; so far it&#x27;s a color that lasts!! I gave it a 4 out of 5 simply because of the scent. It smells okay, but I prefer more of a tropical scent rather than a floral. All in all a GREAT LOTION that goes on smooth &amp; will give you a beautiful lasting tan :) Will buy again &amp; again</li>
    <li> One of the best tanning lotions I have ever used. I have Irish skin and this lotion has helped me avoid burns while tanning and it smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> Pretty darn good lotion.  It&#x27;s thick, but absorbs quickly when applied.  It does not leave me orange at all.  The smell is more perfume like, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s overwhelming at all and people don&#x27;t realize I went tanning over lunch like they do with the tropical scented lotions.  You don&#x27;t have that tan stink that you can sometimes get with other lotions.  The color isn&#x27;t \\&quot;instant\\&quot;, but I do notice within a few hours after tanning that I appear darker.  I like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> great lotion.as good as designer skin&#x27;s obsidian ..but I still like Belleza better because it smells nicer and there&#x27;s no tingler</li>
    <li> Love the smell and has gave me a good tan, but it is breaking me out!  Have to quit using it! (Ashley)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost all of the Designer Skin lotions and this is by far my favorite. It sinks right into the skin making it feel silky smooth, no greasiness, smells beautiful but not too strong, no burnt after-tanning smell, and I actually saw results the first time I used it. Didn&#x27;t stain my clothes either. I think I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this lotion. I can&#x27;t imagine there ever being one better!</li>
    <li> It took longer then usual to get this product.  It smells pretty good and a little goes a long way.  I tan all the time and am not too impressed with the results.  It is a good moisturizer, but does not seem to help tan darker.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion, I first tried this in a trial packet at my tanning salon but they charged $90.00 for it.  The one time trial packet was $14.00, almost the cost of buying this bottle. so now I can love it for an affordable price</li>
    <li> This lotion not only works fast (received a smooth, even and dark tan within about 2 weeks of tanning and I&#x27;m naturally very pale) but it smells great as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I use. Great price on amazon. Tried another brand that turned my orange (I&#x27;m naturally very pale) this gives me a good light brown color</li>
    <li> Bellezza is a great great lotion.  It&#x27;s NOT greasy and dries on your skin silky like you didn&#x27;t even put lotion on, but believe me, it&#x27;s there.  I love the smell its a fruity fresh scent.  Not floral.  Gave me great color from one time.  I am an avid tanner and tried numerous lotions.  I found designer skin to be the best.  I even used to work at a tanning salon so I know the ins and outs and from being sent to lotion trainings.  I don&#x27;t use this for my face though.  I used Crystal faces by Australian gold (I know I just said Designer skin is the best...for BODY LOTION - I go what works for me).....  I always mix my lotions to get the perfect formula that works for me, but Bellezza doesn&#x27;t need mixing.  Maybe I&#x27;ll mix it with a coolant accellerator (Perfectly Dark by Sweedish Beauty - another non Designer Skin lotion I love just for mixing) just to see how it works out.  But I am in love with this lotion as is - very unlikely for me because I am never satisfyed.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky or your hands orange from the bronzers (Though you should always wipe your palms and fingers after an application just incase you rub your eyes).</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST tanning lotion with a bronzer that I have ever bought.  And I have bought MANY different kinds, so trust me on this one.  It leaves your skin soft, smooth, smells great and doesnt turn your hands orange.  The color is noticable a few hours after tanning (in my case anyway).  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS OR ANY TANNING LOTION AT TANNING SALONS, YOU ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF!!!  The tanning salon I go to offers this lotion, and tried to sell a bottle of it to me for...wait for it...$95!!!  That&#x27;s outrageous!!!  It is under $35 on amazon, and i told the salon that there is no way I would buy their lotions with that kind of mark up!  DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY any kind of tanning lotions at the salon.  You will happy that you did!  YAY AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I have tried other Designer Skin products and I can&#x27;t get as dark as this product can get me. I 1/2 the time I&#x27;m as dark as I want to be so I don&#x27;t have to expose myself to the tanning bulbs as long. I like to have a good tan going - better than base tan - before I get out in the sun in the summer. I love Bellezza!! And it&#x27;s the best smelling tanning lotion out there, too!</li>
    <li> Got my lotion for half the price the salon was charging and got it in just a few days. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to buy it on Amazon versus the tanning salon. it had a nice smell, big bottle, and a lot of bronzers.</li>
    <li> I looked ashy after use,don&#x27;t know if it was contributed to fact I was tanning so much after application but made me ashy.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I am a very fair skinned person and it is difficult for me to get color and maintain it. This lotion keeps me looking tan. There are no streaks and it doesn&#x27;t leave you oily or greasy. I really like the scent too because it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you just went tanning.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL! This is a wonderful fresh smell. The color it provides is also not very dark which I enjoyed</li>
    <li> this isn&#x27;t a magic lotion....it didn&#x27;t get me extra dark, it definitely protected my skin than tan it. I found myself tanning easier without the lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy which is great! wish the smell was something else...it smells fruity.</li>
    <li> Smell was good. Liked lotion but needed to switch it up mid way through just wasnt getting any darker but have no complaints about  the lotion at all.  Worked for me.</li>
    <li> I am a seasoned tanner. I usually go for the tingle lotions because I feel like I need to see the redness on my skin to know it works. I do not like bronzers just for the fact that it can leave you streaky. This lotion has outdown any expectations I had on it. I noticed a differene right away and within a month I looked like I had been tanning for 6 months. Its also very soft on the skin and smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> The main reason I bought this was bc of if \\&quot;fade defining\\&quot; formula. I tan real easly but my tan doesn&#x27;t ever seem to last long. I didn&#x27;t tan faster or darker with this more so than any other bronzer it was about average. But it didn&#x27;t help keep my tan. I fade just as fast :/ but the lotion smells really nice I&#x27;d say its a good starter lotion but for those like me that are tanning bed addicted it won&#x27;t help much more than a regular tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion at LA TAN in Lynnwood WA today, for 44.00 with tax because it was on sale, and boy was it worth it! It is a bronzing lotion so I am a tiny bit bronzey but I love it!Not sure if these people sell the REAL kind here or not, but its suppose to be thick, and a soft peach color, and smell every fruity. Not sure if that will help you while you are shopping online and trying to decipher real to fake.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck :)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and I&#x27;ve used it for years. I love to tan and I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to lotion. This lotion gives me great color, it goes on smooth and never leaves my skin sticky. It smells good too! I&#x27;m a fan of designer skin. I rotate Bellezza with Luminary.</li>
    <li> Pros- doesn&#x27;t turn you orange, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, moisturizes your skin, you get darker as the day goes on, helps build a good base tan, smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I wanted to be, I feel as if this is a step one tanner and better for base tans, and then you should step it up.&lt;br /&gt;My jwoww wedding white bronzer left me way darker than this lotion did. But bellezza smells better than that one. I also do not recommend showering right away, and use a tan extender right after tanning and showering. I use juicy.</li>
    <li> I have used this once before but I paid 80$ for it at a local tanning salon! It smells wonderful and works great! at a great price!! I love designer skin and now so does my husband.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for a great price ! Absolutely will order more !! I spend double the amount at the salons for the same product</li>
    <li> This is such a great lotion to help boost your tan, I would consider purchasing it again. Also, the company is the greatest they were really helpful!</li>
    <li> This lotion is nice, I don&#x27;t get as brown of a tan as I have with others, but the smell is nice and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this at a tanning salon, so I knew what I was getting.  Super fast delivery.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have tattoos and the lady at my tanning salon recommended this.  I tried the sample packs (went through 2 of them before purchasing the bottle) and had instant color.  My tattoos are still bright and colorful which is why I felt the need to endorse this product.  I purchased two bottles because they are so much cheaper on Amazon then salons.  The smell is decent and not long lasting but honestly after sweating in a tanning bed I wouldn&#x27;t go run errands right away.</li>
    <li> I love it! it smells amazing! it leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; the bronzer is perfect, not to dark.</li>
    <li> Like you put way too much perfume on. I do like the smell though. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have much in the way of bronzersm but it does a good job at moisturizing and keeping your skin nice.</li>
    <li> this is not the correct product. i work in a tanning salon and we sell this and someone came in today after buying it on here and the products are completely different. never buy tanning lotion on amazon. either buy it at the salon or on tanninglotionsupplies.com</li>
    <li> Really like the feel and tropical smell of this tanning lotion but it did not have as much bronzing effect as I expected....seems like you get more from Black.</li>
    <li> This product smells really good, but I didn&#x27;t see a change even after using the whole bottle. I wouldn&#x27;t say not to buy this product, and I wouldn&#x27;t say to go out and buy it. Everyone has different types of skins.&lt;br /&gt;  What would work for one person might not work or the other. This is why I like buying from Amazon. You don&#x27;t spend a fortune in products trying to find what works best for you. I do like the smell of this and thats about it. Also, I have bought the product Black Storm and I have seen a change in my skin color. I am normally fair skinned and I always read the reviews before I buy anything on here. Just to make sure this is the product that I am looking for. As for me,I didn&#x27;t really know what was going to work for me. As I just started tanning last year! :) so I hope that this helps you.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great scent, but the bronzers are very light. Much cheaper to purchase on Amazon, my salon was charging $65. The lotion will sometimes get a little crumbly on my skin after I tan. Its definitely not a strong bronzer but is a nice lotion to put on before tanning, and I&#x27;m often complimented on my scent after tanning.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. Not as good as Queen I was using   before purchasing this. I dont feel like I&#x27;m getting the results I was hoping for .</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great. It smells good, gives great color and isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, I have used better lotion. Doesn&#x27;t make you real dark but it does give you a natural looking tan. Skin feels smooth after using this lotion</li>
    <li> What a great value! This product was exactly what I ordered and the price blew me away! Been using this product since 2006...it is the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I wanted to really like this but I felt like I didn&#x27;t get the darkest or best tan that I could get out of a lotion. Smells decent, other lotions in this line smell much better though. I won&#x27;t be spending my money on this again.</li>
    <li> Bellezza is one of my favorite lotions by designer skin because I love how well it works on me. The scent is very nice too. I have been tanning off and on over the past ten years and this has been my overall favorite lotion. I also like obsidian by designer skin but sometimes that bronzer is a bit too much for me and I get too dark. I was introduced to bellezza by my tanning salon and they charged $80 for the bottle so buying on amazon is quite the bargain. This lotion is great for quick application and it spreads evenly and moisturizes well. I recommend bellezza to my friends &amp; will buy again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> Awesome my favorite - why do they sell it for $70 in tanning salons.</li>
    <li> I keep going back to this one as a all time favorite. I like the smell ,I like that I seen instant results.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It gives the right color for my level 1 tanning.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it is so much cheaper than buying it from the tanning salon</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the better tanning lotions I have used. Great color and goes on smoothly without feeling sticky. The only downside was an unappealing smell after tanning. I would purchase this again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lotion since the discontinuation of Bohemia by deisgner skin - a while. Months in fact. I&#x27;ve gone through many, a lot thin, smelled weird or produced no results. THIS my friends is the ultimate tanning lotion (for me at least). It&#x27;s on the thicker side which i like, spreads well, and the bottle is pretty big. It has a citrus-like smell which is great because I like to tan on my lunch hour and not smell like crap when I go back to work. I got really dark results with this after just my first use. I&#x27;m really happy with the lotion, the shipping and the company :) great deal.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for over 5 years now and I have tried pretty much every lotion there is. I am not picky either I just like to try new things. I get color relatively easy, but with this it&#x27;s almost instant. I&#x27;ve been almost 8 months without any sun ( so i was quite pale). After 3 times in the tanning bed (not even at the max time) I am completely brown. Very impressed. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Great lotion! I was looking for something to replace Masquerade, came across Bellezza, gave it a try and wasn&#x27;t dissapointed. I am naturally fair skinned and this lotion has taken me to a fairly dark tan. After tanning, it takes a few hours to get the maximum benefit, so leave it on to let it work it&#x27;s magic. At the end of a month, I am at where I want to be, colorwise. The lotion spreads well, and lasts a long time. I have read that some poeple didn&#x27;t like the scent, or that it was too strong. I think it smells rather nice. My tastes run to scents that don&#x27;t smell fruity so I was pleased. I will say though, the scent, in my opinion is feminine. No orange experience and I don&#x27;t need to wash my hands after applying. Works for me!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. I doesn&#x27;t make you smell burnt once you get out of the tanning bed. The bronzer hasn&#x27;t stained my hands. Over all its a good lotion for starting to build your tan.</li>
    <li> I am so stupid to have paid $62 for this today</li>
    <li> It smells great &amp; absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t feel all sticky. One of my favorite tanning products. Very light &amp; not heavy.</li>
    <li> I just got this 2 days ago, and I tried it yesterday. After 1 session in the bed, I&#x27;m already seeing color. And the way my skin feels after putting it on is amazing. Not only does it aid in the tanning process. It leaves my skin feeling baby soft. I have used Designer Skin products for years. I love their products to the point I don&#x27;t want to use any other brand. It works every time, and I wish they would put out a whole line of skin care using the same Ingredients that they use in the tanning lotion. It&#x27;s the best skin soften I&#x27;ve used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, you&#x27;ll be happy you bought this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t go to the tanning bed, I use this lotion whenever I&#x27;m outside in the sun. It works great! I get a great tan every time and this stuff smells amazing!! I&#x27;ve seen this product selling for up to $80 so this is a great buy</li>
    <li> I am a fan of designer skin products and decided to try this because I wanted to achieve a golden glow without spending much time in the tanning bed. I am light and have been able to get a slight golden glow by tanning 2x a week for 10 minutes each time. My biggest complaint about this product is the smell. It has a strong perfume-type scent that isn&#x27;t that pleasant. I would definitely prefer a more tropical smell. Even another customer commented on the strong smell of it. Otherwise, I think it is decent. I won&#x27;t purchase it again and will be going back to other Designer Skin products I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. It took two sessions to see results. It gives a nice tan color w/out too much of a bronze look which I like. I don&#x27;t want to look orange/\\&quot;bronze\\&quot;. I&#x27;m almost to the end of my bottle and will be flipping over to another lotion, but will consider purchasing this lotion again.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best lotion I have ever used.  I have tanned in many different states and have tried many different lotions.  This just makes my tan go to an ever deeper level.  The smell is great too!  Better than most.  The salon price for this is at least 3 times the amazon cost.  Maybe I should sell suntan lotion!!</li>
    <li> Smells good... You don&#x27;t smell like you just got done tanning either. The lotion goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when your done tanning.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this lotion, and it arrive in a quick and timely manner, just as my amazone prime 2 day shipping said it would. I used this lotion after hiding from the sun for several months. It is a bronzer so it enhances the tan after. the previous lotion I had increased my tan immensely right after, and I really liked it (White 2 Black btw) However, the smell was odd. The smell of this lotion is amazing. I used this lotion on a much lower tan setting that I usually do, but I still got comments from people asking why I was so tan, even after a hot shower that night. This lotion is definetly worth the price, it feels great after you step out, instead of feeling like every pore is clogged, you feel light and fresh which means it absorbed well. And the smell was beautiful, not overly fragrant, but definetly had a nice bouquet to it that made me feel clean and not weighted down with anything. It is the best lotion I have used to date (but it is also the highest quality, so take the comment with a grain of salt if you have been using something that is normally more pricey)</li>
    <li> This product gives a nice color but I will not be re-ordering it due to the smell.  It has a VERY strong floral scent.  I don&#x27;t even like floral scents in perfumes.  I prefer more of a fruity scent in a tanning product.  I wanted to try another Designer Skin product as I have been using 14K Gold for a few years now but wanted something that had more bronzer in it.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to the 14K Gold or try something where the reviews state that the product smells more fruity or tropical.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner and have tried tons of lotions and this is the first I have truly loved.  It is thin and not oily so it is easy to apply.  After tanning it does not rub off on your clothes and leave you feeling greasy for the rest of the day.  The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering.  As a matter of fact I have had a few people tell me that they love the perfume I am wearing.  I also find it to be very moisturizing.  It leaves my skin feeling soft even after I shower.  The price on amazon is way lower than at the tanning bars and a bottle will last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion it smells so good and leaves your skin really soft.Its a pretty good bronzer as well.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite tanning lotions and I try a new lotions all the time. This is a great bronzer and I got dark fast!</li>
    <li> I have to say, after reading a lot of reviews on Amazon about certain tanning lotions I was a little hesitant. There are a lot of people complaining that it is fake, or it is old and not the same as in the salons. Well...I am glad that I listened to myself and ordered this lotion from here. I have always used Designer Skin products, and normally use the Celebutant bronzer, but decided to try this one this time. It is exactly what I would get at the salon for $89+ and because I am a prime member, I also got free shipping. I will continue to buy my creams from here - I am an avid tanner (4 days a week). Please do not let other peoples bad reviews influence your decisions...if you have always been happy with Amazon, stay with them!! This cream is SO worth it!! Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this a few times and it is really good. It is a juice formula so it smells great and absorbs well. Just make sure you get it from a good seller and don&#x27;t buy an old bottle or the bronzers won&#x27;t work.</li>
