      <li>It lathers up richly and rinses very clean without any residue.</li>
      <li>I bought both the conditioner and shampoo primarily because i was looking for sulfate/paraben/etc free shampoo and conditioner that i could take with me on a 2 week trip, and these bottles were a good size - not so large that i couldn&#x27;t stow them away comfortably with the rest of the gear (toothpaste, toothbrush, a brush, my moisturizer, deodorant, travel-size body moisturizer...</li>
      <li>This product has a very light smell, and rinses clean quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall, both of us have been very pleased with TotLogic and hope that they don&#x27;t plan to change the formula anytime soon!</li>
      <li>I am always on the lookout for quality, low-chemical products and this fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>Overall however, this is a great choice if you are concerned about the chemicals in your shampoo.</li>
      <li>A year ago my hairdresser said that after years of coloring my hair, I had to switch to sulfate and paraben free hair products, and I found this brand online.  </li>
      <li>It is really gentle and leaves my hair feeling really nice.  </li>
      <li>After all these months, my head finally feels great.</li>
      <li>It is capable of removing hair product from your hair effectively and leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>but I am pretty sure that once you use these ONCE you will want to use them again...</li>
      <li>it has a \\&quot;clean soap\\&quot; scent.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo gets hair squeaky clean</li>
      <li>, they lather well, and and my hair comes out looking and feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>After swimming in our pool it is important for him to shower with a mild soap to rinse off the chlorine in the pool water.</li>
      <li>I like using this shampoo because it&#x27;s pretty much the best natural shampoo without harsh chemicals that I can get for a fair price.  </li>
      <li>Love this new brand!  </li>
      <li>and I have tried other brands of natural shampoo/conditioner for the kids, yet this brand was the best!</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo with pleasant smell and no animal testing (important to me), only takes a small amount to lather, and easy to rinse out</li>
      <li>My kids LOVE the very soft smell</li>
      <li>Also, the shampoo/conditioner makes their hair so very shiny!!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo by far, and I will purchase this brand from now on.</li>
      <li>I recently developed a contact allergy to the drugstore brand shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  </li>
      <li>We also really like that TotLogic products have a very light, pleasant smell - unlike most shampoos which are very perfumed and quite irritating to allergic folks like</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s a whole other topic lol)</li>
      <li>not amazing as a &#x27;poo but great that it has clean ingredients</li>
      <li>After trying the Totlogic Shampoo, my head is no longer itchy and I just love that it all natural and smells very gentle.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s SO hard when that&#x27;s what&#x27;s available and cost effective!</li>
      <li>and I would say just right  in strength.</li>
      <li>Very soapy and gets her hair really clean.  </li>
      <li>but conditioner is kind of lacking and leaves hair a bit dry.</li>
      <li>The pleasant surprise was that it has maintained my Brazilian Blowout for a record 4 1/2 MONTHS (rather than barely three) and at $200 a treatment, that saves a big chunk of change.  </li>
      <li>It lathers well, and paired with the Totlogic Conditioner, it works wonders to clean and detangle my little one&#x27;s fine hair, which tends to tangle easily.  </li>
      <li>I have used this soap as an adult on my own hair and found that it is generally a great shampoo that is free of many of the questionable chemicals found in other shampoos.</li>
      <li>According to their findings, the ingredients in this product or only moderately safe.</li>
      <li>Two other eco-conscious friends of mine have purchased the Totlogic Shampoo and Conditioner after my recommendation was made, and they love the products too!  </li>
      <li>The natural/fresh smell is also very nice, rather than the common manufactured/chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I initially thought &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t spend that much or natural shampoo/conditioner&amp;#34; but I can honestly say that I have now officially switched my kids to this product.</li>
      <li>I do like the light fragrance, and it does have a low sudsing effect, but still not enough to be able to move my fingers through the hair during rinsing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why, although I suspect that the other shampoo may have been leaving a significant layer of something on my hair that made it more likely to &amp;#34;self-style&amp;#34; if I slept on it even mildly damp.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I looked for something gentle.</li>
      <li>It is gentle and oh-so-effective.</li>
      <li>and I know how much extra we have to pay for chemical free food/products already</li>
      <li>The price is also reasonable.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, and it lathers up very well.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo works really well on my 4-year-old daughter.  </li>
      <li>I first bought it directly from the company but now have the convenience of buying it here!</li>
      <li>I am always on the lookout for new products!  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s good for my teenagers, because they wash their hair often and with TotLogic&#x27;s natural ingredients such as lavender, arnica and chamomile, the frequent washing doesn&#x27;t dry their hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>Very natural and gentle.</li>
      <li>I was searching for a very natural and gentle shampoo and conditioner for the kids and family.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Totlogic.</li>
      <li>I highly, highly recommend TotLogic Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for adults as well as children.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner left our hair clean, manageable, and soft with no build up.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;After coloring my hair for years, I have finally found something that is safe and reduces any negative reaction I get after my chemcial treatments.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We have been using TotLogic for a few weeks and really love it.  </li>
      <li>As a daily user of this soap, I kept feeling like I needed to use a greater quantity of soap than with other soaps to get the same level of clean feeling though.</li>
      <li>I have purchased other products from Logic Product Group&#x27;s other lines and have been very satisfied with all of them for</li>
      <li>Use it on my 4 year old!</li>
      <li>But as far as shampoos go</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to all the chemicals they add to shampoo.</li>
      <li>Makes my daughters hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My grandson has sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>My hair is always clean, shiny, and soft, and my scalp has been a lot less dry with this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Definitely much gentler than the other natural brands I have tried</li>
      <li>I searched Amazon and a few other sites extensively to try to find as chemical-free (particularly sulfate free) products as possible, and came across TotLogic.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this soap as an adult on my own hair and found that it is generally a great shampoo that is free of many of the questionable chemicals found in other shampoos. It is capable of removing hair product from your hair effectively and leaves your hair feeling clean. As a daily user of this soap, I kept feeling like I needed to use a greater quantity of soap than with other soaps to get the same level of clean feeling though. Also, I missed having any scent in the shampoo, even though I can understand why some would prefer avoiding even a naturally-derived scent. Overall however, this is a great choice if you are concerned about the chemicals in your shampoo.</li>
    <li> I admit it... I bought this for myself. I love it! It leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I compared this product to a guide posted online by the Environmental Working Group. According to their findings, the ingredients in this product or only moderately safe. After doing that research (unfortunately for me, after I purchased this product), I donated it to a local non-profit organization.</li>
    <li> I highly, highly recommend TotLogic Shampoo. It lathers up richly and rinses very clean without any residue. It is gentle and oh-so-effective. This is my favorite shampoo by far, and I will purchase this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo with pleasant smell and no animal testing (important to me), only takes a small amount to lather, and easy to rinse out</li>
    <li> We have been using TotLogic for a few weeks and really love it.  My girls both have hair that tangles easily, but this has greatly reduced the tangles!!!  Even when they go to bed with wet hair, which they often do.  Also, the shampoo/conditioner makes their hair so very shiny!!  I just wish the containers were larger, I&#x27;m afraid we may run out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I like using this shampoo because it&#x27;s pretty much the best natural shampoo without harsh chemicals that I can get for a fair price.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, and it lathers up very well.  My hair is always clean, shiny, and soft, and my scalp has been a lot less dry with this shampoo.  It&#x27;s not a miracle shampoo or anything, but I think it&#x27;s a good natural shampoo for a great price.  What more could you want?</li>
    <li> My children refuse to let me continue using this on them.  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s hurting my eyes.&amp;#34;  I will go back to Burts Bees.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to all the chemicals they add to shampoo. I looked for something gentle. This product has a very light smell, and rinses clean quickly. All natural and my scalp was happy. no bumps! There are less expensive shampoos in the grocery store like Jason or the like, but you MUST read the label. This product was great. it was expensive for a small bottle, but I am glad I gave them a try.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I bought the Shampoo and conditioner from TotLogic and after using them for my 5 an 7 tear olds, i immediately went and ordered them again. I initially thought &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t spend that much or natural shampoo/conditioner&amp;#34; but I can honestly say that I have now officially switched my kids to this product. I try to avoid/limit the amount of chemicals that the kids are exposed to in their daily lives (it&#x27;s SO hard when that&#x27;s what&#x27;s available and cost effective! but that&#x27;s a whole other topic lol) and I have tried other brands of natural shampoo/conditioner for the kids, yet this brand was the best! My kids LOVE the very soft smell and I love the fact that I feel and see their hair getting clean. After using the conditioner, the kids just wanted to touch their hair and say &amp;#34;how sofftttt!&amp;#34; lol!&lt;br /&gt;I know they are expensive and I know how much extra we have to pay for chemical free food/products already but I am pretty sure that once you use these ONCE you will want to use them again... like I have. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a very natural and gentle shampoo and conditioner for the kids and family.  Glad to have found this brand.  Definitely much gentler than the other natural brands I have tried and we all love the scent. It is appealing to both boys and girls as well as adults and I would say just right  in strength. Smells like a Spring morning in the mountains. The shampoo and conditioner left our hair clean, manageable, and soft with no build up. Will purchase again and hope Totlogic will make some family size bottles soon.</li>
    <li> Love this new brand!  Great for teenagers and adult, too.  A year ago my hairdresser said that after years of coloring my hair, I had to switch to sulfate and paraben free hair products, and I found this brand online.  And it&#x27;s good for my teenagers, because they wash their hair often and with TotLogic&#x27;s natural ingredients such as lavender, arnica and chamomile, the frequent washing doesn&#x27;t dry their hair and scalp.  I highly recommend Totlogic.</li>
    <li> I have tried several eco-friendly shampoo products on the market for my little ones.  Totlogic Shampoo is the best one I have tried BY FAR.  It lathers well, and paired with the Totlogic Conditioner, it works wonders to clean and detangle my little one&#x27;s fine hair, which tends to tangle easily.  I love the smell of the product too...it has a \\&quot;clean soap\\&quot; scent.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product line, and I have recommended to friends.  Two other eco-conscious friends of mine have purchased the Totlogic Shampoo and Conditioner after my recommendation was made, and they love the products too!  I have already placed a re-order of this to keep at the grandparents&#x27; home!</li>
    <li> Over the last six months, my head has been very itchy due to dry scalp. None of the products over the counter have been working. After trying the Totlogic Shampoo, my head is no longer itchy and I just love that it all natural and smells very gentle. After all these months, my head finally feels great. I would recommend this products to adults and children of all ages.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin with slight wave.  I bought both the conditioner and shampoo primarily because i was looking for sulfate/paraben/etc free shampoo and conditioner that i could take with me on a 2 week trip, and these bottles were a good size - not so large that i couldn&#x27;t stow them away comfortably with the rest of the gear (toothpaste, toothbrush, a brush, my moisturizer, deodorant, travel-size body moisturizer... um... yeah, my toiletry bag *is* spacious)  The price is also reasonable.  I&#x27;ve continued to use the products because i like how they don&#x27;t have any overpowering scent, they lather well, and and my hair comes out looking and feeling clean.  Unlike other brands, this shampoo and conditioner also doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  I will buy more of these products.</li>
    <li> I (Sean&#x27;s wife) was searching for a sulfate-free shampoo (recommended by my beautician to maintain my Brazilian Blowout, which is a must for a curly-haired gal in humid San Diego)and decided to give this a try.  I am always on the lookout for quality, low-chemical products and this fit the bill.  The pleasant surprise was that it has maintained my Brazilian Blowout for a record 4 1/2 MONTHS (rather than barely three) and at $200 a treatment, that saves a big chunk of change.  The natural/fresh smell is also very nice, rather than the common manufactured/chemical smell.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and will try more of this line.</li>
    <li> not amazing as a &#x27;poo but great that it has clean ingredients</li>
    <li> Makes my daughters hair soft and shiny. But as far as shampoos go I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the other ones that I tried and this one. I&#x27;m happy that its all sort of  chemical free, so I&#x27;ll buy it again because seems to be working fine. She has shoulder length hair and I use abt a quarter-size each time.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;After coloring my hair for years, I have finally found something that is safe and reduces any negative reaction I get after my chemcial treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for new products!  I have purchased other products from Logic Product Group&#x27;s other lines and have been very satisfied with all of them for both my dog and my daughter&#x27;s preschool uses the bed bug and lice logic products daily!  I trust this company and their products am now using  totlogic for both my daughter&#x27;s bath needs. So very happy to see this on amazon now. I first bought it directly from the company but now have the convenience of buying it here! I know that what you see is what you get in these products. Smells really light and amazing too. Very natural and gentle. Kids love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted a gentle, creamy shampoo for color treated hair, that would be free of the bad chemicals listed. However, dyed hair becomes tangled if the shampoo does not have some ingredient to soften the hair, relax it , during the rinsing before the conditioner. I do like the light fragrance, and it does have a low sudsing effect, but still not enough to be able to move my fingers through the hair during rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;  For children or adults with out color, this may be just the product you would like.</li>
    <li> Having allergies and skin sensitivities as an adult, I find that TotLogic products suit me perfectly. I use them all the time. I highly recommend them for adults as well as children.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Use it on my 4 year old!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no tot, but I love this shampoo!  It is really gentle and leaves my hair feeling really nice.  I use it with the TotLogic conditioner, and it&#x27;s the best my hair has looked and felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the only negative about this product is the price.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shampoo!  I gave it as a baby gift, and my friend, the new mother, thinks it is the greatest shampoo ever.  She uses it on herself, and her children.</li>
    <li> My grandson has sensitive skin.  After swimming in our pool it is important for him to shower with a mild soap to rinse off the chlorine in the pool water. This soap works well and is non irritating for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the summer when he was swimming twice a day ( at day care &amp; our house) regular soap would burn.  This soap did not.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works really well on my 4-year-old daughter.  Very soapy and gets her hair really clean.  It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Contains ingredients that have caused severe contact dermatitis.</li>
    <li> WARNING: DOES NOT PRESERVE A BRAZILIAN BLOWOUT!!!!!  Otherwise it is a great shampoo/conditioner. Shampoo gets hair squeaky clean but conditioner is kind of lacking and leaves hair a bit dry.</li>
    <li> I recently developed a contact allergy to the drugstore brand shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  Although not entirely surprising because I have other allergies, this was a new and incredibly frustrating development. I searched Amazon and a few other sites extensively to try to find as chemical-free (particularly sulfate free) products as possible, and came across TotLogic. After just a few days of using the shampoo and conditioner, my rashes had disappeared. My husband also noticed an improvement in an unrelated scalp condition he has when he started using the TotLogic after his usual product ran out.  We also really like that TotLogic products have a very light, pleasant smell - unlike most shampoos which are very perfumed and quite irritating to allergic folks like us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another random but interesting benefit I noticed is that the major bedhead I would get with my other shampoo has also disappeared.  I don&#x27;t know why, although I suspect that the other shampoo may have been leaving a significant layer of something on my hair that made it more likely to &amp;#34;self-style&amp;#34; if I slept on it even mildly damp. Our only very minor complaint is that we can only get this product online.  We so wish that we could get it at a local beauty supply or similar store. Overall, both of us have been very pleased with TotLogic and hope that they don&#x27;t plan to change the formula anytime soon!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Totlogic shampoo and conditioner-for myself and my kids!  It is&lt;br /&gt;fresh-smelling, clean-feeling, and I love that it works for the whole&lt;br /&gt;family.</li>
