      <li>She is very happy with the gift and uses it regularly.</li>

      <li>My skin is more hydrated and smooth.</li>
      <li>and I am really happy that I do not need to cover up my face with heavy foundation anymore in this lovely spring time!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference with redness relief</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had products that make your skin feel great but in actuality your skin isn&#x27;t vastly improving</li>
      <li>I will recommend this product to any person who wants a greater and healthy skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended! :-)</li>
      <li>or if you simply want healthy looking skin!</li>
      <li>Absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Absorbs very fast, you don&#x27;t feel your face sticky or shiny.</li>
      <li>I tried this product after my friend tried it first.</li>
      <li>Overall, looking at my face in the mirror now, I sometimes have to do a double-take because my skin looks so much better and brighter.</li>
      <li>and I think they are going to get this product soon ;)</li>
      <li>Anyway, this will improve the overall texture of your skin for sure.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This product really does the work!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used  Niacinamide  </li>
      <li>The fine lines near my eyes are diminishing, my face looks so much healthier.</li>
      <li>-- I really love it and hope to continue buying it for a long time.</li>
      <li>feels very soft and fresh every morning.</li>
      <li>The stuff does not absorb into my skin very well.</li>
      <li>I bought this form my wife and you can really tell it works.</li>
      <li>It smoothed out some lines and really helped even out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it, as I can see improvements in color and texture, and this has not been my experience with much costlier products.</li>
      <li>It has helped also with the scarring, although it hasn&#x27;t completely faded those (that would probably require more than a simple serum).</li>
      <li>Truly significant results would require a deeper treatment, such as a laser treatment or medium depth chemical peel that will reach the dermis of the skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Having high hopes for it, we will see if it truly works....</li>
      <li>The serum certainly makes the skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I have many little lines on my face.</li>
      <li>However, because it has jojoba oil I noticed when I wear makeup my skin won&#x27;t oil as fast since jojoba mimics skin&#x27;s natural sebum.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and a lot of products give me an oily appearance and  acne.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using, I have noticed a huge difference in my sun spots and a slight difference in my wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has directly helped my acne, but it has significantly helped the texture of my skin, and has slightly faded my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation</li>
      <li>(I think it is still too early to see complete healing with this).</li>
      <li>so much so that not only do I use it at night, but I now use it after my toner in the am &amp; under my makeup.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job, although it does make your face a little shiny, not bad.</li>
      <li>not only are the lines softly disappearing, but age spots are lighting, and my skin is very soft too.</li>
      <li>I use a fairly limited number of products on my skin, and am very choosy about what I use.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to see if it would help with age and blemish related dark spots on my face and hands, and by the time I finished the first bottle, it was clearly working.  </li>
      <li>This product Is highly recommended if your face feels dry</li>

    <li> I use a fairly limited number of products on my skin, and am very choosy about what I use.  I bought this to see if it would help with age and blemish related dark spots on my face and hands, and by the time I finished the first bottle, it was clearly working.  I will continue to use it, as I can see improvements in color and texture, and this has not been my experience with much costlier products.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it works just great -- I really love it and hope to continue buying it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this several months ago. The stuff does not absorb into my skin very well. I end up feeling sticky or filmy. If I use it in the morning I&#x27;ll end up blotting off a lot of it within a few hours. I don&#x27;t wear foundation often, but when I do I don&#x27;t put this stuff on. I can&#x27;t even use it on my hands as an alternative use because it doesn&#x27;t absorb and I can feel it, and end up washing it off. However, I have acne prone skin and this has not aggravated it, and it does give you a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look even though I have to wipe it off later. I find it works alright at night because it ends up getting &amp;#34;blotted&amp;#34; onto my pillow while I sleep.</li>
    <li> Cream works well....it seems to be helping with pores and blemishes...I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference with redness relief but sometimes that takes time.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me!! My skin is very sensitive and a lot of products give me an oily appearance and  acne.  I have been using it for just a few days and already can see the difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s great. Absorbs very fast, you don&#x27;t feel your face sticky or shiny. My skin is more hydrated and smooth. And you can see some red spots are not to dark anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Great!!!! I recommend this!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after my friend tried it first. She recommended it for me because I have very uneven face skin tone. I always have to put BB cream or foundation to cover up. However, I started to see the improvement on my skin tone after only 2 weeks..! I was really surprised. My friends saw my face and they were amazed and I think they are going to get this product soon ;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this great product and I am really happy that I do not need to cover up my face with heavy foundation anymore in this lovely spring time!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and I have already notice dramatic changes. My pores around my nose and on my nose have minimized.  The fine lines near my eyes are diminishing, my face looks so much healthier. I have purchased expensive products that promise to do the same but they have not given me the results that I have seen with this product. I love it!</li>
    <li> Of all of the hundreds of lotions and creams I&#x27;ve bought, this just might be the most effective. I&#x27;ve been using, I have noticed a huge difference in my sun spots and a slight difference in my wrinkles. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I have been using it for a month now. I can tell a difference in my skins texture and it has cleared some acne and added moisture to my face and neck area. Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Have noticed a difference after just a few weeks.My skin visibly looks less stressed ,smoother and has a glow of moisture &amp; health.Very easy to use, absorbs nicely into my skin.</li>
    <li> This product helped my skin to look younger. Thank you for the authenticity of this product. I will recommend this product to any person who wants a greater and healthy skin.</li>
    <li> It smoothed out some lines and really helped even out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Face feels very soft and fresh every morning.</li>
    <li> I have many little lines on my face. This product really does the work! not only are the lines softly disappearing, but age spots are lighting, and my skin is very soft too. I finally could find a product that warrant my second purchase. Highly recommended! :-)</li>
    <li> ***7Links (seller/maker) has held a contest, for this product and their Vitamin C, best reviews. Early reviews are biased as users want to win for best reviews. The company admitted this themselves on the phone.***    Product experience:  This makes my skin soft when you put it on but other than that I&#x27;m not really seeing the perceived effects on my skin, especially hyperpigmentation reduction or lightening. I still get acne. My skin still looks about the same, just feels nicer to touch.    I&#x27;ve had products that make your skin feel great but in actuality your skin isn&#x27;t vastly improving, it&#x27;s the product making it seem so. I think this is neutral to good (?) for the skin, but you won&#x27;t get all the benefits it claims to have. However, because it has jojoba oil I noticed when I wear makeup my skin won&#x27;t oil as fast since jojoba mimics skin&#x27;s natural sebum. Upgrading to 4!    Note: My skin is oily, so it lacks water content therefore drying my skin. This does not make my face oily.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if this has any effect on my skin.. I havent seen any change when this is alone on my face or with toning and then this.</li>
    <li> On second bottle and have not noticed any benefits.  It does not absorb well.  : (  Not sure what all of the hype is about regarding Niacin cream but I can&#x27;t say this brand worked : (</li>
    <li> Smooth transaction, great product and price. Fast shipping! Five stars!!!  Non-greasy; smooths hands and noticeably lightens liver spots with daily use.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> The cream is great. It is a bit greasy for public use.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the seller and the product and I would highly recommend i!!!!!  This is the first time I have used  Niacinamide  and I will definitely order it again!!!</li>
    <li> Made my face so red eventho i wear sunscreen spf 50 everyday :( really feel disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this form my wife and you can really tell it works. She is very happy with the gift and uses it regularly.</li>
    <li> This product works just as described! I simply love how my skin feels healthy and hydrated throughout the day. This product Is highly recommended if your face feels dry or if you simply want healthy looking skin!</li>
    <li> Bought it with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J7GKCSI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 for my wife, she loves it. She says it feels great and very light on skin. It is being a great experience and she recommends it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this serum....so much so that not only do I use it at night, but I now use it after my toner in the am &amp; under my makeup.  Looks fantastic, not sticky at all!  I have incredibly dry skin, this is helping me combat that along with the upcoming dreaded &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from a friend so I started using it and I absolutely love it. I love that it&#x27;s not oily and feels very light on the skin. My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I got this product before they started selling here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and have already seen a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Really love this product!</li>
    <li> In days fine lines gone - skin bright and healthy looking.  Wish I could buy enough to bathe in it!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I noticed a difference after one use. My skin felt very smooth. I use it after cleaning and toning (coconut oil to removd makeup, Neutrogena cream cleanser, and Loreal pink toner) and after this serum, I top it off with Paulas choice Resist serum. After one week, skin is in great condition. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed a somewhat dramatic change in the fine lines around my eyes. They are smoother and much less noticeable. The few age spots I&#x27;ve developed seem to be lighter. Overall, looking at my face in the mirror now, I sometimes have to do a double-take because my skin looks so much better and brighter. This is one product I can see myself using for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Just got it recently. Having high hopes for it, we will see if it truly works.... If it does work, I will change it to 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month for acne, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and acne scars. I don&#x27;t know if it has directly helped my acne, but it has significantly helped the texture of my skin, and has slightly faded my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (I think it is still too early to see complete healing with this). It has helped also with the scarring, although it hasn&#x27;t completely faded those (that would probably require more than a simple serum). Anyway, this will improve the overall texture of your skin for sure. It is not a miracle worker - no cream or serum will ever do anything miraculous. Truly significant results would require a deeper treatment, such as a laser treatment or medium depth chemical peel that will reach the dermis of the skin. It does make my skin feel a little oily, probably due to the jojoba oil and hyaluronic acid, but I feel it is worth it in exchange for the improvement in appearance. Also, the price is great. I appreciate the lack of irritating plant oils as well, which are known to cause significant irritation of the skin.</li>
    <li> Great quality, hydrating to the max!  I love how my skin feels when I use this.  I will continue to use to see if I see results on some pigmentation issues.</li>
    <li> The serum certainly makes the skin soft.  However, I have not noticed a diminshing of dark spots</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s a good price for a serum and it is moisturizing and smooths the skin. The smell is faint and not unpleasant. I used it for about a month or 2 without another moisturizer and it did it&#x27;s job, although it does make your face a little shiny, not bad. My skin is prone to redness (especially around the nose) and I can&#x27;t say this helped any with that.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging - looks expensive! I also like the pump. It seems to have been reducing my pores and I makes my skin look radiant. I will continue to use this and I will definitely buy it again. Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. Absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
