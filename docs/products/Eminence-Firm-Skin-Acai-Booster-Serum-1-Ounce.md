    <li> think it might not just be good match for my sensitive skin as the acai cleanser didn&#x27;t work for me either.  love some of their other products</li>
    <li> Love this Serum.  I can feel it tightening my skin moments after I apply it!</li>
    <li> 3 stars-- a little eRly yet to give a full review</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Can be used with any moisturizer or masque. Really does firm. Use morning and night. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this have ordered again and again..</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, but the only thing this boosted was my spas bank account .I bought this hoping to give my skin a much needed rejuvenated lift ,but to no avail. I do use Eminence combined with Dr.Haushka in keeping with my organic skin care regime. I know not to expect miracles after the first few tries ,but being that the price is so high it needs to show results quicker in order to justify this type of spending on skin care regularly . Would I buy again ? Probably not.</li>
    <li> This serum is magical! It makes your skin look younger. The smile wrinkles and my neck wrinkles  bother me and this product is great at hiding them.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products but never stayed with one very long.  This product is amazing and I will use over and over again.</li>
    <li> I use the Firm skin mosturizer and have for a while. This one compliments and makes the effect better. Don&#x27;t know if it actually firms, feels like it but hard to tell. My face is rather saggy, so will take a while. WIll continue using. The Eminence products are the best. Need to use for at least a couple of months before you decide.</li>
    <li> GREAT product.  Works great on my dry, mature skin...absorbs quickly and seems to make my moisturizer work better.  I have tried very expensive serums and keep returning to this one.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to daily skin care for aging skin. I have never been dissatisfied with&lt;br /&gt;any of the Eminence products.</li>
    <li> My favorite product line!</li>
    <li> Best serum for my type of skin (t-zone).  Firms skin and helps with lines. Love its light consistency - no build up feeling on your face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel this absorbs as well as other Eminence serums but will give it more time. Hopefully it starts to firm like it says.</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing product! Worth every penny!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Serum Grand Millesime from Biologique, but found out I have a chemical sensitivity.  My facialist turned me on to this all natural product and I love the results.  My skin looks better and feels more natural with the Eminence Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold for life!</li>
