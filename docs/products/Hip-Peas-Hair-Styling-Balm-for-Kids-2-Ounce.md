      <li>Overall I&#x27;m really happy with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I was excited to use this</li>
      <li>Smells great , doesn&#x27;t hold my sons hair in place for long at all tho.</li>
      <li>I really love the smell of it and it works very good without making the hair look greasy or hard.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent is overwhelming, and it holds in my daughter&#x27;s fine hair very well.</li>
      <li>;), but it isn&#x27;t such a great fit for me.  </li>
      <li>My son is 10 months old and has a fair amount of very straight that likes to stick up all over the place.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times on my baby boy&#x27;s hair, and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
      <li>It does keep his hair looking soft and there is no flaky residue or anything, and it does make his head smell good for a while, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much for keeping his hair styled.</li>
      <li>so tried it right away on my two boys to spike their hair.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed a difference right away in my daughters hair.</li>
      <li>His hairdo will really last 30 minutes MAYBE and hour at the most when I use this.</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty well</li>
      <li>Look elsewhere; unless you just strickly want it for smelling it ;)</li>
      <li>Like others have stated, smells nice but not much hold for any extended length of time.</li>
      <li>(he&#x27;s 20 mo with super straight hair), but this balm isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep it swept to one side.</li>
      <li>Very uncool.</li>
      <li>And it works really well.</li>
      <li>This stuff holds back her hair pretty well.</li>
      <li>Thought it would keep it styled a lot longer than that, considering it was pretty pricey for a tiny jar.</li>
      <li>It is fine for my son, he is 3 and not too picky, smells like a little kid, cutest name</li>
      <li>My 2 yr old has super thick straight hair that sticks straight up after he wakes up in the morning/after naps.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold rock hard like the hair products with chemicals will, but I&#x27;m okay with it just holding for part of the school day.</li>
      <li>All natural</li>
      <li>I was looking for something &amp;#34;kid friendly&amp;#34; for my 10 month old son, and this is what I stumbled upon.</li>
      <li>Got this for my 3 year old boy.</li>
      <li>Really small...rather buy different brand for price /:</li>
      <li>In fact if you use too much her hair will look white!</li>
      <li>Also because he has sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Not a super strong hold especially for a toddler</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super strong hold like a gel, but it works well enough.  </li>
      <li>i love that it&#x27;s all NATURAL and the smell is very subtle.</li>
      <li>I even used it in my hair one day to slick it back into a pony tail because normally i get little hairs that break free and stick out all over, and it worked really well for me all day.  </li>
      <li>Like thats its natural but only lasts an hour in sons hair.</li>
      <li>My 5 year old needs something to keep his cowlick hairs in the back and front in place</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of small and on the expensive side, but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>

<li> Too sticky and messy for my two year old.</li>
<li> The product did not hold their style long before it flatten out.  </li>
<li> Lasts a long time and holds up well.  </li>
<li> but I find that it doesn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
<li> Her curls would look dry and frizzy with no definition, and now they are defined and no frizz at all.</li>
<li> Product offers very little hold.</li>
<li> i use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> My 20 month old has lots of hair and is quite thick.</li>
<li> I like the consistency - not to sticky or product-y, but enough hold so it actually does something with my son&#x27;s thick hair.  </li>
<li> I am not sure I will buy it again, but seems like this will last awhile anyway.</li>
<li> but a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> It at least tames by son&#x27;s hair, and keeps it styled for a few hours (not typically through naps).</li>
<li> Not worth it.  </li>
<li> Works well with keeping my little girls hair out ofher face</li>
<li> But His hair is just a sticky mess after a few hours of running And playing.</li>
<li> Son has thick hair that unfortunately falls straight forward.  </li>
<li> this basically works like a sticky paste to tame the crazy hair that needs to lay flat.</li>
<li> There is some residue but that hard to avoid with these type products.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
<li> , I&#x27;m sick of always putting clips in my daughters hair that she just ends up pulling out.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> For the price? I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. But it does smell REALLY good. This lasts in my sons hair about 20 minutes longer than just putting lotion in his hair.  It does keep his hair looking soft and there is no flaky residue or anything, and it does make his head smell good for a while, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much for keeping his hair styled. He has pretty thick hair that&#x27;s curly on the bottom and straight/little wavy on the top. His hairdo will really last 30 minutes MAYBE and hour at the most when I use this. Thought it would keep it styled a lot longer than that, considering it was pretty pricey for a tiny jar. 5 stars for smell, 1 star for doing it&#x27;s job.  Not worth it.  Look elsewhere; unless you just strickly want it for smelling it ;)</li>
    <li> Like thats its natural but only lasts an hour in sons hair. Def need to find a stronger product if you need hair to be good all day</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold for more than 15 seconds.</li>
    <li> We love this styling balm. I was looking for something &amp;#34;kid friendly&amp;#34; for my 10 month old son, and this is what I stumbled upon. I will admit that it doesn&#x27;t tend to keep its hold all day, but it does the job. It at least tames by son&#x27;s hair, and keeps it styled for a few hours (not typically through naps). If you are looking for something to hold up spikes, I don&#x27;t think this would not do the job. We use it to create a cute combover, and it&#x27;s perfect! Oh, and it smells amazing :)</li>
    <li> Works well in my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Really small...rather buy different brand for price /:</li>
    <li> Gives great texture to my daughter&#x27;s fine hair so that it stays in a ponytail or clip</li>
    <li> Eh....  Bought this for my son, but hoped I could use it too.  It is fine for my son, he is 3 and not too picky, smells like a little kid, cutest name HipPeas ;), but it isn&#x27;t such a great fit for me.  I have really fine hair and this is just heavy/greasy feeling for me. I am not sure I will buy it again, but seems like this will last awhile anyway.</li>
    <li> Smells good but that&#x27;s about the only thing. It doesn&#x27;t hold and it is sticky.</li>
    <li> I like to spike my son&#x27;s hair and this hair balm doesn&#x27;t hold it in place that long. It wears off in a couple of hours. Blah.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the scent is overwhelming, and it holds in my daughter&#x27;s fine hair very well.</li>
    <li> My 2 yr old has super thick straight hair that sticks straight up after he wakes up in the morning/after naps. this basically works like a sticky paste to tame the crazy hair that needs to lay flat. i use it on wet or dry hair. i love that it&#x27;s all NATURAL and the smell is very subtle.</li>
    <li> This product smells really good, but that&#x27;s about all I can say about it. Even after using an ample amount, my son&#x27;s hair only stays styled for about 30 minutes. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light but I find that it doesn&#x27;t hold very long. My 20 month old has lots of hair and is quite thick. Easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> This brand uses competing companies names as a way to steal their business.  Very uncool.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Got this for my 3 year old boy. He wanted his hair &amp;#34;spikey&amp;#34;. Product offers very little hold. Hair is cute for an hour. But His hair is just a sticky mess after a few hours of running And playing.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency - not to sticky or product-y, but enough hold so it actually does something with my son&#x27;s thick hair.  Lasts a long time and holds up well.  Has a pleasant smell.</li>

    <li> We love love this product. It smells fantastic. And it works really well. We will be buying. more for sure.</li>
    <li> Smells okay.  I was excited to use this so tried it right away on my two boys to spike their hair.  The product did not hold their style long before it flatten out.  I would not recommend using this.</li>
    <li> Great pomade for kids to use in the hair. I really love the smell of it and it works very good without making the hair look greasy or hard.</li>
    <li> Smells great , doesn&#x27;t hold my sons hair in place for long at all tho.</li>
    <li> Like others have stated, smells nice but not much hold for any extended length of time. All I want to do is keep my son&#x27;s hair out of his eyes (he&#x27;s 20 mo with super straight hair), but this balm isn&#x27;t strong enough to keep it swept to one side.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference right away in my daughters hair. Her curls would look dry and frizzy with no definition, and now they are defined and no frizz at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Got for my 19 mo old.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and doesn&#x27;t clump or stay &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; in his hair. All natural</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well, I&#x27;m sick of always putting clips in my daughters hair that she just ends up pulling out. This stuff holds back her hair pretty well. I always make sure to wash it out, though, because I am concerned if it gets in her eyes. It&#x27;s kind of small and on the expensive side, but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot. In fact if you use too much her hair will look white! LOL</li>
    <li> My 5 year old needs something to keep his cowlick hairs in the back and front in place and this does the trick. It doesn&#x27;t hold rock hard like the hair products with chemicals will, but I&#x27;m okay with it just holding for part of the school day. It smells  sweet, kind of fruity.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Just wish there was an applicator or something because Iots tacky on your fingers</li>
    <li> This product smells like candy - sweet, gross smell that overpowered the delicious smell of my baby. Also, didn&#x27;t hold his hair in place and just made it look greasy. Needless to say, I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> Too sticky and messy for my two year old.</li>
    <li> Son has thick hair that unfortunately falls straight forward.  I use this to help keep the hair out of his eyes and it works well.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, which is what I love and has a matte finish.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> One of the better products I have bought my son for his hair. The organic sprout stuff holds for about 1 minute. This stuff actually holds like the pomade my husband uses. Its smells great and he doesn&#x27;t complain about itching or anything. There is some residue but that hard to avoid with these type products. I think we found a keeper.</li>
    <li> Works well with keeping my little girls hair out ofher face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times on my baby boy&#x27;s hair, and it&#x27;s been great.  It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or girly.

Overall I&#x27;m really happy with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I love that it&#x27;s free of harmful ingredients, works great &amp; smells great too!  I&#x27;ve also tried the Hip Peas cradle cap oil &amp; it&#x27;s just as good!  Can&#x27;t wait to try more of these kiddo-friendly products!</li>
    <li> I love this product, Just tried it out on my sons hair and it worked perfectly to give him a little fo&#x27;hawk. And it smells so yummy, I am so pleased with the product. It is pricey for the amount you get...but a little goes a long way!</li>
