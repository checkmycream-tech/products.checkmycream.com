      <li>It wasn&#x27;t noticeable in the first 30 days, but I kept going.</li>
      <li>First time this has happened.</li>
      <li>the only reason it works fast is because the high mg it has of biotin which is btw a water soluble...meaning the higher the mg is contains the more the water intake</li>

      <li>it really works.</li>

      <li>I am starting my Third week of hairfinity and so far so good.</li>
      <li>Hello, I have very fine hair with some waves and a little frizz after processing it so much.</li>
      <li>the price is two high so stretching it out for 2 months is better for me but at full dosage everyday i bet i would experience wild growth.</li>
      <li>i did notice my hair stopped shedding which was my mAin problem after i gave birth two years ago.</li>
      <li>It seems to be working, will have to use a little bit more.</li>

      <li>A waste of my money...not happy, don&#x27;t need hair damage less facial breakouts!!!</li>
      <li>My hair is fuller longer and healthier two months do far.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recomend two bottles, don&#x27;t expect to see much of any change after the 1st.</li>
      <li>No break outs so far,</li>
      <li>My baby hairs did grow just a lil bit but ddnt see to much improvement overall.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product I can see the change in my hair</li>
    <li> They actually worked!</li>
    <li> I love these vitamins! This is the second bottle I ordered and I have seen significant growth in my hair. I will be ordering again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 2 month supply for $48.00 on the hair infinity site/brock beauty.  I have natural hair and I had braids for the duration of my first month.  When I took my braids out it appeared that my hair really grew and my hair was so thick/course that I wanted to cry when it was combed.  I got my hair braided again but next time get a blow just so I can comb through my hair. I think my water intake has increased but other side effects I can&#x27;t say that I have experienced any.  I don’t like the smell nor the size of the pills but that is not going to stop me from taking them faithfully.</li>
    <li> It does grow your hair faster, but not worth the bad acne breakouts.. I Never broke out like this before and now my skin is in terrible shape.. I tried these a year ago and I&#x27;m still trying to get my skin back to normal..</li>
    <li> To everyone who&#x27;s using this I jus would like you to know the ingredient that makes the product work good is called BIOTIN which is a vitamin you can buy from walmart for $6...the only reason it works fast is because the high mg it has of biotin which is btw a water soluble...meaning the higher the mg is contains the more the water intake you&#x27;ll need or else you&#x27;ll have bad side effects like acne...my advice to you stop buying these expensive pills that&#x27;s just a $6 pill in a pretty bottle and drink a lot of water and take biotin which you can buy by the amount of mg you want...its all about patience ladies...I cut my hair 5inches above my shoulders in june and took a low dosage of biotin + prenatal pills and drank water with lemon by the ending of december my hair was past my bra strap...another thing is its the type of shampoo and conditioner you use and your diet...but if you decide to take these pills do more research pictures isn&#x27;t always truth and sometimes companies post good reviews for u to buy it...</li>
    <li> This vitamin made my hair shed a lot! I had to stop taking them or else I wouldve been bald! Once i stopped taking them my hair stopped shedding. That is the truth! One more thing i would like to add is I had taken them for 6 weeks faithfully. My hair never ever shedded before until after taking hairfinity( once I stopped the shedding stopped).</li>
    <li> i liked the garcinia cambogia product! look forward to trying the free bottle!</li>
    <li> Great no results yet still taking them..but prompt service</li>
    <li> About a month ago started taking 30day supply i did notice my hair stopped shedding which was my mAin problem after i gave birth two years ago. My baby hairs did grow just a lil bit but ddnt see to much improvement overall. One of my eyes would twitch alot since i started and after i was done taking them i noticed it had stopped.</li>
    <li> first time trying, not sure if it works yet</li>
    <li> I have used for only two months, sofar I see a little different in my hair, will give it another two months</li>
    <li> This product work its the bomb.com luv it matter of fact im bout to order another two month supply!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with my results with usage for one month.</li>
    <li> I am seeing  hair growth finally after years of trying.  It wasn&#x27;t noticeable in the first 30 days, but I kept going. It took another week or two, but it is taking off now. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about their smell at first, but now really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> works great and you can see the difference in weeks.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any improvements yet and I have been taking hair infinity for almost 2 months now</li>
    <li> Been using about a month and no growth whatsoever. No change in my hair..</li>
    <li> If you want to see results you&#x27;re probably gonna have to buy two bottles because you wont see much difference with one</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue to use it. My hair growth is continuing to grow faster than it&#x27;s ever.</li>
    <li> I love these pills. And they got here fast</li>
    <li> it did not work for me. there was no change in my hair</li>
    <li> I love the Hairfinity vitamins. I bought two bottles and I&#x27;m on the second one and so far I have noticed hair growth. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time ...great product</li>
    <li> After just one month I saw great improvement in my ear still using now ordering a new bottle</li>
    <li> I have been using these pills for about 3 months now. I will say this, I cant really see where my hair has grown, but so many people say that my hair is growing and that they can notice a change in my texture. I think that I am going to try it out for another three months to see if I can see the difference.</li>
    <li> My bottle safety lining was opened. First time this has happened.</li>
    <li> It appears to help my hair grow</li>
    <li> Product is awesome it came very quickly. I&#x27;ve seen results already. Will buy again from this sealer.</li>
    <li> See no growth in my hair</li>
    <li> So far this is my 2nd bottle, and I have noticed small amounts of new growth. I would definitely recomend two bottles, don&#x27;t expect to see much of any change after the 1st. I am pleased and will continue the 90 days i planned to, hopefull the most damaged area&#x27;s of my hair will fully grown back in.</li>
    <li> So I just received my bottle and did not like the appearance of the bottle, looks old although expiration date is good. It was sealed on the outside but the inside seal wasn&#x27;t intact. After reading the reviews I have one to many concerns. A waste of my money...not happy, don&#x27;t need hair damage less facial breakouts!!! $34.99 down the drain.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Hair finity as a gift to my sister and she said she is seeing a difference in her hair and now I will be purchasing for myself as well</li>
    <li> everyone has differnet hair type, and for me I did not see much change! I took twice a day in the morning.. its 50/50 I wont say nothing to bad about this product because I saw better results with other people. I just say try it out for yourself :)</li>
    <li> They did a great job im in love with this product and would tell everyone about this product</li>
    <li> I completed one month of using hairfinity and now i ordered the second bottle and i realy saw a difference</li>
    <li> I have very Curly hair and it takes forever to grow.  I started to take the Hairfinity vitamins with my daily vitamins (vit c, e, b, biotin).&lt;br /&gt;I looked into taking Hairfinity b/c my stylist recently singed off 12 inches of hair (just a little section), leaving about 3 inches of my hair.  After taking these vitamins for 12 days, I have noticed 1/2 inch of my hair has already grown back. Absolutely would recommend this vitamin to anyone who needs a little help with hair growth.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working, will have to use a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Hair begin to grow everywhere..so I stop taking it</li>
    <li> I use hairinfinity products in the year of 2014.and the great product and help my hair tremendously. I stopped using it for a while and noticed the difference in my hair and now I&#x27;m back on the product love it. and the great product and help my hair tremendously. I stopped using it for a while and noticed the difference in my hair and now I&#x27;m back on the product love it</li>
    <li> I have been using hairfinity for a month now and am only one pill a day to introduce it to my body. I am inconsistent in my use and if i skip a weekend will take 2 pills to make up for the days i missed maybe BUT yet my hair is still growing like never before!!!!! I have almost half an inch of growth from one month and for my hair that&#x27;s something, the hair growing in is soft and manageable and it is amazing! the price is two high so stretching it out for 2 months is better for me but at full dosage everyday i bet i would experience wild growth. The pills are huge but easy to swallow and Ive experience no side effects. I drink plenty of water and take care to moisturize and protect my hair. I am planning on switching to a multi vitamin if i can find similar ingredients because the price is just not okay to me. GNC be beautiful at full dosage worked wonders for me so i am sure so would hairfinity. If you can afford it each month then hey, do it because it works.</li>
    <li> Yes. I feel that hairfinity is making my hair grow longer and thicker after a short time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Has helped me regain my hair.</li>
    <li> Your hair does grow, but, the jury still out on whether it will get thicker.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been on it for a month and 2 weeks.Skin is radiant, nails are stronger and of course my hair is thicker and longer!</li>
    <li> My hair is fuller longer and healthier two months do far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the product for about 3 weeks now. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Used for one month, and did see hair growth!!! Will let you know in acouple more months!</li>
    <li> Love them! Will be buying more</li>
    <li> My daughter bought these. It&#x27;s just a B vitamin, save your money, buy the regular vitamin brands.</li>
    <li> I hope these things work! This is only by second bottle but the vender is trusted.</li>
    <li> I love it, my hair is much healthier and stronger now. overall my hair looks great, I get a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> Product is working.. I can see New growth in bald spots. My hair has become much thicker around sides. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> I love Hairfinity it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Just bought them but my friends said they work after two months of my one friend using them she did however start to breakout! But her hair grew! I&#x27;m using them now and I&#x27;ll come back later for another review after 1 month!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t taken the entire bottle and I only take one pill per day. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes as of yet.</li>
    <li> Hello, I have very fine hair with some waves and a little frizz after processing it so much. My hair was 18 inches long and back in the summer I got some highlights done and I had to bleach my hair which damaged my hair very badly, my hair was fried and dry. So I got my hair cut into a bob a couple of months ago and just had it cut again on Dec. 17 with the purpose of growing it out. I am starting my Third week of hairfinity and so far so good. My hair is growing (not 3 inches in a week but still growing) I want to say that it is about an ¾ to a inch longer, its almost shoulder length and my hair feels fuller as well. No break outs so far, and I also take at least on Biotin only pill a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**PRICE**&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the hairfinity site its about 11$ cheaper is only 24$ for one bottle which comes to $30 after shipping and handling fees. I bought my first bottle from Hairfinity.com and took me about a week to receive the package on the mail. I bought my second bottle from Amazon.com because I get 25$ amazon gift cards from my job so I ended up paying like 12$ dollars for my second bottle.. I ordered on it from amazon on Jan. 2nd and received it on Sunday Jan 4th 2 DAYS WITH THEIR FREE SHIPPING!! WINNING!!.. so I think that for 5 dollars I will be ordering from amazon in the future..&lt;br /&gt;I WILL FINISH MY FIRST AND SECOND BOTTLE AND ILL BE BACK TO DO ANOTHER UPDTAE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/09/2015&lt;br /&gt;Retailer keeps changing prices.. i bought it for 35 dollars and its 41.99</li>
    <li> the pills work great. Will be ordering two more bottles next week.</li>
    <li> I started on January 5th, but I notice a growth spurt I probably gained an inch an a half since today 1/29/15.  I love it.</li>
    <li> If It would of have 60 capsels instead of 55 it would be excellent.</li>
    <li> Seen no results at all and it&#x27;s cheaper on the actual website</li>
    <li> After one months use,  I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.  This product may benefit those with vitamin deficits or poor diets. It is not worth the price; i have restarted my regular hair and nail vitamin!</li>
