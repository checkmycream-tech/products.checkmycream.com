      <li>Good buy.</li>
      <li>I bought this to use for trimming my mustache and can make it work with a lot of work while still not getting optimum results (i.e., an even trim).</li>

      <li>Philips Norelco, you&#x27;ve done nicely on this,</li>
      <li>The foil part is great though worth the money for just this.</li>
      <li>might see that I made the effort all on my own to achieve the result that the Philips Norelco Axe XA9146 is now doing, perhaps better as time</li>
      <li>like form and perfection, not messy nicks or blood scratches as a result of doing my best as I have had to with a razor blade (One that I had to cut and saw to dimensions to make the curves and strokes up and downward with the use of a tracer made of plastic with grinding tool) along with Norelco detailer/ trimmer called \\&quot;G370\\&quot;, previously.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Never have I done better with any detailer to mention.</li>
      <li>Very light, portable and efficient but lose parts get lost easily.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, easy to use</li>
      <li>Smooth shave?, accurate trimming?, for 15$???</li>
      <li>Despite the credibility I am extending to Norelco, they did not continue or have a replacement foil available for the G370</li>
      <li>Excellent trimmer and shaver that allow me to get into tight spots!</li>
      <li>Thats 30$ a year for nice n easy shavin action.</li>
      <li>Wish I found this great clipper much earlier in life, makes grooming detail work come out very professional looking.  </li>
      <li>And i consider myself as someone who rarely lose my stuff.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Go-Styler\\&quot; by Philips Norelco may also be worth checking in comparison as they appear identical.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>worth the money to me.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Go-Styler\\&quot; by Philips Norelco may also be worth checking in comparison as they appear identical.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
      <li>Great for a woman who wants to cut in tight in her &amp;#34;special area&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t want to risk nicking herself.</li>
      <li>This is great if you are like me and want to have clean sharp lines for facial hair.</li>
      <li>if the product works nicely for as long as it does work , if it breaks after 6 months, just buy a new one.</li>
      <li>It really works well.</li>
      <li>and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>but I love this shaver and it feels like it will last for a considerable time,smoot.consider</li>
      <li>Very small and handy.</li>
      <li>How did I live before this?</li>
      <li>want to make it clear that I bought this Philips Norelco Axe XA9146 for particularly one reason, it&#x27;s the FOIL DETAILER.  </li>
      <li>want to make it clear that I bought this Philips Norelco Axe XA9146 for particularly one reason, it&#x27;s the FOIL DETAILER.  </li>
      <li>It has a loose metal piece inside that keeps the battery from working right.</li>
      <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has just a tiny cutting blade and may be OK for travel use, but definitely fails when compared with my more substantial (more powerful and larger) electric trimmer that I have to plug into a socket.</li>
      <li>I lost one of the trimmer head and order a new philips norelco but lost the trimmer head a second time ! .</li>
      <li>I do wonder however if they can actually honor this warranty with either the replacement piece or the complete product itself when the time should come as I tried to replace the micro foil on G370 unsuccessfully?&lt;br</li>

    <li> How did I live before this? This is great if you are like me and want to have clean sharp lines for facial hair. The biggest turn off before I bought it was that it was battery operated but i have yet the need to replace the battery. (I use it daily) worth the money to me.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer and shaver that allow me to get into tight spots!</li>

    <li> Made by gillette enough said</li>
    <li> She sucks. Uneven trim</li>
    <li> Usually don&#x27;t write reviews this early after buying (I&#x27;ve had it for a week now) but I love this shaver and it feels like it will last for a considerable time,smoot.consider this if the product works nicely for as long as it does work , if it breaks after 6 months, just buy a new one. Thats 30$ a year for nice n easy shavin action. Smooth shave?, accurate trimming?, for 15$??? Get outta town. WOULD RECCOMEND TO A FRIEND</li>
    <li> Given as a gift to a guy who has a beard and likes to keep it trim and neat.  He was pleased!</li>
    <li> Very light, portable and efficient but lose parts get lost easily. I lost one of the trimmer head and order a new philips norelco but lost the trimmer head a second time ! . And i consider myself as someone who rarely lose my stuff. So..</li>

    <li> It does the job well for its cost. But, if you are looking for precision, this is not the best product. A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer today and applied it to my mustache and beard almost immediately and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;This instrument provides the best and most supportive angle to achieve the results I need. I wear a thin pencil-like mustache that is trimmed daily with the least length of hair above my lip as a courteous gesture to the girlfriend and general appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I like form and perfection, not messy nicks or blood scratches as a result of doing my best as I have had to with a razor blade (One that I had to cut and saw to dimensions to make the curves and strokes up and downward with the use of a tracer made of plastic with grinding tool) along with Norelco detailer/ trimmer called \\&quot;G370\\&quot;, previously.&lt;br /&gt;One might see that I made the effort all on my own to achieve the result that the Philips Norelco Axe XA9146 is now doing, perhaps better as time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;  The previously owned Philips-Norelco G370 foil shaver did not cut with quite the precision I am achieving with the Philips Norelco Axe XA9146.  The detail-foil of G370 got worn in less than a year and nicked my face. Despite the credibility I am extending to Norelco, they did not continue or have a replacement foil available for the G370 and I was discouraged to give Philips-Norelco a 2nd try for another product of theirs. I must however give them credit for this little invention called \\&quot;Philips Norelco Axe XA9146\\&quot;, in regards to its foil detail shaver. It works like a charm and I have been offered another 6 months additional warranty after the given 2 years, registering the product online. I do wonder however if they can actually honor this warranty with either the replacement piece or the complete product itself when the time should come as I tried to replace the micro foil on G370 unsuccessfully?&lt;br /&gt;  For the price and money I paid for this wonderful unit, all in all I am happy. Never have I done better with any detailer to mention. I got the closest detail shave performance with this unit.  The \\&quot;Go-Styler\\&quot; by Philips Norelco may also be worth checking in comparison as they appear identical.&lt;br /&gt;I want to make it clear that I bought this Philips Norelco Axe XA9146 for particularly one reason, it&#x27;s the FOIL DETAILER.  Philips Norelco, you&#x27;ve done nicely on this, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate however that the warranty offered with this product remain intact with affordable replacement parts in magnitude to the price of the unit so I don&#x27;t have to look for another trimmer/ detailer in another year or feel that Philips-Norelco is eluding their customers with false hope. The research today has paid off.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. When turning the unit off, be careful to turn the cartridge casing slightly or the battery compartment will open.&lt;br /&gt;2.

    <li> Excellent product, great pricing &amp; timely shipping</li>
    <li> Great Value for the price</li>
    <li> Wish it was rechargeable! Great for shaping up around my goatee.</li>
    <li> Great for a woman who wants to cut in tight in her &amp;#34;special area&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t want to risk nicking herself.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove underarm hair. Though it works it does not remove the hair as closely as I would like</li>
    <li> It been two weeks since am using it. It really works well.</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars if it had a rechargeable battery....</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Came on time but a DUD came in January and 1 year warranty that expired December 31, 2014. It doesn&#x27;t work right. It has a loose metal piece inside that keeps the battery from working right. You have to hold it upside down to run. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works great wish i can find replacement parts for the detail microscreen attachment...</li>
    <li> It works as expected. Good buy.</li>
