      <li>It stuck great and held my boobs up to make them look perky in my dress.</li>
      <li>I wont buy another one but good luck if you can get it to work.</li>
      <li>Amazing product and reusable.</li>
      <li>I will not be able to clasp the clasp.</li>
      <li>so it came off easily.</li>
      <li>Also, it was SO comfortable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably only good for a one time use</li>
      <li>It fit right and looked exactly the way I thought it would because of the picture posted on ebay!</li>

<li> I am a modest B cup, and this bra does not fit.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s an adult size, but it was way too small, so be careful when you pick your size.</li>
<li> I got this bra for my backless prom dress and was really worried it would fall off, not stick, show my nipples if i were cold, or make my boobs look like saggy masses.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like it and a waste of money</li>
<li> Ordered a size c got a size a. Waste of time</li>
<li> Runs too small, also I selected the NUDE one and they sent me the BLACK one, also, it doesn´t stick at all.</li>
<li> It was too small, never ask me for a size, I cant used it because it was small size</li>
<li> nothing bad to say except i should have gotten it in a bigger size!</li>
<li> Was utterly disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> I was disappointed, it was not sticky</li>

    <li> worked fantastically. didn&#x27;t fall off my chest or come off with sweat throughout the entire night of prom. i highly recommend this product if you are looking for a bra that gives you support yet doesn&#x27;t have any seams.</li>
    <li> I am a 32 b, and I ordered this for homecoming expecting it to be much bigger because I&#x27;m a teen and it&#x27;s an adult size, but it was way too small, so be careful when you pick your size.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wear a bra with straps I think that was the best part of this purchase I will definitely be getting this item again!</li>
    <li> I got this bra for my backless prom dress and was really worried it would fall off, not stick, show my nipples if i were cold, or make my boobs look like saggy masses. But this bra was the complete opposite and was worth my every penny. It stuck great and held my boobs up to make them look perky in my dress. Also, it was SO comfortable I didn&#x27;t even wanna take it off at the end of the night. Amazing product and reusable.</li>
    <li> It was too small, never ask me for a size, I cant used it because it was small size and I need in medium.</li>
    <li> I am a modest B cup, and this bra does not fit. I will not be able to clasp the clasp. In addition, the sticky portion does not stay adhered.</li>

    <li> Ordered a size c got a size a. Waste of time</li>
    <li> It does not stick very well, and it does not help with anything! It does not push in or up. It is pretty much just so you do not nip. I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all! The bra would not stay in place. Was utterly disappointed with this product. Would not suggest</li>
