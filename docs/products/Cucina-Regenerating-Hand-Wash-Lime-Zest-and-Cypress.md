    <li> A beautiful strong-scented hand-wash for the kitchen</li>
    <li> My wife loves this soap, and I like it as well. No store close to us stocks it, so it was nice to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hand wash and lotion for years. My favorite!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and it is moisturizing.  I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product but the scent on this particular one leaves you questioning WHAT it is as you&#x27;re washing your hands. The scent fades pretty fast once your hands have dried. I&#x27;ll use this one up and then try a different scent of the same brand. There is not a hint of lime scent at all.</li>
    <li> Got this from my daughter, loved the scent. Cheaper on Amazon; will order from this site from now on. Very good for your hands with olive oil as an ingredient.</li>

    <li> This is our favorite kitchen soap. It doesnt dry out your skin and smells GREAT! Plus, it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than getting it at a specialty store or Sur La Table.</li>
    <li> Love Cucina products!&lt;br /&gt;discovered by accident at a sample shop - use the hand cream, hand soap and dishwashing liquid.</li>
    <li> Cleans well without drying the skin. Has a subtle, pleasant scent. Expensive, but I really like this soap.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Nice citrus smell! Received as a gift and now hooked on the product!</li>
    <li> The only hand soap my husband will use.  Smells great, feels great, cleans great.  A definite 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Great products and amazing customer service. Will order again!&lt;br /&gt;Cucina products are wonderful and not only do they have a wonderful scent, they look beautiful in our office kitchen countertop!&lt;br /&gt;We will always keep a refill.</li>
