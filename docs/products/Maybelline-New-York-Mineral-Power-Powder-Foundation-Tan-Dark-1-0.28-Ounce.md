      <li>I was happy to have found it on here thanks</li>
      <li>this is my favorite makeup I am not a makeup person</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>but really glad I found it here.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that found this color here</li>
      <li>I do love it, even better</li>
      <li>This is the only mineral makeup beside Jane Iredale which is almost 3 times the price,that works PERFECT on my oily,sensitive,acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments with this product about my skin and how it looks.</li>
      <li>A family member turned me onto this powder and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I always receive it in great condition brand new!</li>
      <li>Perfect for dark skin, it is natural looking and a perfect fit for me</li>
      <li>It is very light and it gives you a smooth look.</li>
      <li>I love this product it makes your face look smooth</li>
      <li>I buy a few at a time because the price is awesome. :)</li>
      <li>It is easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>It is a tad bit dark however it is perfect for my skin tone during the summer season.</li>
      <li>One of the best foundations I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
      <li>so I mix a couple dots of Maybelline Fit Me (#355..</li>
      <li>Looks good and natural.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, quality product</li>
      <li>it matches great w/ the powder in Tan, Dark 1) with my moisturizer &amp; then finish w/ Mineral Power.</li>
      <li>Great product, its not a cheap product.</li>
      <li>so I use my own, larger brush.</li>
      <li>Exact product I was looking for and was lucky to find it here, seeing as how it is now discontinued.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this foundation and have been using it for years, then all of a sudden it disappeared from the stores, now I have to try and find it online</li>
      <li>and this was exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
      <li>: use a cotton tip (Qtip) applicator to target blemishes first, then brush over enitre face, I do neck also.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This is my 4th time purchasing this exact item &amp; everytime</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use that much of it and lasts awhile so worth the buy.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, and this is okay, but definitely does not compare with Mineral Secrets.</li>
      <li>When you blend it in with the brush it sets so well onto your skin and pretty much stays put.</li>
      <li>This has got to be my favorite loose powder foundation ever!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, you end up with a very matte looking face.</li>
      <li>This is a foundation that ABSOLUTELY MUST have a setter applied to it when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to use much at all.</li>
      <li>it is almost twice as much in some stores</li>
      <li>I really wish Maybeline still offered this shade of mineral powder in stores;but</li>
      <li>Thanks maybelline</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It really agitates me that Maybelline would discontinue this product.</li>
      <li>I use organic rose water, spritzing several times while at minimum 6 inches away from my face, and it gives a dewy baby-soft skin appearance (one which last even as the day goes</li>
      <li>I know there may be other mineral powders out there, but I don&#x27;t even want to try any others because I love this one so much.</li>
      <li>It does look a tad lighter in certain lighting, but I gauge coverage and blending while in the sun, for a concrete determination of the color match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does get a little chalky if too much is used, but other than that it is great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend it for acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>Anyone who wears makeup knows that as you introduce new products, sometimes the skin has adverse reactions.</li>
      <li>What I love, is the fact that you only need a little.</li>
      <li>and I always get compliments on my skin and face and how young I look.</li>
      <li>Works well and blend with natural skin tones.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are kinda rough, so use whatever other brush you like for better application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this same one since high school</li>
      <li>I have really dry skin &amp; discoloration, so I&#x27;m really picky about what I use.</li>
      <li>but this makeup give such a natural glow on your skin and</li>
      <li>I thought this was a pressed power not a loose powder</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Too bad this product has been discontinued....I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> My only problem with this awesome and tragically discontinued product is the terrible brush that comes with it. It&#x27;s a piece of junk, but this foundation is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes your face look smooth n flawless, I&#x27;ve been using it for years I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect match for my skin complexion and its very light wearing...it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.  I will continue to use this and I recommend this to women of color.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Very pleased and will order more</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation and have been using it for years, then all of a sudden it disappeared from the stores, now I have to try and find it online which is difficult in the color (Tan, dark ) which I use and it cost way more than previously in the stores which also is ridiculous. I really wished Maybelline kept it in the stores where it used to be so convenient to purchase,but the product is wonderful and I always get compliments on my skin and face and how young I look.</li>
    <li> ordered for a friend..she liked it</li>
    <li> A family member turned me onto this powder and I absolutely love it. I have a terrible time finding this shade however in any of the local stores. What I love, is the fact that you only need a little. When you blend it in with the brush it sets so well onto your skin and pretty much stays put. I get SOOOO many compliments on how flawless my skin looks. I know there may be other mineral powders out there, but I don&#x27;t even want to try any others because I love this one so much.</li>
    <li> I finally found this color,all the stores seemed to have stopped carrying this color. I&#x27;m glad that found this color here, I literally looked for this color for 4 years! LOL.This is the best! foundation for colored women, it blends well,&amp; it doesnt rub off on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  it&#x27;s a great cover up that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and has SPF-15.  I have sensitive skin, so I was happy to have this! Love it!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a pressed power not a loose powder</li>
    <li> What I expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, quality product</li>
    <li> This stuff was the perfect color for me. It does get a little chalky if too much is used, but other than that it is great.</li>
    <li> I love Maybelline Mineral Power! I think it&#x27;s been discontinued (especially my color, because I cannot find it in ANY store!) I have really dry skin &amp; discoloration, so I&#x27;m really picky about what I use. I tried Bare Minerals in the past, but it did not work like the infomercials claim they do. Mineral Power gives me the coverage I need &amp; matches my skin tone so well! I do not use the brush, though. It&#x27;s too small &amp; it applies too much powder to one spot...so I use my own, larger brush. The bristles are kinda rough, so use whatever other brush you like for better application. And you don&#x27;t have to use much at all. I like using a liquid foundation...so I mix a couple dots of Maybelline Fit Me (#355..it matches great w/ the powder in Tan, Dark 1) with my moisturizer &amp; then finish w/ Mineral Power. It looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Wife uses it and is happy with the price she tells me it is almost twice as much in some stores</li>
    <li> Absolutely ♥ It! This is my 4th time purchasing this exact item &amp; everytime I order I always receive it in great condition brand new! Thanks</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color in any stores I was happy to have found it on here thanks</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite loose powder foundation ever! I&#x27;ve been using this same one since high school and I&#x27;m in my 20s now.  I was sad that they discontinued them in stores but really glad I found it here.  I buy a few at a time because the price is awesome. :)</li>
    <li> love this stuff and cant find it anywhere anymore</li>
    <li> This is the only mineral makeup beside Jane Iredale which is almost 3 times the price,that works PERFECT on my oily,sensitive,acne-prone skin.I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend it for acne prone skin. Coverage is flawless and light. They stopped selling this shade in stores over 6 months now,,SOOO thankful to have found it on Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mineral Power Powder once before Maybelline pulled it off the shelf. Now I remember why I used it only once. You get what you pay for, and this is okay, but definitely does not compare with Mineral Secrets. Does not  feel as smooth and light and does not blend into the skin as flawlessly. This will do in a pinch, but I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> Covers well. Looks good and natural. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Purchased this and received it about 4 days later. Exact product I was looking for and was lucky to find it here, seeing as how it is now discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely excellent. It really agitates me that Maybelline would discontinue this product. They have continued this product in nude and tan and other skin tones for lighter skin toned people, but it looks like they have discontinued the same product in the dark shades. I think this is so \\&quot;not smart\\&quot;, and not fair to darker toned people,&lt;br /&gt;and I can&#x27;t help but wonder why they did that. I may need to pursue that question. However, I was just trying to find&lt;br /&gt;as many as I can because I cannot find this product in my city locally. Thanks</li>
    <li> I do love it, even better then I thought, your service is amazing, i would not hesitate to order anything from your site</li>
    <li> This is nice and light, yet had excellent coverage. Tip: use a cotton tip (Qtip) applicator to target blemishes first, then brush over enitre face, I do neck also.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great product, its not a cheap product. Perfect for dark skin, it is natural looking and a perfect fit for me</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this shade in the stores near me anymore and this was exactly what I wanted and needed. I had no issues at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I usually use it to blend in my foundation with my dark bags under my eyes. It is easy to wash off. It does not give me any acne.</li>
    <li> It is a tad bit dark however it is perfect for my skin tone during the summer season. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used make up before but I like this. It&#x27;s not too heavy. Very light coverage. Thumbs up from me.</li>
    <li> One of the best foundations I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. I&#x27;ve never used mineral powder foundation, but I&#x27;ve always heard good things about it. I finally decided to try it, and it&#x27;s wonderful. The color blended and matched my brown skin perfectly. I opted for Tan - Dark, and it compliments my skin. It does look a tad lighter in certain lighting, but I gauge coverage and blending while in the sun, for a concrete determination of the color match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s easy to apply, and the brush that is included is perfect. I learned to use a slight of hand, and to &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; product into the cap for application accuracy (very little is needed). Blend in a circular clockwise motion, and outward. This is a foundation that ABSOLUTELY MUST have a setter applied to it when you&#x27;re done. Otherwise, you end up with a very matte looking face. I use organic rose water, spritzing several times while at minimum 6 inches away from my face, and it gives a dewy baby-soft skin appearance (one which last even as the day goes on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did notice some very slight irritation on my upper cheeks after using this for a couple of days, and I attributed that to the accumulation of oil being trapped under the makeup as it expired through the day. Even that didn&#x27;t discredit the 5 star rating I gave this as being a really nice and easy to use foundation. Anyone who wears makeup knows that as you introduce new products, sometimes the skin has adverse reactions. However, please don&#x27;t let this stop you from ordering a great product.</li>
    <li> I cant find this color anywhere besides online..this is my go to powder. Its very light and goes on flawlessly with light to medium coverage, not to mention it gives me a nice natural tan look...not orangy and I can control how dark I want to go. Its also good for contouring as well...love it</li>
    <li> Could not find this item anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Found it here.&lt;br /&gt;Great price!&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderful for mineral powder for my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have looked for this product everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find in the store or online for this color they would have every color but this one which was disappointed and I had run out of it I was so disappointed and search the web to find somewhere they sold this color this is my favorite makeup I am not a makeup person but this makeup give such a natural glow on your skin and its like having nothing on your skin it is light and free and have good coverage and you don&#x27;t have to use that much of it and lasts awhile so worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well and blend with natural skin tones.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This foundation is great!  Covers wonderfully.  I have blemishes that I use a little extra product on.  It doesn&#x27;t require touch ups througout the day.  I put on at 7:00 AM and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I really wish Maybeline still offered this shade of mineral powder in stores;but they have discontinued the product. Now I have to search online to find the shade. This particular shipment came in on time as expected. The product was in great condition and I will be ordering again soon. It&#x27;s the only shade of mineral powder that works well for me and my daughter.Too bad Maybeline thinks darker shade women aren&#x27;t using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darlene</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone. I get so many compliments with this product about my skin and how it looks. It is very light and it gives you a smooth look. Thanks maybelline</li>
