      <li>They worked great for a few weeks.  </li>

      <li>THIS tweezers however are GREAT, they comes needle sharp and the storage bag protects the tips so that will not dull.</li>
      <li>I used to essentailly have to dig a hole in my hands with a pocket knife, but these pretty easily have gotten out every one I&#x27;ve had so far, even when they&#x27;re under the skin.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery</li>
      <li>A must have for my household first aid kit and anyone else with children that get splinters (as mine seem to do quite often).</li>
      <li>These worked pretty well</li>
      <li>First, let me say that I am a tweezing addict.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they will last a while</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been spending way to much on tweezers at sephora!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>had previously used Tweezermans point tip tweezers but the TWEEZEES are more precise and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy another brand.  </li>
      <li>I can get the fine eyebrow hair that is to short for any other tweezers which is especially good for dark hair.</li>
      <li>this is a professional quality product, I had to use it to get a tiny torn of my little daughter&#x27;s finder and it did the work excellently, if it can get that, it can handle anything, The bag which comes with</li>
      <li>Should be easy enough to clean/sterilize, the tips aren&#x27;t chromed, but look like stainless.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so frustrating to be able to clearly see a hair and not be able to pull it out with tweezers!</li>
      <li>Incredibly sharp and super precise.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Can remove ingrown hair very easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these!  </li>
      <li>It feels very sturdy</li>
      <li>The tips of these tweezers are actually very well aligned.  </li>
      <li>Feels very durable.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really tell in the photos</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very practical.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how these will work for hair removal, but they&#x27;re fine enough to grab a single hair easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove every single hair.</li>
      <li>but what I can tell you is that they are made well and high quality.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for everyone.</li>
      <li>Even using a 10x Jewelers headband magnifier, the tips still appear sharp, which is far better than anything I can get at a grocery store.</li>
      <li>They are sharp and easily pierce the skin to let the hair poke through</li>
      <li>Got each individual hair on first try and even the super short ones.  </li>
      <li>Using the bare eye, they look very pointy, but using a Jeweler&#x27;s loop 20X, the tips are a little more blunt than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
      <li>However the seller did send me a new pair.</li>
      <li>Very sharp with very precise tips just like professional medical instruments.</li>
      <li>Hairs (or splinters) are gripped firmly and precisely with finely-pointed tips.</li>
      <li>So, I don&#x27;t completely regret this purchase</li>
      <li>These are very useful for removing small splinters.</li>
      <li>My main complaint about them is that there is not enough tension, strength available to pull the hairs out.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>I wanted something which I could use to get splinters out and other things which require very high precision.  </li>
      <li>These have super sharp points so be careful.</li>
      <li>The long tip is also very convenient but just be careful of the sharpness.</li>

    <li> Excellent splinter removal tool - hope the tips are sturdier than cheaper versions.</li>
    <li> I mainly will be using them to pick up small blings for my card making.  They are great .</li>
    <li> I am a man who suffers from a beard that grows in all directions causing me to have ingrown hairs. Finding a pair of needle tip tweezers should be easy but often times the result is a pair of tweezers that couldn&#x27;t pop a balloon. THIS tweezers however are GREAT, they comes needle sharp and the storage bag protects the tips so that will not dull. I highly recommend these!  PS, really great price. :)</li>

    <li> Good tweezers but not durable and don&#x27;t last.  They worked great for a few weeks.  Now they can&#x27;t even grip a long hair</li>
    <li> These do not grab the hair easily and it does not grip hair to pull.  Very disappointed.  Maybe the pair I received is bent.</li>
    <li> These have super sharp points so be careful. Other than that this is a very good product. Feels very durable. As long as I don&#x27;t lose them I&#x27;m sure they will last a while</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers.  I am a Make-up Artist and LOVE these.  I have always paid at least $20.00 for professional tweezers but I have to say this pair is the BEST I&#x27;ve owned.  I can get the fine eyebrow hair that is to short for any other tweezers which is especially good for dark hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use these yet but what I can tell you is that they are made well and high quality. The tip is sharp and perfect for getting out splinters. A must have for my household first aid kit and anyone else with children that get splinters (as mine seem to do quite often).</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers.  And I love that they come in a pouch to protect the tip. They work great and I would buy again.  Very fast delivery</li>
    <li> Very sharp points that meet perfectly.  the points are protected with a plastic cap, which is nice.  The tool is high quality  Presentation, with carrying case to keep it protected is a nice feature as well.</li>
    <li> These did not even pull a hair out of my husband&#x27;s back. These I don&#x27;t like. 7-10-15 However the seller did send me a new pair. They are better but not the best.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s easy to remove every single hair.</li>
    <li> i am very pleased with this purchase. I hope I never have to use these but I know I will.  very handy in carry on luggage. comes with excellent canvas tote and hi quality zippered plastic tote. light color tote easy to find in carry on luggage. I hope I never have to use for insect/bug removal from body but at least im prepared. I highly recommend this for everyone. my girl scout motto: be prepared. hehehe happy trails everyone  :)</li>
    <li> Bought it for removing ticks from our dogs (and ourselves if necessary).  Just got it and haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it is well made and should work as intended.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> These are the best splinter tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. They are very well made, very precise in alignment and tip contact. I bought these because I had a metal splinter in my thumb, and it was removed within minutes of opening the shipping box. I don&#x27;t know how these will work for hair removal, but they&#x27;re fine enough to grab a single hair easily. The pouch is a bit undersized, and you have to do some creative angling to get the tweezers to fit without poking through the fabric. The tips are sharp and smooth, perfect for digging around for splinters. Should be easy enough to clean/sterilize, the tips aren&#x27;t chromed, but look like stainless.</li>
    <li> Tried them out as soon as I received them.  They are super.  Got each individual hair on first try and even the super short ones.  Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> As soon as I recieved these, I got to dedicate some time to my spouse to attack his random hairs and ridiculous eyebrows. These work just as well (perhaps better) than my expensive tweezerman tweezers, and I like the canvas bag because I can pack them in my makeup bag without worrying they&#x27;re going to stab and break up my makeup.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are sharp.  Like two gabby needles.  Seriously, seriously sharp.  I can&#x27;t imagine anything better for removing stubborn splinters.  I have another pair of needle tipped tweezers (and not a cheap pair, either) and still need an actual needle to remove bad splinters.  I do not think I would with this pair.  It&#x27;s seriously a gabby double needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came with both a canvas zipper pouch and a plastic pouch.  There was a tough plastic cover over the tip of the tweezers which I will keep for when they are not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Splinter removal trick for kids: Dab OraGel on the splinter site about a minute before getting to work, then distract the child so they cannot see what you are doing.  No tears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Splinter removal trick #2 for kids: Remove the splinter with a flashlight after they are asleep.</li>
    <li> Well made sharp tips&lt;br /&gt;Can remove ingrown hair very easy.&lt;br /&gt;They are firm and do not bend like some cheaper tweezers I have tried&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied</li>
    <li> Tweezees are a fantastic piece of equipment. Very sharp with very precise tips just like professional medical instruments. If you can see the hair, this will grab it.&lt;br /&gt;I had previously used Tweezermans point tip tweezers but the TWEEZEES are more precise and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy another brand.  GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> These worked pretty well and I got the results I wanted! It helped me get a splinter out with ease, fix my jewelry, and get to those tiny spots not many other tools can do! Great product!</li>
    <li> It functions just like it should.</li>
    <li> I hesitated in choosing 2 or 3 stars for these tweezers &amp; wish I could give them 2.5. First, let me say that I am a tweezing addict. I love, love, love tweezing. I bought these pointed nose tweezers to use for both really short hairs that slant tweezers often have trouble grabbing and also for ingrown hairs. For the short hairs, these tweezers are not very effective. For the ingrown hair, they are only minimally more effective. They are sharp and easily pierce the skin to let the hair poke through but when it comes to tweezing the actual hair out, it may only take one try or it may take 30 tries. It&#x27;s so frustrating to be able to clearly see a hair and not be able to pull it out with tweezers! The tips of these tweezers are actually very well aligned.  My main complaint about them is that there is not enough tension, strength available to pull the hairs out. But for splinters &amp; courser hair, I believe these would work well. So, I don&#x27;t completely regret this purchase but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for those perfect, magical, tweezers.</li>
    <li> Does the job! Make sure to keep the plastic cover for the tweezers to keep the point from dulling (and to not poke yourself)</li>
    <li> Precise and well-made.  Comes in a handy pouch for storage.</li>
    <li> My barber recommended Tweezees for removing my ingrown beard. I have curly hair and bead and get lots ingrown hair after close shaves. Since I have been using this product my ingrown hair are gone. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are very useful for removing small splinters. If they were even pointier, I would have given 5 stars. Using the bare eye, they look very pointy, but using a Jeweler&#x27;s loop 20X, the tips are a little more blunt than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
