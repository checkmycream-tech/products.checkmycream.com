      <li>Hello Good Afternoon perfume has a sweet, rich flavor, I recommend the teenager.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Got it for her ( happy as can be) and was surprised I like it as well.</li>
      <li>I loved our moment, floral, fruity, for directioners , I really liked their predominant intense and juicy and heavenly combination of fresh fruits.</li>

      <li>If your GF/wife likes 1D  just buy it anyways because you will fore sure get laid by a decent smelling GF.</li>
      <li>The bottle is also very pretty.</li>
      <li>Needless to say, she is beyond happy, and waltzed around the house pushing her wrist in our faces to smell the fab scent she now possesses!</li>

      <li>It is actually quite lovely.</li>
      <li>;)</li>

      <li>the package is really nice...arrived on time too...</li>
      <li>This product was for my daughter, she really like it.</li>
      <li>but she loved it due to the teen band promoting the product.</li>

<li> Little stronger then I was expecting.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too heavy / floral and lasts through the day.&lt;br /&gt;I may have to make an additional purchase since she knows that I&#x27;m sneaking sprays.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical at the beginning with their perfume</li>
<li> This product is very expensive in US department stores.  </li>

    <li> Christmas gift for my Niece. She was Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love one direction, so naturally I had to get this wonderful perfume. The bottle is beautiful, it smells wonderful, and  it&#x27;s just a really great buy!</li>
    <li> Hello Good Afternoon perfume has a sweet, rich flavor, I recommend the teenager.</li>
    <li> who cares how it smells, it&#x27;s 1D, and that&#x27;s all my daughter cares about! I haven&#x27;t smelled it yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine. She&#x27;s getting it for Christmas tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Huge Directioner so I had to get this! The smell is amazing! I keep on getting compliments! Thanks to the boys for making this wonderful perfume! ;)</li>
    <li> My GF loves 1D but I cant stand girl bands. I sucked it up and purchased it anyway and it smells pretty good on her, I&#x27;ve smelled better perfumes but its pretty good. The moral of the review is... If your GF/wife likes 1D  just buy it anyways because you will fore sure get laid by a decent smelling GF.</li>
    <li> This is what my grand daughter wanted for her birthday.  It needs to be used sparingly as it is pretty powerfu.  That&#x27;s a good thing.  You do not have to use very much to smell good!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for a friends daughter for her birthday and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;My own daughter also has it and loves it too. Brilliant!!!</li>
    <li> MY GRANDKIDS LOVED IT  THEY LOVE ONE DIRECTION AND LOVED THE SMELL OF THE PERFUME THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP THE BOX AND BOTTLE</li>
    <li> It was for my daughter. . It smells wonderful.. the package is really nice...arrived on time too... the only thing is it looks bigger in the image</li>

    <li> This does smell pretty good, don&#x27;t let the packaging sway you one way or another.  My nieces both love it!</li>
    <li> Everything about it is amazing. The delivery was great and when i got it i saw angels. Smells like heaven on earth and i&#x27;m looking forward to recommend it</li>
    <li> If you have teenage daughters like mine, you probably know what it is 1D mania. I got it for my girls as a gift. The quality could have been better, especially it is relatively expensive. It is worth mentioning that it is better to wear it in winter.</li>
