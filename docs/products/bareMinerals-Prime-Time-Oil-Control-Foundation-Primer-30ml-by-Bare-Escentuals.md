    <li> Absolutely essential primer for my make up. Love it</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used under my makeup!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Make up is so much easier to apply after prime time</li>
    <li> I have used it for several years</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my makeup hon on smoother. Great seller. Came within 3 days as we are Prime Members.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine wearing my makeup without this foundation primer. It makes everything smooth and gives a palette with no crinkles or creases or places for make up to settle. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My face always feels softer after applying it this is one product I&#x27;ve never strayed from</li>
    <li> Best primer I have found, is compatible with all types of foundation.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation primer I have found. Primer is essential to a good coverage. I have found you do not use as much foundation when you apply primer first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mineral makeup primer that helps to avoid rough patches, flaky dryness, the look of fine lines, excess oil, uneven texture, and the appearance of enlarged pores.  I have found the primer extends the wear of my foundation.  The silky formula, with silicone glides on, and in the hot weather, I wait 15 minutes before applying foundation. I find it keeps the foundation from sweating or running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply one pump for an even layer of primer all over your face, under eyes and eyelids. Once it has dried, I apply my foundation with a make up brush. I find I use less foundation, and my face looks better, less is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is light, non sticky primer. I also use it without foundation. I apply the primer, and then some highlighter under nares and eyes, and any touch areas on my chin. This keeps me looking fresh all day without foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-21-15</li>
    <li> I swear by this product as a skin smoother. I always wear it under my base makeup for a balanced look. It does make my skin look younger and smoother. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my face nice and moist before applying the makeup.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and have tried others but there is no comparison!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this primer..little goes a long way, and found by accident, it helps firm my under chin area!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it forever. It&#x27;s just part of the Bare Minerals application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years under my Bare Minerals foundation.  It seems to control shine and makes application smoother.</li>
    <li> I Love Prime Time Primer,  it allows my makeup to stay on all day, and my makeup looks good over the primer.</li>
    <li> Love this and will continue to buy it ! It goes on so nice and makes such a difference !</li>
    <li> Best primer I have tried.  Very smooth and non greasy.</li>
    <li> Its a great product, used with the Bare Minerals foundation, but the container/bottle is rather difficult to use, as it comes out in large squirts at times.  The product itself is great!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a number of years. Love the smooth silky feeling of the skin prior to putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> Product as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very good, prompt delivery,</li>
    <li> Great product and received as expected.</li>
    <li> Is clear and does a great job.  No breakouts.  One pump is plenty.  Switched from Smashbox because of the cost, but I&#x27;m really happy with Prime Time, and it has an SPF too!</li>
    <li> Delivery was as promised. Evens out my skin tone perfectly. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I love using bareMinerals and this is an absolute must have. It makes my skin feel silky smooth and ready for makeup application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and really notice the difference when applying my foundation.  I start out with my moisterizer 1st and then apply my foundation primer and give it time to set in.  My foundation goes on smoothly and looks flawless.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! I didn&#x27;t realize how important primer was until I started using it but it really does make a difference! My face just doesn&#x27;t feel or look the same if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products</li>
    <li> If you wear Bare Minerals powder, you need this primer.  It keeps the powder from drying out your face and also gives it a smooth surface for the application.  I wish there was a better way to get the last of the product out of the bottle.  Other than that, no complains.  I have been using this product for over 3 years.</li>
    <li> Perfect primer for the bareMinerals foundation.</li>
    <li> Perfect, as expected from this brand</li>
