    <li> I loved the idea of this kit, and had planned to give it as a gift to a person who flies a lot and appreciates the small lotion bottles. Good thing I didn&#x27;t!  Of the five bottles, four were only half full.  Definitely not acceptable. Somebody should be checking these before they are sent out!</li>
    <li> Nice samples of the J.r. Watkins products.</li>
    <li> We need some quality control here Dr. Watkins. 2 of the 5 bottles were less than half full. Kind of embarrassing presents.</li>
    <li> Actually I like the cream - but the hard plastic containers make it impossible to get the cream out.  They can barely be squeezed a little.  Even when stored upsidedown, the cream will not come out of the container.  It&#x27;s very thick and effective, but what good is it inside the container?&lt;br /&gt;Buy the cream in a different container, not these little ones.</li>
    <li> The lotions were all wonderful; however, it was quite the chore getting the lotion out of the bottle.  Thought it was just my hand strength, but my husband could not get the lotion out either.  Threatened to get a pair of pliers to squeeze out the lotion.  It was a two man job - he used his teeth to squeeze the lotion into my hand.</li>
    <li> you don&#x27;t know how i am crazy for this lotion, the are mini, sweety fragance, and cau be used for a long time, recommand it.</li>
    <li> J.R. Watkins is a very nice lotion. The variety and the size iof the cintainers is perfect for gifts or travel.</li>
