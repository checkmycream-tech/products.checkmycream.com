      <li>Im a brown toned woman and the colors that i have used, thus far, show up beautifully.</li>
      <li>I have paired this beautiful eyeshadow palette with the 24 HR Eyeshadow Magic Eyeshadow Primer, and I must say these two coupled together will make everyone elses&#x27; eyeshadow look like garbage next to yours.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, so I dont know how well it would hold up to that, but its safe and secure at any rate)</li>
      <li>Just as beautiful as I expected, thank you for such a great purchase my niece was thrilled.</li>
      <li>This was the first eyeshadow I ever got on my own for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The colors are great and they last all day.</li>
      <li>Soooooo worth it since I can&#x27;t find anything like this in stores :)</li>
      <li>I bought it because of the price but honestly didnt  expect much.  </li>
      <li>OH MY GOD, what I thinking buying this cheap quality pallette.</li>
      <li>But overall, if you own a good eyeshadow primer, it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Love it and recommend it to anyone who wants to add bright and fun colors and wants to spice up their looks :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitively recommend it to anyone who loves makeup just as much as I do, it&#x27;s a must-have!!!</li>
      <li>The only downside I would say is the brush it comes with, but as many people may know, in order to have nice makeup you must have different types of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good product and definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I was so excited</li>
      <li>it is NOT to small but perfect!</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I got this palette.</li>
      <li>even though each colour is small in size, it is still and excellent buy</li>
      <li>The colours are pretty bright and vibrant...</li>
      <li>Sure enough, they did, quite nicely too I might add.</li>
      <li>I have a couple of other cheap palettes, and they&#x27;re great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> really radiant colors</li>
    <li> The colors are pigmented and great. The palette is super tiny compared to what I thought I was receiving. All in all good product for my first makeup palette. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my daughters other various palettes just to see if it was as good as the expensive ones.  It is.  Pros:pigmentation,no highlights  Cons:stains brushes</li>
    <li> i am pleasantly surprised with this palette. I bought it because of the price but honestly didnt  expect much.  but actually these colors are very pigmented and with a primer these colors last... i&#x27;m a makeup artist and  all of these colors worked great on my clients and lasted very long...very impressed....and its def something great for the price!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this palette. I love it, kinda wished the pigments were a little more eye popping but overall I love it.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get my palette. I opened it up right away and realized that it&#x27;s way smaller than it looks. I&#x27;m not sure why I assumed that it would be comparable to the picture, but it sort of isn&#x27;t. It does have 96 colors, but they&#x27;re tiny. Like dime sized or smaller. I&#x27;m happy with the number of colors and the price, but I thought I would be getting more.</li>
    <li> In one word: AWSOME!!! One dab of powder and you&#x27;ll have silk-looking, bright-colored, all-day-lasting eyeshadow. Use it over a layer of jumbo-pencil eyeshadow and you&#x27;ll have to scrub it of before bedtime. It felt good on my skin and it didn&#x27;t bother my eye allergies. Also the delivery was speedy and the package arrived in perfect conditions. I&#x27;d definitively recommend it to anyone who loves makeup just as much as I do, it&#x27;s a must-have!!!</li>
    <li> This product came in prefect timing, and I was completely satisfied. I had read a few reviews previous and already knew that they were dime sized, but that is expected when you have a pallet of 96 eye shadows. The colors are beautiful, and with a little foundation or primer, they go on beautifully and wear all day!</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD, what I thinking buying this cheap quality pallette. It is not worth even a penny. Since the day I bought it, I regret it. At first I thought it was okay, but I only used it one time to see the colors and never touched it again. It still looks new as I bought it because I never touch thus stupid product. Don&#x27;t waste your money, you will be stuck with it like me. The maybelline nude pallette $7 I paid for mine is 100 times better than this.   If only I cab return this!   Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> very good colors yellow and pink are a little hard to make out unless applied multiple times but otherwise amazing!</li>
    <li> Just as beautiful as I expected, thank you for such a great purchase my niece was thrilled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of Fash, but my gf wanted it. I purchased this for her, and the shipping was very fast. She hasnt had any complaints about the product. She gets compliments on her eyeshadow all the time. This product is much smaller than it looks btw. Didnt expect too much though.</li>
    <li> Want to help someone pretty up.. Purchase the make-up palette. Great product. Shadows last long (all day). Great for gift giving.</li>
    <li> There are tons of different colors which I love. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because one of the colors was cracked when it was shipped to me. You also MUST use a primer or paint in order for the colors to pop.  It&#x27;s a great value!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item. I received it before the estimated time and it was in perfect condition. The eyeshadows are very pigmented. I would suggest using a primer before applying this product. This was way beyond my expectations. Great for beginners in wearing make up also.</li>
    <li> I love my new eyeshadow! The colors are beautiful, goes on great! I love how some are shimmer and some are matte! Other people have complained that the color pots are too small, but I think they are just right, if they were any bigger the compact would be way too big. And at this price, if I run out I can always get another one! I&#x27;m thinking of getting more colors, and maybe one for my daughter who is just turning old enough to start trying make-up!</li>
    <li> I LOVE  ALL THE EYESHADOW COLORS! THIS PALETTE IS AMAZING. IT HAS EVERY COLOR YOU NEED TO MATCH YOUR WARDROBE EVERYDAY! I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY1!:) MAIRA H.</li>
    <li> The colours are pretty bright and vibrant... long wearing too... even though each colour is small in size, it is still and excellent buy</li>
    <li> The palette has a good selection of colors.pigment is good,price is great.This is a great starter for anyone wanting to experiment..CON:very little of each color,but hey theres 96 diffrent ones!</li>
    <li> the colors work pretty good except the yellow, green, and pink. The light colors don&#x27;t show up very well. But overall it works okay..</li>
    <li> i love the product i got it was all that it looked to be i am so happy with it. i got it just in a few days it was a great price i am very happy</li>
    <li> I got this about 3 days ago and I love it....there are a ton of colors and they are so bright!! Love it and recommend it to anyone who wants to add bright and fun colors and wants to spice up their looks :)</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, best one i have had so far and great for the price...going to buy again....great colors with good texture does not clog or clamp together</li>
    <li> This palette is beautiful. The colors are rich and vibrant, and with the purchase of primer last long and show true on dark skin tones. The shipping was timely and unlike other palettes, the pots were not broken in any way during the shipping. All in all, a great buy.</li>
    <li> nice packaging beautiful shades but some of the colors were chipped from inside that was little disappointing. I would like to order more of your palette for gift but i am not sure because some of your color were chipped. But anyways i am still using the one i ordered and i liked all the colors.</li>
    <li> so i ordered this product only 2 days ago and received it today!!! When i opened the box it was packaged VERY well, NONE of the eyeshadow colors were broken or cracked! and i must say the picture is EXACTLY the way it really is! the palette is a nice size! it is NOT to small but perfect! the colors and the pigment are amazing!! i use a nyx primer before i apply and the color last ALL day so far!! SUPER product for an AMAZING price!! i will be purchasing more from this seller in the near future. anyone looking for an eyeshadow palette look no further this is definitely the palette to have!! 5 Stars all across the board!</li>
    <li> I am a beginner with make up so let me make this known now!!! I am a fair skinned Black woman so all of the colors should show pretty good on me. Some of the color show and some of them dont. You HAVE to use some sort of primer or concealer as a base to make your shadow pop. Also, I think this is a good shadow for something temporary. It will not last you all day..you will need to re apply it after a few hours. and if you accidently rub your eye then youve pretty much wiped off your shadow.   But as long as you use a primer and dont mind re applying it later during the day then I think this is a good BEGINNERS palette.</li>
    <li> Wow, I must say I love this palette.  I am a lady who loves to match her clothes with her eyeshadow and with all these pigments to choose from I am in heaven.  I have paired this beautiful eyeshadow palette with the 24 HR Eyeshadow Magic Eyeshadow Primer, and I must say these two coupled together will make everyone elses&#x27; eyeshadow look like garbage next to yours.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are just learning how to put on eyeshadow or have been doing it for years I would highly recommend this product. The only downside I would say is the brush it comes with, but as many people may know, in order to have nice makeup you must have different types of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good product and definitely worth the money. Especially now that I see the price has dropped extremely low.  Makes me want to buy 3 more sets!!!</li>
    <li> I love my eyeshadow. When I got it there were some colors that had slipped out of the holes and were out of place but I&#x27;m not that picky. I just put them back and good as new. Plus, that is just what shipping does, a little box mixed in with huge boxes at UPS I&#x27;m not complaining about that. All in all it was a great investment!. The colors are great and they last all day.</li>
    <li> Well I have a little bit of a story to go with this one.  I waited a very long time for my palette because usually when I order off amazon it ships through USPS so I always send it to my P.O. Box.  Well I ordered this with a few other items and selected my P.O. Box as usual. But this is shipped through UPS, so I had to wait awhile longer to receive this, but I understand this was my fault. I was overjoyed to receive it and immediately began swatching different colors. NONE of the mattes had ANY pigment for me, but the shimmers did. But since I feel there are more mattes than shimmers, this was a huge disappointment. Well I put it in my makeup collection anyways and figured that i&#x27;d find a use for it somehow.  The next day I tried using it again only I used it wet on a neon matte pink shade. I got alot of pigment to shine through and I was happy I found a way to make this beautiful array of colors work. However, after a few minutes, it dried to a clumpy mess on my eyelids, it looked cakey and just plain gross. I then considered that I should send it back.  Then my Sephora order arrived, with my very first tube of UDPP!!! I was so excited and I was playing around with it, I decided to swatch a few colors from this palette To see if they&#x27;d show up. Sure enough, they did, quite nicely too I might add. I now use this palette almost daily, I love the colors, it ranges from brights to neon and neutrals. However I cant forget how disappointed I was with this palette at first, and I feel that I need to take off a star for price. I paid $22 ($17+ S&amp;H) for this palette, I feel that&#x27;s pretty expensive considering more than half the palette didn&#x27;t work for me at first. But overall, if you own a good eyeshadow primer, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Cool colors however u have to apply a lot to get the same brightness effect, and the colors turns dull by the ending of the day</li>
    <li> The COLORS are AMAZING I realy get impressioned with This PALETTE</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow came very fast which I am happy about and the colors are pretty and well pigmented. I   love it and its great for for when I need it, but the shadow brush things are cheap. The sponge head fell off only after one use! But good product over all.</li>
    <li> Nice little set with wearable colors.  Some of the colors are bright and some are muted.  I bought this for a stocking stuffer and it will fit nicely in the stocking (larger size stocking).  Shipping was fast and the item was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Exactky what I was wanting</li>
    <li> Strong, bright pigment. Much nicer than expected especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Got this product months ago and i still haven&#x27;t used all of the colors but I love this. It came in good condition and works best if you use an eye primer before putting on the eyeshadow. I suggest you have an eyeshadow brush because the applicator they give does wear very easily. But all in all a great product. I love using the different colors!</li>
    <li> I received this order without a brush</li>
    <li> I Love this pallete. I have darker skin and colors are still very bright - I would be over enjoyed if they made the eyeshadow pans a little bigger. The eyeshadows are smaller than a dime just by a little.</li>
    <li> This has been a fun palette for me. I&#x27;ve used a lot of the colors and most of them are bold and work well with my skin. Some of the colors are not so good though. For instance, the yellow is hard to see and requires at least 2 if not 3 applications, but the hot pink works with just one. All-in-all I love this palette and use it several times a week. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s professional quality, but it is fun and works great for me!</li>
    <li> Im a brown toned woman and the colors that i have used, thus far, show up beautifully. I love this product and when i run out i will order more.</li>
    <li> VERY SATISFIED!! came on time, &amp; loved em all :) I havent recieved my leopard liquid eyeliner yet so I haven&#x27;t rated it..but I was notified on when I will receive it so im happy for that :)</li>
    <li> very happy! love the colors!</li>
    <li> T hese are moist-powder shadows, and there is a terrific range of highly saturated colors in both matte and sparkle mediums.I don&#x27;t mind that each choice is only dime-size because I like to wear only a tiny bit of shadow on the lid and then apply vibrant color in the same family at the lash line with a liner brush.    Here&#x27;s my nitpick: the case itself is of a shiny dark plastic and every little fingerprint shows up and it&#x27;s irritating to constantly have to polish it.</li>
    <li> The only pet peve I have is there is no black but other than that I&#x27;m 100% in love! Soooooo worth it since I can&#x27;t find anything like this in stores :)</li>
    <li> First of all, let me state, I am a guy. So I&#x27;m not that proficient or well versed in the world of makeup, I use a lot of it, but for eyes, I usually I stuck to eyeliner or my friend&#x27;s eyeshadow. This was the first eyeshadow I ever got on my own for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love it. There are a lot of colors in there of varying shades and intensities. I have tan/copper skin so I use some of the brighter colors for my eyes and they show up great. The brush in the picture is misleading kinda, there was no giant eyeshadow brush in mine, but there were two little brushes to either side of the mirror on the lid for my application needs, so that was appreciated. They fit inside, and work fine, so I actually think I prefer them rather than a giant brush I&#x27;d have to store separately because it was too big to fit inside the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the packaging could not have been better. Layers of protection and it looks so slick and cool. I still store it inside all of the packaging, which can be a drag to unpackage each time, but that&#x27;s just a little quirk of mine, I dont think I need all those layers of protection around it anymore. The actual case itself that houses the mirror, brushes, and colors is nice and sturdy enough (for my purposes anyways, I&#x27;m not clumsy so I don&#x27;t drop it or anything, so I dont know how well it would hold up to that, but its safe and secure at any rate)</li>
    <li> Not the best. It&#x27;s ok I guess</li>
    <li> This palette is wonderful! The colors are great and they show well. I am of dark brown complexion and I love how the colors show with my skintone. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of other cheap palettes, and they&#x27;re great. This one, not so much. You have to layer quite a bit to get good payoff, and after a few hours, there is fallout under your eyes. That doesn&#x27;t happen with any other shadows I own. I don&#x27;t like it. I would not recommend this product, and I&#x27;m glad I spent less than $10 on it.</li>
    <li> I did not like this palette at all. The eyeshadows were not pigmented at all, and no matter how much I packed on, there would be nothing on my eyelid. None of them showed up or worked. I thought it was a complete waste of my money, and I have thrown mine away because there&#x27;s no use for it.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors! Perfect for a bold fashionista like myself! I have used this countless times and I would absolutely order again!</li>
    <li> I thought that the eyeshadow palette would be a little bit bigger, honestly. The colors are very vibrant and this actually has a red eyeshadow color, which is very hard to find. I was pretty disappointed when the palette didn&#x27;t have white and black.</li>
