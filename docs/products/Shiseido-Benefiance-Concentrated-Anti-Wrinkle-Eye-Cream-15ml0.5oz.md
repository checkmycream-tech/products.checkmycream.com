      <li>good quality for than money.</li>
      <li>Good stuff though.  </li>
      <li>Feels great on the skin, has a lovely scent.</li>

      <li>It is also great for the fine lines at the corners of your eyes, not just below.  </li>

      <li>This sure saves me time being able to order it at AMAZON!  </li>
      <li>I was THRILLED to find it available on AMAZON!  </li>
      <li>all of their creams are light weight and really work great at holding the eyes up!  </li>
      <li>:)  under eye wrinkles have no chance against shiseido.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly; I&#x27;m pleased with purchase.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>However, there&#x27;s no way I can apply makeup on top of it since it leaves my skin feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that just paying a lot for cosmetics does not guarantee better results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a rather dated scent and smells more like something that my mom&#x27;s generation would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this product many years and like it better than any others I have tried.  </li>
      <li>The more I use the Benefiance products the more I have grown to dislike this scent.</li>
      <li>in my 40s, so I do have some wrinkles in my eye area, but not too many.</li>
      <li>I have tried many but this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the texture.</li>
      <li>I have told many about this product, and those who try it, love it.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my eyes feeling refreshed and wrinkle free!</li>
      <li>I love everything Shiseido from their creams to their makeup...</li>
      <li>I really wish Shiseido had not discontinued this exact formulation because it is absolutely wonderful.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>I love this, it is rich and creamy and you do not need lots and lots to get the results of reducing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>the fine wrinkles and</li>
      <li>happy to get last bottles.</li>
      <li>I had been using these particular Shiseido products for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>it looks like expired product for clean out, shiseido products should have vaild date on it.the date may has been erased ?</li>
      <li>Best cream in the whole wide world.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and sits on top of skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just tremendous, but I just can&#x27;t afford it anymore.</li>
      <li>My 78 year old under eyes look as good as they do now thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>Hers smelled fresh and sweet.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>This cream is a light creamy color and has the same strong perfume-y scent that all the products in the Benefiance line have.</li>
      <li>My wife was happy to get this cream for such a low price.</li>
      <li>As it turns out Benefiance Anti-Wrinkle Cream is more suitable for nighttime, or at least in my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love using the eye cream, I am an older women (looking younger) and there is not a wrinkle to be found.</li>
      <li>but this is the one that really works</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a moisturizing eye cream that minimized wrinkles, this really works.  </li>
      <li>I have searched for an eye cream that really works and this is it.</li>
      <li>I used this particular eye cream for years.</li>
      <li>In our high mountain climate the air is very dry and this product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I dislike the new eye cream Shiseido has chosen to replace it with.</li>
      <li>It does its job and kept my skin around my eyes soft.</li>
      <li>I guess this is for young people.  </li>

<li> It might work for some, clearly not for everyone.</li>
<li> Mine smelled dull and old.</li>

<li> The scent and the greasiness of it are not appealing and I&#x27;m not convinced that it has improved the overall appearance of the skin in my eye area in the month I have been using it.</li>
<li> Although it seems expensive you only need to use a few small dabs on each eye so it actually lasts a long time.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t want anything too heavy or greasy for daytime use, but for nighttime, I do look for something a bit heavier.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s still a bit heavy for my liking, but it does seem to lock in moisture and leave my eye area looking refreshed and  moisturized in the morning.</li>
<li> I gave this to a past girlfriend.</li>
<li> I get some of the cream on my fingertips, it has a lightweight feel to it - not too thick or heavy.</li>
<li> This cream is very heavy &amp; greasy... Cannot wear under makeup, it will make it run...</li>
<li> I have to seriously question the quality of the product.</li>
<li> Plus, the results are dramatic and noticeable.</li>
<li> But, alas, even on Amazon, it is just getting too expensive.  </li>
<li> It is not that expensive either.</li>

    <li> I have to seriously question the quality of the product. I bought the item from the seller and my friend bought the item from Macy&#x27;s. They smell and feel different. Hers smelled fresh and sweet. Mine smelled dull and old. Mine ended up in the garbage can within a day.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have tried many but this is my favorite. I am a cosmetologist and this works for me and my clients.</li>
    <li> it looks like expired product for clean out, shiseido products should have vaild date on it.the date may has been erased ?</li>
    <li> Best cream in the whole wide world.  discontinued. happy to get last bottles.</li>

    <li> Fab for wrinkles keeps them at bay</li>
    <li> For me it did nothing. After several months of use, did not see any difference. It might work for some, clearly not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Shiseido Benefiance Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream is a great product.  It actually brings your eyes back to life!!!  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a moisturizing eye cream that minimized wrinkles, this really works.  In our high mountain climate the air is very dry and this product is fantastic.  Have used it for 6 years and have not found anything that surpasses it.</li>
    <li> I love using the eye cream, I am an older women (looking younger) and there is not a wrinkle to be found.</li>
    <li> This cream is a light creamy color and has the same strong perfume-y scent that all the products in the Benefiance line have. The more I use the Benefiance products the more I have grown to dislike this scent.

Nonetheless, I still rely on a good eye cream to make it through the day. I don&#x27;t want anything too heavy or greasy for daytime use, but for nighttime, I do look for something a bit heavier. As it turns out Benefiance Anti-Wrinkle Cream is more suitable for nighttime, or at least in my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get some of the cream on my fingertips, it has a lightweight feel to it - not too thick or heavy. But when I tap in my eye area, that all changes. The cream starts to feel a bit sticky and actually looks a bit greasy. It doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and sits on top of skin. Perhaps the goal of Shiseido is to give skin a dewy appearance, hence detracting from the wrinkles. However, there&#x27;s no way I can apply makeup on top of it since it leaves my skin feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using up this jarBenefiance Anti-Wrinkle Cream at night (I got a jar as a part of a gift pack.) It&#x27;s still a bit heavy for my liking, but it does seem to lock in moisture and leave my eye area looking refreshed and  moisturized in the morning. But would I buy it on my own? No, not at all. The scent and the greasiness of it are not appealing and I&#x27;m not convinced that it has improved the overall appearance of the skin in my eye area in the month I have been using it.</li>
    <li> This is one fo the best eye creams i have ever used.  (I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them) I was THRILLED to find it available on AMAZON!  This sure saves me time being able to order it at AMAZON!  Thank You Amazon! Shiseido is an EXCELLENT skin care line.</li>
    <li> No opinion. I gave this to a past girlfriend.</li>
    <li> She told me to put 5-stars, no questions asked. Although it seems expensive you only need to use a few small dabs on each eye so it actually lasts a long time. Plus, the results are dramatic and noticeable. Excellent Shiseido product.</li>
    <li> This cream is very heavy &amp; greasy... Cannot wear under makeup, it will make it run... Do not recommend this eye cream... Has mineral oil in it &amp; no retinom</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon after the stores stopped carrying Benefiance products.  I had been using these particular Shiseido products for many, many years.  But, alas, even on Amazon, it is just getting too expensive.  Good stuff though.  My 78 year old under eyes look as good as they do now thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I have searched for an eye cream that really works and this is it. This definitely minimizes&lt;br /&gt; the fine wrinkles and I love the texture.</li>
    <li> I love this, it is rich and creamy and you do not need lots and lots to get the results of reducing fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love everything Shiseido from their creams to their makeup...it&#x27;s great buying through amazon rather than the department store...all of their creams are light weight and really work great at holding the eyes up!  :)  under eye wrinkles have no chance against shiseido.</li>
    <li> I used this particular eye cream for years. It does its job and kept my skin around my eyes soft. I dislike the new eye cream Shiseido has chosen to replace it with. That one burns, and hurts! My pot arrived sealed with everything inside it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using for a long period, and seems like it is not helping. Give it time. It is not that expensive either.</li>
    <li> great quality and wonderful product.</li>
    <li> good quality for than money. it&#x27;s worth it. My wife was happy to get this cream for such a low price.</li>
    <li> I am 40, and this eye cream did nothing on my skin.  I guess this is for young people.  This is NOT certainly anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
    <li> Always have, best eye cream for me! I have tried a lot of others out there but this is the one that really works</li>
    <li> Shiseido Benefiance Eye Cream is a wonderful product that I have &#x27;sworn by&#x27; for years!  It is also great for the fine lines at the corners of your eyes, not just below.  I am close to fifty in age, but my eyes do NOT look it!! I have told many about this product, and those who try it, love it.  It is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product many years and like it better than any others I have tried.  The product absorbs into the&lt;br /&gt;skin and appears to fill in the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I really wish Shiseido had not discontinued this exact formulation because it is absolutely wonderful. Arrived very quickly; I&#x27;m pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin, has a lovely scent. Keeps my eyes feeling refreshed and wrinkle free! Cute packaging too!</li>
