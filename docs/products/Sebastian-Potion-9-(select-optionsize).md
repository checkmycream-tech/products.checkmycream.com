<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best product i ever used for frizz</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now.  Recently I ran out and couldn&#x27;t get it.  Found it on-line and my hair is happy now.  It keeps my hair moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I have used this for around 10 years. I have very thick short hair and it helps to keep it under control, yet it is flexable. I like to be active--so if I want to fix my hair after a bike race (wearing a helmet) I just wet it and restyle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve delt with fine, straight hair all my life.  I&#x27;ve used Potion 9 for just about 20 years.  Put Potin 9  on the roots while hair is wet &amp; blow dry, put on wet &amp; leave in for wet look, or put on after styling.  Just amazing.  Lifts hair &amp; adds body to my stick straight hair!  I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without my magical Potion 9 in my hair. My daughter has fine, long, but curly hair.  Potion 9 actually controls the long &amp; wild curls.   The best product ever for her hair too.  Trust us!  After using Potion 9, you will never! have to try another hair controller/amplifier product again. I have never been more serious about a product as I am about Potin 9, and proud to write about it.  P.S.  The price is worth every cent!!  Terry in Germantown</li>
    <li> this treatment makes my hear look and feel super soft and I absolutely love the smell!! Thumps up for the delivery and packaging...</li>
    <li> one word: wow! this product is amazing! the shipping was really fast and the product is amazing itself! it makes my hair so soft and conditioned and it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all! i am very impressed. you really don&#x27;t need that much product so this 16.9 fl bottle will last me for a really long time! it is worth the money! i am very happy with my purchase and i recommend this to everyone out there:)!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great for hair, wet or dry, styled or natural,makes it look healthy and manageable, decreases frizz on fine hair without weight. Had trouble finding it at retail outlets.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair treatment. Has been for years.  Lets me comb my hair any way I want without serious repercussions. Very Good Stuff.</li>
    <li> This product has saved my hair and given it extra moisture. I have wavy, frizzy hair and I was constantly using mouse and hair spray to make it extra curly or wear it naturally. Now I now longer have to use those products that dried out my hair. I usually wet my hair in the morning, use two pumps of Potion #9, and let it hair dry or blow dry it. It looks great all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Potion 9 fan. Great price! However, the bottle started leaking a few months after I bought it, so I put some of it in a tupperware container, and the rest I sealed off. I think the container started leaking for some weird reason. Oh well, love this stuff. Awesome for your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will not leave your hair stiff or sticky. Too bad they have discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, curly hair, and I have tried more products than I care to count to keep away frizz and tame my hair. This product is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I don&#x27;t see myself searching any further. It works great and smells great too! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. My wife loves this conditioner and you can only get in online now.  She recommends it highly.</li>
    <li> Very good as usual.  A reliable product I have used for years.  Not greasy. Great dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I love the 16.9 oz container.</li>
    <li> I have been going to cosmo school for about 10 monnths now. We sell Sebastian products at my school. I LOVE potion 9. We use it on ALOT if not all ethnic hair clients. I have fine (white) Hair. Just a little goes ALONG way. Its a great for thermal heat. (curls,flat iron, anything that requires heat) Its also FANTASTIC for chemically damnaged hair. It made my hair so so so so soft LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF. I use this on almost every client when we have it on back bar. All of our clients ask for it by name and we are always running so short bc of how great it is. I can&#x27;t stress enough on what people are missing out if they havent used this yet. I love it to DEATH. the price on Amazon is AWESOME. beats spending 30 MORE dollars at a salon.</li>
    <li> Potion No. 9 by Sebastian is my favorite product for changing my frizz into waves and curls. Put it in your hair and let it dry naturally--easy and great result.</li>
    <li> The one that I received it wasn&#x27;t the one that I bought, I was expecting the American product, but this was Made in Mexico.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is the true Potion Number 9...seems different than it used to be.  Maybe a different formula?</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair! Not heavy, very natural, do not add wet look, smells ok. Worth its price for sure</li>
    <li> I ordered this product through amazon! I was very satisfied with the service, the packaging, and the shipping was really fast. This product is great and it has been for years. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the result, it manages my hair for all types of weather condition.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - I have been using it for years.  Keeps my hair soft yet in place&lt;br /&gt;Try it you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> This is still my favorite leave in...You can use it for so many things.  This is a great value and product</li>
    <li> Been using for 30 years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products and keep going back to Potion 9. It gives my naturally fine and wavy hair great body and styling ability. It doesn&#x27;t gunk up or make my hair feel like plastic. Once it&#x27;s dry, I just run a brush through it and it looks great - smells great too. I won&#x27;t use any thing else anymore.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product!  Even over high end brands at twice the price.  I have used it for over 30 years.  But just switched to the wearable styling a year ago.  Conditions better than Purology.  I have curly hair so I like the wearable styling feature.  When I straightened my hair, colored it and/or permed it, it was the only product out of the dozens I tried that kept my hair from feeling like straw.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best hair product I have ever purchased. I&#x27;ve tried hot oils,serums, leave in hair conditioners,countless other products. Granted, I don&#x27;t often try very expensive salon products ,but all the good reviews of this on Amazon convinced me to take the plunge. I have dry, frizzy,wavy hair from years of dyeing and now even more fanatical dyeing due to my graying hair. I was considering chopping it all off and giving up as my hair either looked dry and overstyled (after blowdrying) or limp and lack luster (after air drying it). This product within one use convinced me this is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair! I feel like Ive turned back the clock 10 years (I&#x27;m 40) My hair, after one use, is soft and manageable and shiny. I have only used it, so far, after letting it air dry. But I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s going to yield a great result after blow drying also. I will be so upset if this is ever discontinued. I will buy this again. I think someone else mentioned it being their Holy Grail of hair products. It&#x27;s certainly mine, already!</li>
    <li> Nice wearable treatment...........expensive, but worth it.............</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my thin, fine hair.  It gives it more body.  My friend had thick curly hair, and it tamed her hair beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering it this way is a great value compared to the price at beauticians.</li>
    <li> Great product for your damaged hair or just to keep it from being damaged.  Love it.  5 stars with a lower price.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for. it takes only a small amount (about dime size) and it&#x27;s not greasy. thx</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Potion 9 for over 15 years now. It&#x27;s one of my absolute favorite hair treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Finding a good deal on a larger bottle than what I normally purchase, was pure bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, product is as expected. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> this product is the best for controlling curly hair and taking a bit of volume off. and i&#x27;ve tried a lot of  leave-ins!</li>
    <li> I am a Hairdresser,and have bought every product available.  This is the very best for dry hair! No matter what I purchace to make my dry hair look good,I always go bach to Potion 9!</li>
    <li> Really works on my fine hair.  Detangles after shampooing and ads some body.  I can&#x27;t go without it! I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on some heavy duty drugs right now that are very drying to the hair.  I started using a little after every shampoo and it has helped the day to day appearance of my hair.  I will rebuy when ready.</li>
    <li> The ONLY product I will use on my hair.  Have used it for over 10 years now.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Potion 9 for more than 15 years &amp; love it. I use it on my curly hair, wet or dry or when I dry my thick curly hair straight.</li>
    <li> It makes my curly hair hold a shape without being too crunchy.  I use other products that my hairdresser recommends and alway go back to Potion 9.</li>
