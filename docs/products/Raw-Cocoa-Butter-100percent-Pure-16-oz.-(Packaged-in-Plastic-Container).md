      <li>The cocoa is in chunks(1-2 inch) which I am sure</li>
      <li>Pour into chocolate mold or mini baking cups, cool off in the fridge and the result is very worthwhile chocolate substitute.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Wow i&#x27;ve been using cocoa butter for year and this cocoa butter is the best by far.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Cocoa Butter arrived in a USPS envelope.  Inside was the Cocoa Butter chunks in a plain plastic package.  There were no labels or information about the contents whatsoever.  Nothing to indicate the ingredients, the processing, the manufacturer, country of origin, the labels to confirm USDA Organic, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda fishy and probably illegal since such items for consumers have to be clearly labeled in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself smelled OK and seemed fine.</li>
    <li> I love this cocoa butter. It came in big chunks in a plastic bag. When you open the bag you  can just smell the freshness. Thanks</li>
    <li> Wow i&#x27;ve been using cocoa butter for year and this cocoa butter is the best by far. Wow i love this stuff. Cant wait to order more.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> When I got the package, I could smell the cacao from OUTSIDE of the package... I knew immediately this is the real deal. Comes in a bag of big chunks of cocoa butter. Smooth, buttery and smells awesome. I use this in my hair/skin shea butter mixtures and this helps make my mixes smell good. I will purchase from this seller again. This stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> The package arrived the same week that it was ordered and the product is raw as was advertised.  I have not been able to find raw cocoa butter anywhere in my area.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Raw, pure, unprocessed Shea Butter from Ghana is a similar product to Raw, unprocessed Cocoa Butter (check where it comes from).  DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS FROM RETAIL STORES.  These commercial products are worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw Cocoa Butter is rubbed directly on the skin (after a bath or shower - or anytime).  It is soft and immediately begins to glide over the skin leaving a thin film that is almost immediately fully absorbed into the skin.  There is NO sticky &#x27;film&#x27; or oily residue.  It also smells wonderful as does Raw Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of using these products my skin is what my dermetologist calls &#x27;great&#x27;, certainly better than most of my sunloving male counterparts of my age who grew up in the 60&#x27;s in Southern California and Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Purchased to make my own natural skin moisturizer. When it arrived, the packaging (very thin, cheap plastic. Reminded me of a to go food container from a grocery store deli) had cracked and half of the product was all over the packaging box. But I was able to salvage most of it. Besides the packaging, the product itself is great!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Raw Cocoa Butter as an ingredient for a homemade soap. It arrived quickly and the quality of the Cocoa Butter was great. Smelled great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap was a hit, this affordable Cocoa Butter made a good addition!</li>
    <li> I use cocoa butter after I wax my arms, and sometimes after I have my eyebrows threaded. It keeps the skin soft and the helps it heal faster especially after waxing. I also use it to try and soften my developing stretch marks since I am currently losing weight with lots of yoga. Highly recommended. The only thing about this I didn&#x27;t like was how it was packaged. It was placed in a plastic bag that tore. It really could have been packaged better.</li>
    <li> Great all natural product for skin conditions of all kinds would suggest everyone to try and see how much your skin will love it!! Buy on Amazon!</li>
    <li> melted beautfully but hard to get an exact measurement since it is in chunks so had to estimate. but my lip balm turned out wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of pieces.  Nice packaging and easy storage.  Easy to measure and melt.  The smell is most pleasant and will purchase this item again.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the first time for me to buy this product and its great for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps your feet feel better. A good buy.</li>
    <li> While the scent is not offensive to most, it is not exactly pleasant. I used this to make hard lotion bars.  Go use Shea instead I think.  Even after adding essential oils, the cocoa butter smell was all that was left.  Maybe you could add some chocolate scent and it would be ok.  Product was good, though. The males of my family don&#x27;t mind it either.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this is if the scent is not a top priority.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with some oils and shea butter, created a body cream, and my body is super soft, feels great.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the advertised cocoa butter, but instead received a chunk of African black soap.  Black soap is useful but is now what I ordered.  The shipping was timely, but the product arrived without a packing slip, labeling or any information about the product at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is absolutely perfect for making chocolate candies out of chocolate with low fat content. I&#x27;d definitely buy some again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this for a chocolate massage oil recipe I found. Subtle chocolate scent, not too overpowering. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The photo of the product is misleading in that it shows cocoa butter in labeled tubs. My order was for two lbs. It arrived with each pound in a plastic grocery sack, one of which had split meaning there were loose chunks all over in the third grocery sack the other two had been put in. I would have been very unhappy if my product arrived on a day when it&#x27;s above 90 degrees as cocoa butter typically melts at body temperature. It does still get up to 100 degrees at this time of year where I live as then I would have melted lumps to try and peel off the grocery sacks. A quick online search and I found quart size freezer bags that cost less than 6 cents each and if your purchase is over $25, shipping is free. At least with a sliding lock freezer bag, melting wouldn&#x27;t cause problems as I could still get all the product out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered enough shea and cocoa butter from different vendors and my orders have always arrived in the packaging shown in the picture, clear plastic food tubs like what&#x27;s used by grocery store delis. So while the product itself is fantastic, packaging is lousy enough to rate a mediocre review. Raise the price by a dime, and you&#x27;re covered for slightly better packaging while keeping packaging costs down.</li>
    <li> Package arrived cracked vertically with contents spilled out in the bubble pak envelope. Dog seems to love it though. Bought it for chocolate making so I tossed it. Should have saved it for skin stuff...</li>
    <li> The smell will make your mouth drool! After melting the butter down I was able to mix in other oils and butters. Then i used a hand mixer to make it fluffy. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel silky</li>
    <li> Received product around the holidays.  The only problem was the container was broken but the butter was all there. Will be making soap soon.</li>
    <li> Love the packaging and the smell!. I  grab a chunk to rub wherever needed on my body, I have VERY dry skin and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like that the cocoa butter came in small chunks that I could use to rub over my skin. This product itself is great and it is exactly what I expected. It was neatly packaged and it came faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I&#x27;m a little wary that there is no labels of any kind. So, you can&#x27;t be sure where this has come from. The packaging was also not very good.</li>
    <li> When I picked up the box, I heard what sounded like rocks rolling around inside and there was a strong smell of cocoa.  When I opened the box, I discovered the plastic container of cocoa butter had been put into a slightly too-big box without any packing materials. As a result, the top came off, the container was dented, and the cocoa butter was rolling around loose and breaking apart in the box. It&#x27;s not a crisis but it is annoying.</li>
    <li> I literally just got this is the mail and I was so excited to use it so I had to try it right away. It came in a double-layered plastic bag in 3-4 large chunks. Before I even opened the package fully, I got a whiff of the chocolaty scent! It&#x27;s about 95 degrees F outside today, so it was softened nicely, and it melted into my skin right away and left it very soft and smelling nice. The smell isn&#x27;t sickeningly sweet, but it has a very strong cocoa/chocolate smell. I suggest storing it in a tupperware container or a large jar. You can go ahead and melt it down if you prefer, but I liked rubbing a chunk of it directly onto my skin. It&#x27;s been 10 minutes since I got this product and I already love it!</li>
    <li> I used this to make body lotion bars.  This Cocoa Butter is absolutely perfect.  Great moisturizing abilities with a delicious smell.  The only con may be the fact that it is so evidently Chocolate in smell, even with Essential Oils, there is still that undertone, I personally do not think this is a problem.  Do not hesitate to buy this product.  Shipping and packing were also excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who takes the raw cocoa and makes his own lotion adding olive oil to it, heating it on the stove. As it mixed well it gets hard but soft since it&#x27;s mixed with the liquid. It works well on his skin since he has eczema and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying of the lotions at the store.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what i can tell you about this cocoa butter, except that i used it to make a moisturizer</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter says it&#x27;s in a plastic container and it is but my container was broken into a million pieces by the time it arrived to me. I ended up having to use an old Tupperware container  to hold it. The cocoa butter itself smells delicious! It also melts to perfection...I used mine to make body butter and I love it. I would suggest buying cocoa butter from this seller just keep in mind the packaging is horrible.</li>
    <li> I just received mine. Smells great.  It came in a plastic container which is good. My Shea butter came in a baggie that was ripped. I would be careful ordering this during the summer months. But in the cold weather go for it. Very moisturizing. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Agree with some reviewers in minor things such as the product comes in without storage instructions or recommended use. However, the moment you open the box you&#x27;ll love it. The aroma is fantastic.  I licked and tasted a bit (too greasy) and must admit that the pleasure is through the nose and skin. Maybe if you add sugar and lecithin you could make your own 100% chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: you need to melted. I use the stove a very low heat. It takes couple of minutes and last liquid to semi-liquid for about 30 minutes (not bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: skin feels amazing. you get the aroma on your skin and in the room where you melt the product. Yes, it is that aromatically good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those impatient folks who have no time to melt in the kitchen, grab a glove (do not burn yourself!), transport of bathroom, wait to cool down to a point that will feel great to you skin, etc I would recommend palmers brand name oil. You get the aroma, moisturizing, vitamin E and some other ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my cocoa butter purchase.  It was exactly as stated, was shipped as promised.  Works out very well in the soaps I make.</li>
    <li> melts in your hand coco butter do i need to say more!  Used it in my lip balm and everyone loved the feel.</li>
    <li> I wrote the company to ask if this is safe for eating?  I am looking for the natural and raw edible oil / cacao butter to melt easily and blend into any type of recipe. They answered \\&quot;Yes our cocoa butter is all natural food grade.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I made hard lotion with this product which seemed clean and pure, organic beeswax, and coconut oil.  Equal parts melted, poured into containers.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I am working on getting rid of some of the commerical products in my home that we use for our bodies. I was a little nervous about purchasing raw cocoa butter but have found that this is a wonderful product and feels and smells wonderful on the skin. Love it. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> ...and in my opinion, this is best. Undiluted and with that distinctive scent. Just the right consistency to suggest its authenticity. It meets my expectations and I am enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will (very probably) reorder from this merchant when the time comes. But this time I will know to expect less with packaging. The package was soiled and the plastic container was cracked. I did not suspect contamination and immediately transferred the product to my own container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I loved the smell walking in from the mailbox. Hope all the package handlers along the way did too. It&#x27;s very lovely.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my psoriasis; it&#x27;s just on my hands, but it cracks and bleeds and is just all out miserable, but I don&#x27;t want pharmaceutical help. It didn&#x27;t cure it (I didn&#x27;t expect it to) but it keeps my hands more moisturized than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a clear plastic container with the cocoa butter in large chunks; I put them in a glass mason jar with equal parts coconut oil and place it in a pot of boiling water to melt them together. After they melt, I add bergmot oil (and 20 drops for 16 ounces mixed). It takes about a day or two for the oil/butter mix to harden again, but once it does, it&#x27;s very soft and melts again quickly from body temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butter shipped quickly and without problem and smells very sweet and fresh even after being opened for a while. I made my first and second batches of hand cream a month apart (though it wasn&#x27;t out yet; I just wanted to already haver one made). A little lasts a long while.</li>
    <li> Love the Raw cocoa butter for adding to soap recipes. It gives the soap a hardness needed for long lasting bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more.in the future.  Excellent packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Good value</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as described.  I dont have much to compare it to since this was my first cocoa butter purchase but I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> i like it,just started using it about 2 weeks now and i&#x27;m noticing a diffrence.&lt;br /&gt;(my skin is my skin your skin is your skin)all skin is diffrent.</li>
    <li> This coco butter came very fast this seller ships very fast, and the product was very fresh, you can smell the pure coco butter, wish was great keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter now comes packaged in a container, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what those other reviews are saying about coming in a bag. The container is very sturdy. I LOVE this cocoa butter, it smells great. You can just rub a piece wherever you need to and it melts with body temperature. I plan on making my shea butter and cocoa butter mix with this. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and figured I should get the initial review out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;It came wrapped in two priority mail shipping bags and a thin plastic container with the product name on a label on the lid. I had trouble opening the package but I guess that is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic one was easy enough and I was soon able to smell the chocolate. The cocoa is in chunks(1-2 inch) which I am sure will be making my life much easier soon. I gave it a five because I have no qualms with the product. I will be sure to update on how it works for what I bought it for- making body lotion.</li>
    <li> I have ordered from this vendor, this product two other times with great success.  The product is great! Fresh, large cocoa pieces with great cocoa aroma.  Product melts and blends well for lotion bars.  This time the container holding the product was shipped in large bubble wrapped envelope.  The ridged plastic tub had been broken in transit.  The cocoa butter was contained in the inner envelope…but I had to transfer it all into zip lock bag.  Otherwise it would have had 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. I bought it to use as a moisturizer. I put it all over my face and body to go to sleep and it moisturizes so well. It also lightens dark spots. But this smells soooo great that I&#x27;m looking into how to make chocolate truffles at home with it. Will make an update after I&#x27;ve done it. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like making my own chocolate as most commercial brands, even though delicious, are still sweetened with white sugar which acts like a poison to my system.&lt;br /&gt;I make the chocolate using melted unsweetened chocolate bark, coconut oil, coconut butter, stevia as a sweetener and add some cacao nibs, natural vanilla flavoring, and chopped roasted almonds.  Pour into chocolate mold or mini baking cups, cool off in the fridge and the result is very worthwhile chocolate substitute.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to see if the cocoa butter would improve the texture and taste of the chocolate, and logically you would think it would.  However, both time when I added cocoa butter to the mixture, the end result tasted lot more dry and mealy than used without the butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also make my own skin moisturizer, using cocoa butter and shea butter (both rock solid), and melting them with argan, coconut, avocado and/or apricot oil and hint of organic lavender oil.  For best results the melted mixture needs to be cooled off in the fridge, otherwise it develops grainy consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed with liquid oils, the shea and cocoa butter develop smooth, very pleasant, easy to apply consistency and are excellent for both as skin and hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I would not necessarily recommend this for eating, but def. for making your own skin care cosmetic line!</li>
    <li> I used this to make my own body butter by mixing it with essential oils in my Ninja. It smells great and feels great.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Once you rub in the coco smell doesnt last long. I mix it with shea butter. My skin LOVES it!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a happy customer, and I will be ordering again very soon. I purchased this product and some other items because I make and sell body butter, and cocoa butter is one of the ingredients I use. I use it myself as well. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and it is long lasting.  I LOVE the smell as well. I came packaged in a tightly sealed plastic container (not a problem for me), and it was also delivered to me in a timely manner. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Packaged in a plastic tub, good quality product.  I made sugar free hot white chocolate with it, and the whole family loved it.</li>
    <li> instead of cocoa butter, i received a stale smelling african black soap.  major disappointment.  not sure if i wanna go through the trouble of a return.  Maybe i will just throw it away since the smell of it turns me stomach.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out a recipe for homemade whipped body butter. It&#x27;s fabulous. Has a strong cocoa smell, so makes you want a bit of chocolate (or at least it made me want a bit of chocolate).</li>
    <li> Love the smell and use of this product. I make my own body butter and this gives it the smell and touch everyone loves.&lt;br /&gt;Will get more</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves skin soft and shiny. I am mixing it with Almond oil to make it a lotion like and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it!</li>
    <li> This was exactly as I expected.  Packaging was fine, a large plastic container. The butter smells great and melted really well when I made my first ever batch of homemade lotion.</li>
    <li> The cocoa butter has a creamy white color. It melts nicely in my hand and smells delicious. It was packaged in a tall plastic container as they promised. It arrived in good condition (meaning it wasn&#x27;t melted when I received it), but that was probably because I ordered it during the winter. The cold must have kept it from melting. It&#x27;s been a month since I&#x27;ve ordered it, and it hasn&#x27;t discolored. I keep some in a smaller plastic tub and place it in front of the heater to melt when I want to use it ( I don&#x27;t like to microwave it, because I&#x27;m afraid most of the natural nutrients in the butter would be destroyed by the concentrated heat). I leave the rest in the tall plastic container in the fridge so that it maintains its freshness.</li>
    <li> This product is so pure and easy to use. I just pick up a chunk and rub it every where lips, feet, face. everywhere. This is the real thing.</li>
    <li> The cocoa butter melted well and smelled wonderful in my body butter. Good amount for the price. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this to make soap. Smells good. Shipment received on time. Didn&#x27;t verify weight but seems to be as described.</li>
    <li> This works great for recipes and even for other Cocoa butter uses.  Food grade.  Completely edible.  Comes packaged nicely in a resealable plastic container.  No moisture at all - shelf life is easily 3 years.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> the cocoa butter was shipped in a plastic container. the plastic container was broken. maybe it should be shipped in a box rather than an envelope. the product itself is great!</li>
