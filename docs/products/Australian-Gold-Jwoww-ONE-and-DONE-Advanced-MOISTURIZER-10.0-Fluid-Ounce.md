    <li> It is a very light moisturizer &amp; would not help very dry skin, the scent is great!</li>
    <li> Item arrived right on schedule. I absolutely love this product. would definitely share and recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It is wonderful for someone who has very dry skin like I do.  I think I will use it whether for tanning or not.  It is a very good product.  I also love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I am so picky with scents bc most give me headaches. This one is feminine and attractive and I get lots of compliments on it! I have dry skin so I welcome the thickness. Bought min for $36 at a salon so I&#x27;m stocking up on the deal here !</li>
    <li> it was okay but I wont order it again</li>
    <li> I have a problem with the after smell spray tan.  It does NOT work with my body chemistry at all!  This I believe helped temporarily.  But, once I got home the smell was still there.  After 2 showers it was better.. however I&#x27;m sure it took the complete spray tan off.  So, it did not work on me BUT I know it works on other people.  If you have a prob with smell after spray tan.. more then likely this won&#x27;t take care of it.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer...it smells amazing! I love ALL jwoww products. Everything she makes is amazing! You can&#x27;t beat the price either! It&#x27;s a pretty large tube too.</li>
    <li> Souch cheaper than in the salons! Love love love this lotion! The smell is absolutely fantastic and thick too! A++++</li>
    <li> Smells perfect for summer and it&#x27;s one of the few lotions I can actually tell a difference as far as firming and toning goes.  I&#x27;m buying my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Your skin feels so soft and smooth after and very toned,and last all day.I&#x27;m covered in tattoos and it really helps pop life back into older ones. Only down fall is the smell its not bad but if ur not a fan of coconut it gets old fast.Either way the results are worth it. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Love this tan extender! Smells amazing and is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this product. There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with it. It is moisturizing, but it&#x27;s a bit thicker than I would like, so it takes a while to work into your skin. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have any bronzer in this product, so be aware of that. I&#x27;ve been tanning for a few months and I realize now that I really do need a bronzer in the product I&#x27;m using. The smell is strong, but not bad. Kind of tropical smelling. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a man, it&#x27;s a feminine smell and it kind of stays with you.</li>

    <li> This is great makes me fell good about my skin smells good. not drying feels silkier soft on your skin</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Going to buy more! Great price!</li>
    <li> This lotion is really thick and a bit hard to spread. It smells a bit like suntan lotion in the tube but not fond of the scent when its on. I like it enough to finish using it but don&#x27;t love it enough to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Works well but is thicker than I like,doesnt spread as well as others Ive tried. It does have a nice smell also.</li>
