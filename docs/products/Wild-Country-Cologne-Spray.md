<li> Will continue to purchase this and other Wild Country products.</li>
<li> I did not enjoyed this fragrance, and maybe the stuff that I received was just a defective batch and hence was such a low price.</li>
<li> The actual fragrance scent smells like weak old spice mixed with licorice - not a good combo.</li>
<li> purchased this fragrance, because back in the late 70&#x27;s my cousin wore it.</li>
<li> My husband uses only this cologne for the past 20 years!  </li>
<li> Had high hopes for this one but was VERY disappointed and can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
<li> The scent wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>

    <li> I have been using this cologne for 20yrs or more</li>
    <li> when Avon stopped carrying it at one point, so I ordered it from here. The scent wasn&#x27;t that bad and it didn&#x27;t irritate my nose (I have allergies). Would reccomend as a gift if looking into Avon cologne.</li>
    <li> OK I know I&#x27;m not a man, but I hate the smell of womens perfume, and love the smell of mens cologne and the ruggedness of it and this stuff is perfect!</li>
    <li> Very good cologne. I had a bottle of the after shave in my medicine cabinet that my nephew found after he started to shave and he loved it. So I ordered him a bottle of the cologne for Christmas and he wears it every day. Not a bad price either. I got him another bottle for his birthday and he couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Husband wanted this as a change from his present cologne</li>
    <li> really like it arrived safe and sound. no problems, packaging done excellent, will recommend to  others, I buy a lot</li>
    <li> I have been using Wild Country products for several years.  I really like it  Been around for several years now.</li>
    <li> Boy, does this bring back memories!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this fragrance, because back in the late 70&#x27;s my cousin wore it. That was 35 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is appealing, somewhat sexy, but a little cloying. Overall a very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> purchased for my husband as this is one of his favorite scents .... he actually asked me to order it for him</li>
    <li> would recommend to anyone very good and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I like this product but to me it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I remember Wild Country cologne smelling years ago. The Wild Country body talc does smell as good as I remember it smelling, which I also ordered.</li>
