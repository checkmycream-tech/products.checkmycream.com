    <li> For me, it just wasn&#x27;t purple enough. I bought this and the burgundy, and they both were very similar in color.</li>

    <li> That was not what the colour looked like at all. It was more of a reddish purple. I put it on my lips, but I was disappointed with the colour.</li>

    <li> Great colour and application. However, the pencil is rather short.</li>
    <li> I love how easy this lip liber goes on! It doesn&#x27;t tug at your mouth while lining. The color was darker than I expected but I have figured out ways to adapt it.</li>
