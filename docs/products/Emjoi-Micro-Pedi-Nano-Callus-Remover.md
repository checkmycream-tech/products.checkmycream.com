<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love it, it really works great!</li>
    <li> My wife likes this little gadget.  since it is battery powered it is not as good as the plug in model, but it does work.  We have no idea on battery life yet and I&#x27;ll edit that in once we know....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  This winter his heels really started to get thick, tough, dry, cracked skin.  This tool has made a huge difference on his feet. They are softer and smoother with every use.  He said you need to be careful not to use it too long each time, because he went a little too long once and his foot bled a little.  He uses it every other day and that seems fine.  The blue extra-coarse rollers seem to hold up well.</li>
    <li> Did an unbelievably great job!</li>
    <li> Love this!!!  For battery operated machine, it is not excessively noisy.  Order replacement rolls when you order.  I like to change the rolls often.</li>
    <li> does not work as stated</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  I&#x27;m on my feet all day at work and developed lots of dry skin and calluses over the winter. Was heading to Florida and wanted to wear sandals. This purchase enabled me to wear all my sandals without embarrassment  over my feet.</li>
    <li> Works even better than I thought it could! I am getting ready to order replacement rollers, but did get a few good uses out of the blue one included.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule. This is a replacement of the original, which died after a few years and which I loved. This new version is even better. It works so well!</li>
    <li> It actually performs as it says. Very easy way to remove rough dry skin.</li>
    <li> THIS little guy is amazing! !! Worked better than I expected.  I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but now I&#x27;m a believer!  I&#x27;ve had dry, rough feet for years, and I&#x27;ve tried everything except a professional pedicure (I don&#x27;t like the idea of strangers touching my feet, and my husband certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to pay for a foot job).  Within minutes of using the micro-pedi, my feet were much smoother.  There is still some roughness in spots, but I was using an extra coarse roller.  I just purchased the super coarse to finish the job.  I suspect that if you continue to use it regularly, those rough spots will quickly be cleared up as well.  I would also recommend following the callus removing with Vaseline or foot cream to moisturize the skin revealed.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews &amp; I am a bit disappointed.  It does get bogged down if you put any pressure on it, the drum wears out pretty fast, I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times for a couple minutes &amp; I&#x27;m already going to have to order more sanding drums. It works, but not like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Hubby just loves it!  He has large bothersome calluses on his big toes from his work boots.  This has helped more than anything else he has tried.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife and she loves it. Used this two times and had better results than a paid manicure. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best belt sander on the market!  I always had difficulty reaching corners with my Black and Decker but Micro Pedi changed my life. No longer do I have to risk scratching delicate chrome trim when painting vintage cars or refinishing antique furniture. (and apparently some people waste this marvel of their feet?)</li>
    <li> Love this little dead skin remover I live in fl and always wearing sandals so feet tend to get dry..allmost ordered it some where else at a higher price....thanks to amazon I was able to try it....</li>
    <li> Although, the item I received was not the item I ordered based on the picture on your site, it still worked ok.</li>
    <li> This product is the best ever! Giving to my all my friends!</li>
    <li> This is a great little gadget. It fits nicely in my hand, the instructions are simple, and it works very well. I&#x27;m pretty much in bare feet as often as possible so that leads to calluses. This little item works quickly and painlessly does a great job. I would recommend this to anyone interested in callus removal.</li>
    <li> I Love it. Every women ought to have one.</li>
    <li> this machine is good for one day, its smoothing the skin, but not removing the cracks,like it shows on the picture, it is mean that it working only slightly on your dry skin, more deeply doesn&#x27;t remove. if you press harder it doesn&#x27;t rotate , so your choice.. Idea is great, but not enough power to remove skin on cracked parts. actually next day i have to smooth again, waste of money!</li>
    <li> It does just what I needed it to do. It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the negative reviews I was really hesitant about getting this, but hell, it works! It&#x27;s not going to make your feet baby soft the first time, you have to keep working at it every few days, and make sure to put lotion on your feet! But this was the first product I have ever used that has gotten rid of some of those hard to get rough spots!! Very happy with it, would definitely purchase again! The only thing that I think could be added to this product to make it better would be a way to keep all the shavings dust in a compartment instead of having them go all over your hand.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC product! I&#x27;ve tried the pedi Egg and all the other scrubs, scrapes, lotions and what not. This is the only one that really, truly works. .</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing...doesn&#x27;t tear your feet up like the ped egg.  Very gentle yet does a great job!</li>
    <li> Of course, you are goint to need new batteries.</li>
    <li> Really works! You won&#x27;t be sorry if you order one.</li>
    <li> works better than i expected, and i am using the Micro-Pedi that came with it and wow, so i can only imagine what happens with the course. This is a little monster and more than does its job. I am using batteries, there is not a cord at all, but it works so good I am using it once a week batteries will last. 2 more uses and it has already paid for itself lol THANKS EMOJI YOU ROCK</li>
    <li> This works exactly as stated, does not hurt, and you can see the dead skin fall away as dust, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin raw. Whe I first purchased it, I used every other day, but now I only need it a couple times per month. When flip flop season gets here I expect to use a bit more often.</li>
    <li> My heels are cracked &amp; awful. I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun, I even had a pedi every week to smooth them out. When I saw this I almost didn&#x27;t buy it, but I figured why not. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all &amp; is easy to clean. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for a week &amp; the roller hasn&#x27;t worn down yet. A light touch to the skin is all that&#x27;s required.</li>
    <li> Not what was pictured. Go&#x27;s through batteries like crazy. Bogs down too easy.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose. After a bad experience getting a pedicure I have sworn them off so using a callus remover is the next best thing. While this may seem obvious to some, I didn&#x27;t realize how much dust it would create. I have never used something like this before so I can&#x27;t compare it to another electric callus remover, but compared to the manual way, this is a very good option.&lt;br /&gt;Note- I thought I might try it on my elbows because they were a bit dry. Don&#x27;t do that, it was a stupid idea.</li>
    <li> love this, works better than anything else ever tried. Everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> Used this on my husbands feet......amazing! Buying another just for me</li>
    <li> This is a good purchase and does what it claims.  You definitely have to purchase additional rollers though because you will run through the first one pretty quickly.  All in all a good buy and the price was right!</li>
    <li> i wish i had gotten the electrical one but it gets the job done  and living in South Florida I live in sandals or my bare feet 50 weeks out of the year so when i can&#x27;t get to the salon this little guy is a god send!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Removing old dead skin on feet is fun!</li>
    <li> Useful and effective!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Does exactly what it claims to do!  Happy customer.... Happy feet!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it. I couldn&#x27;t see any difference using this product. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> my daughter said it worked great. she now has lovely to look at feet for the summer !!!</li>
    <li> Works really well! Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Not what I expected. Should&#x27;ve went with a rival product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this little machine once a week for about a month , I can see I will save tons of money by doing my own feet ! I just started wearing my sandals a couple of days ago ! No more 30 bucks a pedicure for me ! My home pedicure looks great !</li>
    <li> My feet were never smoother, love this product! WOW!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one! Stick with a professional</li>
    <li> With my dry heals and my husbands callous&#x27; this was a great investment! It works great!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I use it about once a week and then just scrub my feet with a pumice stone in the shower, and they are so soft. Now I don&#x27;t need to pay extra for the callus remover when I go get a pedicure!</li>
    <li> This worked well, but batteries can get a little expensive. I switched to the electric. This will do the job as long as you have fresh batteries to keep it going strong.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.  I have very rough feet, well I had.  I do not know.  Makes it nice and smooth.  Very easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I got this last night and tried it out...OMG this is amazing!!!  I had a pedicure a couple of weeks ago and thought my feet were smooth then.  After using this, they are incredibly smooth, and soft to the touch.  Highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  This is so easy to use and the results are great. I am so pleased w/ this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ - wished I bought one sooner.  Feet are baby smooth and I love wearing sandals.  I do a lot of marital arts and when kicking I used to hate having someone grab them - not any longer.  Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love our emjoi. The product is great.  Gets the job done with excellent results</li>
    <li> Great product for in-between pedi appointments. Very satisfied so far, it has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Works great, but it does leave a lot of dust. I do mine over the waste basket, but I have to make sure that there isn&#x27;t an air current around. It&#x27;s easy to hold and easy to brush clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  A bit less than I was hoping for, but does the job.  Be sure to have something under your feet to catch the shavings (which come out powdery).</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my daughter because I really like the one I have had for quite a while--months and months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go barefoot a lot--especially in the summer, and my heels get very rough.  I have tried metal scrapers and pumice stones, but they really don&#x27;t do the job--the effort required is too much. (And I don&#x27;t think they would ever work to my satisfaction.) This battery-operated roller requires little effort on the part of the operator and gets rid of LOTS of callus.  You need to position your foot over something to catch the powdery skin as it falls.  I&#x27;m tall and I stand in front of my bathroom sink, put my foot up on the counter and let my heel hang over the bowl.  I&#x27;m always surprised at the amount that accumulates in the bowl--it&#x27;s almost like face powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION:  If the roller slows down, you&#x27;re using two much pressure.  Lighten up a bit. OR maybe your batteries need to be changed.  I just changed my batteries for the first time and it did make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE:  Use the roller often.  It&#x27;s easy and won&#x27;t take long if you use it regularly--say once or twice a week.  AND THEN use lotion on your feet when you finish.</li>
    <li> Worked great cleaned up my feet in record time &amp; made my feet soft &amp; very smooth, definitely would recommend to any one.</li>
    <li> My feet feel so happy and look so good! This is so simple and easy to use. BEFORE USING THE CALLUS REMOVER,  BE SURE TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTIONS. Do not push down; a light touch makes it work. Only use it about 2 or 3 seconds on any spot or your foot will be sore.  I love this gadget and it is going to save me a lot of money since I won&#x27;t have to get pedicures as often.</li>
    <li> i have gotten pedicures for YEARS...but, none like this little mean machine !!  From now on &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; I will get a polish change only !!  I highly recommend it 11</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, no need to go to the spa for a pedicure again!!...works even better than I imagined it would!</li>
    <li> Works almost too well! A very cool tool for callouses!</li>
    <li> Works great...but since it&#x27;s a nano it is small. Other than that I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have had very disappointing results with this product. After 1.5 weeks of use, my heels are still rough. I am using as directed and putting on cream afterwards. The results are very minimal and with the amount of time I spend doing this, it is NOT been worth the effort. I honestly have had better results with a $10jar of exfoliater that just took a minute in the shower, that also left my hands softer. I do not feel that my heels are that rough in the first place, this product if it did what it claims to do, should have been helpful.</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to use and does a great job, my heals are soft and callus free. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great for removing rough sin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the service I received from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;The merchandise is very good.</li>
    <li> Very nice, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews... ever, but I had to come back and write a review. This thing is amazing! I am a hostess so i&#x27;m on my feet all the time and switching shoes &amp; boots etc all the time causes me to get calluses and tough feet sometimes. This thing made them go away within a minute and I&#x27;m back to having normal non callused SUPER soft feet again. Now I don&#x27;t have to get pedicures. Saved my wallet too. &#x3D;D I was very hesitant to buy it but now I am VERY GLAD that I did.</li>
    <li> like others it does a good job but a little under powered, if you press hard it bogs way down but if you easy it does the job fine. again like others the pad wears down after only a couple of uses so stock up on pads but does a good job for the size and price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He uses it all the time and really likes it.</li>
    <li> Came on time and it works great!</li>
    <li> works but involves a lot of work blue workers wears out quickly and uses up battery but does give desired result</li>
    <li> My experience is that it works well.</li>
    <li> I can only say Great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this device. I even use it when doing professional pedicure services at the salon. My clients tell me they have never been callous free before this. It is wonderful and makes my life easier at work.</li>
    <li> very happy with the product</li>
    <li> I love this tool. I use it every couple of Sunday&#x27;s and it does a great job getting off the dead skin. Make sure to have a paper towel or something under your feet to make for easy cleanup though. It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to and with medium pressure it does its job. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to those with rough feetvv</li>
    <li> Bought thse for a friend, I have the older model. She loves it as much as I do. IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item.  My feet are very rough with lots of dead skin. This has saved me trips to the nail spa many times. It works like a charm. My feet are smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Works great and does a great job reducing my callouses.</li>
    <li> When it worked it worked well.  I had trouble from the beginning with it turning on.  Now it will not turn on at all.  This is after I ordered all of extra roller heads.  Now I am stuck with all these roller heads and a machine that does not work at all!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but was so blown away by this product I had to let others know how great it is.  IT REALLY WORKS!!!!  I&#x27;ve tried many methods of removing the callouses on my feet and this is the only one that truly works for me.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This little thing works beautifully and quickly!  I was amazed how well it worked I&#x27;m about the same time I&#x27;ve spent with hand files and sanders. I am throwing them all away now that I&#x27;ve found the Emjoi.</li>
    <li> I have really dry feet and this has worked wonderfully on my feet.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé as she wanted one for Christmas. Now, I&#x27;ve always known my feet were rough. Even more nasty, I had some very bad toe knuckle calluses on my big toe. She told me to try it out. Well, I did and I should have put on a mask. The emjoi swiftly sanded and polished them right down and dust was aflyin&#x27;! I&#x27;ve since started to keep up on my feet because I actually like having nice looking feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware though, if your calluses are tough/thick do layers and go back the next day. I did them and kept at it for awhile because I really couldn&#x27;t feel anything. The next day my toes were sore and had scabbed as I started to sand the skin. I definitely recommend this product. I just wish it came with more rollers. The refills are a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift after seeing a video presentation on a popular television shopping channel.  I figured I would have to upgrade to the green or grey rollers - not necessary!  Right out of the box, this did a great job!  At first I didn&#x27;t see anything coming off and I thought it wasn&#x27;t working, boy was I wrong.  This thing is awesome and works better than anything I have ever used.  I have told many of my friends about this little miracle.  My feet look better than they ever have - I can&#x27;t wait for summer.  From reading some of the other reviews, it appears the company may have a quality control problem, which is too bad.  If you get a unit that works, it works great!</li>
    <li> I  Love this product, I was told about it by my boss and had to try it out myself.&lt;br /&gt;I will be suggesting this to people for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you</li>
    <li> I rate the Emojoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover less than one star, its a piece of junk, not powerful enough at all.</li>
    <li> delivery took awhile but it was the holidays, im happy with it. Wont remove hard calluses in one sitting maybe 3 or 4</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much my husband and I love this little gadget.  He uses it more than I do on his heels and even calloused hands.  Works great.  We ordered 5 for gifts for Christmas this year.  We have been using for a couple of years and works great.  Naturally, we have had to change out the wheel but not often.</li>
    <li> Not as good as made out...dissapointing</li>
    <li> A++++  WORKS GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> Just okay. I&#x27;m not sure how great I expected this to work, but it did some minimal help. Soften your feet up first for the best results and use often.</li>
    <li> These reviews don&#x27;t lie. I was still skeptical upon purchase, but this works great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, and I have seen feet much worse than mine.</li>
    <li> This product actually works!  Much better than the Ped Egg, not nearly as hard to use and removes callus more quickly.  Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> It did not perform well, for me, and if I had saved the packaging, I&#x27;d return it.  Total flop.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, however do not throw the oil or shay butter away for your   heels as they will still require reinforcement of nurture.</li>
    <li> After just one time use, my heels never felt so soft and clean.  It works well and I love it.</li>
    <li> This product is a small giant, and its effectiveness is unchallenged.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My feet used to be smooth and over about 5 years, the heels and soles of my feet changed drastically (age).  My heels were hard, needed constant care and use of home remedies that barely worked, weekly pedicures where the texture of my feet lasted 1 day.  They were a mess. I used this ONE time, and all the powderish stuff you see coming off your feet in the video are true!  this product works so good.  I&#x27;m now on about my 12th day and my feet still look like the first day.  My feet weren&#x27;t crunchy crunchy (the feet you only see on rare occasions), but the health of the skin on my feet clearly showed with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of this sounds familiar PLEASE try this.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my girlfriend.  She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> P.O.S. !  Got it for my wife and she hated it. Hardly had any power even with brand new batteries.  Ended up giving it to my kid for a toy..........</li>
    <li> It&#x27; s a useful, and well design tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Txs&lt;br /&gt;Maria C.</li>
    <li> still using it.would be perfect if the size goes a little bit large</li>
    <li> This easily removed the scaley skin.  I have used a pumice stone for years - this works so much better.  I am amazed at the difference.</li>
    <li> It does a wonderful job.  my feet are always smooth now. thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Works so good .. I just don&#x27;t know where to order a filter but all in all it helpsmy feet.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love the callus remover.  It works wonders!</li>
    <li> Works very well and trust me my feet were in really bad shape. Would work on my feet wait a few days the do it again and got my feet smooth. For the price it&#x27;s worth it. Buy it you will not regret it</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with the product, I later purchased one for a family member.</li>
    <li> seems to work pretty good.  Maybe need stronger &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to smooth heels.  Had to use several times to get them smooth</li>
    <li> Love this little thing!! Really helps keep my heels nice and soft! But. I must have had horse hooves because that first roller didn&#x27;t last but just a few times. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ll need to order some military grade sanders for mine I guess but I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great</li>
    <li> I am giving an excellent rating because it came on time, I felt the price was good, and the product appears to be as advertised. However this is a gift for a friend. If she likes it I plan on ordering on for myself. I thought I&#x27;d have my friend try it first rather than ordering two. Fairly soon I will be able to tell you if it does what it claims, Jo</li>
    <li> should&#x27;ve bought this a long time ago. can&#x27;t believe how easy it is to use this!</li>
    <li> Works great use everyday</li>
    <li> Removes calluses,  smoothes rough feet and elbows.  Even my sensitive hubby likes this. Now all our feet are in good shape.  I still get pedicures but this keeps my feet great in between.  I expect that I can cut back to less than 1 pedicure per month.  It has already paid for itself.  I buy rollers from the emjoi club</li>
    <li> Does a great job.  Keeps feet smooth and supple.</li>
    <li> My poor old dogs were a disaster zone and trying to find something that works was a real pain until I tried this product. Easy on feet with great results....ahhh! smooooooooth!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It is so easy to use and very effective. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have an earlier version of this product, which actually gives me a better treatment than when I get a pedicure.  I&#x27;ve had it well over a year and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  This update looks even easier to use. ( I purchased it to give as a gift, and will despite being tempted to keep it for myself because it looks like it would fit into the palm of your hand so easily. )  Just change batteries and rollers as needed and it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations</li>
    <li> not as powerfull as expected</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as I expected.  Also, refills are expensive.  I should have invested in clarisonic pedi.</li>
    <li> Work amazing .I ordered this product from a tv demonstration. I surprised! It worked just like demonstrated, very quickly turned my dry, cracked hiking feet into pink and smooth.  This would make a great gift for a female relative,.</li>
    <li> good product but not much better than others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  for the hype I heard over this, I would have thought it would be a little better.  Feels like a toy. One roller is not going to last very long and then you have to pay to get new ones.  It works though so I will give it 3 stars for that.</li>
    <li> I use faithfully. It does what it is suppose to do. I needed the Nano to finish my pedi-cure. Thank-you.</li>
    <li> I brought the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover for my mom as gift.  She really enjoys used this callus remover.  The Micro-pedi removes the callus in small layers.  This machine has a lot of power and does create a mess removing callus(you may want to place a towel beneath your feet to keep your area clean).  All the Micro-Pedi requires are two AA batteries and comes two standard callus remover rolls(I upgrade to the coarser roller grade of better removal that was an extra cost).  If you are looking for a cheap and easy to use callus remover get the Emjoi Micro -Pedi.</li>
    <li> Priced reasonably ,  does a good job</li>
    <li> I am so busy that I rarely get a chance for a pedi. This little gem smoothed away all of the callused skin and rough edges.&lt;br /&gt;I even ordered one for my bestie as a birthday gift.</li>
    <li> Works great but eats batteries like crazy order the corded version</li>
    <li> This remover works so well that I bought two more for gifts.  Less than a minute a night takes care of &amp;#34;sandal feet&amp;#34; calluses.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. In a couple of uses my dry calloused feet look like a foot model&#x27;s feet. This will make a wonderful and affordable gift for your friends. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not worth it at all. Would you like to spend an hour sanding your feet only to end up with the same result you could acheive with a pumice stone in less time? This just isn&#x27;t powerful enough. Maybe try another brand?</li>
    <li> I like it but I feel the electrical one has more power</li>
    <li> buenisimo una amravilla</li>
    <li> I experienced it as ineffective and returned it after the first use. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> My feet are horrible and this works wonders! I&#x27;ve tried lotions, creams, files, and exfoliating but this is the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> ok cute but i dont use it on my feet ive try it and you will be theree all day so i just keep it in my purse to keep my nails shaped between fill ins</li>
    <li> I ordered a second one of these.  My wife and daughter both very pleased with the product.  When they are pleased, I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I was pleasantly surprised. I took a gamble buying this, being as most &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; stuff is low quality crap that doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as it does on the commercial. The Mico Pedi actually works. While it won&#x27;t leave your feet looking like they belong to a foot model after just a few uses, it dose make a dramatic difference to their texture and is certainly better than using a callous pad or stone. Well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> This is great1 Really does a great job on your calluses with very little effort. Would recommend to anyone.!</li>
    <li> I hate callouses... So, despite using pumice stones and even the Pedi-egg, there have been spots on my feet with callouses that have been a challenge to remove. I would at best get a third to almost a half and when I&#x27;d get a pedicure done they got a bit more but couldn&#x27;t quite remove it all. This finally did it. My feel look so smooth that I&#x27;m very thankful I decided to buy this.  I recommend this to everyone. I have looked at replacement rollers and it seems that there are roller replacements that are even more course than the one it came with.</li>
    <li> Awesome. All the girls loved it. Really works.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. Never knew/heard of these before, I&#x27;m a guy so what do I know. She used to use the Pdei Egg for years but not only was it a cumbersome task, but wasn&#x27;t user friendly either. This one she loves, it effortlessly removes any &amp; all rough spots. She likes to keep her feet smooth and soft. This really is a good product.</li>
    <li> There is no device on the market that can compare to the Emoji Micro-Pedi in callus removal. I don&#x27;t think any customer could complain about this.</li>
    <li> This is just fantastic.  I just cannot tell you all how much I love this product.  I would purchase it again in a heart beat.  I walk without shoes all the time and have a huge problem with callouses.  Gone!  Buy this.  Money well, well spent.</li>
    <li> Aafter 2 to  3 uses I found that the &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; is gone.. have to buy the refills too often at this point-so</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> Simply an emory board on a roller ran by battery.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> beats the ped egg any day !</li>
    <li> Excellent product .... bought one for myself and one as a gift.</li>
    <li> Actually works like it said. First time my heels have been this smooth since I can remember!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this gadget!!!  No more gross feet!!!  No more expensive pedicures, it will save me hundreds of dollars.</li>
    <li> Seems like a strong unit.  Cheaper then the Amope brand and I have to think it works the same.  Time will tell if it holds up I guess.  I know it&#x27;s sanded a few feet aleady and still works.</li>
    <li> Emjoi, where have you been most of my life? When I bought this, the hubby said/asked, &amp;#34;Why didn&#x27;t you get the corded one?!&amp;#34;. The corded one was running at a higher price, so I thought this would be better.  I&#x27;m glad I went with my instincts. Even with cheap batteries, I can use it numerous times without changing them out. The imperfections that I have to deal with are now taken care of, thanks to this wonderful tool.  Also, the replacement rollers last a long time for me. I prefer the extra course, but Emjoi has quite a selection to choose from (which I may, in future). I&#x27;ve truly gotten my money&#x27;s worth and I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is great. Works sooo much better than the as seen on tv one that someone else got me. And the generic refills fit it too. The only issue I have with it is that it seems to drain the battery power very quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, after spending hundreds at the podiatrist this little gadget has saved me a lot of money</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Works better with coarse rollers</li>
    <li> I Love It!!!  Works perfectly. Even used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s heels. Even he was impressed.</li>
    <li> Nice little machine, runs on 2 double AA, not included. Comfortable to hold and angle down to your feet.  Easy to replace the rollers with a small release button on the side.Comes with a protective shield over the top of the roller. Would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what is described! Love it&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Great little item. it works great to keep your feet soft between pedicures. It can make a set of rough feet soft but will take a little time. I feel its more of a maintenance item to keep feet soft. It is a very simple design and easy to use. It came very quickly through the mail. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this. I&#x27;m saving tons of $ not going to get a pedicure. Plus my feet are too ticklish for someone to give me a pedi, so I love this!</li>
    <li> It takes forever to notice a difference</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it. She goes barefoot and feet get ragged. After using the Emjoi callus remover they are smooth again. The price is much better than some she looked at.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it works!</li>
    <li> Just received my Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover and WOW what a wonderful experience. I prefer to do my pedicures at home, but there are always areas that are hard to see or reach. Well this little gem just eliminated all of that. You do not have to press hard at all, and it reaches all the curves &amp; contours. I cannot attest to its longevity yet, but I am quite impressed with the battery power. Hint: use Avon&#x27;s Foot Works Therapeutic Foot Cream afterwards and you will have the softest feet ever!</li>
    <li> This works well and the batteries last a long time. I think the newer design with the long handle is better because it&#x27;s easier for people who have difficulty reaching their feet, but this works fine.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that is took so long for me to find something that addresses calluses and dry scaly heels so well and so easily. It&#x27;s like having a pedicure at your disposal and only takes a few seconds. My feet haven&#x27;t been this smooth since I was a kid.</li>
    <li> Love this gadget.  I got it for use on my hands....I have eczema and the palms get quite rough.  This unit smoothes them out nicely.</li>
    <li> works great , my socks are easier to put on now</li>
    <li> Meh. If you have the teaniest-tiniest callouses and lots of time to kill, maybe. If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;ll impress you with how well it works -- it&#x27;s not this.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this...BUT it uses up the batteries so fast!! It also is weird, the plastic that covers the roller really gets in the way!! A real waste of money for me</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job!  I absolutely love it and bought several more as gifts.  My heels were rough and looked awful and this took care of it better than when I go for a professional pedicure.</li>
    <li> The product is very effective at removing dead skin and calluses. The results are amazing--very soft heels.</li>
    <li> I really love this product ! I don&#x27;t miss the long process of hand filing my feet for what seemed like hours. Takes minutes to have my heels smooth and  looking like I had been for a pro-pedi. A+++++</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift.  My friend says she loves it and that this works amazing on her feet.</li>
    <li> I got this for the calluses on my heels and found it to be very ineffective. It may work for people who just have some dry patches and just need a light buffing up. I unfortunately needed more help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s worse is that the blue roller seems to have dulled after just 2 uses. The tool itself is cheap but the costs of buying replacement rollers would quickly add up. I&#x27;m on the hunt for better options...</li>
    <li> Excellent! Worked as described. I&#x27;ve never had my heels look so smooth. I used to use the Pedi Egg which also worked but this was much less work and had smoother results. Though still worked these rollers were not rough enough. Ordered rougher rollers.</li>
    <li> This definitely helped my (not severely) callused feet. The device is light and easy to hold. I appreciate that it will stop if too much pressure is applied. I was surprised at the amount of time it took to get noticeable smoothing, especially as my calluses are not major. Maybe I need coarser rollers. I was very surprised that the instructions state that a roller should last only 1 or 2 sessions. That seems like a rip -off for something you may use several times a week. The price is less attractive when you factor in replacement rollers and that only one is included. Batteries aren&#x27;t included either and I&#x27;m not sure yet how long those will last. A small cleaning brush is included which is only mildly useful and likely to get lost as there&#x27;s no way to store it in or on the device. I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if the rollers lasted longer or replacements cost less.</li>
    <li> The trick to this is using on dry skin and going slowly.  I love this thing!!!</li>
    <li> I thought this thing would grind the dead cracked skin off my feet like a sander or straight 100 grit sand paper.  It doesn&#x27;t.  The motor is weak and it wouldn&#x27;t grind the bark off a tree..  My conclusion on this is it will end up in the trash when I get tire of it taking space.</li>
    <li> So far I like the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus remover. I&#x27;ve only used it once but it worked fine. You can&#x27;t press too hard or it will slow down. It does a great job though on my lobster feet. The roller is easy to remove and clean. You have to use it on dry feet. I use rechargeable batteries so they will last me a long time without having to buy new batteries. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the power. Emjoi should have made it to run on 3 or 4 batteries. That being said, I would definitely recommend buying this.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Could&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it for her girl callouses.&lt;br /&gt;She says its alright.</li>
    <li> This is garbage they must be paying someone to say its good and its not</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  Had to order a new roller, as it only comes w/one.  Got the green ones for extra power!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. CHEAPEST ONLINE</li>
    <li> This works!  Smooth heels now.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Just be careful not to over-do. Feet can be sore next couple of days if you do too much. But soooooooo worth the money if you want callous-free feet without having to get a pedi every two weeks.</li>
    <li> not as good as other products on the market.</li>
    <li> It is a lousy product.....roller does not turn.....the minute it touches your skin, it stops moving....very difficult to use..sorry I didn&#x27;t listen to previous reviews</li>
    <li> Love love love this callus remover, why did I wait so long to purchase !!!  I use it every few days to keep my feet feeling divine !!</li>
    <li> Works well, but if you have bad feet as mine, order the corse refills.</li>
    <li> I really like this callus remover.  My heels were not in great shape and after a couple of days using this, my feet are looking great!!  When I first used it, I thought that the rollers weren&#x27;t going to be strong enough but they are - just don&#x27;t press too hard when using it. I bought the refill rollers and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I haven&#x27;t replaced them yet but know that I will have to pretty soon.  This is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I relly like it, very comfortable when using it.</li>
    <li> really like the idea, but the design needs works.</li>
    <li> Stop what you are doing and buy this now.  If you suffer from SEVERE dry/cracked feet every winter like I do and have found limited to no success with files/pumice stones/pedeggs/etc, then allow me to guide you into the light, my friends.  Come, follow me into the heavenly bliss that is the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving I ripped open the package with my bare teeth, shoved 2 AA batteries into the back (not included, be ready), turned this sucker on and went at my gnarly, sandpaper, ripped up heels with no mercy.  The plume of dead skin smoke alerted me to the fact that I wasn&#x27;t in Kansas any more, and that I was in the presence of something great.  I worked on my heels for about 5 full minutes, focusing on the thick bits of skin that had started to stick up and catch on socks, blankets, everything.  In second they were smoothed away and when I was done....WHEN I WAS DONE....my heels were smoother than I had felt in years.  I cried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished my other foot and smoothed on a thick cream to retain moisture.  It will require a few uses to penetrate all of the cracks and damage, but without a doubt, this little wonder has found itself elevated to full time bathroom counter space privileges, and all the rights therein.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly, this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It was not like I what I expected. I will not use it again. I actually threw it away!</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Okay. Seems to work intermittently</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but wish it was a little wider. Less work than using a pumice.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. Be sure and get your refills when you order it, so you don&#x27;t have to wait for some to come in after everyone in the family borrows it.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I really didn&#x27;t expect this product to perform so well. My feet looked like baby feet within moments. I was flabbergasted. I have no cons, order the extra rollers and smooth away.. This product is exactly what it claims to be, period.</li>
    <li> i read reviews before buying this. exactly as it is. very happy finally got a product for the purpose.</li>
    <li> Works great!! I have psoriasis on my hands, using this plus my medical cream, after 2 weeks the psoriasis is almost gone! The places where it&#x27;s still present it&#x27;s barely noticeable!</li>
    <li> This item works great on the occasional rough spot on my feet - you do need to mind the instructions as to how long you run the roller over a specific part of your foot - it will leave a raw spot otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love this. Works great. Wish the rollers weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> This thing works well at the beginning, but the rollers just don&#x27;t last long.  I also found that smoothing out my calluses was a bad and painful idea.</li>
    <li> This is the most incredible product ever.  I have really rough feet especially in the summer and after two uses my feet are totally smooth.  I am a barefoot junky and it fixed my feet.  Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews this product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the model I had which used small circular rotating blades. This works so much better in smoothing the rough skin. My only complaint is the skin dust that falls off and doesn&#x27;t get collected. I advise putting a towel or something under your foot to catch it. Also it&#x27;s a simple thing to knock off the loose dust from the Micro-Pedi in the trash can. I give it a few taps on the inside of the trash can, a gentle blowing, and good as new. I also bought the extra coarse replacement rollers. Careful not to wash it with water!!!!</li>
    <li> A very reasonable pedi callus remover.  Works very well and I will continue to use it on my feet as I only get one pedicure monthly and this will smooth the rough spots on my feet until I can get a pedicure.  Excellent buy and I would recommend it to anyone who wants smooth feet.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no idea why this works, but it does. The roller is much too small to cover a wide surface, and the motor is hardly very powerful. Yet somehow this tiny machine has managed to keep my feet baby soft and smooth. I have tried foul smelling creams and pumice stones, all to no avail. I honestly tried the Emjoi on a whim, simply because of the great reviews. I am oh so glad that I did! I need only use it about once a month no less--two times maximum--and my feet remain smooth to the touch. I have no idea how the machine actually manages to be so effective, but I&#x27;m awfully glad that it is.</li>
    <li> This really works great! I have always used a course nail file and this gets the smooth going on with little effort. I ordered the green buffers but so far the original blue that came with it does a fine job</li>
    <li> So nice to &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; your feet at home.  Be careful not to &#x27;over&#x27; do it.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> It really works well.  There are others on the marked but this one was more reasonable.</li>
    <li> does what it says nice product</li>
    <li> The callouses on my feet were so painful. I went to the podiatrist who charge me a $50 co-pay to trim my callouses but barely trim them. This was easy to use and did a great job trimming my callouses. I&#x27;m walking more comfortable. I don&#x27;t have to go to the podiatrist and pay $50 each time I need my callouses trim.</li>
    <li> I bought this skin shaver. It rarely scrapes the dry skin off. When you press it on your heel, it slows down. This is rarely worth it. Never gets this.</li>
    <li> Works great, much easier than using emery board or other manual devices. Easy to clean and use. Included cover is handy.</li>
    <li> This unit works fine but if you have calluses that are pronounced like on your heals it will take quite a long time to reduce them.  I bought coarser rollers but that does not help much.  I have a ped egg that gets rid of calluses much quicker so I use it first then finish them off with this unit.</li>
    <li> It is ok but if it was electric it would of been better. To me it could have more power</li>
    <li> I like this a lot but, I think an electric one would run better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works as described.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Quiet and gets the job done.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live w/out this!  Best brand!  I own the small one as well for travel.</li>
    <li> I just came back to the US after living overseas for a number of years and in my opinion, American pedicures don&#x27;t get all the dead skin off, they barely even scrub your foot sometimes. Especially with winter, my feet have been feeling very unloved with cracked heels and lots of dead skin (what, TMI?). I bought a bunch of pedicure DIYs on Amazon to rectify the situation, and this lil gadget completely exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s kind of like an electric file for your feet, it just gently scrapes off the skin. My feel feel ah-mazing!! Soft and smooth like I just had an actual pedicure. I would buy this again for sure!! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this, works beautifully &amp; doesn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount of money like others.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove dead skin off the palms of my hands due to a condition called dyshidrosis. I tried using other products, but they were either ineffective at removing the dead skin or they affected the healthy skin just as much as the dead skin which only made things worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give this product a try, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It very quickly removes the dead skin without being so harsh as to remove a lot of the healthy skin around it. I think that&#x27;s partly because it works on dry skin more than moist skin. I also love that I don&#x27;t have to press very hard for it to work. That way any dead skin that&#x27;s raised up gets worked on more, leaving the healthier skin below unharmed. What this means is when a blister opens up causing a spot on my hand with newly exposed skin in the center encircled by thick, dead skin, I can use this to remove the dead skin without harming the new skin in the middle. You just can&#x27;t do that with any other product! Removing the dead skin means it won&#x27;t catch on anything and I won&#x27;t pick on it so the whole area is able to heal much faster and with less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, but what about all these reports that the callus remover stalls and sputters if you apply too much pressure? I decided to try it on the calluses on my heels just to see how well it worked, and it was amazing. First and foremost—IT NEVER STALLED OR SPUTTERED WITH PRESSURE! Instead, it created a mountain of powder from my old calluses. The only thing I can think of that might be making a difference is that I did not use regular alkaline batteries. I used lithium batteries instead. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why mine never stalled, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks I can see with this product is that it&#x27;s possible to overuse it, causing damage to tender, healthy skin because it works so fast and so efficiently. I think it&#x27;s important to do only a little at a time just to be sure you haven&#x27;t gone too far. The other drawback is that it can be messy. It creates a mountain of powdered skin cells that go everywhere if you don&#x27;t stop and clean it up as you go. A damp washcloth should help control the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to remove dead skin. This is basically a skin sander which works very effectively. Just be careful to use it wisely because it is so fast and efficient, you can remove more skin than you realize in a short amount of time.that it can be messy.

    <li> this is a really nice product that works well and it&#x27;s a whole lot easier than trying to use a file</li>
    <li> Do not buy. It does not work as advertised. I would not purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Where to begin? First, the design of this was awful to hold. I see today, the one I got which was rounded has now been replaced with a longer one. I guess they got the hint from bad feed back. But I was still stuck with the awkward one.  I put batteries in it and turned it on. The buffer rotated very slow and stopped when I put it to my skin.  I thought it had to be because the batteries were old so I went and got new ones. Same thing. It did a better job with me just rubbing it back and forth with my hand.  So of course I am returning it, but am put off that I have to pay shipping to return it.  I was going to try one of the other models to see if this was just defective and if the other design was better, but I&#x27;m not risking paying more for further disappointment. I would skip it!</li>
    <li> Took a chance, and won!!  I think this thing works great.  I wear flips every day (yes, even in winter) so my feet get pretty thrashed.  I do my own pedi once a week, and I would absolutely order this again.  Only took two weeks to have my feet smooth.  I know two people who are gonna get this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works great, you can tell the differences.</li>
    <li> I purchased one for myself and two for gifts. We all love them.  The reviews were helpful and purchasing these.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for a really callused heel. Just gets off the 1st layer of skin smoothly, but didn&#x27;t get down to the cracks. Not very &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as the product&#x27;s name states.</li>
    <li> Kept seeing the TV ad for this product &amp; checked out reviews before trying it myself. Ordered directly from Micropedi website as they had a buy one get one free offer so for under $30 I got 2! Worked great 1st time out...even my husband tried it &amp; approved. Just ordered the more course green refills so we can use the green/blue combo others had suggested. Again, directly from the website because they were the same price as Amazon or Ebay but with free shipping! Sorry Amazon. Will update review if my opinion changes, but for now I say A++++!</li>
    <li> I bought two - one for me and  one for my sister.  We both love this product. It works really well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works so well and doesn&#x27;t cost as much as some callus removing products.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I use rechargeable batteries because it did take awhile to really get my feet smooth again. Now that I have whipped them into shape, maintaining then is a breeze with this little shaver. So much better than the razor type callous shavers (which I have also used). I don&#x27;t know why it took so long for me to try this. I also purchase the super course rollers for the areas of my feet that needed that kind of attention. My husband loves it too 😃</li>
    <li> I have only used this once since it was delivered.  I am very pleased with how well it worked! It smooths the dead skin from the heals of my feet into a dust.  I am happy I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> It works but is a bit weak on power.  Maybe Black and Decker should make one of these. lol  It does work it just take a lot of time to do it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, rough callouses on my feet and was looking for something to get rid of them.I bought this because of all the positive reviews. What a disappointment it was! It would not spin the roller it came with. So, I bought replacements thinking it was the roller since it would spin without one. Still wouldn&#x27;t work.  Do not waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Product as described, received quickly!!</li>
    <li> This is very nice it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works as stated. Very easy to use and no chance of injury when used carefully.  Gets rid of calluses quickly. I liked it so much I purchased one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great product, i have bought several of these and the regular size which i like a little better because it has a longer handle area. I have given them as gifts and they are always loved....</li>
    <li> I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I&#x27;m glad that I read all the reviews because I was a bit dissuaded by some of the negative comments.  I have a terrible problem with my feet because I have peripheral neuropathy  and yet love to hike.  My feet get very hard and crusty and often break open.  I&#x27;ve been embarrassed to go to a masseuse because of how horrible my feet look. Well I tried this device and my feet look better than they have in years. The secret is to use a  light touch and not press down.  The dead cells just fly off.  This callus remover was half the price of another that I considered and I don&#x27;t see how it could work any better.  My feet are completely soft and pink.  Just DON&#x27;T PRESS DOWN HARD and you will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> First let’s get the negative out of the way.  There is no way I would pay the list price of $70 for this product, it’s pushing it at $20 in my opinion.  That said, I really like the job it does.  I have never, in my over 50 years, had a pedicure and it showed.  My feet were covered on the sides and heel with hard, thick callouses as were my big toes.  With the included  sanding roller, the first use scrubbed away years of dead skin and made my son remark that it looked like I was building a small, white mountain on the floor.  I have continued to use it over the past couple weeks and it has smoothed out my feet to the point that I have almost no pain on the previously hard areas of my feet.  The speed of the roller is a little slow for me but I guess if it ran like a belt sander, one might start to make smoke signals or something.  It will bog down if you push too hard and I think that ends up being a good thing; you keepsanding with gentle, firm pressure for best results.  I’m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Was not sure what to expect - would recommend - helps with getting rid of those callous build up between pedicures.</li>
    <li> I like this so much better than the metal grater that I was using. It is so much more gentle and does a fantastic job of smoothing my feet. The cost is quite a bit cheaper than the electric and suits me just fine.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by this product. It worked better than I expected. I will definitely recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Powerful little thing!! You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised !!</li>
    <li> It performed as advertised.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift to my mother and she loves it. Says it works great and she enjoys using it</li>
    <li> I first saw this product on an infomercial and it piqued my curiosity.  The first thing I did was check reviews on Amazon to get an idea of how this has worked for others and if this was the product for me.  This is like an electric sander for your feet.  It is also very easy to use.  Be sure to get refills of the Emjoy Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers on an as-needed basis.  The rollers come in different colors based on their level of coarseness.  As for this little gem, it is small, requires 2 AA batteries and is very easy to use.  You will see results immediately.  Not only will it gently buff off dead skin, it will work like a miniature construction crew on calluses and corns.  Just follow instructions and don&#x27;t buff one area for more than 2-3 seconds.  You will be delighted with the results!  Be sure to wash your feet afterwards; lotion them and you will see an immediate difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I liked this micropedi, the [[ASIN:B00O0GBRL6 Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and  Callus Remover]] does a much better job.  That one will remove your corns by pulverizing them to a powdery consistency and leaving your feet corn and callus free!</li>
    <li> This product works like a rotating pumice stone.  The first time I used it was amazing.  There was a tremendous improvement to the rough, cracked skin.  I sort of expected the result to last a long time, but I found that to maintain results it has to be used every few days or once a week.  Use of the product is very easy on the hands and arms when compared to using a regular pumice stone, as the little machine is doing all the work.</li>
    <li> Super product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love it. Mine doesn&#x27;t look like this.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with this product, gave it to my wife and ordered the Men&#x27;s version for myself! Shipping was seamless(as with all Amazon products)!</li>
    <li> Compact, easy to use.  Seems like it will wear out too soon.  It will need to have replacement rollers &amp; I did not see an option for that.</li>
    <li> This heel file works great. I would suggest it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I gave this as a gift and i was so embarraced to see how cheap and not powerful at all is this product.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> works great, really like it, saves me money when I have a pedicure. my heels look a whole lot better but it&#x27;s an ongoing process to keep it up but that&#x27;s on me!</li>
    <li> My skin was so bad I ripped my sheets, which made me look at options.  I like this one and when I first used it it was going crazy with buffing my feet.  It was packaged well also.</li>
    <li> A great easy to handle item. Just be very careful you don&#x27;t abraze skin too much.</li>
    <li> For dried feet doesn&#x27;t really do the trick. For soft feet, helps keep them soft. Need a stronger one.</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough for tough feet</li>
    <li> works good - my heels were really bad.</li>
    <li> This item works fantastic and exceeded my expectations.  The only thing that would make this item even better would be if it had a vacuum mechanism that would collect all the debris.  I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.  I did purchase some extra coarse replacement cartridges and they really got the job done!</li>
    <li> Does not work. A little pressure and it stops.😐</li>
    <li> Works great.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, effective, and easy to clean. Great value!</li>
    <li> Other sites offer this device with 2 rollers--coarse and regular.  You only provide one roller.  Hard skin is not removed quickly, as the product ad claims.  It takes a while.  You need to keep your foot on a towel as you use this, since powdery white skin falls down.</li>
    <li> This is the same message as the rollers.  I won&#x27;t be giving anymore ratings on any of the other products today.  As for the guitar parts &amp; accessories, I honestly don&#x27;t know enough about them to give an educated rating.  Please note, I bought metal detector accessories which cost much more than this .  They were sent by mail.  No problem!!!  This is an awesome product.  Too bad it was shipped through a freight forwarder???</li>
    <li> My husband bought it for me because he says my feet feel like razor blades....works GREAT..after a couple of weeks of use ....NO MORE COMPLAINTS FROM HIM....now, he even rubs lotion on my feet for me....Thanks for a great product !!!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me the egg thing years ago because I get such bad calluses  on the ball of my foot,  Due to a car accident to my hip my left leg does not rotate in socket so I have to contort myself to try and get at my foot.  I have been using a single edge raiser blade to cut them off and finishing with the egg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby said look at this - Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  Well it took me awhile, but I finally broke down and purchased.  I do not know if it will last a long time, but I do know that it is a SAFE and quickly efficient way to remove calluses from your feet.</li>
    <li> This is the Bomb!! Fast, easy. Love it</li>
    <li> Not effective. It simply does not do the job. I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> Note:  Please see my comment below this original review, written after 3 uses.  I&#x27;m revising my opinion and have written the Sellers to try and return. (I originally gave it a 4-star review and realized I was overly enthusiastic.)     Easy to use and it DOES work!  But, I wish the unit&#x27;s top plastic wrap-around part, that surrounds the dark blue sander portion,  exposed MORE of the spinning sander.  The design forces you to be able to only rub the unit across your heels along the FRONT of the unit - along its front side - instead of a more-natural position of wanting to sand with it across the TOP of the unit.  Much like the analogy of a men&#x27;s shaver, where he uses it across the top  of the razor to shave his face, with this unit, you have to sand your feet across the front face of the unit, making it a little awkward to use.  There MUST be some reason for this design, but I can&#x27;t imagine why.  Otherwise, it DOES do what it&#x27;s supposed to.  But, I can see that the sanding rollers are going to be needing frequent replacements - they are not going to last long.  Be sure to order the extra replacements with your order of this unit - purchased on a different listing on Amazon (haven&#x27;t used those yet).  Once your initial sanding has been done, a little &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; every 2-3 weeks keeps your feet nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Really works! I was skeptical, but this thing really gently sands away your rough skin!</li>
    <li> This device effectively and gently buffs away dead, hard, and dry skin. But don&#x27;t add to much pressure or it will stop. As you continue to use this device, your feet will continue to feel and look much better.</li>
    <li> I have always had terrible callused feet -- cracked heels all the time. I asked for the emoji nano for Christmas with not high expectations of it helping my feet that much. I ended up getting it for Christmas and have used it once a day since then (3 days ago) and my feet already feel amazing!! They&#x27;ve never even felt like this after getting a pedicure! Totally worth the small cost to finally get rid of my disgusting feet!!</li>
    <li> Used it on my feet and my husband. It is slowly but surely removing my calluses.</li>
    <li> very good quality and works great</li>
    <li> This little gizmo is really, really great. Like others, I&#x27;ve tried many other products to eliminate my dry and calloused heels.&lt;br /&gt;No need to look further.</li>
    <li> LOVE item!  Get one if you have trouble with Callus&#x27; s.&lt;br /&gt;Quickly and easily sands them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just thrilled to have something that works well.</li>
    <li> 5 star  Best of all items I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> nice machine and does what it says</li>
    <li> Meh. Sometimes you can&#x27;t even trust the good reviews you read on the internet anymore. I was so excited to try it out and it had good reviews, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it&#x27;s okay.. But nothing special. I don&#x27;t have much callus on my feet, but the Emjoi wasn&#x27;t even able to remove the little bit I have properly. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was amazed by a product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The callus remover worked exactly as it said it would, and is ever bit as good as all the other reviewers said it is.&lt;br /&gt;This little &amp;#34;micro-pedi&amp;#34; worked perfectly to remove the callus from my feet . . .  turning it into a pile of dust (ok, dead skin) in very little time.  Leaving my feet smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  And don&#x27;t bother ordering the replacement rollers just yet . .  I used this thing for a total of about 2 hours (over the course of a few days) and it shows NO sign of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more pumice stone for me.  EVER!!!</li>
    <li> Take this for my friend,he like it</li>
    <li> It does work but if you have rough feet your going to want a much more course roller. I gave it a 3 based on the roller and the fact that it eats batteries fairly quickly</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife and so far she is happy with it.  It takes care of her calluses on her heels and I would definitely recommend this.  If it made her happy it can make pretty much anybody happy.</li>
    <li> My feet have never been softer! The replacement cartridges are a little expensive but I think they&#x27;re worth it considering all the dead skin they remove.</li>
    <li> So far I like it, but I think longer handle would be better for my hand to hold it.</li>
    <li> Summer feet on the way!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it makes my feet smooth.</li>
    <li> Horrible product don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> Had serious reservations about this.  Read the reviews and saw a similar product on a TV shopping network--but still....doubted how this would work.  My wife &amp;#34;politely&amp;#34; refers to my heels as hoofs....they damage bed sheets, scratch her in bed, and when they crack badly in the winter months they HURT!  Creams, ointments, Vaseline...prescription meds--nothing much helps....so what the heck, tried this as a last resort.  Tried it for the first time last night, and l can&#x27;t believe it--like, seriously...can&#x27;t believe it!  Ended up with a pile of &amp;#34;saw dust&amp;#34; on the floor, and used the coarsest roller they sell, and the results are unreal.  Showered afterwards, used a generic foot cream afterwards, and for the first time in my adult life, my heels are smooth, soft, and look and feel like--everyone else! Treatment is painless, fast, the unit is simple to use, and I&#x27;m simply shocked at the results.  I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but this goofy little machine is awesome!  I&#x27;m a sold customer and fan!</li>
    <li> Seldom does a product work as described. This is one I would highly recommend. After being on my feet for extended periods of time packing and preparing for a move, my feet were a mess! Cracked and dry and even a pedicure didn&#x27;t help. I ordered this tool and used it over a period of a week prior to taking a shower. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. My feet are soft and smooth - better than they have been for years!</li>
    <li> Works wonders removing calluses and does it so fast!</li>
    <li> If you have any considerable callous build up though, consider buying the most course rollers available along with your emjoi which comes with the blue rollers. The blue rollers was like taking a knife to a gun fight! It didn&#x27;t make a dent. I had to order the heaviest coarse rollers and then it cleaned my callouses off until the feet of a newborn baby appeared! It does take a bit of time to work around the areas of your feet but a far cry better than using a ped egg or pumice stone. I have carpal tunnel in my wrists so this was a blessing. DIdn&#x27;t know i could get my feet looking so nice again and just in time for an upcoming cruise.</li>
    <li> Nice but is not course enough to really remove dead skin.  The roller needs to be bigger and would be much better if it came with a course roller.</li>
    <li> This is the best footsie fixer I have tried. You can wash the roller but still will not last long. That is the ONLY downfall. If you use it in a gentle manner, it will NOT jam up like some experienced. I will buy the replacements but maybe improvement needed there. Either more foot life or lower price of refill. Still a GREAT sander</li>
    <li> After ordering this product, I received it in a few days!  I only wish I had known it existed years ago. Actually, it works better than the pedicure I pay for! In fact, it pays for itself after a couple of uses.This would be a great Christmas gift for every female (and male)on your list!</li>
    <li> This little thing does a BIG job. I use the xtreme coarse and my feet (heels) are presentable again</li>
    <li> This would be a good product except it does not have the torque it needs to properly do the job. As soon as you make the slightest press to try and remove a callus, the roller stops. I don&#x27;t think it is good for much other than &amp;#34;buffing&amp;#34; your feet.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product while looking for something to help with rough heels. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of sanding my heels, using the ped egg and that monstrosity I refer to as a cheese grader ( you know the kind they use when you get a pedicure ), I decided to give the Emjoi a try and have not been disappointed. I will be giving these as Christmas presents as I like to give my favorite things and this is definitely at the top of my list.</li>
    <li> Used a couple times and worked well initially, but after the 3rd use I already needed to replace the roller. I replaced the roller with the a roller for super callus removal, but the motor did not work very well anymore. Weak motor...</li>
    <li> This is very effective and inexpensive.  Makes your skin feel like it did when you were young.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how long it will maintain the softness just using lotion.</li>
    <li> This product works well overall and the fact that it doesnt have blades makes it a lot safer than other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;However it is a little short on power, could be stronger</li>
    <li> this little gem is amazing.  for the folks who say just a little pressure and it stops working ... it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s for your safety.  the beauty of this is that you apply almost zero pressure and it effortlessly removes all dead, dry, flaky skin.  i was shocked at how quickly it worked -- first time i used it my feet were sandal/barefoot ready within 10 minutes -- and that&#x27;s after an entire winter of doing nothing.  i know ... hideous visual, but it&#x27;s to make my point at just how great this is.  it&#x27;s so easy to use at first i thought it wasn&#x27;t working ... so lightweight and easy to use.  no more manually filing my feet with far less satisfactory results.  I&#x27;ve already recommended to all my friends.</li>
    <li> My aunt loved this gift!</li>
    <li> Best product for smoothing the tough skin on your feet there is.</li>
    <li> Everything about this is easy. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and is a very hard worker. Well worth the money. My pedicurist is very happy.</li>
    <li> This works great!  Smooths rough feet, removes callouses.  Excellent speed.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this, especially in the summer when feet need extra care.</li>
    <li> I used it last night and my feet were smooth after my use of the micro pedi. It makes my feet feel real clean and soft. I will say yes get it to anyone who wants their feet in good shape.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this Micro-Pedi!  So Glad she did!  It is Perfect and so easy to use!!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had such smooth heels in years!!</li>
    <li> No  more podiatrists. Excellent product. Does all it is touted to do. Love it for all your callous needs. And it came fast!</li>
    <li> Works excellent and I was a little surprised that it surpassed my expectations. Would highly recommend. Also very easy to use!</li>
    <li> The motor in this was so under powered that it stopped everytime it touched my foot. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing. And when I sent it back for a refund it cost me 10.00 dollars to ship so I&#x27;m out almost half the money it cost to buy it. It&#x27;s just junk.</li>
    <li> Works very  well. Good little item. Removes calluses and dead skin effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Kind of weak, when you apply even the slightest pressure the roller slows down so much as to be ineffective.  Honestly, I use this occasionally, but I keep going back to my PediEgg since it does a better job.</li>
    <li> Worked really well on my really gnarly calluses</li>
    <li> This is the best thing to keep my feet in great shape.  I don&#x27;t know what I did without it.</li>
    <li> I just received my nano emjoi and I am in love with it. I&#x27;m already getting the refillers because I never want to be without this product ever. This is a must try. Thanks for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help reduce the heavy callouses that build up on my heals. When untreated, they get so course that they stick like Velcro to the bedding. I&#x27;ve tried it all: the shavers, pumice stones, and as of late I&#x27;ve been using a fine sanding block (like the one to sand a wall). The last was the best I&#x27;ve used so far, until this device. It is easy to use, but it did take about 30 minutes the first time then about 10 for maintenance a week alter. It&#x27;s been a week and I have now had to use it twice. Results lasted for me, with severe callouses, about 7 days.</li>
    <li> Husband and myself love it, it works real good</li>
    <li> Bought for wife.  She is now obsessed with it.</li>
    <li> I gave as a gift.  The person I gave it to thanked me .  After trying called to let me know she was surprised and pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> Great item in between pedis!</li>
    <li> I am diabetic and was afraid to use the other instrument that shaves off callused feet as for a diabetic this could be dangerous. This product is WONDERFUL. Does what it is supposed to do without blades. I used it on heels, balls of feet, toes, anywhere it was needed. I followed it up with foot cream, put on booties and enjoyed my newly soft  feet. Love this product, love that I can order refills on Amazon.</li>
    <li> love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> this is not a cure for my horrible rough feet.... ended up buying this stuff called &amp;#34;baby foot&amp;#34; (cheaper that this thing with GREATER results)  do yourself a hung favor and by Baby Foot</li>
    <li> My feet were cracking and rough and just GROSS.  I really didn&#x27;t believe that a product like this could do anything but I was wrong.  Let me tell you the proof, I worked on one part of my foot at a time for instance the heel...the part that I worked on was a little yellow and pink (the color the skin should be, not red from the product) and the other part of the foot was still the brown, yellow hard color. You could tell the gross tough thick skin came off. Of course, some of the hard skin that turns into powder actually comes from the machine while you are using it so you can see it there too.  Kinda looks like baby powder.  After only a few minutes my feet were much smoother, maybe even smooth in most parts. I was too lazy to do it for too long but I&#x27;m sure if I do it about 5 minutes a day by the end of the week my feet will be amazing. This is a must have for an avid bare foot walker like me.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ON MY FEET.</li>
    <li> So GLAD I bought this!  I did buy additional rollers that fit perfectly.  I needed the Xtreme Coarse rollers to start with and then used the less coarse rollers to finish up and smooth out the pedicure.  Wish I would&#x27;ve bought this long ago.  SO MUCH EASIER than using a rasp. I prefer doing my own pedicures because I know everything is clean and sanitary.  I highly recommend this new style; easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever attempted to take care of my feet.  This little machine works!! Just remember, don&#x27;t push down so hard, let the machine do the work for you!</li>
    <li> This works really well.  For the price you cant beat it.  The only CON is that it uses double &#x27;A&#x27; batteries.  That is not enough for me to drop my star rating.</li>
    <li> It is good but I hope it works little bit stronger.</li>
    <li> PLEASE NOTE....this is not going to cut off your callouses like the razor or shaver at the nail salon.  This is more like a sander or buffer....it will work to gently sand and smooth even the toughest skin--but it takes time.   Any of us with thick callouses understands that shaving or RAZORING is temporary....and shaving is a quick fix that grows back quick and uneven......Be patient and take the time to slowly sand and smooth your feet with this product and you will be thrilled.....after this first few long sessions it will be well worth it...Maybe 10 -15 minutes with the coarse roller on each foot for the first try.....don&#x27;t even have to look at it while you do it as it is so gentle.</li>
    <li> Awesome little machine.  It&#x27;s so nice to have smooth heels again without having to pay for a pedicure.  The running time of the machine is good too, as two AA batteries seem to last though at least 4 &amp;#34;sessions&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Awesome time saver!!!</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to the previous version of the micro-pedi and I absolutely loved it!  I have terrible calluses and have been embarrassed to wear sandals in the summer.  I have tried EVERYTHING to make my feet look better to no avail!  My friends micro-predi took every callus off of my feet!!  I was so excited that I immediately got online to purchase one.  This was the &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; version so I assumed it meant that it was &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not!!!  Don&#x27;t buy this version.  Buy the one before this!!  The other version has a better grip and gets to your calluses much better than this one.  The sanding power is also different on this one and not nearly as effective.  The other micro-pedi is absolutely amazing and I WILL buy it!  Its an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I have tried all the tools for smoothing out the rough areas on my heels and the sides of my foot. This is by far the best thing ever!  Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This thing is so awesome. Even my boyfriend is using it now. Works better than I anticipated. HIghly recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> Works just as it is advertised.  Saves me a lot of time and it is convenient and portable so I can take it anywhere</li>
    <li> I actually saw this little gizmo demonstrated on tv and thought it looked like something I&#x27;d be interested in. Am glad I bought it. Works like a charm without a lot of &amp;#34;elbow grease.&amp;#34; Just move it over the rough spots on your feet, elbows or other areas where you want to have smoother skin. Let the machine do the work - don&#x27;t press. If you press the little cylinder will just stop turning. It does an amazingly good job and runs for a long time on a set of batteries. I&#x27;ve used mine many times and the grit on the blue cylinder is still rough enough to do a good job. Definitely a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item for those who are tired of having rough, cracked heels!</li>
    <li> Got this for myself and one for a friend. We both love it!! works exactly like described on the web site. Thank you Amazon, my feet are very happy!</li>
    <li> A very good product. does the job and recommended. Don&#x27;t know how long does the roll last though before I need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Bought one for both my daughter and me.  The work super great and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I saw results immediately,  I use my micro-pedi outdoors so as not to get the flaked skin all over the floor.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Bought this one for my Mom, but may buy one for myself in the near future.</li>
    <li> I hardly bother to write reviews but I had to for this item. I hate getting pedicures and so I often do them myself. This has to be the best thing I bought for my feet in years. So easy to use and it does a great job without damaging your skin. Depending on how bad your heels are, it may take a few days of using before you have your heels butter smooth, but after that, you may only need to use it once a week for up keep. I use mine every 5 to 10 days. Five if I am using flip flops out doors.  I bought mine about 3 months back in the winter and since I was always wearing socks, it was only 10 days between uses. My feet are so smooth now. Even my husband has been using it for his feet and he loves it.  It is so nice not having our heels scratch each other or snag on the blankets. Be sure to follow up with a nice soak in epsom salt and then lotion it up with your favorite foot lotion.</li>
    <li> This thing is so over-hyped.  The initial roll lost its abrasiveness after one session.  Foolishly, I went and bought the nineteen dollar replacement rolls.  They work, but it says right on the package that each roll only lasts for a few &amp;#34;sessions.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s a very expensive, and very time-consuming, foot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing-- this is more of a buffer than any kind of smoother or callus remover.  It takes a very, very long time to remove even a little dried skin.  I could easily spend 30 minutes trying to remove dry skin from just one foot with how slowly this &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; tool works, and by then the roll would be useless.  I got frustrated at one point and brought out my old pumice stone, and wow did I feel foolish-- the cheap pumice stone did a much better job in a fraction of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it&#x27;s helpful for getting into smaller areas-- dry skin around nails, and dry skin under toes-- but for everything else a simple pumice stone works about a thousand times better than the emjoi, and it won&#x27;t cost you ten dollars for each replacement roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when there was a trend for those silly, weak little gadgets that removed sweater lint?  That&#x27;s what this emjoi reminds me of.  It&#x27;s weak, it&#x27;s pricey, and when you&#x27;re sitting around for 15 minutes trying to soften up your heels (when a pumice stone could do the job in about 30 seconds), you start to feel pretty foolish for believing the hype.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little instrument that fits nicely in the hand to smooth away summer roughness.  It really works, and gets rid of those ruff edges that tear hosiery.</li>
    <li> Affordable and efffective tool and I am very grateful</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has really bad callus build up, really bad, on his feet and this just eats through it. I was so impressed, which I was not expecting to be because most beauty tools like these don&#x27;t work. Because his feet are as bad as they are the grit was worn out in about 2-3 uses and so were the batteries. They sent a coupon for replacement grit and they have different courses so I bought more worked even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works best with good batteries other wise once it starts to die it just doesnt do anything for your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Other con is that it doesn&#x27;t have a dust catcher, since his feet are so bad we had piles of foot dust all over the floor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda bulky and sometimes awkward to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> Saw, used, and loved my daughter&#x27;s, love this one as well although a little clumsier to hold than the older version-works well!</li>
    <li> This device is a miracle worker. And saves me a trip to the salon. Me and my coworkers were just talking about this because they have one also. It&#x27;s amazing. And really sands down those dry cracked callouses and feet. I love that its hand-held and requires no hard maual labor on my part but to merely move it around on my foot. Which was instantly smoother when I finished. I&#x27;m a barefoot gal so my feet get really dry and build up of deadskin. This machine just shaves it away safely and without worry about getting scrapped too close. A must have if you don&#x27;t have time to spend lost of money and time in a salon.</li>
    <li> Mine lasted about 3 months. Eventually it stopped spinning all together, even when I replaced the grind wheel. Worked great initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried changing to several new batteries. It would spin for a few seconds, then stop all together.</li>
    <li> I love this!  After spending weeks in the hospital my feet were dry and awful.  This product solve that problem in one time of using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a popular manual product for years, but have been less and less satisfied with its results. This is simple and quick to use, and the results are far better!</li>
    <li> This works well on my feet.  I use it on my corns on the side of my little toe and my under foot callous.  Is gentle, yet effective.  I no longer depend on the pedicurist to do a good job on my calluses and corns because I can do it myself/even better!  I recommend that you buy the replacement rolls for the device.  I&#x27;m glad I did that.</li>
    <li> This will get your feet ready for sandals without the worry of whose feet were in a foot whirlpool before yours!  Have a towel ready under your feet because the amount of skin it removes...painlessly, is crazy.</li>
    <li> Excellent! The skin becomes soft and free of calluses and the usage is very simple and secure. And have a nice look.</li>
    <li> A nurse friend told me that she purchased this item and I know that she would know a good product. I really like it and it works so comfortably. Yes I would and will recommend it to other potential customers. Just wish it came with one extra roll for the price.</li>
    <li> Takes a little time, but works great and way cheaper than going to the salon. I soak my feet before use and it seems to help it go a little faster. I&#x27;ve used it three times and the roller still has life to it; my feet were not extremely callused though.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly.  Save money at the pedicure place.  You feel like you have new feet.</li>
    <li> Not very good just touch your foot it stops. Not a good thing don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, works so much better than any other pumice stone or callus removers.  I ordered the Unisex Tough Calluses refill at the same time just in case.  The blue one that comes with it works well, but for tougher spots the silver tough refill works incredible.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> This works well to smooth out my calluses and heels. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> All I can say is Emjoi, WHERE have you been all my life?!?! Why didn&#x27;t I find you 20 years ago? I have used this only twice and have already recouped what it cost in time and effort savings! I will be purchasing the manicure kit, as well, now that I see how well this works! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING tool.  So glad I saw it on the Wendy Williams Show!  I immediately purchased the most coarse refills offered.  My feet are softer than can be expected during the Summer months of open-toe and nearly bare shoe designs (which expose and dry the soles).</li>
    <li> I was too, but don&#x27;t hesitate.  It&#x27;s totally worth it.  My feet get so calloused from wearing open toed shoes. This just takes care of it in a snap.  The only drawback is the roller seems to wear out fast..</li>
    <li> Not really powerful enough to get the really tough callouses.  The batteries run out very fast usually after one use.</li>
    <li> This device is easy to use and gets the job done! I strongly recommend it for anyone who likes smooth feet.</li>
    <li> I walk a lot.  I used have these hour-long sessions just working on my feet: filing and smoothing away that hard, dead skin and then massaging in healing ointments and creams.  And still couldn&#x27;t smooth all of the hardened areas.  I used to have to pay extra (in time and money) at the salon for callus removal treatments.  And then would tip extra because I had worked my technician so darned hard. THAT DOESN&#x27;T HAPPEN ANYMORE!  I&#x27;m FREE!  The first-time use of the Emjoi didn&#x27;t take nearly as long as with the foot file and it was much more thorough.  Now it only takes me a few minutes, once or twice a week, to maintain my now soft, smooth feet.  And the skin on my feet looks better, healthier.  The Emjoi combined with my extra coarse rollers is one of the best investments ever for my foot health.  Oh, almost forgot to share:  I&#x27;d noticed a slight odor with the hard skin.  THAT&#x27;S GONE, TOO!</li>
    <li> An excellent purchase, and very well received.  Products functions exactly as described, and seller extremely prompt with shipping, and careful in packaging.</li>
    <li> Love it!  So much quicker and easier than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as expected.</li>
    <li> Works well but the shape is a little awkward to use. I wish I&#x27;d purchased a more open model.</li>
    <li> Works great. No more killing your arm muscles with the pedi-egg. This does all the work for you, and your feet look great. I have used a lot of things for my calluses, and this is the best-by far.</li>
    <li> It is alright but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with this product. It does get rid of some dead skin but not as much as I&#x27;d like. The roller is not fully exposed so you can only hold it one way on your foot.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the favorable reviews.  Powerful?  no it is not.  Not sure what everyone else is basing their review on, but this thing is sub par.  Should have been about 8 dollars.  What a disappointment.  Sanding disk spins very slowly. I don&#x27;t really have that much dead skin so it should have worked wonders.  You would be better off just using a piece of sand paper,</li>
    <li> This thing work! my feet were a disaster and this thing has smoothed the soles of my feet so nicely!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Emjoi device for my wife who was having trouble finding the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s sander she&#x27;d been using. She loves this sander and was amazed at how quickly it gets down to tender skin, don&#x27;t push too hard! Much easier to use than the old file type sanders, we&#x27;ve already ordered some replacement rolls.</li>
    <li> I spent $200 on the new Clarisonic Pedicure tool; I took it back two weeks after purchase.  I simply don&#x27;t have the time or energy to use the tool on my feet every day and the accompanying products are ricidulously expensive.  The PedEgg really worked better, in my opinion.  However, this little machine is best by far.  Great price and automates the exfoliation so it&#x27;s more effective than a PedEgg.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have used so far. It is easy to hold and maneuver. Removes calluses easily.</li>
    <li> This new Powerful Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover is every bit as good as a professional pedicure!  I was totally amazed at the way my feet and toes felt after just one application. This product is great!</li>
    <li> Great buy.... Very impressed by this product allows my feet to always feel silky smooth</li>
    <li> Love this! Saves me money by doing my own feet painlessly and without the fear of fungus</li>
    <li> This tool is fantastic. It keeps my feet looking great! I have recommended this product to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for years for a solution to dry cracked heels and elbows. This is it!!! Easy to store, easy to use. Works great. I ordered refils at the same time but haven&#x27;t used one yet because it continues to remove dry skin effectively. Ladies, I go barefoot 9 months of the year in the house, so I&#x27;m telling you my feet were BAD! This is the answer I was searching for.</li>
    <li> When I first received this, it seemed awfully small to me, but it&#x27;s very easy to hold and maneuver.  It comes loaded with a roller, I&#x27;d say it was probably medium grade (no batteries included).  I also purchased 4 &amp;#34;extra course&amp;#34; rollers which came from another vendor, but arrived on the same day.  After trying the original roller and being amazed by the results, I switched to the course one.  Wow, it&#x27;s amazing how much old dry skin this thing removes, and leaves your feet nice and soft with no rough spots.  I was immediately impressed.  I put coconut oil on my polished feet before going to bed last night (with socks), and then pure shea butter this morning.  I&#x27;m ready for my beach vacation next week!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the performance of product. Read the reviews and was hopeful this would be the answer to eliminating the hard skin on my heels but it has only made a minor impact. The roller doesn&#x27;t last long at all and the unit did not come with any extra :(&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why people who seemingly have harder skin than mine on their heels gave it good reviews.</li>
    <li> Works great I use it for my gel nails at home it works better then the $$ drills and works wonders on the feet</li>
    <li> Quick pumice over my feet and I am sandal weather ready!  never know when you are going to wear a skimpy strappy standal!</li>
    <li> that is a really good machine&lt;br /&gt;i love it , it works so well&lt;br /&gt;i used it every week for months now</li>
    <li> My feet are so smooth and silky!  The hubby is impressed, too.  I am very pleased with my purchase, so I bought one for my mom and sister, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three or four times but I already feel the difference. My feet feel softer and ready for summer beach &amp; sandal weather.</li>
    <li> Can I give this TEN stars?  What a great product!  Quiet, easy to use, really shaves away at the calluses.  After trying so many pumice stones, metal shavers that I was afraid to use, pumice creams, emery boards and lotions that did very little if anything for the calluses I was  pleasantly over-joyed when I used this</li>
    <li> I have rough heels due to the fact I wear sandals all the time. Have pedicures once a month and &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; my heels. Nothing worked until along came the Emjoi Micro Pedi Callus Remover. OMG. It is super and my heels have never felt better. They still need work but what a difference. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is awesome, so much so that I wrote a blog post about it! Ya gotta get one to believe it!</li>
    <li> There is nothing this can do that you cannot do with an emory board.  It is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband has diabetes and has to take very good care of his feet. I got this so he could reduce his callouses and it works very well. He has sensitive feet and this is so smooth that he didn&#x27;t flinch when I worked on the soles of his feet and his toes. He feet are very smooth now and the cracks are gone. I would highly recommend this to anyone but especially to those who have sensitive feet.</li>
    <li> This is great for your foot dry calluses. So good we have two - one for my wife( the new one) and one for me. Would recommend getting the extra coarse blade if your foot&#x27;s callus is rough. This is our second hand held device - works as good as th3 original.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE return policy!  Product is not effective unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regularly get a pedicure monthly so my feet tend to be in OK condition.  I bought this emjoi for maintenance purposes for my feet.  However, it is very ineffective.  It is not very powerful and shaves very little of the skin at all because it is not strong enough.  And after my first usage, the roller already showed lots of wear down in that the blue started to come off the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am dissatisfied with the results of this product so I looked to return it for a refund.  Although the website claims Complete Satisfaction under the return policy, Shavenow.com will NOT accept any used products.  How would I know if it works well if I don&#x27;t use it first?!!</li>
    <li> Lasted about 2 good uses, then needed to replace head.  Will have to buy additional heads to continue being effective</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  This is my 2nd one!  My first one still works great, I just wanted to try this more powerful model!  Emjoi makes quality products!  I have an epilator from 1998 that still works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great Product and it does what it says!</li>
    <li> Works really nice very happy with product</li>
    <li> Work fine for the rough stuff but can&#x27;t bring your feet to a nice smooth finish. No roller options will do this either. Plus, it&#x27;s a tad too small since there are sides to the rollers</li>
    <li> Love this Micro-Pedi.  Powerful enough to go through my extremely rough dry feet. I highly recommend this to anyone.  I&#x27;ve been using a pumice stone, soaking my feet, even bought a special foot cream. Nothing worked until I bought this. My feet were so dry I actually stepped on a small nail and it did not penetrate my foot. After using this machine that nail would go straight through my soft skin.</li>
    <li> Got another for my husband--fantastic value for half the price of what I see in local stores.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this. Love it, love it - it gently clears off even the worst callouses better than any pedicure I&#x27;ve had.  I find it works best on dry skin, so no need to soak your feet first.  After you buff your feet, try slathering on a good foot moisturizer &amp; put on a pair of cotton socks to let it absorb.  Like baby feet!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and used it on my son who is very much into sports. the bottom of his feet has some nasty looking calluses on them. it takes a bit of time but I cleaned both feet and they weren&#x27;t even sore the next day, he said. I washed off the wheel afterwards so it&#x27;s ready the next time he comes home from college. it&#x27;s a good product and I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I am athletic and have callouses that can be uncomfortable and not attractive, especially with sandals.  This tool removes the dead dry skin easily.&lt;br /&gt;My friend has one that came with a refill and batteries for the same price.  A bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me.  I am delighted with it so far.  It is so much easier than using a manual file or buffing pad and the product is easy to hold and maneuver.  I am wearing sandals to a formal event next month and my feet can now look their best for the occasion.  Be sure to read the instructions and follow them.  It does take a little time to do it, but it is very easy!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review but I just had to write this one.  I have tried everything for my feet - my skin is super dry and my heels&lt;br /&gt;are always so cracked.  This arrived today and with my first use I see an incredible improvement and the dry cracks are gone.  I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have to use it a couple of times but it does work!</li>
    <li> Liked it until it broke. Only lasted two months. Definitely a disappointment.</li>
    <li> The motor stopped when it touched my heal. Probably says more about my heal than the product but none the less, this product is not for people with severe cracked heals/calluses. I did buy the Amopee product from my local Walgreens... That thing is a beast!</li>
    <li> This callus remover works pretty well, however, If you feet have very bad calluses this will smooth them but it cannot penetrate deep down. Unfortunately, I have cracks on my feet so this remover smooths my feet but doesn&#x27;t help this problem.  If you have just rough feet then this will work good for you.</li>
    <li> Did not receive nano. Full size micro pedi arrived</li>
    <li> This thing is super at buffing off those nasty foot barnacles. I had one of those emery board type things on a stick, but when you hit fresh skin with that thing, you know it! This doesn&#x27;t hurt in the slightest. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This works fairly well if used to maintain soft feet and prevent rough spots from turning into calluses. If feet have tough calluses, this just isn&#x27;t strong enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this little gadget, saves on elbow grease and sweat. I would like it to have other grades of sandpaper though as there are callouses on my feet that defy even multiple uses with this. A coarser grade of grit would be good.</li>
    <li> Small , compact and handy tool that can save you lots of time and the motor is powerful enough for extended usage(more than 20 minutes) The easiest way to clean the roller is by using canned air duster while the unit is on/when roller is spinning/.Just move the air nozzle left and right 2-3 times from a close distance and you&#x27;re done with the cleaning process. Of course you do this outdoor :) Great buy ! One star off because these is no storage case to protect the glossy easy  scratchable surface. It would cost less than $1 to the Manufacturer to include this useful accessory.</li>
    <li> I used it to remove a large callus on the below my big toe toward the side of my foot and discovered that a small bunion on that foot which the callus was hiding. Such an odd thing to discover. Other then that it did the job well and quick.</li>
    <li> The roller on the Emjoi foot sander is so weakly-powered that anything more than the slightest pressure causes the speed to drop dramatically and renders the entire device essentially useless. Other reviews recommended using &amp;#34;light pressure&amp;#34; while you operate it; however, if you have anything more than the barest of calluses, it will take AGES for you to make any noticeable progress. I originally bought one to replace a foot file I&#x27;d been using, but after several attempts at using the Emjoi, I went back to using the foot file. Essentially, it&#x27;s a toss-up between a little elbow grease to remove calluses or spending roughly an hour in each spot to get anything done. Honestly, I can&#x27;t see why anyone would think this product is good. You&#x27;re better off with something, literally anything, else. The only upside I could see was the price; I only wasted $25 on the thing.</li>
    <li> It does the job!!  Easy to use and comfortable to hold.  Great price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent product......  just what I wanted it to do...it cleared the skin off my bad spots.... really have enjoyed it.mm</li>
    <li> My husband says this works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little callus off at a time. You can&#x27;t press very hard or it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for those who have callused heels/feet.</li>
    <li> This works so well! My feet were so bad but this with the extreme coarse rollers made my feet sooo smooth. Loving it. Love that you can buy different rollers depending on the level of need my feet need too.</li>
    <li> I love this product but prefer the plug in one because this one uses too many batteries as I&#x27;m using it a lot.</li>
    <li> This thing works great!  It is easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to contort into a million different positions in the shower using a pumice stone.  I thought it was probably just another gimmick and wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough to really work on calluses, but it does.  I have used pumice stones with very little effect and I&#x27;ve cut myself on callus shavers countless times.  This was easy, safe and well worth the money that I would spend on a single pedicure.  One improvement would be to have some sort of collection bin for the &amp;#34;foot dust&amp;#34; for a lack of a better word (like my electric shaver has for hair).</li>
    <li> Works as it says. Bought for my husband and he is really likes it.</li>
    <li> Excellent, it really works!!! Better than any other!!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this micor-pedi.  It works great!  I even bought a second one for my Mom!  I received it sooner than I was promised, with no problems!  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am disabled and it is almost impossible for me to have a pedicure.  When summer comes I don&#x27;t want to have to hide my feet in tennis shoes.  I thought I would give this a try and I was amazed that a product actually did what it actually claimed.  This is so easy to use and it will not damage your skin at all.  My feet feel wonderful and look great.  On goes the nail polish and my sandals.  Now I am ready for summer.  Oh also had this for several months and I am just buying my first replacement bar just to have on hand.</li>
    <li> This is not a very powerful device at all and you have to buy extra roller balls, that are not included.</li>
    <li> Abrasive roller fell apart after second use.</li>
    <li> So easy to use and it works great! Highly recommended for anyone hoping to find a product to use between pedicures. I won&#x27;t have to go as often for a pedicure, now that I have this product.</li>
    <li> It does a great job over the hand held scrapers &amp; blades I&#x27;ve tried in the past and is really convenient</li>
    <li> This little callous remover works great on its own terms, but they don&#x27;t make rollers coarse enough to tackle my callouses.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but I felt like I had to for this product.  I just received this micro-pedi callus remover today.  I inserted the batteries and tried it out.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so great.  Within seconds (really seconds) my heels and big toes looked like never before.  I could literally see the calluses being removed.  I am so excited that I ordered this product and had to tell everyone.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Works great on my dry skin</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, great value for the time I save alone.&lt;br /&gt;Already bought the refills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important to follow directions do not over do this is a powerful little machine&lt;br /&gt;and you don&#x27;t want to go to deep all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important I am done in a few minutes...and my feel look and feel wonderful</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever. Its exactly what it claims to be. Would definitely recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have the original (longer) version of this and to me, it &amp;#34;holds&amp;#34; better.  Both are great at removing callus, however.</li>
    <li> This works as it says it does and my feet have never felt so smooth. They usually have very hard callouses. Not anymore.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with Powerful Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover. It is small and convenient to use. Be careful that you don&#x27;t remove too much callus.</li>
    <li> The only reason I have ever gotten pedicures was rough feet but I&#x27;ve always been concerned about the soaking baths being unsanitary. I will never have to do that again! This works great!</li>
    <li> Bought these about 10 days ago and this callus remover works better than expected.  Compared to the price of the more expensive ones, I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone wouldn&#x27;t choose this product.  One thing I&#x27;d recommend is the ability to recharge the batteries.</li>
    <li> Now when i say you will get one good use out of every roller that&#x27;s what you get.If you have really really crack heels this is not for you. If you have ruff feet depending on how ruff it MAYBE FOR YOU. It wasn&#x27;t for me i use it once and could not tell any different .DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Works well for a small product.</li>
    <li> The item you will receive it not as pictured and definitely not as advertised.  It is not very powerful and the insert only lasts for a short while.  If you are purchasing this make sure you get at least a dozen refills so you will be able to utilize the product for at least a few months.  Please remember you will not be able to return this product so buyer beware.</li>
    <li> OK, I am never the one to fall for something I see on TV, but I figured I&#x27;d order this and return it if it turned out to be a gimmick.  It also helped that I had a gift card so zero risk either way.  Wow! This thing actually works! My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in years.  I didn&#x27;t have those ugly calluses that are always shown on ads for stuff like this, so not sure how it&#x27;ll work on those, but it totally removes the average dead skin layer that I assume most people have.  The only complaint I&#x27;ve seen so far is how expensive the rollers are, but I really don&#x27;t think you need to replace them that often. Once that dead skin layer is gone, I assume it&#x27;ll take months before it comes back.  The roller also seems pretty sturdy, so I&#x27;m not really going to worry about the roller cost at this point.  Just enjoy my new baby and sandal-ready feet.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 different models of this type of gadget and between the 2 the long slender handled one is easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;This one works fine otherwise, so it&#x27;s just the shape that is less easy to hold on to. Otherwise it makes smooth feet&lt;br /&gt;very quick work.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that this would be more effective for dry skin, cracked heels.  It works ok.  Maybe it will improve with long-term use.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love Emjoi Micro Pedi! Its nothing sort of miracle, and so easy to use! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great price. Easy to use. Took a bit to get used to but it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> It works.  Use it along with a moisturizer and you will see a difference.  Use it regularly, just not every day and you should be happy.  Don&#x27;t press too hard, just let it do it&#x27;s thing when it hits your skin.  Small enough to fit into a medicine cabinet and a travel kit.</li>
    <li> i should have taken a before picture but i was too grossed out buy my scruffy feet... i thought i give it a try and oh gosh.. this is the BEST!!! it was really easy to use and most important thing it didn&#x27;t hurt!! i got all the dead skin sanded off and now they are nice and smooth.. i couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference this makes. its really amazing and you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Basically sands off your dry skin. I would not recommend to a friend. Not worth it. Replacements are pricey</li>
    <li> I was really excited to buy this product. After reading the reviews (most of them &amp;#34;passing&amp;#34;) I decided to give it a try. I am one that schedules a regular pedicure appt. due to being in the hospitality industry, I am constantly on my feet. I bought this to use in between my appoinments. As soon as I received it, I used it and...nothing!. In the next couple of weeks after, I missed my scheduled pedicure appt and decided to give the Emjoi a try again. And again...nothing! I even used it on my husband&#x27;s feet (who I have since convinced to pay a visit to a professional pedicurist) and...nothing. So by now you should see that the operative word here is...nothing!!!. Very disappointed that I wasted my time and money.</li>
    <li> This product is surprisingly effective. It simple does what it&#x27;s meant to. Powerful yet gentle and really easy.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad part is the mess we do while using it, but honestly it&#x27;s the healthiest and most effective ways I&#x27;ve found to keep my feet smooth. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with dry cracking heels for years. I get pedicures every two weeks not for the fun of it but because my feet will crack and bleed and it&#x27;s very painful. My technician actually would use a Dremel file on my heels. When I received my Emjoi I immediately opened and used it. I was SHOCKED. My heels are baby smooth when I&#x27;m done. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
    <li> Actually the prior version of this product was more user friendly - the longer handle allowed better maneuverability. The roller on the updated model seems smaller and thinner somehow. I won&#x27;t return it but I am not so happy with it either.</li>
    <li> Does what it says and what I was expecting: smoothing out calluses.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe it works so well....grind grind grind and you will have smooth feet... I love it!  Thanks people for thinking of it</li>
    <li> Works good, not great.  Should be more powerful.</li>
    <li> Very compact, quick shipping.  But the  rollers themselves do not work very well</li>
    <li> Batteries run down quickly. Save yourself the trouble and purchase the corded one</li>
    <li> Not much power, better after a pedi to keep your feet smooth</li>
    <li> This is a great product for removing dry skin from your feet (also works on elbows)  It&#x27;s very gentle and quickly removes the dry skin.  This new version is ergonomic and easier to handle than the original.  Doesn&#x27;t cut or make the skin raw like other products.  It&#x27;s so effective that I find I only have to use it once a month if I use a good cream after application and nightly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> One of the best things I have ever bought.  My feet are lovin&#x27; it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product that was battery operated and wished I ordered the electric one because it seems like if you push it down on your foot it just stops, I think if it was electric it would be more powerful.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase; works wonderfully</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT LOVE EMJOI</li>
    <li> Great for in between  maintainance to nail salon for pedi care</li>
    <li> To be honest, I was expecting the Nano to be more &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; than it is...BUT.... IT WORKS GREAT!  I have been using the PedEgg for several years, and it takes lot more time than the Nano and doesn&#x27;t have nearly as good  results.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> different from the pictures, useless:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. It works great</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and worked as expected. My Mom had purchased the older model and when my sister and I used it we had to have one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great. I did buy extra rollers but my first roller has lasted a while.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best items i have purchase it works really great in mins every thing is smooth nice.</li>
    <li> I wear flip-flops almost year round &amp; in my dry climate my feet really suffer.  This is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried to remove calluses &amp; smooth my feet.  BUT, that said, I like the original model better; I find it easier to hold &amp; use.</li>
    <li> It does a wonderful job. Just wish it came with additional rollers.  I only wish I had purchased the electric version so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I could be a spokes person for it.  Truly works and is gentle.  I purchased 4 more for my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This product is sbsolutely amazing. No more pedicures for me.  My feet are so soft and smooth after one use. I highly recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this product 10 years ago!  It gently exfoliates my heels and I was amazed at how much dead skin came off!  I use it every week and now I have nice soft heels.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was not sure about this item. Once I used it, I was hooked. My heels have never been smoother.&lt;br /&gt;It works beautifully. My feet are not callused just dry heels, average feet.&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers said that it stops if you push hard. It does. It is a safety feature. I like this feature. The Emjoi works fine without pushing down on it.&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with the Emjoi.</li>
    <li> Sure liked the way this little machine worked.  It clears off all the dead skin on your heels and makes them like baby skin.  It was delightful experience. Now everyone in my family wants their own.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi is a wonderful device, my heals have never looked this good. It is easy, can be done in your own private home, no need to go for a pedicare, which saves tons of money.  The rollers are different courseness to adapt to what you may need. I would definitely recommend this and buy it again when mine wears out!</li>
    <li> For the folks out there that have really calloused feet, this product is for you. I use Baby Foot, I go to the salon about every 6-8 weeks but yet I still need to keep my heels in check. This product gently but effectively removes my hardened heel calloused skin. Its the perfect in between treatment tool for me.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this based on other reviews.  It took a long time to remove very little dry skin.  It was very ineffective. It is not very powerful and shaves very little of the skin at all because it is not strong enough.  Save your money.  Buy a very fine sandpaper from the hardware store and you will get better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only begun using Micro-Pedi but so far I am very please with it.  I don&#x27;t think it works quite as well as a spinning pumice stone that I have on another epilator, but the stone is small and I fear I will wear it out using it on my feet.  The&lt;br /&gt;size and availability of replacement rollers give this callus remover a great advantage.  I am looking forward to trying some different rollers with coarser and finer surfaces.  Being able to switch from removal of callus to buffing for smoothness will give me more of a professional pedicure feel.</li>
    <li> I am not normally a person that would try something like this but glad I did.  It works really well and not my feet feel so smooth.  It is easy to use and takes a light touch.  I will recommend this to my gal pals.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT! Best Pedi tool I have  ever owned!</li>
    <li> After only ONE use, my feet feel soooo soft!! You can trust that if it works for me, it&#x27;ll work for most. Why? I have an ongoing very day battle of callouses on my feet, regardless of any shoe or sneaker I wear. I use to use a nail file!! But that took forever and NEVER worked as good as this. I&#x27;m ecstatic! I even used it on my hands too!  Item shown that I&#x27;ve purchased only looks different. The one I was send it thinner. Not a big deal!  There&#x27;s nothing like feeling your feet. Meaning, I&#x27;m really enjoying walking barefoot now! You&#x27;ll only wish you got it sooner!</li>
    <li> At first, I was underwhelmed. I&#x27;ve made a bad habit of walking around barefoot much of the time (even outside), and that pretty much turned my feet into hobbit feet. This thing didn&#x27;t really seem to make much of a difference until I bought the Xtreme Coarse rollers and stuck in a pair of fresh batteries. Now I can&#x27;t believe the difference. My feet have never been this smooth. Truly awesome little gadget. Better results than I dared hope.</li>
    <li> Very nice and handy piece of equipment. Works wonderful and easy to change cartridge. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> is about 1 1/2 years old, and I found it&#x27;s terrific!!!  I&#x27;m at an age that cracks appear on my heels for seemingly no reason.  And after years of pedicures, and still having problems, I bought one, and it&#x27;s the best solution my manicurist has every seen!  As far as the rollers are concerned, I have a specific toothbrush I use to clean them.  It does a good job, and it&#x27;s a cheap solution to it being clogged with dead skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, but should have invested in a corded model for better power.</li>
    <li> It stuff Works!  I have really very bad and thick callus as in it hurt when I walk. My feet was really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the regular rollers for under my feet and then changed to the extreme coarse (you need to buy this separately) on my hard callus. And my feet was so beautiful and smooth and it no longer hurts when I walk. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal pedicure tool.  I have very calloused feet and cracked/dry heels, and this product took care of the problem in a fraction of the time that it took with the PedEgg. Much more efficient and effective.  It now takes a total of about 20 min to take care of both of my feet - callouses and heels. This will make great stocking stuffers for my sisters this year!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my mom and I love it.</li>
    <li> I have horrible ( i mean so bad the people who do my manicure cringe!)  thick callused heels from being a nurse and being on my feet for long periods of time. I usually go and get a pedicure to help soften these. Well no more! This thing has saved me money in the long run! I got the coarse roller and within 5 minutes all of the calluses were gone and my heels were as soft as a babies butt!  Best micro pedi EVER! I will never buy another item!</li>
    <li> My wife had gotten the reg size, I thought this would be nice since it was smaller. But it is not even close to the power of the regular size. Buy the regular size, you&#x27;ll be much happier with it.</li>
    <li> Best.Product.Ever! I mean, this item tops EVERY foot care product I have EVER used. Even my sister&#x27;s feet, which are known for having some tough skin layers have become baby soft with this tool. I LOVE Emjoi Mirco-Pedi Nano!</li>
    <li> It works well.  It seems well built.... Used it for a week now.  It is like little rotating sandpaper for your calluses (heels in my case).  Does produce copius amounts of callus &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;. Have tried other product like heel sanders, heel shavers, pedi-egg.  This is the best by far.  I think the only drawback I can think of is I am going to go thru a lot of batteries.  This is very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t bought replacement rollers yet - not sure how expensive will be to maintain</li>
    <li> Works as intended. My feet feel better after using Emjoi. Thanks</li>
    <li> Tis item does not work, I have pretty bad dead skin and my feet are the same even after I used it.</li>
    <li> It works ok, but seems to loose juice as it goes.  I debated buying this one over the corded one, should have went with the corded.  Not a bad overall product, but would not buy the battery version again.</li>
    <li> I have used both shapes and still can&#x27;t decide which one I like best  they both are the same at what they do</li>
    <li> My heels are a nightmare and we have cut back on money so pedicures are out of the question for now. This tool makes it very easy to keep my heels smooth with very little work.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that within seconds my heels were baby soft. Definitely recommend it, especially for sandal weather. Great product!</li>
    <li> This item does everything that it is supposed to do and is exactly as advertised.  I love it and use it often.</li>
    <li> It works great the first couple times, but if you have serious callous issues you are going to go through the rollers very quickly and they aren&#x27;t cheap. I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased. It will be one of those items that I leave laying around for a year before I finally toss it out. I don&#x27;t want to spend good money after bad, buying more rollers. I have a $2 large callous scraper that I got a Target that works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love this little callus remover.  It&#x27;s powerful, easy to handle, gets the job done quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mother and she cannot stop raving about it.  She said it is the best tool for smooth feet that she has ever used.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best thing I have ever used to take care of dry heels.  It takes care of having to spend the money on a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I own the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Pro Rechargeable Callus Remover and love it.  Although it works just like the one I owned, I purchased this one because it is smaller and more light weight and if perfect for vacation.</li>
    <li> This works fine. Not as good as I would have hoped.  The batteries run down too quickly to stay strong enough to take care of the dry areas on my feet. It is a nice size for traveling, just make sure you take extra batteries with you. The rollers seem to last even though I bought extra replacements just in case. The rollers that come with this unit are a bit too fine and would suggest a rougher textured roller to smooth the feet faster.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well, takes forever to smooth down a callus with the roughest roller.</li>
    <li> I just got my micro-pedi and it works like it said it would ! my feet have never felt so smooth!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS.  I HAD  VERY BAD  HEELS AND A NASTY LOOKING SIDE OF THE BIG TOE.  THIS MACHINE  MADE MY FEET  SO GOOD LOOKING. MY FEET FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> I would have thought this would be a little bigger. Not so comfortable to use, and really not so great due to the size&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend it if you have big feet.</li>
    <li> I had one of the older versions and I really liked it. I thought this new one might not be as good. I was mistaken. It is just as good and it really works like they say. By the way the old one was still good. I gave it to my sister when she came home. She had a pretty rough place on her foot and couldnt wear some of her shoes. After using it a few time she was wearing her shoes again. Powerful product.</li>
    <li> The back of this comes up a bit high-so you cannot use from either direction--the roller is only accessible via the front like shown in the pic.  It fits comfortably in the hand and isn&#x27;t very loud at all.</li>
    <li> This really did save me paying extra when getting a pedicure!  However after a few uses, seems I may need to be replacing the roller.  But am satisfied but giving it less than 5 stars as it should come with replacement rollers.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool for removing callus on your feet.  I&#x27;d go back and buy a &#x27;bundle&#x27; with a few replacement rollers if I had it to do over again, because they were offered at a discount at the time of purchase.  Other than that, it is a great little tool!</li>
    <li> A girlfriend got these for her husband and all of her kids as Christmas gifts.  I ordered one and can hardly keep it out of my husband&#x27;s hands, he loves it as much as I do.  Baby smooth resutlts.</li>
    <li> reallylove it it removes my callus on my feet would recommend it for anyone who has calluses on their feet</li>
    <li> This actually works better than other reviews I&#x27;ve read said it would. Maybe they just had bad batteries in it, because mine hasn&#x27;t had any troubles. I have used it a lot on both my husbands feet and my own with no problem. All the extra rollers I&#x27;ve bought for it have fit perfectly. Overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have problems with calluses on my feet. Particularly  on my heels. A friend told me about this device and I decided to try it. It works quite well. It will remove all of your calluses in one usage,  but will drastically reduce them in a couple of days. Not extremely powerful, but is powerful enough to get the job done. You will have to order extra refills because they wear out quickly. Also, be sure to put lotion on your feet after using it.</li>
    <li> The product did exactly what it says it will do, which was a nice surprise. I only wished the roller was a little bigger so it could cover larger areas at a time.</li>
    <li> This thing does not turn off unless you remove the battery. PLUS it does not really do what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This device helps to keep your feet smooth by removing rough skin and callused areas.  It is gentle and keeps skin smooth.  Easy to use and does not cause damage.</li>
    <li> I was wary of buying this product since I had seen it in a TV infomercial.  However, I was persuaded by the reviews I read on Amazon.  Now I am very delighted that it did work.  I would have given the product 5 stars but for the following negative comments. (1)  The cleaning instructions say use a brush to brush away the &#x27;shaved&#x27; skin on the roller but no brush is provided with the unit.  (2)  Also, the roller cannot be washed so a little more thought  needs to be put into the invention for improvement.  I would have liked to at least clean the unit and the roller with some rubbing alcohol and in addition I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hygienic to share the unit with my husband.  I suppose this arrangement is good for the manufacturers in that you need to buy more rollers / units to serve the family.  However, point (1) ref hygiene remains pertinent even for one individual.</li>
    <li> I love it.. It just runs on ur skin and removes all the clauses .. Function is very good .. However I wish it wouldn&#x27;t take too long to do .. But it doesn&#x27;t pain ur hand with a normal stick one so that&#x27;s a good point .. So if u got a lot of time in your hands u wud want this handy piece to do ur job for u or if ur in a hurry use the stick conventional one</li>
    <li> I had chapped feet, not horrible, but no matter how many pedicures and special creme treatments they would still feel rough. This cream plus the &amp;#34;ProLinc Dry Heel Eliminator&amp;#34; cream have completely reversed the process. I no longer need to dread pulling off socks or panty hose and have hose rough snaggy skin on my heels.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself. bought 4 more for my daughters. They love it and are buying them for their friends and sisters!</li>
    <li> Purchased another brand which was so wimpy compared to the Emjoi.  Now I can keep my feet smooth &amp; flake free.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  It works wonderfully.  Perfect to keep up GREAT looking feet between pedicures.  Easy to use with instant results.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is totally useless, cheaply made, a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the motor they say is powerful is not - it&#x27;s totally weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say you need to replace rollers after a few treatments - well not only are over-priced, but then they try to \\&quot;enroll\\&quot; you in their \\&quot;club\\&quot; so you end up having to spend and spend on these cheap little blue rollers which are only good for a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire thing is a rip-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending $25 on this device, to have to replace rollers so often for nearly 20 dollars per pair, it&#x27;s just obnoxious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning it immediately.</li>
    <li> and it truly does a great job! I can keep my feet looking smooth and soft, and it is so easy to use! A great buy!</li>
    <li> received quick and is what is advertized.  wife loves it</li>
    <li> This really works! Dead skin just falls off in a jiffy. It is easy to use as long as you hold it at the right angle for your foot. I am so impressed by it that I bought one for my daughter who has terrible dry skin on her feet. She loves it, too!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t as enamored with it as most of the users.  It didn&#x27;t make my feet baby soft.  But it&#x27;s a good, decent product.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> TAKES FOREVER TO SMOOTH MY FEET.&lt;br /&gt;VERY DUSTY. VERY MESSY, AND BARELY WORKED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USED OTHER PRODUCTS BEFORE. THE HANDHELD ONE.&lt;br /&gt;THEY WOULD COME WITH A CONTAINER TO COLLECT THE DUST.&lt;br /&gt;THIS MACHINE DOES NOT. SO, YOU KNOW, PLEASE COVER THE FLOOR&lt;br /&gt;WHEN YOU USING IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ROLLER WORKS FOR ONE TIME. AND THEN, IT IS DULL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CAN BUY A PIECE OF SAND PAPER FROM HOME DEPOT AND DO THE SAME JOB&lt;br /&gt;FOR MUCH LESS AMOUNT OF MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FELT LIKE THREW MY MONEY INTO THE TRASH.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare with an Authentic one though this product worked fine for a month, then it stopped working, and it was not returnable anymore. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of methods to remedy my callused and cracked heels.  This works very well.  I don&#x27;t have perfect pink heels after I use it, but they are better than they have been in a long time.  The down side is that the rollers don&#x27;t last a long time and they are expensive, but it is worth it to me because I am more comfortable wearing sandals and flip flops.</li>
    <li> Although kind of small, this tool fits quite nicely in my hands and I have big hands. It&#x27;s designed ergonomically and is very maneuverable with either hand. It&#x27;s sleek, simple, and easy to use w/o a lot of buttons, gizmos, or digital stuff, and the batteries are easy to change. I love this product and use it often. It&#x27;s also great to travel with as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
    <li> In less than a minute I can smooth any roughness on my feet, and cream them and go, with no soaking my feet first. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s so well-shaped and easy to hold and use, and that it works so fast, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem of causing a friction burn or any discomfort at all.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product and thought my feet can look like that nice and smooth. So I ordered it and WOW my feet have never been this soft before. I used it once and then couple of days later did it again. I couldn&#x27;t wear sandals or go barefoot I was embarrassed how I had rough feet and cracks. Now I don&#x27;t worry and I haven&#x27;t used in for 1 1/2wks and still smooth. Also my 98 yr old mom said try it on me and did and her feet are smooth and also took alot of dead skin off her legs. Thank you for making this for people like me</li>
    <li> My mother has the original Emjoi and I was always using hers!  Decided to purchase the newer model and I am very pleased so far!  May not get the tougher calluses, but it really helps to make your feet look great for summer sandals!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Light weight with comfortable design. Definitely does a better job than any file or stone. Replacement rolls are easy to change out. No college degree required!</li>
    <li> great quality for the money</li>
    <li> Easy to use...no pain at all. The dry skin just falls off , leaving your feet silly smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> AWESOME~ ok so I have been struggling with rough feet for years.. this thing is amazing. Just be careful you don&#x27;t use it over &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; skin as it can pull it into the roller! OUCH... haha.. my fault.. but it&#x27;s great, and I would buy this again ( I ambuying hubby one for christmas) and would highly recommend it, and no I am not paid to say good things, or given stuff for free.. it&#x27;s bought and paid for ! so far so good!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I had dry, cracked skin on my heels and this took care of it in the first use.  I took off 10 years of dry skin in 10 minutes.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works great, smart design, easy to clean and seems rugged to last.  Glad it doesn&#x27;t have more grinding power; it would be too much against my skin.  It seems to do its work fast all the same.  Already seeing huge results.  Very happy with the product and my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap-o similar &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; type of callus remover - this, by far, surpasses it.  The thing to remember is &amp;#34;DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE&amp;#34; just skim it over the area.  If you&#x27;re calluses are really bad, it will take a while, probably a few minutes over a few days - or a week, but eventually you&#x27;ll see results. It&#x27;s not magic, but close enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the blue roller, which I think is too fine.  I also purchased the green coarse rollers.  I just ordered another one to give as a gift - with that one I ordered the &#x27;silver&#x27; rollers - which look like they&#x27;re the coarsest.</li>
    <li> Buyer please be aware. This i the first time i felt cheated by amazon reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever this product claims it can do. IT CAN NOT. and the company knows very well about it so they make the return policy extra difficult and ask customer to pay for the return shipping. EVEN IT IS DEFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They surely do not stand behind their product and just decided spending all their marketing $$ on creating amazon positive review would be most effective because i really find it hard to believe anyone would find this to be a good callus remover, or even dead skin remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do your self a favor and buy a pedicure sponge. it is only 3 dollars and works 1000000x times better than this.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about getting this to help with my feet. However, after using it, I realized it made my feet get rough quicker and coarser than when I used my pumice stone. It also did not clean my feet as good as the manual stone I was using prior. I did not like the feel it gave my feet afterwards. Also it is a little harsh on the feet and made it tender while and after using it for only two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with this product. Used it twice then went back to.my pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Great product! Don&#x27;t need to go to the salon again for a pedi! It is really easy to use, and in 10 minutes you are ready at the most.</li>
    <li> After first use I couldn&#x27;t imagine why I waited so long to try this product.  I have used the Ped Egg for years and suffered the occasional scrape which was painful.  The rollers allow you to safely remove calluses and leave the skin feeling silky smooth.  I plan to use once or twice a week and keep my feet looking great.</li>
    <li> Very under powered.  If you have some heavy duty calluses to get rid of this is not the item for you.  If you just need to get rid of dry skin it works well.</li>
    <li> When researching this item I wasn&#x27;t sure which model to buy but I chose this one and so far am not sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the Xtreme Coarse Rollers on my husband&#x27;s terribly calloused and cracked feet and in just one use (and a short amount of time) his feet look so much better.  After years of manual scraping and &#x27;scrubbing&#x27; with other tools, this is a real improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use according to directions, do not apply too much pressure and let it do it&#x27;s job.  No problems with it being under powered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has extreme callouses to light callouses, really it&#x27;s for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, no complaints about the seller, ShaveNow - my order even arrived 2 days earlier than promised.</li>
    <li> I wish I had saved my money! My feet are pretty rough and I thought I would use this product between pedicures. A waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t give 5 stars unless the product REALLY works. This one does. I don&#x27;t wear shoes in my house and my skyn is a little dry so the back of my feet was and I say was! very dry and ugly. I used the Emogy  callus remover and my feet look and feel smooth and soft like never before!! I don&#x27;t even have to put cream on them. I use it 2 times a week, it&#x27;s so esy, works instantly. You don&#x27;t have to get your feet wet and and wait forever to see  the old  typical callus remover work…if it works!  I am not kidding this is a great product, I bought one for my mom and another for my sis.</li>
    <li> she like it save her time doing her feet&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> WELL worth the money!!!  I have recommended it to every one I know.  After wasting money on creams and other foot products - finally found a solution to my dry - cracking feet!</li>
    <li> Just started using this callus remover, was tired of doing with a hand pumice stone., So far I have had no problem with it.  I remove the small pumice wheel and wash it and then let it set and dry until i need it again.  As the item suggesst do not bare down on it while removing callus.</li>
    <li> this thing works great!  and lasts a long time on 1 set of batteries too!  very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It makes it so easier to keep my heels smooth.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my feet again. This item is amazing.</li>
    <li> u will see the difference the first time you use...</li>
    <li> Really like the product...tho the roller already needs replaced after just a week of use.  I would still purchase the product.</li>
    <li> These are great!  needs a light touch, takes care of the problem and easy to hold in your hand.  Bought four or five for friends to have as a &amp;#34;souvenier&amp;#34; of a fun pedicure time in AZ!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I have tried so many products for my calloused feet.  This one is easy to use &amp; delivers superior results.</li>
    <li> Yes. I made a good choice. I like using it. Too bad I just found out about it. I highly recommend it to everyone who need a quick pedicure.</li>
    <li> Best callus remover that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Works great. delivery fast.</li>
    <li> Great for calluses and nails</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the pedicure at the salon. Great for in-between touch ups!</li>
    <li> Love it it works great.</li>
    <li> Works as well as advertised. I use it about once a week, and it does a good job. Much easier than using the manual &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; type handtool. I&#x27;ve learned that although the normal rollers work well, it might be a good idea to also buy a pack of the heavy-duty rollers (they can be interchanged) if you have thick calluses. It also fits well in your hand and is easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> works great  great product</li>
    <li> Love it! Works really well.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Almost as good as a professional pedicure!</li>
    <li> Pretty bad product. I used once, and worked nice. But at the second time, the engine didnt work. I even bought new rechargeable batteries and it didnt work. I tryed everything. And when I contacted amazon for warranty, it turned out I had no chance for a new one. I just used once. Now I lost my money.</li>
    <li> Finally, really smooth, soft heels!  I love this item!  It seems to be of good quality. Would absolutely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> is a miracle worker! I have needed this for YEARS! I am so very happy that I found it! My feet are soooo smooth now.  It took me over 45 minutes to get them that way.  Once a week for five minutes is all I should need now.  I have happy feet again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, though, that the packaging was horrible.  In fact, I received a nasty cut trying to cut off the thick plastic holding the appliance.  : o(</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS MORE THAN WORTH THE MONEY. MY FEET ARE NICE AND SMOOTH NO MORE TRIPS TO HAVE MY FEET DONE I CAN DO THEM MYSELF</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have callused feet but they were very dry and snagged on my sheets at night. Yuk.  A once over with the Emjoi and they are a soft and smooth.  I did find it&#x27;s even more effective to use a foot moisturizer right after.</li>
    <li> I find the Emjoi to be most helpful for the very sensitive pinky toe area and the great toe area. These are the areas that traditional pedi-files can cause pain. The Emjoi Micro-Pedi works well in these areas (without pain), but it needs a stronger motor to do much in other callused areas. I used my regular file first to get my feet in shape, and now I use the Micro-Pedi to keep my feet callus free. The bottom line is that it has potential, but needs a more powerful motor in order to get moderately callused feet callus-free.</li>
    <li> Purchased one of these as a gift for my daughter.  She liked it so&lt;br /&gt;much and after trying it I decided I also needed one so bought one&lt;br /&gt;for myslef.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Does nothing even after soaking feet for 15 min in hot water.</li>
    <li> This works just like it stated.  I always worry about stuff from TV but this ting is well built and does exactly what it is suppose to, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Super effective. Need to buy refill strips with it, though.  Got rid of my calluses mostly in one use.  Second use completely gone.  Really effective and easy to use solution to callused feet.</li>
    <li> I tried a couple other solutions for calluses and none worked.  30 seconds into using this Emjoi device, I knew it was going to be the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s great.  It gently turns your calluses into dust .. easy to control and after a minute or so, your feet are soft.  You kind of get addicted to using it, it works so well.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as advertised.  Saves time and effort for a necessary chore. It is designed to make buffing your feet easier and it does.</li>
    <li> I just received it and used it, I love it, I&#x27;m ordering one for my daughter in college. My daughter just got hers and loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once but it works really well...no more having to manually scrape my feet! Just have to be careful to not use it too aggressively.</li>
    <li> Powerful and functional. Easy to maintain!!</li>
    <li> Amazing tool. Light, convenient and has a nice grip. But the only drawback is that the rollers will not last long.</li>
    <li> It does everything I expected it to do and more than I expected it would. I like how easy it is to clean!</li>
    <li> Really works well.  I thought I had an extra toe growing on the side of my foot-- less than 1 minute and it was gone.  Product seems much sturdier than less expensive models and easy to use.  Delivery came sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;gadget&amp;#34; is very easy to use, not clumsy or heavy....simple to load, clean, refill, and does the job as described.  Certainly worth the current price...would recommend to family/friends.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this amazing product.  I have been wearing flip flops every single day since March.  My feet/heels have been a disaster.  They have always been dry - but this summer, they have been bad enough for me to do something about.  They have been cracking/bleeding and just all out hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after a few searches on how to fix cracked heels.  The reviews were helpful and there were enough positives for me to go through with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got home from work, I broke it out of the package and read the directions.  I started using it.  For those of us old enough - it reminds me of a &#x27;sweater shaver&#x27; (the sort of thing you&#x27;d use to remove the little bumps from a sweater - it was big in the 80&#x27;s).  As long as you follow the directions - it&#x27;s nothing short of INCREDIBLE!  By the time i was finished with my first use - my feet felt like I just walked out of a nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every day since and after 3 days, I can report that my heels have NOT looked or felt this good in YEARS.  I am going to get the refills and am so glad to not be embarrassed anymore by my feet!  :)</li>
    <li> I was not sure at first about this product until I read the review. Then I decided to purchase this product to give it a try. When I received it 3 days later I tried it right away. I must say that I was really impressed. I gave it a 4 star simply because the board in fine and not course.</li>
    <li> Product performed as advertised. Roller could have been a bit thicker, but it got the job done. My calluses are chronic, so if they made the Emjoi bigger, I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
    <li> Way way way better than the Ped egg.  I&#x27;m so happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> This works well, and does a nice job.  Glad I got this, this one. very easy to use. Love it!</li>
    <li> If you use alkaline AA batteries, it won&#x27;t exert its maximum potential. Try to use rechargeable ones. Their resistance is way lower than those alkaline batteries. WILL make the spinning faster and more abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stock blue is to us, way gentle for tough callus, but it is good for pedicure purposes. Good on the nail, but lil weak for callus.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  The pedi egg is NO comparison... this leaves your skin smooth and effectively removes calluses without any risk of cutting your skin.  Excellent product!  Definitely worth the money!  I used to have HORRIBLE calluses and now my feet look like I just got a professional pedicure.  Love this thing!</li>
    <li> This has worked out so well for me. I still get pedicures, but this device keeps the balls of my feet and my heels smoother than when I get them done at a salon! I have used this for about 2 months about once a week and not had to change the batteries yet. I like the coarser rollers the best. This is the best thing I have found, hands down, to help keep my feet in better condition from the bad habit of wearing very high heels to work. I highly recommend this affordable alternative to some of the pricier products.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products, including the &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; to relieve my calloused and dry feet. The Powerful Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover lives up to its advertising. I&#x27;ve used it several times and have to say that my feet are starting to look great. I recommend this product highly. Just make sure to buy additional accessories (replacement rollers) when you purchase the basic product. I am impressed and highly satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple for some friends of mine for their birthday and, when some other friends found out how well they work, they wanted them too!  I have a different Emjoi model but my friends swear by this.  I really love the one I have too.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy on my arthritic hands, doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Great little gadget!</li>
    <li> My wife calls this a foot sander... Though much smaller than I expected, this appliance does a nice job reducing calluses.  It requires AA batteries (Make sure you use good quality alkaline batteries or it won&#x27;t have enough power to run properly)  My wife&#x27;s biggest complaint was that it makes a mess, leaving callus-dust all over - No so bad if you use it outside.  She was accustomed to a handle-mounted pumice stone which she uses in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is great, fixes great in my hand. Also works great. I say that it was the best deal I ever had on any callus removers.</li>
    <li> I have one of these for several years and love it.  I have bought them for gifts and everyone agrees, it is the best.</li>
    <li> Works great, the wife has always been using the sanding boards purchased at the local retail shops. I saw this and ask her if she was interested and she sure was. She love&#x27;s it. Mama&#x27;s happy &#x3D; everybody&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. No need to go and pay for a pedicure again. Order extra cartridges right away. They wear out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This does work great.  For some reason my heals got very ruff and just cream wasn&#x27;t working.  I only gave it 4 stars because the head needs to be replaced after using it a few times and they are a little pricey.  It&#x27;s so new I don&#x27;t know yet when I will need a new&lt;br /&gt;one. I do intend to keep using it.</li>
    <li> It great for my rough dry cracked feet. it takes time but works like a charm... Dont hesitate. Buy it</li>
    <li> It works well.  It is easier than other methods. It still takes awhile though.  I&#x27;m glad that I discovered it.</li>
    <li> Been wanting to try this and glad I ordered it because it works so well. My feet are so smooth. It is very easy to use and handy.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Great price and got it within 2 days. So happy.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND PLAN TO PURCHASE MORE FOR GIFTS.  KEEPS HEELS IN GOOD SHAPE AND KNOW MY FRIENDS WILL LOVE IT TOO,</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. It really works better on dry feet than on feet just washed because the dead skin can clog the roller.</li>
    <li> easy way to keep feet looking good</li>
    <li> Needs more power I find the engine does not have enough grunt for my liking.</li>
    <li> Great for sanding calluses and keeping feet soft.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product - I love it!  Thanks so very much!:):):)</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail. I&#x27;m not one to read directions so I put in some batteries and turned it on. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! What usually takes me 1/2 hour or longer I did in less than two minutes. And thats both feet. No more files this is something I will use forever! A must buy as far as I&#x27;m concerned!!! LOVE IT!!!!  So glad I ordered extra rollers!  Hope this helped you ;)</li>
    <li> Does a great job smoothing the calluses off your feet!</li>
    <li> Stop reading! And just put it in your cart. Awesome. Buh-bye PedEgg!</li>
    <li> I use this with the Micro-Pedi Precision Kit to remove Crossfit induced calluses.  I had tried the coarse stones right after the shower, the ped-egg, the callus razor... and the problem I was having was my hands are not flat but contoured, so it was impossible to remove enough of the callus without hitting normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the kit, I&#x27;m able to remove the calluses as much as I want, anywhere I want.  Pure precision.  It&#x27;s super easy, and no worries about harming yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of power from this device on 2 AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piece of advice - I like to do this on my back deck, otherwise you will get tons of pieces of white dry skin coating your clothes/floor</li>
    <li> I have used this product only once since received, but if it continues to do as nice a job as it did after the first time, I will be ecstatic.  My heels were smooth and looked good.</li>
    <li> I do not like it!! And I don&#x27;t have ruff feet I just wanted to get the dead skin off. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> I wondered when I bought it but having used it once, I can tell you it really works.  Be gentle with it - IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> I got this about 3 weeks ago and have given it a good work out on my feet and elbows (word to the wise keep your skin pulled tight or it gets caught in the roller Ouch!) The truth is I had a problem and didn&#x27;t realize I had a fungus in a couple of my finger &amp; toe nails. I have been crazy buying spraying creams etc trying to take good care of my feet &amp; hands as well as my nails since. If you have never had fungus in your nails you have to be very diligent to get it gone it takes months of night and day care. I also have a problem with my thyroid and I think that is why my feet tend to be on the dry side so I got the Xtreme coarse but I haven&#x27;t had to use them as yet. I did have a problem with a bad callus on both feet on my big toe as well as my heel, this little machine took them off in two sessions. Keep the machine moving and don&#x27;t stay in one spot or you could have an issue, it will do the job, remember the callus or dry skin didn&#x27;t happen in 2 minutes. I would say after I used it the second time my feet were baby soft! About a week later I went to the Dr. she has been checking my hands and feet every visit this visit she said ... your feet are so soft and in such good condition what are you doing different? I had to laugh when I told her I am taking care of them myself ... me &amp; emoji!</li>
    <li> This works really well for my dry cracked heels. Best I have found, plus using a cream afterward even better</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  My feet - especially the heels - were rough enough to sand wood and no amount of lotion/moisturizer/cream would offer more than temporary relief.  Then I bought this, and my feet have been smooth and soft ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, I wore out the first roller very quickly but since it hasn&#x27;t had to work as hard in subsequent uses, the second roller is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I didn&#x27;t receive the one pictured.</li>
    <li> I purchased this previously for myself and my friend.  We both love it.  My friend&#x27;s friends saw this and loved it.  She&#x27;s been looking for one for herself for a while now, and was very happy to get this.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This is nice and really works.  My only concerns are that the files don&#x27;t last that long (&amp; they are pretty expensive in my opinion), and the batteries don&#x27;t last long.  Wish there was a rechargable one!  &#x27;</li>
    <li> Purchased for Christmas present. Giftee loves it....now I need one for me. Will purchase one for another friend for Christmas gift this year.</li>
    <li> What a Rip-Off!  Well, it sounded good when I decided to buy it, but the roller is only good for a few uses.  And I just spent another $18 for &amp;#34;extremely course&amp;#34; roller refills and they are no different than the regular ones.  It seems in retrospect that if one just purchases the right material to use on one&#x27;s callused feet, then just a little manual elbow power would provide the same service this silly and expensive gadget performs, especially since one needs to constantly and frequently replenish and change the rollers. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really good, my mom used it as well and loved it</li>
    <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This gadget is simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;My feet are so smooth and almost pain free.&lt;br /&gt;The pain I have is NOT from the Emjoi but the Emjoi does help relieve my pain. So much easier than any manual tool. Highly recommend to all, especially at this price!</li>
    <li> Great item for those in between trips to get my pedicures.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 43 yr old man with gnarly feets. I wear flip-flops most of the time and my feets be all dried up and cracked out. This little spinner shaved down all that nasty crust. Now the skin shards don&#x27;t be curttin&#x27; up the sheets. Me feets be all nice and smoov and I can cuddle up to my wife again.  1- yr later (see photo) Happy Feets</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this type callus for a long time. It is very effective and 100% of my expectation. I recommend  to every body.</li>
    <li> It arrived when expected.  I had no trouble at all.  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I really like my Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover. I use it between appointments for my pedicure.</li>
    <li> I received this today so I had to use it right away. I also purchased the super coarse rollers that worked well. This really made my feet smooth and very soft. I was surprised that with light pressure this buffed the skin fairly quickly; I went over my heels a few times and it was comfortable to use with no irritation. Reading other reviews I was prepared for dust (fine skin shavings) so using the bathtub by sitting on the edge is the ideal location. Afterwards I rinsed my feet and followed-up with a moisturizer. My feet look way better using this than getting professional pedicures!. No more pumice stones or those metal scrapers for me, I am sticking with this product and I hope it will last!</li>
    <li> This callus remover really works very good. It is the best one I have ever owned. I would&lt;br /&gt;buy it again</li>
    <li> This is not a replacement if you have extreme dry skin but for a a quick buffer and smoothness, this is an amazing product. Can take it on the go when travelling so you do not miss a day of scraping. In seconds your skin feels smoother.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about how good this product was going to work, I&#x27;ve used similar products &amp; was disappointed because when you applied any pressure they would normally stop as a safety measure, but this product took away all my doubts! it&#x27;s very powerful &amp; doesn&#x27;t stop when pressure is applied! I went all winter without a pedicure &amp; my heels looked like I had been walking on hot coal....dry, cracked a mess! I was absolutely surprised at how well this micro-pedi softened my heels &amp; it arrived before the scheduled delivery date, my only regret was that I didn&#x27;t order replacements! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This does a good job.  The only thing I would recommend is purchasing more rollers if you plan on using this often.  Do not get the rollers wet.  It is sandpaper type of material and it will fall apart if you get the roller wet and use soon after.  I did not have this problem when my foot was wet, only when I tried to rinse of the roller and use again the next day.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with all my body parts looking good especially my feet. I&#x27;m not really vain I just can&#x27;t stand people that don&#x27;t take care of themselves. I have nice feet for a guy and I&#x27;ve used just about everything to keep them that way. I&#x27;ve used the PediSpin that you can buy at CVS in the As Seen On TV section. That sucks, and bogs down with the slightest pressure. I have the egg thing also and that works just fair. THIS HOWEVER is really very very good. It will bog down if you really push on it but honestly this Emjoi really does sand down your feet to a baby soft feel. It really takes off the dead skin and calluses. I think the corded one and rechargeable one might have more power but this is really a very good buy and you can get different types of rollers for it. I just ordered the super coarse green rollers but the one this comes with the extra coarse are great but the green ones are probably amazing. You can get the generic rollers , a pack of 4 pretty cheap and they look just as good. I bought them but haven&#x27;t opened the package yet. Haven&#x27;t needed to. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed in this as it really does the job and feels pretty good doing it. 2 AA batteries that so far have not worn out after about 6 uses. Very happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The green rollers came and I used it last night. They work even better then the standard blue one what came with the device. They are more abrasive and sand off even more dead skin. My feet are smooth as can be and my girlfriend is amazed with how well this thing works. I also noticed that if you use the lower quality batteries this thing bogs down somewhat if you press even a little hard. HOWEVER, if you buy good batteries - I bought the generic CVS alkalines that were on sale. They are basically the Duracell I think with the CVS name. They worked much better in that you can push down now pretty hard on the machine and it won&#x27;t stop rolling nearly as easily as it did with less quality batteries.  So, to sum up. The better batteries and the green rollers are the way to go. I don&#x27;t really have super rough feet but the amount of skin this takes off is pretty amazing. Now my feet are amazingly smooth and I use this every day anyway to keep up on them. Ok, so I&#x27;m a little obsessive. Not sure how anyone can give this a low rating as it works great unless you have feet that look like a million year old stone and you don&#x27;t press so hard that your knuckles turn white which you wouldn&#x27;t have to anyway. This is a great little device. You can&#x27;t go wrong buying it and it&#x27;t inexpensive too.</li>
    <li> I was on the fence with this one because of some that gave it 1 or 2 stars but this does exactly what it advertises to do.  I have little time for a pedi with two toddlers.  This removes more than the technician can.  You won&#x27;t be diappointed.  I love this tool!!!!</li>
    <li> This device really works...well!!!!  Desert climate, constant air conditioned house, hard tile floor &#x3D; horrible, cracked, bleeding feet!  This product is easy to use and works like a charm.  I  bought this for my husband after knee replacement surgery made it difficult to keep up w/ his necessary, daily foot care..this product was the answer to his problem.  The price is affordable, so I am getting one for myself !!!</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I anticipated.  Slow results.  Slightly noticeable over the course of a week or so. Recommend for extreme cases.</li>
    <li> love this it works great just wish i would have gotten the one with a electric cord so i don&#x27;t use so many batteries</li>
    <li> I love this it works great!!! I need the course roll and also I really want to get the manicure attachments! I recommend this to anyone it works great!</li>
    <li> AS I WROTE BEFORE BEST PRODUCT FOR THE FEET I HAVE EVER BOUGHT IT IS THOUGH WITH CALLUSES BUT GENTLE AT THE SAME TIME.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing.  I put in a couple rechargeable batteries and have yet to recharge them!!!  I use this weekly and a few months in, still using the original roller.  So I think they last a bit longer than people are saying, plus there are a number of generic replacements that are reasonably priced.    Performance wise it is fantastic.  It takes away dead skin fast!  But give yourself time and a place you can make a mess because the skin comes off like saw dust!  This is perfect for guys like myself who are vain about their feet, but won&#x27;t to set foot in a nail salon.    Last, don&#x27;t press too hard, light pressure is all you need as the Emjoi does all the work. Be careful as your skin will be gone before you know it.</li>
    <li> Second purchase of this product, which I gave to a friend. Works great</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  Makes at home pedicures a breeze.  Super easy to use and clean up is a breeze!</li>
    <li> What an awesome tool! Much quicker and more convenient than the manual models.</li>
    <li> Received this in perfect condition.  Works as advertised.  I had the seen on TV type and it wouldn&#x27;t keep up with me.  This doesn&#x27;t slow down at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once but I&#x27;m impressed. It did a great job of removing the thick area on my heels - smooth as a baby now and it&#x27;s been 3 days since I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> I had the older version, which seemed easier  to use because it had a longer handle.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  I returned it after trying it for a few days.  I have moderate calluses and when I put the blue sander portion to my heel (gently or firmly) it just stopped.  There just isn&#x27;t enough power to keep the unit turning.  I even tried it on wet vs. dry skin to see if that made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving it a fair shot, I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;The concept is good.&lt;br /&gt;The execution for moderate calluses and above - poor.  I would have given zero stars, but that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
    <li> This product worked just as advertised and safely removed calluses from the heel area of my feet.  It seemed to work best after showering, when the heels were softened.  Will not need quite as many pedicures so I am quite happy about that.</li>
    <li> This works great, from the first use I found this to be much better then a file or emery board. Very smooth finish.</li>
    <li> It really works well!  It removed the hard callus area and left a smooth skin surface.  Much better and safer than using a razor.</li>
    <li> Great product.Would give it for a gift.</li>
    <li> I had very thick and splitting calluses. This has eventually sanded them down. However my feet must be tough as even the gold super course sanding wheels take time and patience to get it done. Some kind of collection attachment would be a nice refinement.</li>
    <li> There is nothing to say about this except it is freaking awesome. I was skeptical when I ordered it. But it works. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Great on calluses! Worth the money as it will save you tons of money on pedicures! I even bought one as a gift for my friend!</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!  I now have &amp;#34;pretty feet&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I hardly leave reviews but this is one of the best beauty products I have ever purchased! I eagerly awaited the shipment of this product and when I opened it up, I used it right away.  Immediately, I began to see results in filing down my calluses and in a few moments, they were back to a smoothness I hadn&#x27;t had in a long time! I got a pedicure the day before but the salon had failed to scrub off most of the calluses from my feet, and I had thought there was no way any other product would be able to get them off - I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, scrubs, ped egg; the closest product was the Tweezerman LTD soft grip foot file. With the Emjoi, there is no pain, no cuts and it slowly files away the rough edges. The trick is to let it glide over your feet - don&#x27;t apply a lot of pressure. Wish this product came with batteries (AA) and we&#x27;ll see how long the cartridge lasts but I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Good product, works fabulous...</li>
    <li> We are very Happy with this purchase. The Micro-Callus Remover works better than expected , Thanks for the follow up.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as expected. Not powerful and the rollers need to be longer to give it any chance of working as advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap, underpowered toy that gets the job done if that job is to polish a spot that you took down with another tool.  Would recommend this only if you have one or two light spots you want to hit, or need to smooth out an area after using something more abrasive.  Would not recommend using this as a primary tool when working on thick callouses.</li>
    <li> Delivered fast.  Too early to tell if I love it.  But seems to work the way it was described</li>
    <li> Works great.  Highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> Love my Medi-Pedi! It shaves the excess skin right off my feet.</li>
    <li> It works great and a lot safer to use than a blade.</li>
    <li> Did not work properly at all !</li>
    <li> Works great on really dry heels.</li>
    <li> IT IS S WONDERFUL PRODUCT AND WAS SHIPPED WELL!</li>
    <li> I’ve told y’all before I’m a pedicure junkie. When I finally get all the correct lottery numbers on just one ticket; this girl will be getting a pedicure every single week!! Getting a pedicure is one of those wonderful relaxing indulgences that I simply adore! Since The Husband and I are retired I can only indulge in a professional pedicure every other month. However, since I spend about 99.999% of the time barefoot I don’t dare let my feet go for 2 months! I can’t even imagine how bad my feet would look if I didn’t use this. Yikes; that just gives me goosebumps just thinking about it!!&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to share my review with you of the Emjoi; a Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover. The Emjoi is super easy to use. If you apply too much pressure the Emjoi stops on its own. HOWEVER! You don’t need to apply pressure for this wonderful device to get rid of your dead skin. Seriously this device will have dead skin flying like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi does such an awesome job! So much so, that the last professional pedicure I had, the technician didn’t even ask if I wanted the “extra callus remover treatment” You know these are soft feet if that’s the case!&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Micro-Pedi not only gave me instant results but the more I use it the smoother and softer my heels feel.&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover takes two double A batteries. Insert the batteries by simply twisting off the end. Super easy. Also changing out the roller is very simple as well; just the push of a button on the side.&lt;br /&gt;Holding the Emjoi is easy because of its ergonomic design and easy grip sides.&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi works wonders! While it really buffs away dead, dry and calloused skin it does it without pain. You can’t go wrong with this one!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> We use this and it seems to work great. I even ordered one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product &amp; received it fast. After recieving it in the mail, I immediately used it that night. I had did my heels as they are the major area. I used it for 10 mins on each heel, not pressing hard as the directions instructed. Immediately after I finished, my heels were so smooth. I kept rubbing my heels &amp; feet together because of the smoothness. I have been wanting a product like this for awhile &amp; glad it worked. It was a very resonable price. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Really does make your feet soft. Does a better job than the stone and the scraper! The shipment took 5 days. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift. The person was astonished at how effective it debrides that ugly crusty heel skin.  Now her feet look greatly improved and is very happy with the gift.  The dead skin just flies away in no time. No need for any of the drugstore remedies as this&lt;br /&gt;She can&#x27;t wait until summer to show off her beautiful feet!</li>
    <li> This is the best foot sander i have invested in! I have battled for years with callouses on my big toes and heels. The only thing capable of getting rid of these was wearing my arm out using a sandpaper wand. I have tried the &amp;#34;Egg&amp;#34; also which just made it worse. This device is soooo much easier and quicker to use. I do reccomend that when using this item make sure a trash can or towel is laid down underneath to catch the shavings otherwise youre gonna need to vaccum.</li>
    <li> it came very fast--great product</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my rough cracked feet.. I would recommend it to anyone who has callus problems.</li>
    <li> First time since I was a child that my feet have been this smooth and callus free.  I&#x27;ve used pumice stones, metal &#x27;scrapers&#x27;, nothing even came close to doing the job that the Emjoi has done.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use.  Do not press too hard or you&#x27;ll strain your battery. If you have very tough calluses (like I did) use the Xtreme Coarse Rollers and then follow up with the blue ones. Finish by putting on some foot cream. I recommend O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy feet, and slip into some cotton socks to let the cream soak in.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth as can be!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST callus remover ever.  WOW</li>
    <li> This callus remover is the bomb! I have never used anything quite like it. We love it! The refills rock!</li>
    <li> This was definitely not strong enough to get rid of my calluses...but it did make them a little smoother. I need to change the roller after every fourth use or so...</li>
    <li> This is a TERRIFIC product!! I wish I would have found this YEARS ago! It works amazingly well and is a must have for anyone that likes soft, well cared for feet. I would recommend this nifty little gadget to everyone...so much better and easier than a pumice stone or, heaven forbid, those cheese grater-type devices that I relied on before making this awesome purchase!</li>
    <li> wasnt as strong as expected. But it does remove dead skin.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous products to remove dry skin but this little item is a gem. Very easy to use.  It is electric and has refills available BUT it really works. For the first time it is no bother at all to exfoliate.  My feet look amazing.  This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I think the cracks in my feet are too deep for this.  It didn&#x27;t help my cracks but someone else who just has callused feet would probably benefit</li>
    <li> Needs a little more power, and a longer handle would be great.</li>
    <li> You can have beautiful heels with almost no effort! Runs well, very quiet. Each emory wheel gets dull fast, you&#x27;ll definitely need replacements.</li>
    <li> I just love this Emjoi, my feet have never looked better than they do now after using this for just a few times.  I would recommend this to anyone who has dry skin or calluses on their feet</li>
    <li> I have the worst calloused heels and I have never ever found anything that helped.  The Emjoi was amazing right out of the box.  I will be buying this for gifts for all my friends!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect addition for any woman , especially at summer time, when we were open shoes and slippers.&lt;br /&gt;I am a runner and had problems dealing with all my calluses. Of course, I tried this cute thing right away.&lt;br /&gt;Wow! It worked fantastic! Skin looks awesome in a minute! Give a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Too bad it didn&#x27;t come with extra buffing rollers.  Those have to be ordered separately.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised. It is ergonomic, powerful, and efficient. I was surprised by how quickly it pulverized callouses. Good purchase for me. If you don&#x27;t like the shape your feet are in, this will brighten them up quickly -- dead skin and callouses will be a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love it! works so much better than the ped-egg things. It&#x27;s quick and easy, I did get the next coarser inserts for mine.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> This works just great remember use gently over dead skin on heels if you press to hard will stop and it is not necessary worked great for me no complaints at all. good product. After using apply balm repeat 3 days later antil heels are looking terrific.</li>
    <li> this works great! I love mine and bought another for a friend</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! My sister has a similar product by the same manufacturer. This makes quick work of any scaly or hard to buff off parts on your feet. Just a few minutes and mine were baby smooth. I will be ordering replacement pads for this as I am sure I will use it again and again.</li>
    <li> This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s amazing how the lightest touch removes sooooo much and yes be prepared for a dust pile of dead skin. I joke a strenous hike with my dogs every day and a shorter one at night which shows on my feet but with this product it makes my feet smooth again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a great as it was touted to be.</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget!  Finally a remedy for dry heals other than one of those pedicure files/eggs/pumice stones . It&#x27;s just so much more efficient and a heck of a lot less work.  My heals were so dry and cracked it took several times over them with a coarser roller the first few times but now it&#x27;s just maintenance a few times a week with the regular roller. It saves time and money going to the pedicurist or just maintaining in between visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you press too hard the roller stops so you can&#x27;t peel too much off at a time.  The instructions  say not to stay on one spot more than a couple of seconds which is logical.  I was so impressed that I bought my sister one for her birthday.  I love wearing sandals again and not scratching my hubby&#x27;s legs when we go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for 3 months and no problems at all with the quality and As Is aid I use it a lot.  I would highly recommend this guy for anyone with dry feet or calluses.</li>
    <li> does the job and the design of it is easier to handle than the other model; for those of us who have developed dexterity problems in our hands</li>
    <li> Works great.  Easier than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often review items, unless they blow me away.  I am very happy to give an excellent rating to this product.  I received it today along with some coarser replacement pumice rods.  I immediately went to work...I loved the ergonomic design and simplicity of use.  I honestly think that I will not need to go to a nail salon unless I just want the experience and to get  my cuticles in tip-top shape.  Very mild sensation and it doesn&#x27;t take much time at all.  A+++ product!  Buying for my mom and all girlfriends.  Also will be easy to travel with if you&#x27;re a road warrior like me :)</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. I have 2 of them. I recommend this to every one I know</li>
    <li> was so excited after seeing the infomercials....just didnt meet my expectations. not powerful enough.</li>
    <li> Love this, one of my best purchases ever! Removes dry skin and in its place is smooth, soft skin. Don&#x27;t pass this up!</li>
    <li> I read a number of reviews, some favorable some not favorable.  I have been very pleased and satisfied with the Emjoi callus remover, it does all I expected it to do.</li>
    <li> If you do at home mani and pedis this is a great tool.  It really does the job and makes your heals super smooth</li>
    <li> The device is easy to use, ergonomically designed; light weight and removes callused areas well. Overall, I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Well worth buying. Remarkable difference in my feet. Smoothness lasts very long. recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased this! I&#x27;ve been using it on my feet every night for about a month and I now have softer feet. I wish that it had a greater affect of my extremely coarse feet but I&#x27;ve come to realize it&#x27;s not the product fault and that I need to buy their xtreme rollers to get the best effect!</li>
    <li> This works well as advertised.  I did buy coarse roller refills on e-bay and I am happy with this little device.</li>
    <li> Easy pain free callus removal! Quiet and simple. Does the job! So, far it is fantastic. I am curious to see how long the roller goes before needing replacement.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It works very well for preparing feet for sandals!  Worth the price.  Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> used three times and removed callus</li>
    <li> I love this foot buffer. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and see a big difference already. Great customer service too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the other edition of the micro-pedi callus remover and its incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!  East to use, and instant results.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews. Complete waste of money. Seriously.  Not like I have e&lt;br /&gt;Elephant feet, but this is way too weak to achieve anything. It removes the tiniest layer, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift and was told it works great!!! So much better than the ped-egg and less expensive than many pedis!</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this to me. I used hers then bought my own and love it. Its easy to use and keep clean. No more dry rough feet!</li>
    <li> Performs well but would have purchased a &amp;#34;wired&amp;#34; versus batteries wich do not last too long (maybe 2 minutes at the most)</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this. Doesn&#x27;t have enough power or battery life.  I do however like being able to rinse the cylinder when needed.</li>
    <li> It is the best one I have ever tried! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a remover! So much better than the &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; recommended by spa therapist</li>
    <li> Was skeptical when we ordered it, but stating seeing an amazing difference from the first use. Say goodbye to dead skin and hello to soft feet!</li>
    <li> I got this product a few months ago, thought that the quality would be too good to be true and was completely wrong. It is efficient yet painless and makes my feet feel so smooth. Also strong enough to take on my boyfriends man feet and make them pretty. You will not be disappointed, and for the price it easily pays itself off for anyone who has gone through the uncomfortable &amp;#34;callous removal&amp;#34; process that is also costly at the salon.</li>
    <li> EmjoiMicro-Pedi callus remover did a really good job on my callus and what is like most about it ,I didn&#x27;t have to soak my feet before using it . I also liked that my friends noticed the different in my heels no more crack hills .it really worked for me and being a person with diabetes it is very gentle to the skin  unlike some I use to used it doesn&#x27;t damage your  feet.</li>
    <li> I finally have smooth heels.!</li>
    <li> Returned. My feet arent the greatest, but they&#x27;re definitely not the roughest either. Tried using this and definitely not what i expected. Every time I&#x27;d place it on my heel and applied a little pressure, it would just stop. Good for smoothing the bottom of your feet, but would not call this a callus remover</li>
    <li> Nice that feet are dry and can use it anywhere, but it takes a very long time to remove any callus at all.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My feet are soft, there is no more dryness or roughness, the cracks are gone. This is amazing.</li>
    <li> Only used three times but seems to work just fine on heals.</li>
    <li> I could not resist and had to try it immediately as it arrived! It is gentle but effective. My feet feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> Mini miracle machine. My feet are as close to baby smooth as I&#x27;ll ever get again. I will never be without it ever. It is my second best beauty necessity next to my clarisonic for my face. My feet and skin are smooth and all I have to do is sit there and roll it around my foot.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing in the world to remove calluses.  I have used it several times and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have horrible feet.  Really.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much my entire life I&#x27;ve deal with dry, cracked, scaly feet.  I broke down and bought this little gem a couple of weeks ago and, while it works well enough.... I have had to replace the batteries at an alarming rate.  When the batteries start to wear down... this thing just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to do its job.  This means you have to change the batteries before they&#x27;re dead.  I&#x27;m looking at a pair of batteries every week.  At this point I wish I&#x27;d have paid the extra to get one with a power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the replacement cartridges are NOT cheap but the durability seems good.</li>
    <li> gets a lot of the dead skin fast</li>
    <li> I have TERRIBLE feet. For years (yes, I am quite &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;), I shaved my callouses with a razor, used an abrasive, visited podiatrists and had pedicures, but nothing provided lasting results. On a whim about a year ago, I bought a Micro-Pedi...and miracle of miracles, with 3 weeks of about 10 minutes of daily use, my feet were smoother than I can ever remember. I am hooked!  Yes, the rollers wear out and are not inexpensive but much less expensive than a podiatrist&#x27;s visit or a pedicure!  I set up an automatic delivery plan for the rollers--very convenient.  And yes, you do need to wipe your feet and moisturize after using.  For a small investment of both time and money, your feet will be happy, too!</li>
    <li> So much for scraping with a file. This gadget is too easy and mows the rough skin away. It comes with a roller that will work on most areas, but my heels are a little tougher so I will  use the coarse roller for that.</li>
    <li> This device is easy to use and gets the job done! I strongly recommend it for anyone who likes smooth feet. I use it on a regular basis to maintain my feet and I am upgrading to the corded version. I recommend this product because it works!</li>
    <li> Great purchase. It is everything I thought it would be and performs just as described. Don&#x27;t hesitate to  purchase it.</li>
    <li> Great tool, works well</li>
    <li> love this thing.  now if i could just get my daughters to quit stealing it.  i&#x27;m now going to have to buy my third one.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product. I have been fighting callouses for years this product gives me salon pedicure results at home.</li>
    <li> I really want to tallk to anyone who finds this useful.  I&#x27;ve used it exactly twice, and the roller is done.  Both times I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s been a completely worthless experience.  Please, please, please use your money to buy something that will actually work, like literally anything else.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!  I bought one for myself, my daughter, mother and neighbor!!!  We all love it!</li>
    <li> I have been surprised at how well this does.  My feet have not been in such good shape (especially in the winter) for a long time. I do think the little pumice roller is wearing out rapidly, however.</li>
    <li> Got this, was happy to upgrade from an pediegg knockoff thing. It worked great the first time I used it. The second time I turned it on, it barely moved and burned my hand when I opened the back to check on the batteries! No thank you!</li>
    <li> My mother purchased this and I decided to try it out to see how it worked.  Boy I was surprised.  I expected it to work like the dozen other callus removers I have purchased in the past.  I&#x27;m happy to say that it works very well.  It&#x27;s battery operated which makes it easy to take with you anywhere.  I ended up having to purchase one for myself as my Mom wasin&#x27;t willing to share hers.  Also, my son tried it out and I ended up purchasing one for him.</li>
    <li> This has done exactly what it promised to do &amp; was easy to use. Would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> My husband has used it and needs it and likes it.  His Dr. said he had to get something for his calluses</li>
    <li> I got this from Costco and I am loving it. My feet has never had cracks until this Summer. It looked horrible cracks which easily accumulated the gunk and fine dust. I have used this twice and my feet are so much better. It was so bad that I could not imagine going for a pedicure looking the way it was. I love that this product is a great pedicure set!&lt;br /&gt;I clean my feet and dry them before I use this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. So easy to use on all those calluses on your feet</li>
    <li> not really strong enough... i tried it for a while but i feel like unless you use it 24/7 for 50 years you won&#x27;t see an effect.. it removes a very very thin layer of skin</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend one of these if you have cracked feet and dry feet.  You have to use it on dry not wet skin and it works very well.  I liked it so much I bought several for Christmas gifts to the women in the family, along with a tube of foot cream. They loved it!</li>
    <li> love it -love it-my dry heels where taken off and very smooth !!!! YOU KNOW HOW DRY HEELS CRACK AD BURN this solves that problem. I do put foot cream on them after using this and I will never give this little machine up!!!</li>
    <li> At 1st I didn&#x27;t think it was working, it was the dead skin...it works great and easy to use, fits in my hand just fine...glad I bought it and my feet were in bad condition</li>
    <li> During the winter months, my heel is unbearable to the point that I am uncomfortable walking around the house without any socks. After getting this item it definitely made things much bearable and don&#x27;t regret purchasing this! My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to clean even with the given brush, but it&#x27;s really just a minor issue that I can deal with it.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my son inlaw.He says &amp;#34;it changed his life!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just got it and it is super easy to use and I love it!  I don&#x27;t want to give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t know how long the callus file will last so I will keep it at 4 but still, it is small, takes 2 AA batteries, easy to us and does a great job.</li>
    <li> this one is great and small for quick use.  love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the extreme coarse refill rollers and this product does work. Best tip is to let the roller do its job (I didn&#x27;t have this happen but saw the potential - Do not press it against your skin as it will burn or tear your skin) I was amazed how well it worked as a battery operated product. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I was a bit reluctant to try this out but it works like a dream!</li>
    <li> Worth the money!!! The best callus remover I&#x27;ve ever used! Don&#x27;t waste your money on PediSpin or alike products...get the Emjoi.</li>
    <li> Order arrived on time &amp; properly packaged. This item was recommended to me by a friend &amp; I am very pleased with this purchase.  It does exactly what it says, needs only a light touch &amp; the results are nice &amp; smooth. Will definetly recommend this product to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> Best devise she has found yet, works great</li>
    <li> worth every penny spent.... Just wish it had another roller with it</li>
    <li> Amazing (and somewhat disgusting) how much &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; comes off your feet.  Much better than I expected and it pays for itself now that I don&#x27;t have to get pedicures in the winter-we don&#x27;t wear sandals north of Boston after October but I used to primarily to have old skin removed.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great price - I shopped a round!  Easy to use.  Comfortable to hold.  For once I have soft, smooth feet!  I only wish I had purchased it in the beginning of the summer, not the end!  Makes for great &amp;#34;sandal&amp;#34; feet.</li>
    <li> Love this little machine!  Use on the feet and actually all over where I am dry.  You just have to make sure you clean the refill with water after every use to get the maximum from the refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great callus remover, easy to use!  Have soft pretty feet now :o)</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS CLAIMED TO BE</li>
    <li> Effective results, easy to use, quality construction, cylinders are long lasting, outstanding value for the money. Got it to use on husband&#x27;s feet to remove tough calluses on his heels. With regular use, we have had excellent results! Makes a wonderful gift! Have given one to everyone in our family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning this as it stops too easily when applying pressure. Maybe mine is defective. I bought the corded more powerful model, by this company, and really like it!</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product (based on the reviews) but a girl from work swore by it - so I bought it.  I also purchased the extra coarse rollers because my heels are extremely dry with deep cracks.  No matter what I have done - nothing helps.  I try to stay away from pedicures with the razor because my heels tend to be worse and the callus comes in thicker. I have tried lotions, pedicure scrapers, solutions that claimed to dissolve the callus, etc.  Nothing has worked.  So I purchased this - with the stronger rollers - and I was stunned.  While using, I was stunned at the immediate shavings that fell to the floor (in a powder form).  I used the product on both feet for about 5 minutes each. I rinsed off the residue and lotioned up my feet.  I literally was stunned.  They weren&#x27;t perfect yet but they were soft again!  I have used the product every other day for about a week and they are almost perfect. I am no longer embarrassed to have people see my feet!!!  I am buying this for every woman in my family for Christmas.  Thank you for existing, Emjoi!  You saved my feet!</li>
    <li> This is my second Emjoi. Just love this product. Absolutely recommend the product</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.  I purchased another brand and it made my skin even rougher.  This one is far superior.</li>
    <li> I love my Emjoi. I&#x27;ve tried knock-offs from the store and they just don&#x27;t work well. Emjoi gives me the results.</li>
    <li> Used it as soon as I got it, love it. Wood highly recommend to anyone that wears flip flops every where.</li>
    <li> I love the whrrrr...of the battery and not having to saw back &amp; forth with a foot implement.  I am a convert 100%.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing callous and cracked skin buffer.  My feet are smoother than when I get pedicures.  I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Grab one of these and run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found something for my &amp;#34;hooves&amp;#34; that really works and shows results immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer a slave to the nail salon.  Until I found this I thought I would have to spend $$ at a nail salon for the rest of my life - every 2 weeks.  When I say &amp;#34;hooves&amp;#34; I mean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foolishly spent $200 on a competitor item that did squat.  I use other items the competitor sells and love them, but their foot care product is a complete waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend this battery version.  You can use it anywhere and aren&#x27;t tied down to a plug.</li>
    <li> Good for use between pedicures. Have to be faithful in using it or dead skin builds up. I was given one as a gift and bought this one for my husband. He also likes it. It is not a complete substitute for a pedicure, in our opinions.</li>
    <li> This is so much easier than scraping with any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Leaves your feet smooth and not scratchy.....</li>
    <li> This product is rated #1 for a reason, it literally softens the callous and rough edges on your feet in a couple of minutes AND you don&#x27;t even feel it working! One of the best investments I ever made on Amazon..The price is well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Save your money and get a real pedicure.  The refill cartridges get pricey, since you only get 1 use out of them before they get really dull.  My feet are in great condition and I don&#x27;t have thick cracked heels.  The Emjoi did smooth out the skin, but it was only temporary.</li>
    <li> Returned it - save your money and get a Pedisoft</li>
    <li> Very nice. Quite to my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is a must for anyone who wears sandals.  I had my doubts but it really does smooth the callouses off of your feet, without any effort at all.  Everyone at one time or another have used the buffers but they really are a lot of work.  This you just put the batteries in turn it on and presto they are smooth.  I keep it out at all times.</li>
    <li> This thing is absolutely amazing. Probably the highest satisfaction item ,I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It really kicks A$&amp;. Removes callus&#x27;s , in seconds. Super powerful ! Brushes last forever.&lt;br /&gt;You will be completely amazed , at how well it works. Easy to control and fun to use!</li>
    <li> Not very powerful but does a good job</li>
    <li> Definitely need to buy a more coarse insert! But seems to work great in power.</li>
    <li> I love this! It keeps my feet smooth and beautiful!</li>
    <li> This product is everything it promised to be. I love it.</li>
    <li> It worked great and no issues with removing too much. Kind of addictive so I ordered three more replacement heads to last the summer.</li>
    <li> does not do as much as I figured, may be I am not using it right. thought it would help remove dead skin from my heel area</li>
    <li> This small but powerful tool does the trick at removing dry skin and calluses.  I would give it a 5 star but the gadget is VERY loud.  It&#x27;s even hard to use it while watching TV without increasing the volume (alot).  But other than that I love this.  I like that it comes with a small brush to clean the debris ( dry skin) from the roller area and it&#x27;s very easy to change out the rollers when they need to be replaced; just hit the button to release and it.</li>
    <li> If you go barefoot a lot, get this, it will work miracles on those hard calloused feet-Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A wonderful pedicure tool!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, strongly reccommend.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I absolutely love it!!!  Has saved me the expense of frequent pedicures!!!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product really works, I&#x27;ve used the battery operated Remington which had no power &amp; the Egg which requires too much manual labor. I saw immediate results when I first used it. My only concern is how long the rollers will last &amp; how soon I&#x27;m going to have to replace them. I&#x27;m surprised by the power it has &amp; the ergonomic design makes it easy to hold in your hand. Prepare to watch a build up of white sandy dead skin falling off your foot!</li>
    <li> It works pretty good. Good for a quick fix.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw this on a shopping channel for more, and it worked on tv so I got it for a better price, and it works great my feet are smooth!! But you can&#x27;t over do it or your feet will ache.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order it as the reviews weren&#x27;t all so complimentary but  it beats the heck out of using the blades and scrubbing devices.  Works like a charm and gets to the callouses on the pad of my foot right behind the toes which the blade doesn&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but as other reviews have said, you have to replace the cartridge pretty frequently.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but I wished I had ordered the model with the handle - this one is a bit awkward</li>
    <li> For calloused feet, this is fantastic.  Way better than pumice stones, files, razors, etc.  Planning on buying one for my son who apparently inherited my bad feet...</li>
    <li> Love it. I bought the older version but if this one is anything like the old one, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The best product on the market.  Great removing calluses!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Fast delivery</li>
    <li> It is a toy, do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed. I have psoriasis which causes pretty thick callous that burst into cuts so I have to maintain them to avoid that. I have used everything from foot baths, pedicures, Pedi Egg and I bought this in hopes for an easier solution.  I tried using this after shower and before shower and it simply does not have enough power. Applying too much pressure by pushing in stops the spinning. I ground for a very long time and did not really get a return for effort which was my goal in buying this. My feet were smooth but the callous was still there.</li>
    <li> Product worked great and was delivered on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Works well with regular use. Makes my feet feel ultra soft.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift so not sure how this one is but I have bought others and they were great.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, does a good job.</li>
    <li> This device is AWESOME!  Got one for everyone in my family.  Works so great and fast!  Keeps my feet beach ready all year long!</li>
    <li> Works just perfect!  I bought the extra coarse rollers for mine and used those with much satisfaction.  My feet are nice and smooth now.</li>
    <li> It  was not a good  at removing callus</li>
    <li> small, portable and efficient. I use it over a trash can so the dried skin doesn&#x27;t fly everywhere. Wish the rollers lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product I have rough calloused feet and this smooths them right out!</li>
    <li> this little gizmo is fantastic. shaves the rough dry skin right off. my only concern is sand paper roller replacement. It does such a good job that is bound to need replacing soon.</li>
    <li> I love using me Emoji Micro&#x3D;Pedi  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Does what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> Have only used this once and was sceptical but now am a believer.  I don&#x27;t have bad calluses and have been using the Pedi egg but defiantly would recommend this remover.  It says only use 3-4 seconds and was not sure it would really work in that short amount of time but works like magic.  It is definitely messy so use outside or in a tub.  There is a slight tingle on feet after use so would not use it more than the recommended time.  No need to apply pressure.  Easy to clean.  Since I&#x27;ve only had it a couple days do not know how it will hold up but love it so far. Ordered one for my husband who has build up calluses and am anxious to see how it works on his.</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  It works great!</li>
    <li> The absolute best product for dry cracked feet. This on my to buy list for Christmas for everyone, men or women. My feet aren&#x27;t even this smooth after a pedicure!!better than any cream, although I do moisturizer after use.</li>
    <li> Eats batteries. If it&#x27;s not working as well as it should, it&#x27;s probably the battery, not the roller.</li>
    <li> Products works good and with a great price</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, after using this my feet are soft like baby feet, can&#x27;t beat the price, I definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far, but it did a very good job.  It made the bottom of my feet so smooth.  Loved it!</li>
    <li> My feet were dry and very rough with calluses on my big toes.  My doctor told me I needed to take better care of my feet, since I am diabetic.  So I first tried a pumice stone.  That helped a little, but not enough to make a big difference.  So along comes the Emjoi.  The Emjoi Micro-Pedi works well to smooth calluses on my feet.  Used along with lotion, my feet feel much smoother than 2 weeks ago.  I am no longer ashamed to have the doctor examine my feet for diabetic sores, etc.  My only caution is don&#x27;t push too hard or the Emjoi will stop rotating.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped but the product does the job.</li>
    <li> This little device does exactly what they advertise it will do. My feet aren&#x27;t to bad, dry with mild cracks on heels and along the outside of each foot. This removes a lot of dry skin and my large callouses I have on the outside of each big toe. I have tried this on completely dry feet and also on my feet after a warm shower, to soften the skin, and completely dried and the later did not work as well. The softened skin didn&#x27;t shed as easily and the skin kind of got gunked up in the roller.&lt;br /&gt;Order refill rollers when you order this device, I have already gone through one and glad I have the replacements on hand. My feet do feel so much smoother and softer but they still have mild cracks on them. I lotion up very well after and wear cotton socks to bed, the next morning my feet feel like babies skin.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  I have one and am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best callus remover ever! It gets the job done, easy to use and well worth the cost. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This workers wonders. The batteries last and it has power. Makes my heels feel so soft. I can wear saddles again and do not need to smoother my heels in Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I have always gotten calluses on my big toes, and of course the back of my heels were rough.&lt;br /&gt;Always looking for an effective way to smooth these areas and didn&#x27;t find much until I got the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;This really works, I was skeptical, but it really works. Without using a straight razor blade ( like I usually&lt;br /&gt;have done,) Without a  pumice stone that really doesn&#x27;t do much and I cannot stand the feeling !!&lt;br /&gt;This worked, I have smooth feet, it took about  to 10 minutes, maybe. Try it</li>
    <li> You have to replace the blue part after only a few uses. What a rip-off</li>
    <li> great product, great price</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  The vendor was extremely nice and easy to deal with, providing a full refund. but the product just isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;high tech&amp;#34; enough to do anything.  The motor is extremely weak and didn&#x27;t do much of anything; it actually stopped when I put it on my heel.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received it yet, but im sure it will be wonderful, for my feet problem from the nerve damage and diabetes problem</li>
    <li> The callus remover is easy to use and did not irritate my skin in any way.  After one use only, I could feel the difference on the heels of my feet.  I am very pleased with this product.  I think that it works much better than the technicians at the nail salons I have gone to in my city.</li>
    <li> Works great and love it!  Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> The product completely exceeded my expectations. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could claim this simple machine is not exceptional. First of all, it got rid of all my terrible calluses in one use (and it probably took less than 5 minutes!). My heels, especially, were in terrible shape, and I have never had my feet done before, professionally or otherwise. My feet literally look and feel like baby feet (except that they didn&#x27;t become tiny). I totally believed this thing had to be too good to be true. But in fact, it&#x27;s better than advertised. Even on men&#x27;s feet, this machine is amazing (and so easy to use).</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s pretty powerful and removes all rough callus leaving feet feeling smooth. I Just wish the rollers were much bigger and last longer. Within 3 use I have to buy replacement rollers.</li>
    <li> This item is okay.  I am a man with really bad feet, I think that fits many of us here reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item only deserves three stars and here is why.  First, it eats through batteries quick!  I&#x27;ll go through two sets of rechargeables while working on my feet easily.  It really should be a wall ac adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is the scruffing pads.  My feet wear them out quickly.  I bought the roughest sander wheels available (green) and they still are worn out before I can properly remove all the calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that as a maintenance item, this would work well when used weekly.  But the device isn&#x27;t heavy duty enough for gross man feet.  I need courser rollers and I need a wall plug option.  BTW, I didn&#x27;t receive the Nano, but the standard version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I have the larger full version, but Amazon is showing my history as the Micro.  I think its because Amazon started selling this directly while I bought it on Amazon through a seller in the past.</li>
    <li> best thing I have found at removing calluses..</li>
    <li> Best little thing I have ever gotten. My hubby bought this for me at christmas. He didnt realize how much I would love it. It took me a couple of days to get rid of all my old skin but I had years built up on my heels. By day 3 I got baby pink feet. Oh yeah. I love love love this thing. I dont see how it has any bad reviews honestly. Basically dont push down, let it just glide on your heel. Absolutely painless and see amazing results. This is my new best friend, haha</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased for those of us who prefer to do our own pedis.  It removes dead skin and leaves your feet feeling so soft.  I purchased the extra rollers also and they are a snap to change out. The roller does last through many pedicures.  Defiantly a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Love this.  My feet are looking so good!</li>
    <li> I love this little thing....&lt;br /&gt;Just some heads up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers appear to get &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; pretty quickly, but you can wash them and they return almost perfect, otherwise you would need to change them quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a LOT of power, but you don&#x27;t want either, you don&#x27;t want to go through you feet with a grinder... sometimes it takes a little extra time to go thoroughly through your feed, but the result is REALLY good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider that corded one, which I assume is more powerful, but the convenience of the cordless is hard to beat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I strongly advice this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS when you buy it, buy some extra rolls, you will need them no matter what!</li>
    <li> It definitely works better than ped egg but still could use some improvements</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she used it one time and it broke and she was very upset and needless to say I had to buy her another gift.</li>
    <li> It works really great.  Heels are now smooth.</li>
    <li> The callus remover is wonderful for removing hard, dead skin.  Be sure you read directions and are careful how much you &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; off.  I found this model extremely hard to hold with my arthritic hands.  The slimmer models are MUCH easier for me to hold and use.</li>
    <li> This works very good just don&#x27;t take off to much.</li>
    <li> I am extremely please with this product . It really works.</li>
    <li> I saw the Emjoi on QVC and decided to check out Amazon.  Glad I did...this unit is the newest model and was cheaper and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and the design fits well in my hand.  Amazon even has off-brand replacement rollers in different roughness and multi-packs.  Received very quickly and quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This was terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great gift item, great price, and very useful.</li>
    <li> When this was advertised as &amp;#34;Powerful&amp;#34;, they weren&#x27;t kidding! I HAD terrible calluses on my feet and now they&#x27;re smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! Just be careful not to overdo it! Be sure to read the directions because it works really fast !</li>
    <li> Being the sceptic that I am I was prepared to be a bit disappointed in spite of all the great reviews this got. I gave my daughter one for Christmas this past year and she said she liked it a lot. I have gone barefoot around the house and yard my whole life and sometimes I felt like I had Velcro strips on the bottom of my feet when I walked across the carpet:)  And so, because I had been undecided for over a year I finally decided..&#x27;what the hay&#x27; it&#x27;s worth a try. Now I can only say &#x27;why didn&#x27;t I get this over a year ago or four years ago or six years ago or....&#x27; Well, you get the point. I really am pleasantly surprised with the instant results. No more &#x27;velcro&#x27; feet:D  Go ahead..get it! I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> My wife is a dancer and the bottoms of her feet get so callous,this product makes short work of it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for years...  This foot sander works wonderfully!!!!!  Got to tell you, that you will love this thing!!!  It is NO work to sandyour feet with it and it has my feet really smooth and no cracks!!!  Love it!!!  Thank you</li>
    <li> this item was horrible, this did absolutely nothing for my calluses sometimes I wonder if the reviews are real, the last time I put in a review they seller removed it, hope it stays this time around would I recommend? no way I want to get a full refund, this looks like a toy and feels like one not worth the time of day, this deserves 0 stars but I see that that is not an option so I gave it a 1</li>
    <li> my feet are softer than ever!</li>
    <li> The absolute best product for smoothing rough, yucky, heels!😎.  This little item is sooooooo effective you will be glad you bought it.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this machine, it works really well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful gadget....I use it on my legs as well...recommend!</li>
    <li> nice- really works! Take a hot bath and then use this to get those tootsies really soft and smooth. You can also use it around your toe and finger cuticles for a really nice manicured look.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Maybe mine was defective?</li>
    <li> works better than expected. When it arrived I was a little concerned because it is very small. But then using it on my feet, it outperformed my wildest expectations. I used it a few days in a row because I did not want to remove too much at one time.&lt;br /&gt;It makes heels and toes very smooth, not comparable to using a sanding stone (or what ever they are called).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I used it now for a month and the original sander is still in good shape. I ordered 4 more just in case, but these will probably last for a few years. You will not use this thing every day anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it, dont push too hard, it will remove dead skin even when you just roll it over a few times. And use per instructions, not to sand in one spot for more than 3-4 seconds. (It can get hot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click on the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button below. Thank you</li>
    <li> Does a great job.  Wish I had bought it long ago.</li>
    <li> Love it as far as taking the dead skin away, but I find that you have to refill more frequently then I would like and the battery life is something to be desired but overall very good product and between this and the foot cream with booties my feet look and feel better all the time.</li>
    <li> WOW!  This is one grooming product that every woman needs to own.  As a Type II diabetic, it&#x27;s important that I not only watch my diet, but take really good care of my feet for continued health and well-being.  The Emjoi Micro-Pedi takes care of any rough spots, callus and or heel problems before they become a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can wear open-toed sandals, sling-back pumps or any other revealing shoe without worry--because my feet look and feel healthy. The cost of this little miracle is much, much lower than a visit to your local podiatrist and helps you to feel confident that your grooming needs are met.</li>
    <li> If you have dry feet from hell like I have dry feet from hell, you NEED this. My only regret is that I bought the battery powered model, not the corded one. This one is less expensive but I am kind of burning through batteries and they will definitely make up for the cost difference! Oh well... I still love this gadget.</li>
    <li> So far so good. You have to use it frquently.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be.  Guess I have pretty tough calouses</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for my birthday since I have so many foot callus tools that don&#x27;t do a great job. OMG - this is perfect! My feet are so soft and this is small enough to travel with! I love it and will buy more for presents! It doesn&#x27;t tLe a lot if pressure - the lighter the better! I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Disappointed, kind of lost strength after a short while, but outside the allowed two week return period.</li>
    <li> Not a lot of power, but my batteries were weak, so I will retry</li>
    <li> Love this gave these out for the holidays to the ladies. Feed back was great from them as well. 😎</li>
    <li> Wife Loves it but order new rollers for it the wear out after about 3 or 4 uses .</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this because of some of the neutral or negative reviews.  My feet were extra bad after a weekend at the beach and I used this - AMAZING.  So worth the money, even with the fairly expensive replacements, considering it&#x27;s at least $40 per manicure otherwise.</li>
    <li> smooths the area nicely</li>
    <li> I have tried several different products with no results until I received the Emjoi....it&#x27;s perfect and my feet are finally smooth.  I use it nightly and it took about 4 days to really start to feel and see results.  Great power with just batteries.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> product seems to work pretty well. would recommend to a friend.......</li>
    <li> Works really well, I love it!</li>
    <li> Good product, very satisfy with it.</li>
    <li> Especially useful for people who develop calloused areas on heals, toes, or even hands.  Much better compared to other methods.  Faster compared to using the cosmetic &#x27;rasp&#x27; tools.  Quickly removes the area needing attention quickly and makes it easier not to remove too much causing possible bleeding.</li>
    <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;would buy again does just what is says it will do&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about get more for family !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in the habit of writing reviews about stuff...but, for this super-gadget I just had to comment.&lt;br /&gt;  I inherited sandpaper feet from my dad. My feet could sand down a floor as well as any belt sander.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and all brands of  &#x27;guaranteed to work&#x27; creams, ointments, and a large variety of other gunky stuff.  If only I&#x27;d known about this product.&lt;br /&gt;  I used it immediately after I received it. OMG!!! This is the greatest thing in my life...I live a very simple life and get excited about the weirdest things...but anyway, if you have the WORST sandpaper feet in the neighborhood, get this!!&lt;br /&gt;  I used both the blue sander when I got it, then the next morning I used the black one. (it comes with this particular model) I&#x27;m going to use it till the soles of my feet are down to the bone. It&#x27;s addictive. I hope there&#x27;s a recovery program for this. 12 &#x27;steps&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;  Well, I&#x27;m through rambling...thank you for your attention.</li>
    <li> I wear dress shoes in tropical southeast asia every day.  I think the combination of dress socks and shoes and humidity caused my heel callouses to grow out of control.  I have thick rough armor on my heels now.  I went once to a spa to have it shaved off with a razor, which worked, but was expensive and inconvenient.  And I don&#x27;t think I can reach all the angles on my heels to use the razor device myself. So I went with this.  I would say it works about 80% as good as shaving it of with a razor.  My feet aren&#x27;t new skin smooth, but it grinds down the thick scales to where it is smooth and pretty soft.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers get used up pretty fast, so buy them in bulk here on Amazon.  And I agree with another reviewer, get the most coarse.  You wouldn&#x27;t be using this device if you only had minor callouses.</li>
    <li> This thing REALLY works!  I have used the ped egg and it was a 3 out of 10 this is a 10 out of 10!  No matter what I do to my feet the are just naturally rough.  I used it the first day I received it and fell in love.  I joined the free membership club and also purchased another grit for my husband.  I&#x27;m now foot ready for the summer.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the fastest or most powerful item around, but it does safely remove the wife&#x27;s callus... which is better than watching her scrape it off.  I think she would recommend this for the price.</li>
    <li> These things really do get the hard skin off of your feet.  Work great and I&#x27;ve bought them for three people I know and they all rave about it.</li>
    <li> works good but does not last long. Have to use more offten</li>
    <li> This is my first ever negative review on amazon! Talk about getting ripped off. This product is so horrible at the one job it&#x27;s supposed to do it&#x27;s ridiculous. However I&#x27;m not going to rant and rave about my experience with it. Ive asked fr a refund hopefully they will give my money back. Bad product at a high price.</li>
    <li> Incredible!  I was tired of constantly using the manual heel smoother, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I am so impressed!  It did a thorough job, was gentle, and never slowed as I applied pressure.  This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just alright, takes forever to make any noticeable improvement on calluses.</li>
    <li> This is my second Emjoi micro pedi.  I bought the first one with the handle and found it to be awkward to hold.  This &amp;#34;latest edition&amp;#34; is much better. Easier to hold and maneuver around my heels.  It works better than I could have hoped for.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews that say the refills are expensive.  I just run the roller under warm water  and am still using the original refill.  I use it about twice a month.</li>
    <li> I really like this thing. Finally I don&#x27;t have to rub my feet raw with the file brush. I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy another refill so fast. That&#x27;s the deal with this, you have to buy refill rollers.</li>
    <li> I will have to try the more coarse heads.  The ones that come with it work well but not good enough for my callouses.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Actually enjoy using.  Much better than using a foot file/rasp.  And it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly in the mail and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!  I have tried everything...e v e r y t h I n g  for my feet. I am on my feet a lot and wear flip flops all the time. I always end up with elephant heels! I have even gone as so far as taking a one edged razor to my feet, they get that bad. The skin gets So thick and cracked.  One session with this and my feet are So much better! Easy to use, great results. I use it when my feet are totally dry. The roller it came with worked well, but I did order some of the super coarse rollers as well. So very happy with this callus remover.</li>
    <li> This did indeed remove dead skin on my heels and the white flakes in the (dry) bathtub proved it.  But, I still had ridges, dried crevasses or whatever you would call it.  Maybe my heels are just terrible, but they didn&#x27;t look like the perfectly smooth, pink heels showed in the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture on the advertisement.  I noticed that Amazon sells grittier roller replacement rolls.  Maybe I&#x27;m just a person that needs the mega-gritty rolls.  This device is better that using a hand callus remover, for sure, but not as good as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This really works! Be sure to put a towel under your foot because the callus dust is going to be heavy!</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s works fine for the dead skin on my heels but really hasn&#x27;t helped my callus.  For the hard callus, I&#x27;m going back to my pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Love it! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Pretty easy to use. I used it as soon as I got it and you do see and feel a difference instantly. I like that you can use it on dry skin makes it convenient.</li>
    <li> DW is thrilled with the thing. I had to perform a pro on her at first because she was skeptical...But she was sold when she saw the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought my wife many things during our long marriage.&lt;br /&gt;Jewelry, cars, me ....&lt;br /&gt;She is the most excited over this item, than any of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t necessarily look like the one posted.  But it works great and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is very nice, will clean up your feet very good.  Would recomend it to everyone needing to remove dead skin on your feet.  Received it on time.</li>
    <li> Love it... Works great.</li>
    <li> All there is to be said about this device is, if you need callouses gently removed very efficiently, then this is it.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it!!!  Order the extra coarse rollers.  They work even better than the ones that come with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, powerful even with the battery</li>
    <li> I do like the product, however it would have been nice if they had placed an extra roller that wasn&#x27;t so fine.  It takes at least 10-15min. on each foot to get skin really soft.</li>
    <li> Work just as advertise</li>
    <li> I love it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this callus remover with hesitation.  I am so glad I got this!  I love it!  It removes all the callus&#x27;s quickly.  The skin becomes dust so make sure you use it in an easy clean up area.  Becareful, you don&#x27;t go to long in one area.  I would recommend getting the extra rollers too.  It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Callouses return almost 24 hours later thicker than ever</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my heels. If your heels are in bad shape like mine, you need a razor blade, not this soft gentle stuff.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that you cannot put much pressure when applying this to your feet or it will simply stop.  It does the job but takes a while.</li>
    <li> My feet love these. I wear sandals all the time and in the winter, even pedicures weren&#x27;t getting rid of the ugly calluses.  These do a great job, painlessly.  They never take off too much and leave my heels sore.I bought 6 of these as gifts for friends this year.  My friends are now my BFF&#x27;s because of the Emjoi.</li>
    <li> This works really well. Hope the rollers last a while.</li>
    <li> Great product to get dry skin off your heels and make yor feet feel smoother and lie new skin.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought this for mom at her request.  She says it does her feet very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, she says it&#x27;s very slow, and she doesn&#x27;t like that.  Also, the cartridges don&#x27;t last that long and they&#x27;re pricey to replace.</li>
    <li> So far so good as advertised. Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Best gadget ever!! Removes callouses just like I went for a pedicure without exposure to all that weird bacteria.  Plus, a lot cheaper and I can do it at home.  I just have to do my own polish and not worry about getting home in the snow.</li>
    <li> This thing is wonderful.  My feet are so smooth and pretty since I got this.  Get some extra roller things for it especially if you have a lot of work to do.</li>
    <li> Works great does an amazing job!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Leave my feet really soft!</li>
    <li> For the last couple of years, had this callus that was big and getting thicker. The last several months it has been VERY painful. I tried the callus removers that helped to some extent, but never enough. Plus, they occasionally burned parts that didn&#x27;t have calluses. I read about this on some forum (not sure where) after some desperation and frustration with not being able to get rid of my callus. I decided to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all the time I spent with other things, within seconds, this callus was ground down to a comfortable level. And the next day, it actually came off the rest of the way (probably from when it was loosed by the callus removers). I was absolutely ecstatic. It&#x27;s great to be able to walk without a limp because of the callus pain, and would recommend this to anyone that has problems with that. It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Works very well- still on the first grindwheel.</li>
    <li> Great simple system for callus removal. Prior to use, soak areas in water for 15 minutes. Do some treatment each day, don&#x27;t try to remove too much callous at one time This unit has good power and does not stall the motor even if moderate pressure is applied to the skin to increase the friction during callous removal.</li>
    <li> Works better than pumice stone my pedicurist uses! Easy to use and I&#x27;ve already purchased replacement rollers and purchased one for both my daughters!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and the recipient absolutely loved it.  I love my own Micro-Pedi and have given it as a gift many times.  Not one complaint!!!  First, it works great!!  Second, it is an unusual gift and something every woman can use.  What is funny is that I always give it to a girlfriend and their husband&#x27;s end up using it too!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, perfect condition.  Makes feet soft quickly. Creates a bit of a mess, not much.  Best used over the tub, prior to shower.</li>
    <li> Smooth feet in seconds and so much fun to use, makes you want more dry skin to use more! Incredible product!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use....does what it is suppose to do</li>
    <li> This thing really works well.  I can go a lot longer between pedicures.  Love this new toy.</li>
    <li> Works rather slowly. A friend of mine loves it but I am not crazy about it.</li>
    <li> functional, but not functional perfect.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with how simple this is to use.  One does need to be careful because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing much but it really is.  The amount of dead skin powder was amazing.  So, I do know it was working great.  It was easier and in my mind safer than the little pedi-egg thing.  I&#x27;ve used that in the past, but the pedi-egg takes chunks of skin and can cut through the callus too easily causing cuts.  This is more like the file part of the pedi-egg but as it is motorized, it works quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with my feet for years now, and have found this tool to be very helpful in getting rid of those rough spots.  Have to apply foot cream when done with the callus remover.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work well even when not being held tight.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.  I read all the reviews an thought a lite touch would work; but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> see posting on rollers  Got rid of calluses that no pedicure had ever been able to do for years. Now foot is callus free with just once a week touch ups</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this device and as I stated, buy extra rollers because you will use this repeatedly as you get to softer layer of the foot. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love the emjoi.This was a gift to myself. It is a great invention. It makes my feet feel great!</li>
    <li> Wow all adults should have one of these. It works very well. I bought some for daughters.they all said they really liked the emjoi</li>
    <li> Cool product, works good. I like it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  Maybe my feet are beyond help but it does do much for me.  I use a less expensive callus remover and it does a better job.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Like a professional pedicure --- maybe better. No pain; easy to use; quick; gets off all callouses readily. I have never had any device remove callouses as effectively as this. Buy immediately!</li>
    <li> This is a nice concept with short comings.  It is easy to handle and does the job, albeit very slowly.  Two AA batteries power the rotating sanding rollers and that&#x27;s why this unit falls short.  It is just not powerful enough.  It bogs down easily and frequently.  It take a deft touch to use.  Yes it does slowly sand away the calloused skin, you can see the fine skin dust falling off while working it.  It just needed to be designed with D or C cells for more power and torque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, easy to change out the sanding cartridges.  Too bad it falls short in the power dept.</li>
    <li> I have suffered for years with horrible crusty heals. I had seen this item before and decided to buy it.  My lord I couldn&#x27;t believe how much dried built up skin came off and I used the foot creamm that I ordered with it.. My feet are getting ready for sandals. Great product . My daughter hads one and loves it.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it said it works great.</li>
    <li> I love it much easier than the pedegg.</li>
    <li> Keeps my feet softer longer, especially in between pedicures.  Just ordered the replacement rollers because I don&#x27;t want to be without them when the original roller has run it&#x27;s course.</li>
    <li> Has the Ped Egg beaten by a mile.</li>
    <li> Very Good. But I wish it would come with more refill rollers.</li>
    <li> I love this product and think it&#x27;s worth every penny!! Living in Phoenix, my feet get dry and cracked. I started using this along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Foot Creme and my feet look fantastic! I did buy the super coarse green refills and only paid $15 for four so I am not sure why people are gripping about the costs. That is a heck of a lot cheaper than regular pedicures!</li>
    <li> Best device I&#x27;m aware of for removing skin.</li>
    <li> got item on time and very easy to handle it. works good. thank you</li>
    <li> Works great yet gently on calluses.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle ....after years of razors, ped eggs. my husband&#x27;s sandpaper (very awkward), pumice stones, foot soaks...finally an easy to use product.  My new Christmas gift!  I use it before a shower...the accumulated dust is washed away...moisturize and put on socks.  The sanded foot dust is very drying so be sure to wash your feet afterward.  Those over 70 years old will find this very helpful.  Good foot care is essential for the seniors!</li>
    <li> This really works! Love it,</li>
    <li> Seriously this thing is Amazing!!!!The description says Gently and effectively buffs away rough, dry and calloused skin in seconds- this is 100% true. I got mine today and it works wonder first I no longer have easy access to a salon for mani/pedi not to mention that is costly when I can find on so this thing is a life save. I used it on my foor and some other rough areas of skin on my hand and toyes. There really is nothing left to say it is AMAZING and I am here to by replacement sander rolls...I have already killed 2 pairs of batteries...yeah I am putting it to work!!</li>
    <li> WORKS OK, HAS DIFFICULT WITH LARGER CALLUSES AND ANNOYING THAT IT DOESNT WORK WHEN YOU PUSH DOWN BECAUSE BY INSTINCT  THATS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOURE TRYING TO GET OFF A TOUGH CALLUS. WOULDN&#x27;T BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> great price, does the job perfectly, and safely.</li>
    <li> Works great  Perfect and works so much faster than using a file.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to buy one, this is wonderful.  Now I would compare the softness of my feet to any two year old.</li>
    <li> Got one for my girlfriend and 1 for her daughter. They love it.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  It is comfortable to hold, has great ability to zero in on one specific area without going so fast that you risk injury.  Leaves my feet smooth and callous free and the roller has no wear after quite a few uses.</li>
    <li> Just buy it! It really works- I used it on myself, and it was amazing! Very little effort produced super smooth- sandal ready feet (if it ever stops snowing)! Then I changed the roller and used it on my husband- perfect!! I had that battery operated PediSpin which had no power and stopped with even the slightest pressure. This is entirely different- it is powerful, and the roller looks like it will last through several treatments- if you use it regularly- you&#x27;ll just need touch-ups.  I am recommending this to everyone! If you want pretty, smooth and HAPPY feet- look no further! Fast shipping too!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and I to use and it does a great job. Thinking about buying another one.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Seller was very quick to ship. Very well priced and it works wonderfully. I like that it has a little cover for the roller when it&#x27;s not being used unlike the other $50 model. I also like the feel of it in my hand. It&#x27;s small and easy to handle. It works really well on my calluses. I even used it a bit on a thick toenail I have to thin it out a bit. I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t  pay attention to the negative reviews. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is so close to a 5 star rating! I love it and it worked well on my husband&#x27;s feet also. I am very happy with this product. I have only used it twice, but it will be a continual ritual to my foot grooming. The batteries are still going after 3 uses, so that is nice. I was afraid I would have to stock up on endless AA batteries, but they are lasting quite a while. This is so much safer than the product I was using. I don&#x27;t feel like I am going to hurt myself, as it is so easy to use, and there is no cutting on my foot..</li>
    <li> love this  bought many as gifts also  works  great  !!</li>
    <li> I have always had calloused feet and I&#x27;m a young adult. I get pedicures once a month and the nail ladies have to scrub all the dead skin off my feet. With my job, I&#x27;m constantly on my feet and I wear flip flops daily during the summer. I bought this and I use it once a week. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and I haven&#x27;t had to buy a new replacement roller yet. It really does work and removes the dead skin but I would also recommend using a foot lotion afterwards and wearing socks to keep your skin soft.</li>
    <li> Love this! Why did it take so long for me to find this? Works great on my dry feet!!!!</li>
    <li> shaves well but requires new roller blades after a few months. Purchased new roller blades: 4 for $30 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Does make the skin on your feet smoother.  Doesn&#x27;t remove skin as quickly as the egg with metal scraper.  However, it would also be really, really hard (maybe impossible) to hurt yourself by accidentally removing too much skin, as can happen with the egg if you&#x27;re not careful.  The egg also doesn&#x27;t really leave your feet smooth, it just kind of roughly takes off the dead skin.  I ordered the extra extra course rollers--the best ones are the knock offs, they are coarser than the brand name.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, and I had to change the batteries already.  It was still working, but I felt it was kind of getting less effective.  When I changed the batteries, it definitely began doing a better job.  It takes a really long time to really do a thorough job on your feet.  I spent a good 30-40 minutes using it today.  My feet are less rough--I&#x27;d even say they&#x27;re smooth, but they&#x27;re not perfect--they still have some tough skin. I still like this thing, because I&#x27;m not aware of anything else out there that&#x27;s better at this point.  If someone is, please tell me!!!  This thing works OK on my feet, but to put a dent in my husband&#x27;s elephant-skin feet, I think would take days, maybe longer.  He did give it a whirl, but it wasn&#x27;t really strong enough to get through his thick callouses.  My feet aren&#x27;t as bad as his because I use the egg periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I allowed the skin to fall onto a flat surface so I could see how much this machine was getting off my feet.  After 40 minutes, there was a pile of skin flakes.  However, not as much as the pile that builds up inside the egg when I&#x27;ve used it.  And that I can do in 5 minutes or less.  Plus, I felt like I could have continued to use it, it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t have all day to give myself a pedicure, so I kind of stopped because I hadn&#x27;t allocated that much of my day to working on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the manufacturers...this thing needs to be more powerful, and the rollers need to be rougher.  I know you probablydon&#x27;t make it more powerful, because you&#x27;re afraid brain-cell-challenged people will hurt themselves, so you made it perfectly safe.  Those of us with brain cells, would prefer the option of a more powerful/effective machine, that would allow us to complete the job more effectively and in less time.  We&#x27;re very busy people.  We&#x27;re busy using our brain cells, and out earning a living so that we can afford to buy your foot pedicure products.  We don&#x27;t have 40 minutes a day to spend removing the dead skin from our feet.  How about you make one that will effectively do this in 5 minutes?  We&#x27;ll sign a waiver, and use it at our own risk.  You don&#x27;t see the egg-manufacturers getting sued, do you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum...not the be-all, end-all, but in my opinion, worth having.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and I will continue to use it.  Maybe the best thing to do is use the egg first, then smooth your feet out with this after you finish?  Wish someone would make one product strong enough to really get your feet smooth and soft.  But, at the end of the day, if you have a little extra time. you might be pleased with how this thing takes the rough edges off the heals of your feet.</li>
    <li> This is a moderately effective tool, but my little Dremel tool has a stronger motor and cheaper roller parts.  The only advantage to the Emjoi design is that it covers a wider area due to larger roll.  Would not recommend it over a Dremel.</li>
    <li> Works awesome!! Make sure to buy replacement file drums though..</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the price and product</li>
    <li> This is quick and easy and effortless to use. I wasn&#x27;t sure after one use, but it&#x27;s so easy that you can use for a few minutes a few times a week. No more fumbling around with pumice stones and things that hurt. This thing is awesome. I have soft feet and it was easy!</li>
    <li> This is the best pedicure tool I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
    <li> Great item and so comfortable to hold when using.  Small and compact and certainly does the job. Being diabetic and suffering with hard skin I would highly recommend this item just don&#x27;t over use it and use a good foot conditioning cream after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the rage is about this thing but I had high hopes. It&#x27;s just ok. It takes forever to get down to the soft skin. And I don&#x27;t have particularly calluosed heals. I bought the extra rough inserts which didn&#x27;t seem to be any big deal. I would say that if I had know how many batteries you go through - I would have spent the extra money and bought the one with the cord.  Maybe that one has better power. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing</li>
    <li> This was a major disappointment. Stopped working after third use. Even if it had continued to work, however, I would not have spent $25 on it again. Not very powerful. Buy a $1 pumice stone instead.</li>
    <li> I have heels that will crack and bleed if not taken care of on a very regular basis.  This tool is amazing!  It is easy to use, just powerful enough to do the job, but doesn&#x27;t hurt or overdo the job and cause tender spots.  I love it and would strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> So much better than other products so take care of smoothing your feet.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it.</li>
    <li> which I have taken over for myself.  This is the coolest device and so much easier to use than the pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Good prodect with good safety feature of stopping when too much pressure applied. Convenient and easy to use. Maybe a bigger roller would be an improvement.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for heel cracks.  Scrapers, creams, pedicures, the egg, emery boards, cheese grater scrapers.  This is by far the best item I have ever purchased for my heels.  Could not believe it would work on dry skin.  Leaves the heels in perfect condition.  I would give it ten stars if possible !</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of buying this. I thought it was just another beauty gadget to take my money. After doing a little research and watching a few YouTube videos, I decided to buy it. It works exactly like it says it does. My heels were really calloused and cracked (even though I use a foot file on them daily). After one use, I was really impressed with the difference it made. After three uses, I have one tiny crack left on my heel. Other than that one small crack (which I expect to be gone in the next use or two), my feet look like a baby&#x27;s feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews saying this product was a piece of junk and stops working with the slightest amount of pressure. This is true. If you push on your foot with it, it will stop working. You do not need to apply pressure. It is very effective by gently gliding it over your feet. It will gross you out to see the amount of dead skin this removes.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying the one which plugs in and not this one that uses batteries, so I was a little disappointed when I first got it.  And it surely bogged downs if you start pressing too hard.  But it surely did the trick.  I am diabetic so I needed something that was safe to use on my feet and I am also obese so I needed something that I could use and it would work fairly quickly before I started cramping up.  This surely does that.  I am not looking at the one that is a little longer and bigger and also plugged into AC.  I might get that one also.</li>
    <li> This device works well. I also ordered the extreme callus roller for better&lt;br /&gt;removal of dead skin. I like this device</li>
    <li> I would reccomand this product to others. It matches all the descriptions from the seller. The only down side is the battery usage issues</li>
    <li> Product came in on time and lived up to its advertizing!! It cleaned the calluses off with no pain. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with my feet always being soft and well groomed. This makes it easier to either do my day to day buffing at home or keep them up in between pedicures. I am buying some as gifts!  It&#x27;s so easy to use. The piles of foot powder it makes is just crazy!  I use it every other night while I watch tv before bed so I go to bed with soft feet. I have a satin comforter and any sort of roughness grabs on it. Never again with the micropedi buffer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Emjoi for this!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t know diabetic can&#x27;t use this , I did now my feet are very dry.</li>
    <li> I need to order more supplies.  It should come with additional ones.</li>
    <li> This is very gently and does a fabulous job at removing the callouses. I have used it on my husband and he was pleasantly surpised at the gentleness to remove the rough callouses. He is diabetic and it&#x27;s important to keep his feet free of them - because he&#x27;ll go too long and then they crack open and he really has a problem. I was removing them the haed way with one of the hand type scrapers. There was a time or two when it scraped too much in an area.So he is please that this takes extremely little effort for great results. You&#x27;ll wonder why you waited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;So, ladies and gents- this item is well worth the money, especially since a single pedicure costs about the same !</li>
    <li> Works as designed.  I thought the comments about not having enough  power are false.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Love it.. Better than any professional. Good power.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom.  She uses it every night. Just as good as the ones twice the price.  Has changed foot are forever.  If you are very careful, can be a great tool for Diabetes Foot Care.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a real time saver. The path to a woman&#x27;s heart starts at her feet. ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I trusted the brand. I have a new emjoi epilator and it is amazing. But it took me 30 minutes per foot to remove all the dead skin. I have a hand-held screen that works much faster. The other problem is that only a small part of the abrasive part is exposed so it is difficult to get the right angle on some parts of my foot. Needless to say I returned it right away.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Like it very much.It does a good job.I am baying it for my mom and sister to. Would recommend if you do pedicure yourself.</li>
    <li> works great, but the calluses seem to come right back. :(&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t think this would be a daily or weekly thing I&#x27;d need to do.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll live with the calluses.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, buyer beware, this leaves a TON of fine dust on the floor when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to lay a towel down before beginning.</li>
    <li> great product much cheaper here than anywhere else I saw it, wifey has now got soft feet!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Top 5 product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from anyone anywhere. I get pedicures every 2-3 weeks and always have hard heel skin that is never totally removed. 5 minutes with this product, my feet are smooth like a child&#x27;s. It&#x27;s unbelievably effective and is truly priceless. I would pay many times the price to replace this. Nothing works this well and I&#x27;m finally proud of how my feet feel. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been a Master Esthetician for 30+ years and I have tried everything to sand the dead dry skin off my clients feet. I cannot number the hundreds of pedicures over that time and I really don&#x27;t like the workout any more. I saw this product and read the reviews and made the decision to make this purchase. THE BEST PURCHASE I HAVE MADE IN 30 YEARS, FOR PEDICURES. I am purchasing several more for my business. (Just an FYI for the 1star review, don&#x27;t press hard, or it will bog down. Use very little pressure and it will sand the dry dead skin off of each foot in about 1 minute)</li>
    <li> Since I am a distance competitve runner, I have to take good care of my feet.  This little device for sanding the calluses from the bottom really works well and makes the process much easier.  I highly recommend this and my wife was so impressed that she ordered one for herself.</li>
    <li> Keeps my feet smooth!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Neat little &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;. Had been using a file to keep my feet soft but this is much better. You just gently hold it against the skin/callus area for it to be effective -- unlike a file that needs some &amp;#34;elbow grease&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love it-- no more filing my heels! It&#x27;s everything I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> works fantastic, my feet have never been smoother</li>
    <li> Easy to handle.  I do prefer original, but have no complaints with this different shaped Emjoi.  It does the job very well.  And in far less time than with a board.</li>
    <li> I have had a nerosis problem with the pads below my big toe for about five years. It changed my life. I quit working out and running after about fighting it for 3 months. Went to the top pediatrist in town several times. The last visit he told me I would have this problem for the rest of my life and if I could keeep the calus that forms filed down and wore the right shoes it would help. The pain was still there 3 years laters and I have tried everything, it feels like. People will always have their individual opion on all products but for me the Emjoi has been a life saver. I walked barefoot for the first time in 5 years without pain last week. I started walking again 2 weeks ago for the first time in probably 4 years without pain. I am using this about once a week because it removes a lot of skin/calus quickly and use Gold Bond Ultimate cream afterwards. Feeling very blessed to found this product!</li>
    <li> Does the job easily for the cost of a pedicure!</li>
    <li> It did not work well for me and I read the other reviews and not one person told the truth</li>
    <li> This little thing is terrific.  I use it inbetween pedis and keep your heels smooth.  I use it with o&#x27;keefes healthy foot cream.  In my opinion, beats the heck out of the ped egg which used to tear my skin.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Received this today &amp; it is fabulous!!!  I&#x27;ve always had issues with the heals of my feet, being dry &amp; cracked &amp; have tried everything.  After seeing a similar product on a TV, searched for it on Amazon &amp; after reading the reviews, chose this one.  Never, did I imagine, having soft heals on my feet.  I can now wear sandles with confidence.</li>
    <li> good product,my wife like it very much.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the performance of this little device!  I didn&#x27;t think it would work half as good as it does.  For sure worth the purchase if you need a product like this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my rough heels. I just put a small trash can under my foot when I get ready to do my heels as it does shave the dead skin off. That way all the residue is already cleaned up. It leaves my heels very smooth. I put lotion on afterwards followed by my favorite pair of aloe socks. My feet have been pampered for the day! Oh, I let my sister use it and she liked it so much that I bought her one also!</li>
    <li> I chose this product after reading many reviews.  It works great and I would recommend it anyone who wants to have smooth feet.</li>
    <li> Wife doesn&#x27;t know how she lived without it! I hear how great it is every time she uses it! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the PedEgg for years and like it fine but thought I&#x27;d try this and have been delighted with it...smooth tootsies, quick clean up. Use it over the trash can or you will get debris on the floor.</li>
    <li> I am a yoga instructor and we spend a lot of time in bare feet so I am very careful to keep my feet looking good.  This was a constant struggle with my heels especially in the summer.  I have tried so many things and to an extent they all worked but it was a real struggle and I thought I was doing ok with it until I tried the Emjoi.  This little device it the BEST!!  From the moment I started using it I realized I had finally found the answer.  I have used it for 4 days now, my feet have never felt better.  The only reason I have used 4 days in a row is because I wanted to take it slow as to not do too much at once but I am slowly becoming obsessed.  I have already ordered some replacement rolls.  I didn&#x27;t need them yet but I just wanted to make sure to have them available when it&#x27;s time. I plan on telling everyone I know about this tool and I cannot say enough about how happy I am with it!!!!  Finallly</li>
    <li> Does not work as great as I had hoped but it is a good product!</li>
    <li> This little gadget and some moisturizer after using allows me to have baby soft feet.  No more pedicures for me.  I could do better myself now!</li>
    <li> The so called \\&quot;powerful emjoi micro pedi\\&quot; is a horrible product which does not do what it is suppose to do!Firstly, when I try to shave calluses from the bottom of my feet even the tiniest bit of pressure stops the machine from rotating. Secondly you can not use this on wet feet. So, think about it when you&#x27;re feet are wet your callus is soft because it was in water for good amount of time. So on dry feet it can hardly remove any dry and hard callus. Finally, No matter how long I sit down and try to remove my callus, it does not work. If you want my honest opinion \\&quot;PEDEGG\\&quot; is awesome. It is a manual callus remover and it works. Come to think of it any manual remover is better than this junk. At least with a manual you can apply as much or as little pressure you want. All you need to do is find the right one. Hope this helped. I am going back to PEDEGG!</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a week now and I love it. Works great. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> My heels have never looked better. Easy to use and I can see results immediately.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Item arrived promptly and has been used consistently every day or two.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is his wife writing. Don&#x27;t know how I made it without this thing. My feet feel like satin lol! It has even improved the feeling in my husband&#x27;s diabetic feet. I highly recommend this for anyone into foot care. If your feet are originally rough like mine (hard, calloused, and cracked lol) then I recommend you purchase the &amp;#34;extreme coarse&amp;#34; stone to use initially. It&#x27;ll get to work on ya! I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about every callus softener and foot treatment you can think of. Finally something that works.Just a few passes and it removes calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The little unit is comfortable to hold . The rollers and batteries are easy to change. Be sure to use fresh batteries.</li>
    <li> My fiance decided to try this and she loved it. Definitely had good power and she still uses i to this day. It does go through batteries fairly quickly but it does a pretty good job otherwise.</li>
    <li> I now have touchable feet and soft.  I would recommend this product to every woman for that&lt;br /&gt;sexy sandal look.</li>
    <li> This item is the truth!!! Does exactly as promised.  It is completely painless and gentle.  I work out quite a bit and my heels get very dry and flaky.  This has made them softer after the first use.  I follow up with a good heel balm.  I am going to upgrade to a larger one as my husband has confiscated this one - definitely need 2 for the house after it catches on.  Yes, please buy this - you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT, THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this instrument.  I think a couple of rollers should be I clouded withe the order.</li>
    <li> Powerful?  Are you kidding me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue thing spins around and that is all it does for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry skin (if it comes off) comes off as a small amount of white powder.  But a pummel stone.  You will do a better job!! at far less cost.</li>
    <li> Like, but could love it if it didn&#x27;t cut my foot. I don&#x27;t have any callus it did an awesome job at getting my feet soft, but the roller pinched skin inside the roller and scraped my skin. To strong for me I will get a roller that is for softer skin, because the roller does not look like it will last long. It&#x27;s fast but I will need practice to controll it better and not scrape my thin skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product ..does exactly as advertised ..was tired of getting callus removing pedicure done and with it also the effect would only last a week or so ..did the pedicure using this and it&#x27;s been a month and my feet still feel nice and soft.highly recommended</li>
    <li> This really does work and it is so very easy to use.  The refills last a long time.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> works great!!! DEAD SKIN BYE!!!</li>
    <li> A gentle, yet effective way to clean up the heel of feet, etc.  If used occasionally, can help keep feet from snagging on socks.  I am looking forward to using alot in sandal weather.</li>
    <li> this works great at removing calluses, however the on/off switch is hard to use, so I remove the batteries when not in use as I have trouble turning it on and off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve tried other methods but this works the best. I have already recommended this to several of my friends. I think it works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Just love the results. Wish it had the option to use with a charger in addition to batteries, since it would be more environmentally friendly batteries. Would be helpful if the rollers can be washed or easier to clean. After a few uses the coarseness gets dull because of the build up of dead skin. That said, works beautifully in smoothing out feet. When using, make sure your feet are over something you can throw or shake out... a cloud of fine dust wafts around your feet.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one.  My first one was taken from my luggage (or dropped out when a security check was done at the airport)  Works, if you use it....just buying it does not work to remove those ugly calluses...</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! Works amazingly well. Powerful yet gentle. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best callus remover you could possibly have at home</li>
    <li> Best product I ever bought. It is so easy to use and really does work.</li>
    <li> Great item actually works as described. No disappointments</li>
    <li> Does not work. Pops out whenever I use it.  Does not have enough power. I have soft feet to start with and this just does not work. Completely useless</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s like a weed eater for calluses. Pressure lugs it down a little bit but I have never had it stop on me. I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> this works great on my feet it really takes the callus off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving it,...my feet are feeling smooooth all over!!!!</li>
    <li> I had feet that were in really rough shape -- I had spent some time working overseas on a medical mission and hadn&#x27;t had a pedicure in maybe 10+ months.  I went to get a basic pedicure and started using the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover afterward to keep my feet smooth and to continue to work on the more severe calluses I had.  I really like this device. It is very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and is effective. My only complaint is that I notice my feet initially feel very smooth, but feel rough again in unusual patterns by the next morning.  This goes away with another Emjoi &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;.  Not sure if over time this will subside, but overall I&#x27;m very pleased. This is easier to use than the Pedi-egg and traditional foot filers (and does a better job, too!)</li>
    <li> It works well but must be cautious to not overdue &amp; create sensitivity. Skin is much smoother than going  for a pedicure &amp; you control the sanitation.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift for a friend who complains of rough feet.  I have the electric model and like it, so hope she does too.</li>
    <li> the product arrived 5days after I ordered and in good condition. I used it and amazed on the result of my feet, I washed and put lotion so I have smooth feet. I highly recommend this product. Need to order refills for future use.</li>
    <li> Great product and service!</li>
    <li> This works great and it appears to be very easy to change the refill roller.  This also had a much lower price point than the callus remover I have seen advertised on TV.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this, does not do anything to remove dead skin</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product from Shavenow...I wish I would I just purchased the ampoe instead.  Mine stopped frequently and was just a pain to use and didn&#x27;t seem to really get the job done...pay the couple of extra dollars and buy the ampoe but if you do decide to purchase it them don&#x27;t go with Shavenow.</li>
    <li> Appears great, have not used</li>
    <li> I bought and tried it.It is wounderful and very cheap price and so, I ordered 6 pieces again</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! This is the third one I have bought as I have left mine behind(with new refills) for friends and family.  This product truly works. The seller ShaveNow is extremely reputable and fast.  I had ordered the newest model, as in picture.  I received the older model.  I needed it right away as I was going on vacation and wanted to take it along.  Before I left, I contacted ShaveNow and told them they had sent the older model.  I did not expect to hear from them at all but, it had made me feel better (lol).  When I returned today, they had sent me the newer product as pictured.  No argument, no emails. I was so surprised and pleased beyond words I had to write about their service.  They also have a membership to receive refills which I will join as I am so impressed with this company.  Very reputable seller. Extremely good product.&lt;br /&gt;To answer a question I saw posted about the refills; I change mine after every third use.  I suppose I could hold out longer but I would have to spend more time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from a tv demonstration so I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations. But boy, was I surprised! It worked just like demonstrated, very quickly turned my dry, cracked hiking feet into pink and smooth. It won&#x27;t get rid of thick calluses with just one use, but it does make your whole sole smooth and even and ready for your dressiest sandals. Be sure to follow the directions, including wiping the dust off your feet with a damp towel and using a moisturizating cream afterwards. Who cares what color the roller is, as long as it works! The directions specify that if you press hard, the device will stop. The trick is to press very lightly, as if you were filing your nails. Also, make sure your batteries are fresh. My one complaint is that the packaging didn&#x27;t give any info on where to order refill rollers, but that&#x27;s what Google is for, I guess. Good to know I can get them here!  This would make a great gift for a female relative, or anyone who likes regular pedicures, especially if they can&#x27;t afford to go as often as they&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> This was sent to me as a gift, and I am glad I had added it to my Amazon Wish List.  With just two uses, my feet are smoother than they&#x27;ve been in a long time.  This works much better than a pumice stone, and I&#x27;m finding that my feet are staying smooth for a longer period.</li>
    <li> I have bought over 30 of these as gifts and I always get amazing feedback on how well they work.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, smoothest feet, even better than getting a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Perfect for safely shaving away callous on the bottom of your feet. Replacement rollers are not a hassle and are not expensive. Battery lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great product it is very easy to use and my feet feel soft and nice afterwards. I order some extra rollers for other family members to use.</li>
    <li> I have the earlier version of the micropedi. Complaints: goes through a lot of batteries (should have a rechargable) and the refills on the files are about $10 each. Works very well over time. Will not work on thick callouses at once. I&#x27;m talking months. I use mine with a foot file, soaking, and my clarisonic pedi every week but have about gotten rid of all callouses. Works best on the edges of thick callouses</li>
    <li> I would just buy a blunt knife to shave the asperous skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take off has much has I thought it would.  Purchased cuticle softner from Sally&#x27;s and that work&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Emjoi MicroPedi Foot Buffer.  I finally found the answer to remove the thick calluses on my feet.  It did a great job on the first use.  Will continue to use as necessary.  Highly recommended.  Also received the item very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this for use in between pedicures and when they don&#x27;t do a great job getting all the caluses off during the pedicure.  I ride horse and I torchure my feet, this gets them ready for sandals.</li>
    <li> Generally I don&#x27;t review my purchases, but I&#x27;m making an exception here. This product is very good. It has been the most successful at resolving the calluse issues of the four others I have tried. Within three uses my feet are almost smooth! I only wish it had a built-in rechargeable battery. Nevertheless I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well, does the job.  Not sure how long before it needs refills but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Guys, just buy this would ya? I&#x27;m a 29 yr. old male and my feet are rough. I knew this but my girlfriend insisted that I fix it. Well after all her wish IS my command. This thing is like a belt sander on my feet!! Feels pretty good and honestly works amazingly. I thought that it would lose power easily and bog down with pressure, WRONG!!! This sucker has some get up and grind! Its not too much that it hurts but enough to get the job done. I&#x27;ve been using it a few months and I want you to be prepared to clean up a pile if fine dusty skin! I find it easiest to do it sitting in the bathtub along the side (a dry bathtub haha). Ladies, if you yourself want the smoothest feet for summer, pick this up, vote that this was helpful, and thank my girlfriend for making your day!</li>
    <li> I have the worse feet. Constantly fighting callouses, It took me a good hour the first time, but ever since its only about 10 minutes if I keep on top of the build up. I use to use a double sided razor and actually soak my feet then shave off the built up skin, and of course once in a while go too deep. This is a live saver. My feet have never been in better condition.</li>
    <li> I have no clue to what people are talking about when they say this thing doesn&#x27;t work.  I can&#x27;t put mines down.  My wife laughs at me because I&#x27;m constantly using it.  I have a pair of procell Duracell batteries and the same sander, and this thing hasn&#x27;t slowed down yet.  Not a pretty bar, but one who wheres steel toe boots to work and do a little exercising, I can sometimes begin to feel the calluses on my feet rubbing inside me show.  This thing naws away at it.  And to think, I don&#x27;t really post, and here I am posting about some d**n foot sander.  WoW...Need a drink now.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just what I needed! And the price was affordable! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Get this! It&#x27;s great for your feet!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s easy and IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> Im so enjoying my emjoi i let my mom try it and she want one now .</li>
    <li> Great product!  Does professional job.  Follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions as to usage.</li>
    <li> If you put too much pressure it stops ..</li>
    <li> I love this callus remover. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! My feet were dry and cracked and I whipped this out of the package forgetting I had it… And it was like a miracle cure from my dry cracked feet! I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> Love it--wish it was rechargeable, then it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I dont know which one is better this or amope. Jeez both r great..i got this today for Christmas ( and amope was bought last night by me) sont buy urself stuffat xams! Anyway I got the obe with travel bag and all three diffrent coursenesses so total of four .cuz plus the one it that was on the emoji</li>
    <li> It does a pretty good job with smoothing my feet, but it is really hard to get the dead skin off the roller without wetting it. I use the little brush that came with it and also the one that came with my electric triple head razor which has a firmer brush, but I still end up having to moisten a paper towel a little to clean the roller, but it doesn&#x27;t get it completely clean back to the blue color. It now has a white &amp;#34;top-coat of skin&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will be before I have to replace the first roller. I bought an additional pack of 4 rollers when I bought the Emjoi.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured, it is the smaller model</li>
    <li> Works better than going to nail salons.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to pay a lot for pedicures because this thing does it all. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Awesome product, best thing I have ever used, no more dry skin on feet!</li>
    <li> my heels are terrible and i was a little doubtful about this yet, it is the  first tool that has actually helped at all!&lt;br /&gt;it works and i am grateful. i have thick heels, on my right foot for some reason, yet, this has helped to bring it down some.</li>
    <li> Best product I have used to take care of rough feet!</li>
    <li> This works really well .. at least according to my mother. She has the diabetes and as such cannot use an appliance with blades of any kind. On 1st use she was able to get those rough spots on her feet nice and smooth. She showed the device to her foot Doctor and she thought  the results were good too.. The Doctors assistant had tried to describe this device to the Doc and so appreciated that my mother brought it in to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure beats doing it by hand!</li>
    <li> Was not what I order but works good</li>
    <li> The is a great product.  I have been manually removing the callouses on my big toes for years.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy one sooner.</li>
    <li> Calluses all gone! I have bunions and get some pretty tough callusses on the sides of them and ony heels. I have used the very course emery style device and that&#x27;s ok. But this little device makes short work of those calluses  and leaves a smoother finish.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of doing what it was intended to do.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews but this device is super amazing. I am sooo glad to have bought this and cannot recommend it enough to others who have the same issues. I have tried EVERYTHING to remove the callus/dead skin off my feet but have not been very successful until NOW. I started with the green refill (x-treme coarse) since my feet was in such horrid condition and now am going to buy the blue refill (extra coarse) to maintain my new found soft feet. Use it when your feet is dry and it basically sands away the dead skin. Does not hurt at all and it felt so good afterwards. I rinsed my feet after all is said &amp; done, then apply lotion and socks.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, and cleans off the calluses pretty well.  I use once or twice a week because during the cold weather.</li>
    <li> would work if power strtonger</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful product ever. I have now purchased 4 plus mine and everyone loves them!</li>
    <li> Love this item works amazing</li>
    <li> Buy one, you will be amazed!</li>
    <li> My feet used to bleed- the cracks so deep, and sometimes just aggravated my feet with even Soa pegucurws- within a day or less, the dry and cracked awfulness would come back making them catch on the sheets when getting into bed. Now I have an amazing product, and the only thing that has ever produced long term results.at a fair and reasonable cost. Thank you got the integrity of this product and for the reasonable price!</li>
    <li> My gf loves it, and she&#x27;s taken a liking to doing my construction boot wearing feet. I&#x27;m not going to say i hate it, I&#x27;ll just say that much.</li>
    <li> So light and easy to use.  My feet have never felt so soft.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Got rid of my calluses without much work or pain on my part. Def recommended to all!! Now just have to wait for summer to arrive...</li>
    <li> When you use it, it doesn&#x27;t look like it is working very well but try putting something dark under your foot and see how much comes off. Really good.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.  Works as advertised.  Have been looking for something to help me with my callouses, and this really fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Looking for something like this for along time.  Thanks for making a tough job easier.  Use it for the family.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of pedi filer. Works much better than the Amope given the green course file heads. Also had a stronger motor. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Works great. easily removes the dried dead skin from your feet. My heels get real hard to the point they start hurting. Run this over it a few times and its nice and smooth. The only thing you need to be aware of is that it creates a lot of dried skin &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; so do it in an area that is easily wiped up. You will be surprised at how much &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; it will produce. If I have any complaint I guess it would be that I feel it could be a little more powerful then it is. It will still do the job you just might have to run it over the area several times.Dont use a lot of pressure or it will just bog it down, light pressure will do. Make sure to pick up a few extra rollers as they will be needed. Its one of the reasons I went with this brand as their replacement rollers were a lot cheaper than most.</li>
    <li> Much easier than coarse boards for shower use.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool to keep feet sandal ready!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as it should.  You need to use a very, very light touch, barely touching the skin with it.  As a Canadian, the problem is the cost of the replacement rollers:  $10 for two, plus $10 shipping which I am not willing to pay.  I will continue to look for the rollers elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more as gifts for the holidays for friends and family.  The results were just as explained.</li>
    <li> I love this! It works just as described on QVC! However it was cheaper here like everything else. It does not over work the skin and cause tender areas. Works quickly!</li>
    <li> Light weight, easy to use for both men or women and something that was appreciated as a gift. Good item, good choice.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product.  It is small, quiet, light weight, and easy to operate and clean.  Leaves skin surfaces smooth.  Highy recommended.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is just that I have very course calluses on my heels, but this is a total waste of money.  I went back to the grater shaver.</li>
    <li> excellent piece of electrical equipment. As I walk around barefooted, this keeps all my foot problems at bay Thank you kindly. Anthony Luck</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I bought it for my mom for Christmas and she loved it. Removed so much dead skin/calluses from the bottom that we had to get a bowl to hold it all. It was cool in the grossest way possible.</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly. I love ,love, LOVE this!  Makes the Pedi-Egg look prehistoric! I never expected to love this as much as I do-It&#x27;s so easy , quick and efficient-Like a salon visit in 5 minutes in my own home.</li>
    <li> OMG BEST CALLUS REMOVER EVER!!!! If anyone has bas callused feet, this will fix that in 1 use! I bought this for me wife who has had very bad cracked, callused heels and with one use there was a noticable difference! Her heels looked and felt better! I will never try another remedy for callused feet!!</li>
    <li> I love this product - gives excellent results and leaves your feet feeling smooth as silk. Once you use it, put lotion on your feet and walla!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! For the first time I got my feet silky soft within 5 min! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! I am so glad I decided to give it a try. Using pumice stones has always been a pain in the butt and never gets it as smooth is this little machine does! No regrets at all. I will be ordering replacement rollers to keep as a backup.</li>
    <li> powerful is a gross overstatement. this was a total waste of money. I went back to using my ped-egg.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and I should have listened to the negative ones.  This product is worthless unless your feet are already used to being pampered with frequent pedicures.  (I&#x27;m not even sure it would be useful then)  The rest of us who have dry winter feet, cracked heels from going barefoot, or are just not flexible to get down there to take care of their feet every day need to look elsewhere for foot care.  The so-called &amp;#34;powerful Mejoi Micro-Pedi callus remover&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t remove ANYTHING.  The roller, even with new batteries, stops at the slightest pressure, and I spent over 30 minutes letting the rollar just &amp;#34;skim the surface&amp;#34; to absolutey NO EFFECT.  I did better with a dollar store emery board.  I&#x27;m disgusted and very sorry I spent so much money for that and the &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; refill rollers which are no better.  :-(</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  I have horrendous runners feet and they are now smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom for the first time in 35 years.</li>
    <li> This is the best pedicure tool I have ever used.  I love love love it.  Make sure to order extra rollers they only last a handful of times but worth replacing.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Love, love it. It does a great job and ease of use. Others have done a good job but not as easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! When I&#x27;m through using it, my feet look ten years younger as all the cracked skin is gone and they are smooth as silk</li>
    <li> It works . I will have to purchase the coarse replacement because it takes a long time to get an area smooth.</li>
    <li> I had this product recommended to my by a friend...thought I&#x27;d try it.  I do love it.  Worked as indicated by my friend and I would recommend it to others.  Easy to use and works like a dream.</li>
    <li> There is absolutely nothing better for rough, dry skin and callouses on your feet! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This saves money.  You don&#x27;t have to get a pedicure.  Do it yourself.  This is a handy tool and works great.</li>
    <li> Since they have outlawed the razor in many states when getting a professional pedicure...this is the ticket! It was easy to use and made my dry, cracked and ugly feet smooth in about two minutes. Super easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t bog down..powerful motor. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I&#x27;ve got terrible feet because let&#x27;s face it....I&#x27;m busy &amp; feet are low priority.</li>
    <li> I had really bad calluses and rough spots on my heels. Even pedicures didn&#x27;t always manage to minimize the appearance. This micro-pedi callus remover really does the trick! I have used it only twice and the calluses are gone!! I apply a little moisturizer afterward and I ready to go!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Cannot say enough good about this product.  Calluses are a thing of the past and skin is smooth in places that haven&#x27;t been for years.  Small enough for travel, too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot more efficient than I thought it would be.  My feet were very dry and rough.  I used it a couple of times while watching tv.  It&#x27;s painless and works very well.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The Nano is an effective and inexpensive way to take care of my heels rather than a professional pedicure--it is a great product that is easy to use and maintain.</li>
    <li> Good product. Wish the cylinder would last longer. Still a good product.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy the corded electric model</li>
    <li> It works just like it says</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big review writer but i just HAD TO say that this is AMAZING!!! in less than 10 seconds you get baby soft feet with none of the effort of scrubbing. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This is such a time saver!  Easy to use and makes my heels look and feel like they did when I was a teenager.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!!  I have used hundreds of products to attempt to rid my feet of calluses.  This product is by far the best I have ever used.  If you are thinking about buying it, don&#x27;t think, just buy it.  Within ten mins. of taking this product out of my mailbox, my feet were callus free.  Put a towel under your feet while you use it because it produces a fine powder from your feet and just press gently, it doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to work really well.  I will be buying more of these for some of my family members who are also always complaining of calluses.  I will never use a different product on my feet.  If I could give it more than five stars on here, I would!!!</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as advertised. Batteries wear out too fast. I wasn&#x27;t able to finish one foot on two new batteries. The corded version may work better, but I would not recommend this version for any serious callus shaving. I recommend spending a little extra money for the corded model. I would also recommend the male (dark blue) corded model as it spins 47x per second vs. this models 30x per second.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and fast working.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Easy to use and clean.  Results are immediate and my heels are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great gadget! Works very well if you don&#x27;t push hard, and you really don&#x27;t have to, as it does the job. I&#x27;d buy it again should I ever need a new one.</li>
    <li> My feet feel like I had a professional pedi</li>
    <li> Just received as a gift and I am blown away at how well this works! Have always had terrible feet, and the only thing ever did any good was a professional pedicure with the razor. This little guy did even better than that, and in a fraction of the time! I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great if used on a regular basis. Very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> Love it.  The best thing ever invented, It leaves your feet feeling smooth and beautiful and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  No need to go to the nail salon any longer...</li>
    <li> This little gadget is very surprising.  It does such an amazing job.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it uses up the 2 AA batteries really fast. So buy a large package of batteries, too</li>
    <li> So far I have only used it a few times, but what a difference it made. On my feet, which aren&#x27;t too bad it helped to smooth them. I used it on my BF and it was amazing to see what it could do with just the roller that it came with and not even the coarse one I bought. If your feet are real bad I suggest spending 5 or so minutes each day for a while so you don&#x27;t irritate your skin. Oh and I used it with my feet being clean and fully dry.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, does the job.</li>
    <li> This gadget is magic! It takes the rough skin off your feet quickly &amp; painlessly! Its amazing. I will save tons on pedicures. 💕</li>
    <li> I immediatly put in the battery and went to work on a callous on the ball of my foot.  The callouse has been there so long and is so hard and thick that I often use a single edge razor blade to remove it, this callouse remover is safer and works well.  I used it all over my feet wherever the skin had thickened.  It did the job better than any other product I&#x27;ve used and I have tried many over the 50 years that I have suffered with this callouse.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Oh what a relief!  So easy to use!!!!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHTTHIS ITEM FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE HAD BAD DRY SKIN ON HIS FEET AND HE HAS BEEN USING IT SINCE CHRISTMAS AND HE LIKES WHAT IT DOES.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT AND  WOULD ALSO LIKE TO  GET THE EXTRA ROLLERS FOR THE EMJOI.  IT WAS A GREAT PRICE TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how much I love this little appliance.  I am 58 years old, and my friends tease me that I have had feet like leather since I was a little girl.  I took this out of the package and used it on one foot, applied lotion to both feet and had my husband test them out by running his hands over them.  The look on his face was pure shock!  He could not believe how soft the treated foot was in comparison to the other.  It was so easy to use.  Now we will see how long it lasts, but for now I can say it was already worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I just used a Ryobi sander with 60 grit sandpaper and it did great.</li>
    <li> First time my husband used this, he noticed improvements right away he got up and danced on his feet with no pain. Best gift I could had ever gave him. He was so happy.</li>
    <li> This was love at first try! I can&#x27;t afford regular pedicures, and this wonderful little product made my feet just as baby-soft, if not more so than a professional pedicure. OK--it can&#x27;t give you a foot massage, but it works wonders on rough heels and calluses. It comes with the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; roller, but refills are available in different textures up to extra coarse. The one that came with it worked fine for me After only two uses, no more rough,dry skin and my feet felt wonderful! Batteries weren&#x27;t included, so be sure to have some AA batteries on hand. It&#x27;s easy to use (no need to soak your feet before or after) and easy to clean. Best product for smooth feet I&#x27;ve tried, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many! I&#x27;m giving this to several friends and relatives for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is great,I have tried course files which cut my feet and I used other Pedi callus remover,and it too put little cuts on my heels.This is so easy to use and it works great.Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about all this anymore.It really takes off the dead dry calluses on my feet and heels.I recommend this to anyone who has rough dry calluses.Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this, it works really good. I&#x27;ve had something similar but it doesn&#x27;t remove anything as good as this one does. I&#x27;m going to order more to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Use it every few days. I hate pedicures but I adore this. Better than any ped egg or Dr Sholls product. This is the way to go. Replacement heads are a little pricey but still cheaper than pedicures. Amazing how smooth my feet feel.  I don&#x27;t believe in not maintaining your feet. Heels are not ok when cracked, white skin sits there. We walk, stand, run, jump and more so it is obvious that you should pay attention to the details. I dont do pedicures in a shop, I just trim my nails and cuticles and occasionally paint nail. Not often. However the bottom should always be soft and hydrated. This product allows you to do that.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use and smoothes out rough calluses really good at taking care of the ones on the balls of your feet.</li>
    <li> Works well....so far (haven&#x27;t used it frequently.  A bit expensive though.  I only bought this more expensive brand because a friend bought it at local store and it worked well.  Nothing to compare it to, so maybe a cheaper brand would&#x27;ve worked as well?&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> We have bought a few products designed to remove rough skin from the feet. However this is by far the best I have used. It has such a powerful motor. Unlike other products this won&#x27;t stop working when it touches your skin. It allows you to apply sufficient pressure on the callous without reducing speed, and most importantly without risk of injury caused by friction. It is easy and fast to use, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I was sqtcale about it, and it is GREAT, wonderful product, recommend it 100%, go ahead and give a try, you wont regret it</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and effective.  Be sure to order refills because the roller does not last very long.</li>
    <li> This has worked very well.  You need to use a light touch.  I bought both the regular and the heavy duty replacement heads and have used both on different parts of my feet.  As usual with products that label the products as a men&#x27;s version and a women&#x27;s version, the men&#x27;s version is cheaper.  I don&#x27;t worry about labels, and they&#x27;re the same product.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  If you&#x27;re tired of the manual callus removers this is def. the way to go.  I wear flip flops year round, and that causes loss of moisture and wear and tear on my feet that the Emjoi takes care of in quick time.  Already purchased roller refills, since this has become a staple in my mani-pedi home kit.</li>
    <li> I love this item, I will buy more, just for stocking stuffers,  it works really well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a LOT of different products for my heels!  Some were useful, some not so much!  BUT, this is THE BEST one I have purchased for using to remove the crust from my heels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you don&#x27;t know the &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; then simple PUT A TOWEL under it when you are running it!  How simple is THAT??!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers (Super Coarse) - Pack of 4  AND the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers (Xtreme Coarse) - Pack of 4 !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO worth the price !!!!!!!!!!  I am SO tired of my heels being crust, because I wear sandal type shoes year round, and this makes my heels not hurt when I walk!  My clothes and sheets do not &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; on my heels -- you know what I mean!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it works on heels</li>
    <li> Works very well, wish it was rechargeable</li>
    <li> works well ...... could use a little more power , but in all does the job .</li>
    <li> the roller that comes with it worn out in only a couple of uses. Those blue surface worn out, and showing white core.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
    <li> This gadget really does a good job on my heels. I am just learning what works best for me but is is certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> I researched these things until I finally decided to buy an Amope and this. The Emjoi essentially had sandpaper that wore out before I was done with one foot, but the Amope&#x27;s file feels (and works) substantially better and longer. I agree 100% with other reviewers that say it&#x27;s not very powerful (neither was Amope, to be honest), but for safety purposes, I&#x27;m sure it needs to work slowly so people don&#x27;t burn holes in their feet and sue them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other way Amope exceeds over Emjoi is the head of the filer. Emjoi only gives a small little area of open file and it&#x27;s very difficult to keep the area you&#x27;re working on in that tiny window. Amope&#x27;s head is wide open, so you can move that thing in any direction and have sweet, sweet access to the file.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried to use this, even just lightly placing it against my foot stopped the rotator from actually rotating! Basically this was junk and I ended up with a non-functional item:(</li>
    <li> Works so well. My heels look amazing.</li>
    <li> This wouldn&#x27;t even cut on, I spent $30 on different brands of top notch batteries STILL wont respond It feels like a $1 item I want to see how they respond I will update the outcome And I hope they don&#x27;t send me through that delay process ,this will be examined by the proper authority if I don&#x27;t get a working product</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon. I bought it from Shoppers Drug Mart Canada. Let me tell you this is the best thing I&#x27;ve seen since slice bread! I spent so much money and time at the Nails Salon trying to get the results I achieve so easily with Micro-Pedi Callus remover. It leaves my skin smooth and wonderful. I don&#x27;t know why others complain that the cartridge doesn&#x27;t last long. I had it for five month now and it&#x27;s going fine. Just remember to wash them after every use. I found that it makes them work better. It&#x27;s worth the money and I think every woman should have one because it&#x27;s not only painless but will save you a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product as it does the job well. My first as I&#x27;ve seen the bigger brother (one) on a Canadian shopping channel, so decided to get this for a test drive, here in the States. It WORKS and works well ONLY on dry feet/heels. I made the mistake of using it after I showed and that&#x27;s a no no. Your heels HAS to be dry, at a point where they look whitish/ashy due to build-up of dead heel skins. It DOES leave my heels a bit tender in spots that I went over a few times; that was my own fault. I use it, shower and then apply Vaseline all over my feet and heels and wear an old pair of sport socks before I hit the sheets. In the morning, my feet and heels are near perfect. Repeat every night, but only use the Nano Pedi once a week. No need to buy &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; foot cream, Vaseline and a pair of soft socks work the best. My ONLY problem with this Nano Pedi is, it is a bit on the small side for a guy&#x27;s feet; the roller is too small. Another thing, wash the roller in warm water and use a nail brush to remove the dead skin on it.</li>
    <li> The Micro-Pedi works well.  Had another pedi machine and it was also OK - but was $20 more.  The Emjoi Pedi does the job -- but could have a little more power. It seems you have to have the RIGHT TOUCH - a little to much pressure and the unit boggs down.  Very satisfied - SO FAR.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been this pleasantly surprised in a product doing exactly what it claims to do in a very long time! I read some of the reviews about it stopping or not spinning once they touched it to their skin and I have to think those reviewers are pressing the machine too hard against their callouses. A light touch is all you need to file away the rough skin. I suspect it stops working when pressed too hard as a safety precaution. I bought this for the price of a pedicure in my area and therefore consider this little device already paid for for that reason!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter, NEED it for myself! It worked beautifully on her winter weary feet, they&#x27;re like silk to the touch, and boy, is she happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to have fun with this thing.  First, I had high hopes because I have owned two Emjoi hair removal products in the past 15-20 years that I still use weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I have used a foot file and sloughing creams to get me feet nice and soft.  While both those methods worked, they proved to be lots of work.  I have only used the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano once so far, but I got such good results with minimum elbow grease that I feel compelled to write a review.  This is like a mini power sander and you use it much as you would a sander on the callused areas of your feet.  Be prepared for soft feet after the first use.  This pedi tool is amazing!  I&#x27;m also going to use it to &amp;#34;file down&amp;#34; the corns I have on my little toes.  It worked well for that the first use, but, I did catch my uncallused skin so will be more careful next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I was not too thrilled about is that it is battery operated, however, if it were corded, I feel that that the cord would get in the way and may not be long enough to reach where I have chosen to sit.  Rechargeable model would most likely work well, but not sure if I want to have yet another item to constantly maintain a charge.  The corded version was quite a bit more $$.  I went for budget and glad I did.  Will use rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used my small bathroom trash to catch the shavings.  That worked well to contain quite a bit of shavings that were removed.  No &amp;#34;dust up&amp;#34; occurred...all filed skin dropped into the waste basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will stick with the Extra and Super Course roller files since my feet are mildly callused.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have a bad time with my heels getting dry and cracking! What pain! This thing fixes it. I use it in the shower before I turn the water on so all the dead skin falls there and can be easily washed away. My feet feel like baby feet. I&#x27;m taking care of callouses that I&#x27;ve had for years. Yes! It is small, fits the hand beautifully and works!!!!</li>
    <li> I was a very unsure about trying this as I have tried so many products, creams etc. to keep my feet smooth.  Happily, this product really worked great!  I noticed a real difference after just one use.  I highly recommend this product and it is affordable too.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and with thorough instructions which should be read before using.  Easy to use (I have healthy skin) and fits in my hand nicely.  Left my feet feeling and looking smooth.  Item is powerful so read instructions and care before using.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she said this is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is great, works very well, it works so well I threw away my Ped Egg, that I was using, that was not working well.  I will however be ordering replacement rollers.</li>
    <li> This callus remover has been wonderful.  For 20+ years I have tried EVERYTHING, from very expensive to Vaseline with socks at night.  It would only work 1 day.  This Emjoi fits good in your hand and you will absolutely wonder how you lived without it.  I am buying several to give next Christmas or birthdays.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this years ago! The only complaint is they did not have an extra refill compared to the one advertised by another maker on tv which had 2 extra refill rollers. Otherwise It&#x27;s great. Had I seen the one on tv I would have been tempted to buy it.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just Wow! I love it.  My feet have never been this smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This micro-pedi callus remover  &amp;#34;is top notch&amp;#34;. I had a callus on the side of my foot that it has completely removed over a short period of time. Use it daily and the results will save a few bucks from getting a pedi.</li>
    <li> I have had to go to the foot doctor at the very least once a month for fifteen years.  A back surgery left me walking on my heels and horrible calluses were the result.  Even my doctor has said he very rarely sees such bad ones.  That is while he is cutting them off with a scalpel after they had been soaked in hydrogen peroxide for 1/2 hour and after the cutting came the grinder to smooth them out.  Have tried many many products over the years and none worked very well.  But this one is the bomb!  It works like a charm.  This machine is amazing.  After about four minutes I had a smoother heel than I have ever had in my life.  They say the grinders only last a couple of times but they are wrong!  This machine and its grinders just keep on going.  Amazing machine at an even more amazing price.  Would buy it again and again.  No more doctors.  No more waiting rooms.  No more talking about how awful the heels are.  These calluses would even put holes in my socks. I&#x27;m going to save a fortune!  Not to mention the embarrassment.  One last item.  I am diabetic and have found this machine to be perfectly safe if you follow the directions.  It is extremely powerful.  Please read carefully before you use  it.  I have used it eight times now.  All with perfect results.  Anyone who can read and comprehend should not have a problem.  I would keep it away from young children.  Its very powerful for being such a small device.  It fits in my hand very comfortably and is easy to control. A very well made machine at an amazingly affordable price.  Finally!</li>
    <li> I purchased the emojoi micro-pedi nano callus remover in March hoping to use it before summer sandals wearing season  began. At the first use, it was great.  It made my skin feel really smooth.  In May, I took it out for the second time and used it again, and it continued to do a good job.  In June, I tried it once more and the thing died on me half way, so I thought it was the battery, but after changing the battery, it didn&#x27;t work.  I contacted seller, via shavenow about the defective product, but they didn&#x27;t stand by their product because it &amp;#34; expiration of the returns period&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was quite upset about losing $20+ over a product that was defective and which I only used 3 times.  Shavenow has horrible customer service. Beware!</li>
    <li> Does the job just takes a long time and you can&#x27;t press down firm at all. Motor is not strong enough. Make sure you have a good amount of batteries.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - takes a little practice to understand it takes a little time to remove hard areas.  Just take your time and use light pressure and it will work wonders on your feet.  An instant Pedicure for a fraction of the price at a spa or salon...</li>
    <li> Great product, good price - really helps with the dry skin on my feet</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife who has had very rough, coarse, crack heels.  She has used this product several times per week since purchasing the Mini-Pedi machine and is extremely pleased with it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> the Emjoi Micro-Pedi is fabulous.  This is the first product I have found to do the work and it is so effortless.  My feet have never been so smooth.  I bought two more for my sisters, and they love it also.  Great buy and great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, will leave your feet like a baby.........will save you a lot of money doing your pedicure al home. It works wonders.</li>
    <li> This little device is powerful enough to remove dead skin and expose healthy smooth skin in a pain-free manner.  My 79 year old mother was the first to benefit from my niece&#x27;s pedicure.  I tried it next and was amazed that I did not have to apply any pressure to remove so much skin--and so very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: We used the regular roller that came with the unit (cleans up easily), but I may experiment with the extra coarse rollers just to see if my assessment is the same or if results are reached in an even faster timeframe.</li>
    <li> I just love the Emjoi Micro [pedi callus remover. It does the job just the product promises. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am getting one for each of my girlfriend&#x27;s. It works perfectly. One wish is that it came with various rollers in order to see which works best</li>
    <li> I have been forever unhappy with pedicures since they stopped using the razors, I felt like my calluses where going to be there forever. But using this one time there was already such a difference!!!!! I love it and much easier then using the razors at home, or paying $30 for a foot soak and polish change.</li>
    <li> I expected something a little more effective. It really offers little improvement and I was hoping for something that would really flake off dead skin. I feel like I would need to use this for 15 mins every day to see any benefit from it at all.</li>
    <li> I like this tool, but wasn&#x27;t bowled over by it. IMHO, I got much better results from the PedEgg system and it&#x27;s too bad that those are being phased out due to their defective replacement blades. The Emjoi did successfully smooth out the rough skin on my feet but my skin still felt hard and smooth rather than soft and smooth like the PedEgg (after using the black smoothing pad) made it. However, I remedy that by scrubbing my feet with sugar scrub using an exfoliating glove every night in the shower.</li>
    <li> I found the earlier version of this in a catalog for $90.  This thing is great!  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one before.</li>
    <li> I have really bad callouses on the bottom of my feet. I have to go to a podiatrist to have him &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; them off. I bought this to see if I could save money and not go see him so often. I ordered it and I told my wife about it. She is very skeptical about things like this and she said, &amp;#34;I hope it works.&amp;#34; When I got it in the mail I went home and used it on my feet. I had her feel my callouses and she was amazed. She had me use it on her feet and she was blown away by how it took care of her feet. I am sure glad I bought it. I recommend this to anyone who has callouses on the bottom of their feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but, nothing comes even close to this one.&lt;br /&gt;It really does a great job !!! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, I placed some batteries in it that I had found around the house and it was a big disappointment. It just wouldn&#x27;t work very well at all. So I decided to buy some new batteries and when I placed them in the product and turned it on - WOW what a difference! It takes some time to get used to the light pressure that you need to use in order for this device to work properly. I took the advise of another reviewer and I sat in my bathtub when I used this.  I am glad that I did because all of the skin that is removed from your feet is turned into a fine dust and it goes all over the place. I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating because I have to replace the batteries frequently. I have resorted to using rechargeable batteries to save money and that seems to have helped alot.  I use this every other day, and I recharge the batteries after my 2nd use. When I use this product, I do the bottom of my entire foot and then around the heals and I concentrate on the balls of my feet for both feet.  This device is defintely for maintenance and not a one time cure-all but it is so much easier than using stones, sand paper, or other items which require alot of effort and pressure to do half the job this little thing can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to do the following and you should have no problems with your device. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * Keep your batteries fresh (change out about every other use depending on how much you use it each time - I suggest rechargeable)&lt;br /&gt; * Clean the roller after each use (I take mine out and run it under water and then dry it off)&lt;br /&gt; * Clean the device after each use (I take a paper towel and wipe off the device before I place the roller back in it)&lt;br /&gt; * Be sure to use a light pressure when using the device or it will not work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it 2 weeks ago and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is such a useful device - I don&#x27;t have particularly horrible calluses, but I have some and just creaming and usual skin-removal didn&#x27;t help at all, but with this device I already see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The service by seller is wonderful as well - communication was fast and helpful, delivery was excellent as well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend both the product and the seller!</li>
    <li> Just got this today and I love it. It&#x27;s amazing to see how much dead skin this thing removes, it&#x27;s gross but wonderful at the same time. I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I saw commercials but I thought hey I don&#x27;t ever buy as-seen on TV type products maybe I could try just this one. It really does make your heels baby soft, its painless and quick, easy to carry so great item to pack for vacation if you plan on wearing sandals, heels, or just on your feet a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this is that I wish it came with one spare roller but its not that big of a deal, a 6 pack is under $20 and will likely last me at least 4 months but probably more. The price for spares for a year is like the price of 2 pedicures. Very easy convenient, effective product.</li>
    <li> My sister wanted this for her birthday, so I bought it for her.  She reports that she LOVES it, so I&#x27;m giving it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Compact, easy to use and it works and I recommend it to anyone. Oh yeah and the price was good too!</li>
    <li> Really works -- I just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to purchase it.  Even bought one for my mom.  She loves it too.</li>
    <li> Love this item. No longer have to work so hard at making my heals smooth.</li>
    <li> The entire device isn&#x27;t worth the price.  Sure it works if you have the time to repeatedly keep going over your feet but I get better results from a $3.00 hand-foot sander I get at my local Drug Store.</li>
    <li> Works well but need to use the coarser rollers to get feet smooth in shortest amount of time.</li>
    <li> Powerful little machine</li>
    <li> This is such a worker!  I started to buy one months ago and I wish I had.  I hope it lasts a very long time.  If it dies, I will just buy another one.  I certainly recommend this callus remover.</li>
    <li> This works great for even thick calluses. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is because of the price of replacement sand paper tubes. Wow!</li>
    <li> Really works well .  It is easy to use and easy to clean.  Skin does come off like powder so make clean up preparations.  Eould recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  My feet were so rough and now they are so smooth. The product is really easy to use too. I also used  O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s healthy foot cream - great combination!</li>
    <li> Does bog down even with light pressure. Is great for light callousness but if you have bad callouses, you may need to go for the full sized one.</li>
    <li> was a gift for my friend who loves it</li>
    <li> It was great first day when the sandpaper was still sharp. I washed the roller 2 times and it helped. After that, the&lt;br /&gt; roller was useless. New rollers are costly. I bought a hand held scraper works 100 percent better. Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. I was going to try a ped egg, but then I saw this on qvc. I found it on Amazon with free shipping and same price. It does not irritate my skin and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Does not hurt. Keeps your feet looking and feeling great. Would be great if it came with one extra replacement roller.</li>
    <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave 2 of them as gifts they just loved them use them constanly and find all new ways to&lt;br /&gt;use them feet elbows and taking polish of of toenails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they love it</li>
    <li> I love this product.  it works just like it was supposed to.  No more using the Ped Egg for me..........</li>
    <li> So glad I found this product! Thanks to Amazon reviews, I am guided to the best things in life :)</li>
    <li> My wife loves this callus remover.</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed in this product.  I had really high hopes for this item.  First mine looked nothing like the package and the color of the buffing rod is a totaly different color.  The motor is very week as soon as it comes into contact with the skin, even with light pressure, it stops working.  I even tried it on my hand with light pressure and it completely stops running.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi MicroPedi Foot Buffer actually does work!  I received it last week, and have used it one time.  My feet are smoother than ever, and have remained that way.  No professional manicurist/pedicurist has ever achieved as good a result with buffers and files.  It is quick and easy and you will love it! I plan to send them as holiday gifts.</li>
    <li> Works even on guys nasty feet!!</li>
    <li> Too slow. Good for maintenance but, not cracked heels.</li>
    <li> Love this product can save a lot of money! !</li>
    <li> works great, takes all the dead skin away and in Minnesota winters, that is a really good thing.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as I had hoped it would.  The roller is not coarse enough to make a big difference. Seems like I have to use it everyday. I think a manual file works better and the effects last longer. Would not recommend mainly because it&#x27;ll be no time at all before I would have to order a new roller.</li>
    <li> Great item. This is not a gimmick or a fad.  This device quickly, effectively and safely removes callouses and rough spots from the foot.  I had ruined my pinky toes years ago by wearing high heels every day, and have had callouses on them for years- which had been removed repeatedly during pedicures. Those callouses always came back. It only takes a few moments to lose. \ This thing is so gentle, that it removed the callous, but keeps the healthy skin and then all you have is healthy skin.  My toes are cute again.  My feet are now sandal-ready, even in the dead of winter.  (One word of caution is to keep it from the dog as he will chew it as it will smell like you). But just get it.  You can thank me later.</li>
    <li> It was a xmas gift and the person lovedddd it! I bought one myself</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Does a good job from what I can tell</li>
    <li> After reading multiple reviews I decided to give the Emoji Micro Pedi a chance but before I ordered it I prepared myself for any complications using the product.... I purchase a pack of Duracell&#x27;s from SAMs Club then I ordered the extra course rollers for the micro pedi.... So now I&#x27;ve tackled the weak batteries after one use and the not shaving down of foot skin after one use... I would have needed this extra equipment anyways.... After doing these upgrades I was afraid that I shaved too much skin off of my feet, baby feet aren&#x27;t cool for walking on after 40.... The micro pedi did the job and now I have supplies for plenty more shaves....</li>
    <li> This is not powerful enough, buy something else.</li>
    <li> This thing is just fun to use. Sure it makes your feet all smooth, but it is so fun to use, you start asking everyone in the house if they want you to grind their feet too! I know it sounds disgusting, but it is a blast - not just a grind.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I am a skeptic at heart!! Does what it says. Don&#x27;t press hard or it won&#x27;t work, light pressure only and you will get results!</li>
    <li> I like it, the device did what it was suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Works very well, you just have to do it every few days.  At least I do, to keep up with the roughness.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She says it does the job and she likes it.  Why so many words???</li>
    <li> I have thick calluses on the bottoms of my feet. My old method was to use a scalpel to cut them away. I hated doing that so much (because of the difficulty of reaching them and the danger of accidentally cutting myself with the razor sharp scalpel) that I would delay the procedure for as long as possible, often walking around in pain until I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and *had* to cut them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife got one of these for her more &amp;#34;dainty&amp;#34; calluses, and she suggested that I get one of these for my feet. I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t think it would work on my thick, manly calluses. Wow...was I wrong. This device has been great! I can shave down the callus much more safely and can get them down as low as I need to without accidentally going too deep or cutting myself. This is an excellent device and solution to what has been a nagging problem for me. Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover!  It really works!  I wear flip-flops &amp; sandals year round whenever the temperature is above freezing and snow is not on the ground.  I also go barefoot in the house year round, so my feet really take a beating.  This product works wonders to remove the dry, dead callus skin and makes my heels and feet as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  I only use it about once a week and follow its use with a touch of oil rubbed into the newly exposed soft skin.  Best thing I&#x27;ve bought for myself in a long time!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product to help in the removal of calloused skin.  I spent a few minutes and removed callous and the unfortunate beginning of cracked heels.  Just by following the directions and using it on dry skin and not using pressure, I made significant improvement.  I don&#x27;t know how people who didn&#x27;t like this used it.  My roller is holding up, despite frequent use and battery power is not a problem.  What a great tool!</li>
    <li> This product is better than going to the spa, it&#x27;s so easy to use and with great results. I love it!</li>
    <li> Like everyone, I was worried that this little thing wouldn&#x27;t do the trick, but it sure did. Has tons of power and definitely removes the dry skin and sands down calluses!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a birthday gift. My friend loves it. Price was great, delivery was great. would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great roller for feet and dry heals......I use it about 3x a week.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this one.  I do my own pedicure, and I make sure I built in some time to use this product before soaking my feet in warm water.  I was very surprised to see how much callus dust is produced, but it does not really hurt the feet.  I put colored-towel underneath, and gets amazed the amount of callus dust piled up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million creams and files for my heels and nothing works.  This product made more progress on my dry cracked heels after just one use, than all the others put together.  I figured this would be another failure but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I wish I had started using it earlier.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend,she likes it,she really,really,likes it.&lt;br /&gt;No her name is not Mikey.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful little machine - works better than I had hoped</li>
    <li> Great product but I do suggest you buy the refills along with it.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and very good customer service. I&#x27;m a guy and use this on my elbows and feet. Really does work to get rid of the dry, rough white scaly skin that never goes away with just lotions.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Wish I knew about this a few years ago.  In my job, I am on my feet 9 hours a day. My poor feet suffered for it. This has really been one of my favorite purchases, made my feet feel so much better, and I am not self conscious to wear sandals anymore.</li>
    <li> Does not work well.  Does not remove calluses.  Does make skin smooth right after use, but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s going to work great! i can tell a difference already. Strange on / off switch but I handle it.</li>
    <li> Impulse buy. I will never use this. My feet aren&#x27;t that bad...</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for some places but hard get into some others</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even come close to do what it&#x27;s meant for!! low power and no use for it at all!!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! Works fabulous!</li>
    <li> Weak motor. Cannot apply very much pressure or it will grind to a halt.</li>
    <li> I have used it now a couple of times and it is so much easier than scraping with a pumice stone, would&lt;br /&gt;recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I could not believe how good this product is, for the first time in years I had smooth heels, I use it weekly&lt;br /&gt;and has made a real difference when wearing sandals. I heard about it thru a friend and I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used a Ped-Egg for quite a few years and the grating of the metal on my heel always set my teeth on edge, but it worked.  This is SO much better!  It is comfortable to use and works quickly.  My only piece of advice is to have a towel or something under where you are exfoliating because a lot of dead skin falls out of the device as you work.</li>
    <li> 2 stars because while Im sure it works for some people, it does nothing for rough feet or calluses unless you do it for months</li>
    <li> They loved their gift!</li>
    <li> I am using it all the time and it really helps smooth my rough feet.</li>
    <li> You can do a better job with an Emory board.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many items over the years to try to handle the callouses on my feet.  This took care of them within a couple of minutes on each foot.  I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative comment, the replacement rollers are quite expensive.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works wonders. I now get less pedi&#x27;s (so it&#x27;s saving me money)!  Worth every penny good for freshing up your feet on a whim.</li>
    <li> This is totally ineffective.  It is weak and the blue roller was done after one use. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Love this battery operated callus remover. Very convenient. I&#x27;ve had it for over 8 months now and it really works. I noticed it is more effective when your feet are dry (still ok after shower or foot bath, when feet are dried off, but less effective). Love the convenience of the replacement rollers. I usually use one roller for 3-4 treatments, then replace. I prefer the coarse type rollers. My feet have never been this soft and I haven&#x27;t had to go get a pedicure for callus removal in quite some time now. If you don&#x27;t see enough results - upgrade to the coarse roller. If you&#x27;ve had your device for a while, make sure to change batteries out - get&#x27;s the job done more quickly on a fresh pack of batteries. Would definitely buy again, but works great. Fact that you can buy several replacement rollers is convenient for sharing among family.</li>
    <li> Very powerful little guy, works so well!! My feet are baby soft and even though I got the one with batteries it is powerful enough. Very happy with it!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide on this or the electrical one, but, decided on this due to the cost and convenience. I have tried everything and cannot be more pleased. I wish I had heard about this before spending money on all the other things that didn&#x27;t work half as well. Money well spent. I ordered the green rollers.</li>
    <li> This is just an amazing little machine wow I&#x27;m blown away by what it did to my feet and my husbands feet!!! Great product!!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom as a &amp;#34;pamper yourself&amp;#34; gift and she recently told me that she loves it.  Thought i would pass it along.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and works perfectly, by far, the best for pedicures!</li>
    <li> I regularly receive pedicures, so this works so well! I know some people said it doesn&#x27;t but I think they may have a lot of course dead skin, they probably just need to buy replacement rollers.  I get a pedicure every other week, but for the past two months I haven&#x27;t been able to get up to the salon and this worked so nicely, and I had quite a bit of rough skin that dragged on my sheets when i went to bed.  This little guy took it all off like magic.</li>
    <li> I really like this, although it surely isn&#x27;t permanent.  It works well on my &amp;#34;not so horrible calluses&amp;#34; but with Hubby who has terrible feet, it works for a couple days, then you need to get back at it.  I&#x27;ve never seen dry, hard calloused skin grow so fast, can&#x27;t keep up with it in Hubby&#x27;s case.</li>
    <li> I would like to return this item. It does not do what it claims to.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! I use it all of the time!</li>
    <li> super item easy to use</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as i was hoping, battery needs frequent changing</li>
    <li> it barely takes off the the dead skin you have to go at and at it, so basically you have to keep buying rollers! Don&#x27;t buy doesn&#x27;t do what it says</li>
    <li> I love this callus remover.  My feet were in terrible condition but are so much better now thanks to this little wonder.  At the time I bought it, I did not realize that there were different coarseness of rollers.  Once I found out, I bought coarser ones and they really did the trick.</li>
    <li> pretty good. Convenient and useful.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and used it today for the first time.  My feet were in great need and now feel so much better.  It is easy to use.  Will plan to use again today, to finish the job.  I have looked at others and this one had the best reviews.  Glad I read them.</li>
    <li> Consider it like the massage for your feet that gives you some polished effect. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Smooth feet at last! I&#x27;ve tried everything short of an orbital sander to rid myself of severe cracked heels and FINALLY! Something that works! I deliver mail (ten miles on foot) and used to have the ugliest feet ever, now I&#x27;m not embarrassed to be seen in sandals on my days off! I would have paid ten times the price to see results like this!</li>
    <li> Luv luv luv these r going to be my girlfriends and sister laws gifts . It&#x27;s amazing I only have 4 stars I will never give. 5 always room for improvement like catching the dry skin</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of foot files, even some battery operated ones, but none of them holds a candle to the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover.  I have had this file for about 3 months now and wanted to wait to see how effective it is and also how long the files last.&lt;br /&gt;My feet have never felt so good or looked so good.  I have corns and calluses, and this file takes care of them much better than any other file and with less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After initially removing the really hard, dry skin, I now use it about twice a week to keep calluses from forming again.  Do take heed from other reviewers and use it in the tub or a shower so you can easily wash away the dead skin because it does get rid of a lot of it at one time. Also do not press hard because it will stop….this is a safety feature and there is no need to press hard. Follow the directions and it should work great.  It did for me.</li>
    <li> My feet are so dry and scaly. Glad that I can use this to soften the calluses and then put lotion on and it feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to for this. If you have been searching for beautiful feet-search no further. This is easy, painless, and Works better than any pumice, scraper you have ever used.  Better than anything a pedicurist can do too.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for feet. Used it for the first time today and it has worked miracles lol I love my feet again. Seriously though this thing is great!!</li>
    <li> My feet get calluses that crack and hurt. This thing sands them down in no time. Has good power and so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product to the point where I no longer have to go to the spa to have my feet done.  Easy, simple, compact.  Highly recommend this to everyone.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m on my second night using the enjoi.  I&#x27;ve had severe calluses for decades, and short of weekly expensive pedis, nothing has gotten rid of them.  The &amp;#34;cheesegrater&amp;#34; scraper, razor shavers, exfoliators--never do a complete job and left my heels feeling so sore.  I&#x27;ve read the reviews of this product and don&#x27;t think they all do it justice--ofCOURSE it&#x27;s going to take a little time and effort to get those calluses gone!  I prefer this type of gentler &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; so that my heels don&#x27;t feel burned.  I do think it&#x27;s going to take several nights to get them all removed--but then weekly maintenance should keep them smooth.  And I&#x27;ve done probably 30 minutes already, and no slow down or dead battery yet!  The roller has not worn down yet either.  I&#x27;ve neglected my feet for too long because I didn&#x27;t think anything would work--I look forward to having smooth feet forever!!</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Confession: I had the worst feet in America. Well, at least top 10 worst! The Emjoi Callous Remover has taken me off the worst list.  Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years in a cold climate where my feet were rarely seen, we&#x27;ve moved to Denver where we have 300+ days of sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dry, cracked, rough heels were not ready to see the light of day. They were bad enough I was embarrassed to get a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m taking a 2-part approach to fixing my feet. Part 1: Emjoi Callous Remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Success!  I used it today and after 15-minutes my heel callouses are tamed enough that I can wear sandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; use on DRY feet&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; use a light touch (don&#x27;t press hard)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; let spinning pumice glide over your heels&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; change up the direction of the spinning pumice (side to side; up &amp; down; diagonal) for most thorough callous removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to Part 2 of my foot rehab: Baby Feet with salicylic acid!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It  has  a lot of power for such a little device.  Definitely keep s my feet looking nice in between pedicures at the salon.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product.  Very small and hard to use.  Bought it for a Christmas present so that makes it worse.  The shape makes it almost impossible to use.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different product.  Margrette Brent</li>
    <li> I tried using it on my calluses on my feet and the coarse roller that came with it was like using extra fine sand paper. As soon as I applied a little pressure it stopped working. It would take me hours to sand down my calluses. I will stick to the pld sanding boards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this Emjoi Micro-Pedi. First, for the obvious reason, to remove calluses and make my feet pretty again. Second, my feet get really dry in the winter and start itching, and even slathering on moisturizers is only a temporary help. I&#x27;m finding when I keep the dry skin sanded off and as much dead skin removed as possible the itching has lessened dramatically. (BTW, my feet don&#x27;t have a fungus). I&#x27;ve used pumice, those  long black emery file things, those \\&quot;cheese grater\\&quot; eggs, and got tired of all the stretching and bending and contorting you have to go through to reach all the areas you need to. Sometimes, I felt like I&#x27;d just done an exercise routine, worn out. The ease of use of these battery operated callus removers quickly sold me.    I bought the Emjoi instead of the Amope for a couple of reasons. First, the reviews on the Emjoi convinced me the unit is a good one, and the price was better. Second, I like how the Emjoi&#x27;s sanding roller isn&#x27;t totally exposed, just on one side. That means the dry skin isn&#x27;t flying all over the place and you won&#x27;t find fine white skin dust on your ceiling fan if you don&#x27;t do it in a bathtub; can be easily directed towards a paper towel for easy gather-up and disposal.    I have zero problems with it being battery operated. So far, I&#x27;ve used it maybe 5 times and the sanding roller still has a lot of life left in it. It turns on and off easily; the roller comes out very easily for cleaning; the unit is small and can easily be held in one hand; it is easy to reach pretty much all areas of your feet and toes. If you bear down the motor will slow down, so don&#x27;t bear down. Just go back and forth a few times and have faith the roller is doing its job. And it&#x27;s quite satisfying when you&#x27;re done to see lovely smooth sandal-worthy feet.    Hope all this helps. I do recommend the Emjoi, can&#x27;t think of any negatives, really.</li>
    <li> Not an easy product to use.  You have to stop and clean roller much too often. Cannot roll freely around the heels. Roller should be free to roll on either side. Difficult to use around corners of heel, on sole or sides of feet. Will return product.</li>
    <li> Great product and really works.  Love it and heels feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Wife thinks it&#x27;s the greatest.</li>
    <li> Not as great as i expected. Smooth feet don&#x27;t last long. Sandpaper on this should be coarser. Ped egg works much better.</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering this but am happy I did. I does a great job. But the batteries don&#x27;t last real long.</li>
    <li> Most wonderful item!&lt;br /&gt;Does everything it says it can do.  Your feet feel wonderfully soft and callus free!&lt;br /&gt;Should include an extra set of rollers, it would be a BIG plus.</li>
    <li> fantastic buy.  works like a dream.  I am a senior citizen and have a hard time using a pumice bar because of my arthritis.  This makes it so much easier.</li>
    <li> Love it, works wonders for my feet.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how this has conquered my dry, hard, nasty heels. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and meets all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I sent my Mother this for Christmas. She says it&#x27;s the best product she has ever used for her feet. She insisted on myself getting one as well so I will be ordering one for myself soon. Was quickly delivered and in new and perfect quality.</li>
    <li> Does the job..I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This thing is fantastic!  I thought the PediSpin I&#x27;d previously purchased worked great...until I tried this.  Wow. Just wow.  My ugly, calloused tootsies have utterly been transformed by this device! I would recommend this product to everyone who has gross, calloused feet. I&#x27;m elated!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but on this product I feel I must because there is such a division of great versus awful. This is truly a great product. Those who indicate otherwise are using it incorrectly. Because I always wear sandals I have thick callused feet and have had them all my life. For the past 10 years I have used a Dremel Mini Mite to try and care for the problem. I will never use it again. I will never be without the Emjoi again. Use it lightly like you would an electric razor or an electric toothbrush. You will not be disappointed in the results. I am truly delighted with it.</li>
    <li> Works well but rollers need to be replaced about every 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I received this item and absolutely love it...The quality and what they said it does is so true....I have already saved money on what it would have cost me on a professional pedi....Already paid for itself...You must get one today!!!!!! You will love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The price meet my budget, deliver on time and the product excellent</li>
    <li> I hate pumice, so I have tried this callus remover. It seems a little pricey to me, plus the little rollers aren&#x27;t cheap. I had an older design/.version, and it just died one day after only moderate use. I liked the product enough to give it a second try. Fingers crossed...</li>
    <li> This thing is SUPERB! I wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
    <li> It would have been great but it broke on the second use... too aggravating to have to return so I will keep but it spins and the roller pops out.</li>
    <li> I ordered the multi pack of refills along with this and quickly changed out to the coarse roller because my feet were so rough.&lt;br /&gt;This has been very helpful in keeping my heels looking clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to operate and my young son thought it was fun to give mommy a &amp;#34;pedicure&amp;#34;. :)</li>
    <li> Love it but the buffing part should of been bigger</li>
    <li> I love this thing.. I&#x27;ve spent many hours sanding my feet, soaking them , lotions a creams galore. . Alls you need is this item and you wont need to waste your time n money on all that other stuff</li>
    <li> Works pretty good, not as good as I expected.  It smooths out the rough places on my heels,</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! No more dry heels!</li>
    <li> BEST Callus Remover EVER</li>
    <li> removes skin as described.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and ergonomically designed to allow a perfect grip while operating the unit.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my mom and she loves it. It really works well it&#x27;s small and convenient. She did her feet once really well now she does her feet once a week to maintain them. I definitely recommend this product and brand.</li>
    <li> Great for your feet, nails and hands!</li>
    <li> I really do love this product - have been using it for about 3 weeks now and am really impressed. The MicroPedi will save me time and $$$ - and (I think) will be much safer than some of the methods used by the professionals to remove callouses.</li>
    <li> Not as professional as what I expected. The manual ped-egg works better.</li>
    <li> received earlier than expected. new and works perfect. received as pictured.</li>
    <li> heaven is all i can say for my feet. So soft, i haven&#x27;t felt like this since i was a kid. I think if you have deep calluses you might have issues, especially if you can hear a knock on your feet. But dried and cracked can be resolved quickly i have baby soft feet. Definitely use cream after use, and make sure to use a towel, its a very messy product.</li>
    <li> Great tool, my feet were really really bad no creams could touch them, the callus&#x27;s came right off!</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time with rough skin on my feet since I spend a lot of time outdoors barefoot.  This does get the dead skin off easily without much effort.  I can paint my nails after doing this and it looks like I just got a professional pedicure.  I do have to do it every few days to maintain the results.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love it. Gentle &amp; very effective,  very easy to handle. Has done wonders for my feet , I tend toward nasty cracked heels, edges of my feet especially in summer. In a week (using it just a bit every day) I feel like I do have new feet! Good deal,shipping fast.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to keep my feet looking smooth. This finally did the job perfectly. I use it every few days through the summer and my feet are smooth. Many thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get rid of unsightly calluses on my feet -including soaking solutions, files, liquid removers, and cut my feet with razor callus removers. I saw this and ordered it, partly because it was new and on sale but also with the thought it wouldn&#x27;t really work. After receiving it, I replaced the included spindle with a coarse one, I had ordered separately and popped in 2 AA batteries, turned it on and was amazed with the results! It is powerful but safe to use. It removed every callus and for the first time in years, I can feel the floor under my feet. It&#x27;s even improved my balance! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase:) For the first time in a very long time my feet feel smooth to the touch and I can wear heel-less shoes and sandals again with confidence. Thank you for making such a great product! I love it:)</li>
    <li> This product works quite well for its intended use.</li>
    <li> Love it, after reading the reviews I decided to try it and all the reviews were right it takes my dead skin of my feet and has helped reduce the callacous i would say this is a good buy to get</li>
    <li> I only wish I bought this much sooner!</li>
    <li> I use this after every shower and my heels are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s!  LOVE IT&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> it works ok, It tools off a lot of dead skin but I still had calluses</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this.  I have very tough skin and callouses on my feet. (I walk barefoot as much as I can). I have tried everything to get rid of them.  I have a very rigid maintenance routine with various creams and moisturizers that really doesn&#x27;t accomplish much.  I&#x27;ve used stones and blades, and they are pretty limited in effect.  I was VERY skeptical that this would work for me.  I even went so far as to buy the extra course replacement wheel.  Turns out I didn&#x27;t need it.  The standard wheel worked marvelously and in no time at all.  The wheel looks like it will go for a while without replacement too!  I just couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I only wish I had found this gem sooner.  I was also concerned that it might be too much for my feet or thinner callouses, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all.  It didn&#x27;t get hot on my feet or burn in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped from a 3rd party and came very quickly.  I ordered it at the same time I ordered some other Prime items, and the callus remover came the day after my Prime stuff.  I&#x27;ve had it now for just a few days, so I can&#x27;t attest to long term performance.  The device itself is very light, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made.  It doesn&#x27;t come with any &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; like replacement wheels, but at this point, I don&#x27;t see needing one for a while.  This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> Does the job pretty well- would like a&amp;#34; rougher&amp;#34; option to  insert  Would be helpful</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to try this model.  It works great.  I had some deep calluses so took several days to wear them down, rather than doing it all at one time.  I pop the roller out after every use and clean.  I didn&#x27;t expect miracles but the tool works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> So happy I made this purchase!  Make sure you have a towel under your foot while exfoliating.  After exfoliation is complete wipe foot down with damp cloth and slather with lotion for a smooth finish.  Great for an at home pedicure.  Make sure you keep the Emoji moving so that you do not create too much friction in any one spot.</li>
    <li> Love this....wish I had known about powered call us removers years ago.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the money. I get better results with a gadget I bought for 1/2 (or less) the price. Plus, the refills are way over priced. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but after getting this in the mail today, I feel compelled to tell others about this product. In a matter of minutes, my feet were smooth and I could see all the dead skin on the floor. It works like ultra-fine grit sandpaper and just smoothes the feet with a couple of passes. I read the directions and followed them exactly, not over-doing it. I followed with a quick rinse and some Aquaphor (like Vaseline) before bed. I was so excited about the results that I called my friend to tell her about it.</li>
    <li> Works great and fast. My feet are super smooth all the time.  I did buy the green extreme coarse rollers.  They work much faster than the blue ones.  It&#x27;s easy to switch rollers, so you can start with a green one, then finish up with a blue one.</li>
    <li> just received it today, but i already fall in love with it.</li>
    <li> Got this today and my son decided he was going to treat my feet. He pened the package, found some batteries and went to town on my feet. He is 10 years old and had a great time sanding my feet. It was like a wood working project. My feet are now smooth and it only took a few minutes. my feet were so bad my sheets wore out at the foot of my bed. I think a monthly treatment is a great idea and so is this product. They offer a membership to the club to get the sander rolls every three months but it&#x27;s not required.</li>
    <li> works good but I don&#x27;t use it anymore since I used baby feet peel system and lotion every night.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to choose the new model because of the new design (thought I would miss the handle) but so glad I did!  It&#x27;s comfortable in your hand.  The extra power leaves my feet looking great in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  A foot file is just as good.  I tried a variety of rollers and they are only good for one or two uses.</li>
    <li> amazing little machine, it really works for me, and I have really bad feet, but you do not need to press hard, just let the roller do its job. Great</li>
    <li> This really is effective for long standing callus.  I am removing the callus in stages, but am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I had the hardest dry, cracked heal due to multiple surgeries and this took care of it. I just wish I would have ordered extra rollers since my heal was so bad.</li>
    <li> Good product just keep batteries and rollers on hand.</li>
    <li> Product works better than expected.</li>
    <li> Takes the miles right off cracked heals &amp; dry skin!  i love this product, but you must not overuse it, otherwise  your feet will become senstive.  Compact and easy to use, totally works for my feet.  Its a little gross to see all the deadskin coming off, but that&#x27;s the proof that it works.  I bought one as a gift for a family member, was a it!  Great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for!!! right out of the box was right on. So many years bothered with caluses .&lt;br /&gt;removal was EASY!!  beats razors and other ways of cutting the hard skin off. 15 to 2o mins later I was&lt;br /&gt;able to walk normally. Hard to put that into words, THANKS</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! Way better than the Pediegg and so fast and easy to use. My feet have never felt this good without getting a professional pedicure.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  It&#x27;s so much faster than the manual foot sanders.  Makes my feet feel so soft. I&#x27;m going to order the courser pads for summer calluses that need a little more power.</li>
    <li> Great callus shaver.  I&#x27;ve bought several for gifts and have told (and shown) all my friends about this.  It does not pull nor get too close so no discomfort at all.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and the soles of my feet never felt or looked better.  I immediately bought a set of 8 replacement rollers because I plan on using it frequently as a maintenance tool so that I no longer have to have the nail salon do the callous removal.  Much safer and more sanitary this way.  An excellent tool for a great price!</li>
    <li> This thing mess up my feet. It had them peeling so bad. I hurry up and send it back</li>
    <li> The best product ever!!!</li>
    <li> Really does work, but you still need to use lotions to see best results I believe. This really does help to get the dead cracked skin off.</li>
    <li> Rotten things, deceptive</li>
    <li> I have had these horrible calluses on my heels for years. I have used pumas stones and have had them sanded off. A temporary fix. I bought this and as soon as I touched my heel, it stopped.&lt;br /&gt;So, I returned it. They were prompt to reimburse me.</li>
    <li> works well and makes feet softer and smooth</li>
    <li> This little device is pretty incredible.  I received one as a gift then bought one for my Dad.  If you own this, and use it, you will never have to have unsightly feet again.  Seriously.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> works great, love how it make your feet feel!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the $20 I wouldn&#x27;t spend more on it,  works fine, the only thing is you need to change the rollers and those aren&#x27;t cheap</li>
    <li> Really lacking in torque and power.</li>
    <li> I really love this Pedi Foot Buffer, it is very easy to use. This buffer is the best investment you can make. Don&#x27;t wait get one!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! For any woman who has known the horror of being born with Fred Flintstone feet this is a small price to pay for heels that don&#x27;t look as if they&#x27;ve been used to stop the footmobile. I&#x27;ve used pumice, the PedEgg, and many other methods, but this little gadget is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget. My friend at school told me about it and she was so happy with it I just had to try it. I fell in love with it. It is just awesome, takes all that unwanted tough, calloused skin off my feet and makes them smooth and soft to the touch. I have told all my friends and family about it. My friends at work are getting one, my mom has one and I am getting ready to order another one for my daughter for her birthday. The only down side is it uses batteries, if you could just plug it in instead of having to keep a stock of batteries that would be great. Actually having the option of either or would be even nicer.</li>
    <li> A+++ excellent product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This I received as a Christmas present from a dear friend and liked it so much that I bought one for another friend for her birthday in January.  She loves hers too.</li>
    <li> It is so easy and works so well and does exactly what it says. Love it! Makes a self pedicure easy.Works better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this about a week now and am very happy with the way it works.  i had read other reviews (somewhat mixed because the ppl who bought it and didn&#x27;t like it weren&#x27;t using it correctly), so i thought i would give it a shot and see.  you have to use a gentle touch with it -- you can&#x27;t press hard or it does stop spinning - which i imagine is a safety feature.  but here&#x27;s what i did, i put a towel (dark colored is good) under me while i was using it and i could see the huge amount of dry skin that came off my feet the first time.  now i&#x27;ve used it just about every day.  my feet are in much better shape.  but you have to wash your feet and apply some kind of cream or lotion and then socks (for a while) to achieve this.  but it&#x27;s so much easier to use than a regular pumice stone and even better than the pedi-egg, which i used and thought was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  so i would recommend this.  as someone said - that dry skin on your feet didn&#x27;t get there in one day and it&#x27;s going to take more than one day to get rid of it ... so keep working at it ... i suspect that once i get rid of the majority of the dry skin, i can use it once or twice a week to maintain the smooth skin i want ...</li>
    <li> not worth it&lt;br /&gt;not powerful enough.</li>
    <li> You would have to pay $100 to have a pedicure as good as this.  It is gentle and does the job well without any discomfort.  I just love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It works great on my scaly heels. It has enough power to do the job and about once every month or two I can quickly and easily get rid of my scaly, cracked looking heels. This really works good. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Useage was,  was a safe/ comfortable experiebce.t hat, I also purchased  th Emjoi electric corded w/handle model. So nice I bought it twice. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically a small sander for your tough skin. I never experienced any discomfort using it and it has quickly and cleanly removed the hard dry skin from the heels of my feet.</li>
    <li> I still cannot believe how well this works! I swear I&#x27;ve tried every other products, cremes, soaks, you name it but I still get callus&#x27;s the sides of my heals and NOTHING compares to how well this works. It&#x27;s painless, quick and just does a darn good job making my feet smooth and soft. I couldn&#x27;t stop raving to my friends and even my hubby about. I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t sold in many places (probably because it&#x27;ll put pedicure places out of business). Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have bad callouses on my heels and a pumice stone wasn&#x27;t time effective in wearing them down. This product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use (as opposed to those electric callous cheese graters on the market that just look terrifying) and is quiet and efficient. Because it basically sands down your callouses very quickly, you&#x27;ll be left with a pile of &amp;#34;saw dust&amp;#34; (aka, dead skin) wherever you use it but that&#x27;s evidence that it&#x27;s working. It will probably take you more than one use to completely remove your callouses if they&#x27;re relatively thick but I haven&#x27;t found that it&#x27;s an inconvenience to use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I am going to be completely honest!  I was very skeptical when I saw this item on TV - I was even more skeptical when I read all of the great ratings on Amazon.  I did not use my pumice stone for over a week on purpose to see if the Micro-Pedi was worth its&#x27; weight in gold.  I am here to confirm the Micro-Pedi does exactly what it says - my feet were so smooth.  I am so impressed - I am going to purchase one for my daughter.  Who knew this little contraption would provide me so much happiness.</li>
    <li> Not impressed....I still had to use my old standbys...a pumice stone, pedi-file, etc...this just isn&#x27;t powerful enough &amp; it bogs down if the least amount of pressure is used :(</li>
    <li> This is the first summer I haven&#x27;t had to pay for pedicures every two weeks! My feet are callus free!!!!! and it only takes a minute or two!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Soft feet, check. Done quickly at home without dropping lots of money and spending time at a pedicure appointment, check. I LOVE it. I did drop one star because I feel that the insert does wear out somewhat quickly (and no, I don&#x27;t have troll feet), but I am ok with buying replacements because I still love it and it is still much cheaper than pedicures!</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as expected, even with new batteries. After one use the battery power isn&#x27;t enough to operate the callous remover a second time sufficiently.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY WIFE. SHE IS SO HAPPY WITH IT THAT SHE WONDERS WHY SHE DID NOT PURCHASE AN ITEM LIKE THIS YEARS EARLIER. MY OPINION .......... YOU CAN PAY MORE, BUT YOU CANNOT BUY BETTER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  JEFF KIRBY -- NOTASULGA, AL</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> This works great! I was skeptical but so very pleased! This will cut down on pedicures at the salon. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have use pediegg and it just too much trouble to constantly use and recently it has started to leave scales like marks on my feet.  I&#x27;m using this product to fix what the pediegg has done to my feet and i have it to say it a miracle worker.  You do need replacement roller on deck because they do wear out quickly but if that what it takes to restore your feet then you know you need to do it.</li>
    <li> My new favorite gadget!  My mom got it for me for Christmas and I just used it for the first time.  Love it!  So easy.  And painless!  I don&#x27;t have really bad calluses, so I don&#x27;t know if it would be good for that... but for me it softened up my rough/thick spots along my heels really nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes... I&#x27;m a real person! :)</li>
    <li> I have used it twice now.  I wear sandals year round and tend to get hard calluses and hate to get pedicures!  I just love this product. Very easy to handle and worked right away. I was amazed how fast and easy this was.  I didn&#x27;t get any extra rollers with this product so I will have to order more.  I do make sure to clean it real well afterward. Does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to grind down my boot feet, if you don&#x27;t need something like this, it will probably work great for you.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much other than take off a small layer of the callous. I am sure if I kept up with it daily the callous would eventually dissapear however after a few uses I can tell that just using my regular lava rocks do a better job.</li>
    <li> Wish it was a little longer. It is only about 3 i/2 in long and it&#x27;s harder to reach all areas easily but seems to do a good job of removing callous.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works perfect!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. If you have continuous need to remove calluses from your feet, this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; to buy. It is too light-weight for heavily callused feet. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> works great, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love my Emjoi Micro- pedi.  Only use it once &amp; it does a wonderful job. Don&#x27;t press on it when in use. I 5 starred it</li>
    <li> A handy yet useful tool to remove callus on foot or hand. My wife loves it after using it. It&#x27;s better to order at least two sets of rollers, one set of super coarse  and one extreme coarse for future use.</li>
    <li> This does exactl;y what it says it will do . It is very gentle to the foot, Makes feet smooth  and comfortable. Saves so much time than filing by hand.</li>
    <li> I am diabetic and have very rough, course heels.  I use this after my shower a few times a week and my heels are smooth again.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that even makes a dent in the calluses on my heels.  I bought extra coarse rollers to use instead of the ones that come with it and they work great.  Battery life is iffy, I&#x27;ve used it maybe three times for &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; sessions and it does seem like they need to be replaced.  But we have kids so there is an endless supply of AA batteries in this house, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
    <li> very small in person, almost too small and awkward, felt very cheap as well</li>
    <li> Thi:s works very well.  We use it often, it really works, just don&#x27;t use too long at a time.  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Use for rough spots on hands from Crossfitting. Great for it.</li>
    <li> Works much better than files or other products.  Very happy and soft feet!</li>
    <li> Fantastic little tool! Raved so much about it, two friends bought one. My only complaint is that an extra roller wasn&#x27;t included with the one I ordered and one that my friend bought at Cosco included an extra for same price as mine. Replacement rollers are a bit expensive.  Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Do not buy it it doesn t work!</li>
    <li> Where has this been during all the time I chiseled my feet!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this.  Gently removes calluses.</li>
    <li> Surprised by how well this worked - shaves the skin right off, leaving feet beautifully smooth in a very short time.  I live in south Florida, where flip flops and sandals are year round, so anything to help avoid gnarly feet is a welcome addition to my home pedicure routine!</li>
    <li> OMG THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with terrible calloused rough cracked heels- and lately I&#x27;ve combined the Callous Blaster exfoliating soak with this... and the results are incredible.  My heels are *almost* normal!</li>
    <li> great product, does the job!</li>
    <li> works great....love ,,love it!</li>
    <li> Okay I read all the reviews and figured I&#x27;d take the plunge.  For the record my feet are AWFUL.  It&#x27;s only been like this in the past 2 years or so but I get crazy hard callous&#x27;.  Then my skin cracks due to the callous and it is painful to walk.  I have tried just about everything.  All the creams, lotions, buffers, pumice stones, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had hopes for this but just wasn&#x27;t sure it would actually help my horrible feet.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It actually helps quite a bit!  You must understand that this is NOT a miracle solution for those of us with really bad feet.  But it is a big help.  You must also keep up with it and use it frequently and then moisturize.  If you use it like this then it will improve your feet quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only 4 stars?  Because a) I wish the coarse roller was coarser and b) I find you have to replace the roller frequently to get good results.  The replacements are not cheap either but I am still pretty happy overall.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> excellent way to exfoliate your feet and remove callouses.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This turned my feet from rough and cracked to baby smooth after the first few uses.  I give  it 10 Stars!</li>
    <li> This is fun to use to watch piles of skin dust pour off, stopped my heels from getting deep cracks.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Works well. I use it frequently!</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for a man.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received this. And  used this immediately.&lt;br /&gt; Foot is clean now. This is safe, easy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, seller.</li>
    <li> ...be prepared to pay alot for refills.  This product has worked very well for me, but the rollers wear out quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great at a great price! Beats paying salon prices.Wish replacements were cheaper and would last a little longer than they do</li>
    <li> Great product. my wife loves it. You need to read the directions to use it properly and to clean the rollers after each use for health reasons.</li>
    <li> Perfect hand held foot smoother</li>
    <li> With respect to the Micro-Pedi company, I have severely callused feet from several years in the Marine Corps and continuing on to a civil service job where I am constantly on my feet. Having said that, this callus remover was nothing special and did not remove my calluses.  It removed small pieces of dead skin but the majority of my calluses are still intact as this callus remover was no match for them. I have tried several other things to no avail such as lotions, hand files, etc. I&#x27;m not really comfortable discussing my lack of foot care with strangers but hopefully its saves someone money if your foot condition sounds equal to or worse than mine. On a lighter note, the grinder wheel on this machine was pleasantly painless and relatively quick for the traces of skin it was able to remove. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Gets the jagged edges smooth!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  I felt a little  skeptical at the beginning, but once I tried it, couldn&#x27;t believe it - I felt so happy-  The first week I was obsessed with it and still couldn&#x27;t believe how it transformed my feet, from rough heels to very soft. I am enjoying so much more now to put lotion on my feet.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL! WORKS GREAT USE IT EVERY DAY BECAUSE I HAVE HORRIBLE FEET.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well the Emjoi Callus Remover works.  I know most of the reviews were positive on this, but I still had my doubts. This thing is great.  I will save a lot of money this summer, as I no longer have to go for a pedicure every few weeks.  My heels look better using the Emjoi than when I get a pedicure.  It is so easy to use.  This is for anyone who wears sandals during the summer.</li>
    <li> Nothing, and I mean nothing has ever worked on my calluses before. This is fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used many products to try and slough off my calluses on my heals including the pedi egg which was a complete waste of money. The Emjoi micro pedi surpassed my expectations. I have only used it twice and my heels feel and look better than they have in years. I even get pedis twice a month and my heels don&#x27;t feel this good afterwards. This product just saved me $20 month in callus remover for my pedi. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend this product! I spend a lot of time on my feet and have always scrubbed them 4-5 times a week, just to keep them kind of soft. After weeks of searching for a pedi tool, I decided to try this one and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. My feet were not in bad shape, by any means, and I still noticed a huge difference! Instead of scrubbing my feet every other day, I use this twice a week and my feet are incredibly soft! If you let the tool do the work, and don&#x27;t press it into your foot, you&#x27;ll have great results!</li>
    <li> 2ND REVIEW.ITS REALLY GREAT.SUPER PRICE.JUST NEEDS BATTERIES.GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all and this is just incredible!!! Loved the tip that it works best on dry feet. My feet were always calloused and they are now so smooth! Easy and painless to use!</li>
    <li> I purchased this about three weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend.  I highly recommend it as well.  I have been using it alternate days, followed by a heavy duty foot cream (Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Creme).  Prior to purchase, I was developing cracks in my heels.  They are now gone.  My feet are less rough, and look much better.  I have had no trouble with it working and encourage new users to pay heed to comments regarding not pressing hard on the device while using it.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price paid.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy to use.  Painless and instantly leaves area smooth.</li>
    <li> i want to try a more coarse roller</li>
    <li> Good device, but it is really micro. If it will have straight electric cord instead of battery it will be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I liked the older model better, with the longer handle and fuller/wider rolling area.</li>
    <li> i think it does an ok job. it dont help 100% but i guess it does get some off, i still want something more professional and im not going to invest in anything like this again</li>
    <li> It is very good for the feet and heels , no problem.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foot pedi!! My feet were so callused, rough, horrible looking! I recoeved this and within one hour of use i transformed ugly feet into smooth, healthy looking, barefoot beauty!  I purchased the precision callus remover also for that finer work..cant wait till next foot doc appt to show off my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; feet!!</li>
    <li> This product is just ok. I thought this was going to be an excellent product because of the reviews. Maybe I need to use it more frequently. When I&#x27;ve used it, my heels still have dead skin on them. Maybe I was expecting a miracle. I&#x27;m going to use it more frequently and then update my review if I need to.</li>
    <li> love this for in between salon pedicures.  really does what it claims.  can use wet or dry.  I feel it does better dry.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Easy to use and it does the trick!</li>
    <li> This little &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; is amazing. I normally use a blade callus remover, which works well, but it does not even come close to what this product can do. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, only when I need to. It has gotten rid of my callus and I have smoothed my heels as well. It really is a wonderful product for a great price. If you need more power, you could always opt for the plug in version. This battery powered it enough for me. And ladies, if your man has rough hands, you can convince him to try this product. It removes all that built up, dead, dry skin.</li>
    <li> I live in the Arizona desert, dry, dry, and dry, so rough and callused feet are a real problem.  This product works like a dream and is easy to use, smooths feet in no time.  Use over a towel as the dead skin falls like snow.  Great product worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. love it.</li>
    <li> Best thing since &amp;#34;sliced bread&amp;#34;. I was amazed at how well this works. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of the calluses on the bottom of my feet and all were very time consuming and didn&#x27;t work that well - until the Emjoi. Now the soles of my feet are baby smooth!</li>
    <li> Fast and safely remove heel skin buildup.  Actually better than going to the nail salon.  I recommend getting the refill with your first order.</li>
    <li> For feet that have walked barefoot for 60 summers this is a gift from heaven !&lt;br /&gt;Smoothly, effectively and most importantly with control from me it removes unwanted dry skin</li>
    <li> I just bought this after reading the reviews.  I have bought few other callus remover and while it worked ok but not great.  As soon as I got this I put fresh batteries (batteries did not come with it) and start using it.  WOW!!!  Because it is a roller it does reach curves with no problems.  I love this so much I am ordering more rollers (coarse and fine).</li>
    <li> Have been using the PedEgg for years and thought it was doing a good job- results with the Emjoi are dramatically better- great purchase</li>
    <li> I have major foot problems that, even after surgery, still form deep callouses. I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, blades, gels, you name it. None of them came close to this product. It&#x27;s painless and very effective. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I stand on my feet all day, and I developed a cracked heel.  Nothing seemed to help and I bought this to try.  It took care of the crack and my heels have never been softer.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool. It works just fine....never stops, still on the first set of batteries. Just bought the extra coarse refills for those times when the heels get a little worse.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Makes my feet feel smooth. After I got a peddi, my feet still felt rough in spots and I used this. It did a better job than the girl at the salon. I use it a few times a week to keep my feet sandal ready. It is easy to clean and so far, the blue part is still going strong. Just make sure your batteries are fully charged or the wheel will slow down and not be as effective.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this, I was using 3 different callus removers in the shower and none of them can begin to compare to using the Emjoi Nano callus remover! This is such an awesome product, removing the rough skin and leaving it soft. It takes a few runs (several days) using the roller it comes with for a few days to remove layers of thick callus, but even though you may have some left the heels are so smooth still. I didn&#x27;t think my callus was so thick... but it is... so glad I have this to help get back to healthy heels again!&lt;br /&gt;So much cheaper than a pedicure too!!! Best price here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;The size is easy to hold and use. When I&#x27;m done I just blow on it to remove the debris; works better then trying to use the small brush it comes with. I&#x27;ve used it several times and the battery still is sounding the same so I think I&#x27;ll get a lot of uses with the batteries.</li>
    <li> False advertising -- not powerful at all.  When I use it it stops all the time, and if I put just a little less pressure it doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return it, but the only phone # in the package you are asked to leave a message, but no one returns the call.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing. It helps my feet so much. I stand all day for my job so it&#x27;s nice to take care of my feet when I can. I use this dry and then soak my feet.  It seems to do a good job. I&#x27;m getting the coarser rollers to try them out. I&#x27;ll see which is better</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this little gadget.  After my daily shower, I lightly run this over my feet.  Calluses have disappeared and I no longer have to pay for a callus-removing pedicure.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not as powerful as i thought</li>
    <li> very small and works only on batteries. Wish it was stronger. Replacement files have to be ordered on line. A bit of a pain and expense.</li>
    <li> this beats a pedicure great for diabetic I would buy another for the wife</li>
    <li> This thing works great.  It does a nice even job and does not burn your foot like other devices.</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone who would like to do their own pedicure @ home. Works very well on removing those rough dry spots from your feet.</li>
    <li> This works great. It removed my callouses and now my feet are nice and smooth.  It is the perfect size and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> EXcellent product. It does exactly what it says it will do, evidenced by the nastiness that came off my heels. Use this over a towel, toilet, sink because powdered you will be everywhere. If you buy this, make sure to buy extra rolls.</li>
    <li> Very good for taking care of callus.</li>
    <li> Sanding drum on a variable-speed rotary tool is much more manageable/effective and the little replacement drums are only $3-$4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lacks power and took almost 10 minutes to make a noticeable difference to a small callous on the palm of my hand. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Works awesome  i wear boots every day and my feet are so rough&lt;br /&gt;I used it 3 days in a row and my feet are so soft now</li>
    <li> Good product, works well, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was little skeptical of buying this. But for the price of $20, I decided to buy it and give it a try.  after one use.  It really impressed with the difference it made.  This is an awesome product to take off the rough edges .  Very happy with my purchase.  :)</li>
    <li> great product that works as advertised</li>
    <li> I live in Fl. so I go bare footed a lot. Hence the calluses. This was pretty good, though it only comes with 1 roller. The replacements are a bit up there unless you commit to a plan. I like it and will most likely will order more rollers/</li>
    <li> It did a great job and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!! It&#x27;s done wonders for my rough feet!! I recommend ordering the super coarse refill roller. I got the 4 pack. Used this a few times then started with the super coarse and it was like magic!!! Follow with a good foot cream or vaseline for better results and put some socks on. I do this every night before bed or in the morning. My feet feel so soft and are back to normal!</li>
    <li> Works as shown on tv and as I expected it would.  it&#x27;s easier than a manual emery board for feet.</li>
    <li> This thing worked better than I could have imagined!</li>
    <li> this product works really good on my dry heels especially when I am out in CA and it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
    <li> Again this is labor intensive in doing the job. I spend as much time cleaning the roller as I do removing my calluses.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and it worked really well on his feet (he has awful feet) and it removed a lot of the dead skin and callouses, but it took a long time for it to do it (I&#x27;m talking hours here). Replacement parts are a little on the expensive side, and it would add up pretty quickly for what my husband would need. Finally my husband just took a palm sander to his feet, and was done in a fraction of the time and got his feet a lot smoother. This product is okay if you don&#x27;t have really bad, hard, calloused feet.</li>
    <li> I find this product easy to use and effective. I may buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have a real problem with calluses on my heels and behind my big toes.  I can pumice and sand and file and break them down but then they&#x27;re sore and after a few days they get all rough.  This works so slick. No soreness , don&#x27;t know yet about the rough after a few days, but if they are I can just take 30 seconds to run the Emjoi over them and they&#x27;ll be smooth again.  Very easy and you don&#x27;t have to (and shouldn&#x27;t) press hard.  Just ordered 2 more for Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail.  Opened the package and used it right away.  OMG! OMG! OMG! It&#x27;s fabulous.  I have (had) bad callius&#x27;.  It only took a few minutes and now I have baby smooth feet (even my heels).  My feet were even worse than what you see on the ad...not anymore!  Love it.  If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this item, stop thinking.  Get it!  You&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. I intend to order more products soon.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; undamaged and I love using it.</li>
    <li> Over priced didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Less powerful than had expected. But still did the job quite fine.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Press gently on your callus and it will easily flake off.  I do it outside as it does get messy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed! It worked well once. I wasted my money</li>
    <li> Works unbelievable for what it cost</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 1 or 2 times a week followed by a moisturizer, and my feet are getting softer and softer!  That&#x27;s pretty amazing for me because usually my feet (especially my heels) are a cracked, dry mess in the middle of winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the best results when my feet are clean but totally dry. On completely dry skin, it gently removes the dead skin in a fine power. (I don&#x27;t use it right after washing because it just kind of catches and clogs on damp towel dried skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me less than 5 minutes to finish both feet. Then I clean off everything with the included brush, and put it away until next time.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull product, i recomend it</li>
    <li> It zips right through the callus.  Mine are so bad I am going to have to use it daily for awhile but I really like the results.</li>
    <li> Its ok thought it wouldn&#x27;t been better</li>
    <li> My only comment is that it was a little on the small size.</li>
    <li> Thrilled with this product, period!</li>
    <li> So I have used many, many products to try and make my feet look nice. I spend a lot of time walking around barefoot and don&#x27;t have a lot of time for pedicures. Soooooo, I saw this and thought okay I&#x27;ll try it, but I didn&#x27;t really think it was going to work that well. When it arrived, I opened it immediately and set to work. Immediately I noticed that whatever was going on, SOMETHING was happening. In minutes I had pretty much done both feet, rinsed, dried and lotioned and they looked amazing! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I already have one that I love...bought this one for a Christmas gift and she loves it..</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve used a foot shaver to remove all of my calluses and have cut myself a few times.  For the first time in my life, by using Emjoi, my feet are smooth and I do not need to use a foot shaver anymore!  This is a great product and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Throw out your ped-egg and buy this!!! It works great! Takes very little time for smooth results</li>
    <li> Great product, pampers feet unbelievably well!  My wife says it&#x27;s the best gift I have ever given her!</li>
    <li> Does not work as well on removing callouses as I&#x27;d hoped. Takes a long time to remove dead skin, and even then, does a poor job.</li>
    <li> I used my Emjoi for four nights at first felt wonderful and my feet were soft. I now only use it once a week for maintenance. I gave my children each one and they love there&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> works great with OEM Emjoi rollers do not buy generic equivalents.</li>
    <li> Crazy item,it&#x27;s useful for my husband&#x27;s feet,I love it！</li>
    <li> This is the best callus remover. Battery operated so it&#x27;s good for travel. Very powerful for a small hand held unit. Does a better job than going to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> Works very good on my wife&#x27;s feet. Very easy to use and a great buy.</li>
    <li> World&#x27;s biggest skeptic here!  I thought it sounded ridiculous but figured what the hell.  This thing is awesome.  Read the directions and results are fantastic!  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the bigger version</li>
    <li> love this product, but overpriced</li>
    <li> This is just a great tool, works wonders, and is pain free!</li>
    <li> not as helpful as advertised</li>
    <li> Bought this and love it.......works perfectly !!!!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> After spending lots of dollars trying to find something that really works on my callused feet, I have finally found something that really works!  After just one use, I will never go back to anything else.  I am a diabetic and have to watch what I use on my feet.  It takes the calluses without damaging my feet.  This is truly amazing!  My feet are now sandal ready and I can&#x27;t wait!  Thank you Emjoi for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> got this thing for my wife( and me too, I guess). it actually works great. it makes our feet feel really smooth and my wife seems to like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and is not harsh on skin.  Best winter feet I have ever had !  I look forward to weekly buffer treatment.</li>
    <li> This item is a must have for anyone wanting to keep their feet in top notch condition. Especially during the sandal wearing months!!! Works like a charm! So easy to use and gets the job done quickly and efficiently! I would recommend this item to both men and women.</li>
    <li> Every so often a product comes along that actually does what it promises to.  This foot buffer is WONDERFUL!  It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable to grip, and in almost no time &amp;#34;sands&amp;#34; off all the dead, calloused, cracked skin on my feet.  My heels are particularly rough and cracked and it took care of them in no time and they are now smooth as butter.  If you have issues with dry skin espiecially in the winter time, then purchase this. If you&#x27;re like me and base most of your buying decisions on other customers reviews, I hope this helps you to decide. I think you will be as pleased as I am.  I am considering purchasing a second one as I never want to be without it again!  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Get corded one instead</li>
    <li> Loves it, brought two</li>
    <li> Love the Emjoi. Works great. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Cleaned up my hard patches in a jiffy</li>
    <li> I just received the MicroPedi.  Easy to use and works great.  After I finished I put AmLactin (you can also buy on Amazon - my dermatologist recommended this ) and I now have smooth, soft feet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried one of these before, but after this winter,and my feet never out of socks,and the price was amazing, I thought I&#x27;d try it! Well it worked wonderful. My calluses are off and my feet feel smooth for the first time in years!!</li>
    <li> My wife mostly uses this with great results! It works as described. It takes off the old &amp; calloused skin with ease &amp; your feet feel a lot better afterwards. Highly recommended by me!</li>
    <li> This is a great item! Works awesome! Would be improved if came with one or two additional rollers!</li>
    <li> Great little toil works well very pleased</li>
    <li> awesome, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this for you rough areas,hands, feet, elbows.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping  I just ordered the heavy duty replacements to hopefully get it to work a bit better</li>
    <li> Fast delivery works good. My feet are really bad I have some deep cracks. It&#x27;s going to take a little more work to heal the cracks but as for the rest of the foot smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to soak my feet first. I will try that next and see if it helps with the deep cracks.</li>
    <li> So, I didn&#x27;t actually buy this product for myself. But, I was a bad granddaughter and forgot to tell my grandma happy birthday ( I know shame one me) and I wanted to apologize and give her something that she has always wanted. My grandma has always had problems with caluses and roughness on her feet. She was and still is a very hard working lady for 73. She has wanted something for YEARS that would help make her feet softer and not so bothersome when she is walking around in her shoes. So, I told her to tell me what she wanted and I narrowed it down to this......and I got the text tonight that she absolutely loves it and that it helped sooo much and it definitely made up for me forgetting to tell her happy birthday. Now, I know some of you might be thinking that shes just telling me that not to hurt my feelings but, my grandma is a straight shooter and she would tell me if it sucked....therefore I give this product 5 stars because, if anyone will tell it like it is my grandma will!</li>
    <li> This little device is pricey but worth it.  It saved my soles!  A &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; for summer. I am so glad I ordered this.</li>
    <li> This has really worked well for me. A few tips I&#x27;ve learned;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use rechargeable batteries and charge them often. This eats batteries like a kid eats candy.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t expect to remove all callouses in one sitting. Use it for a few minutes every day for a week and you will get great results.&lt;br /&gt;3. Change the roller when it the effectiveness diminishes. With 2 people using it, I change every couple months.&lt;br /&gt;4. Get the coarse &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; roller for thick callouses. It will work a lot quicker on those.</li>
    <li> If you wear shoes, you need this product. No matter the shoe, there will be pressure on some area and your feet will respond with a thickening of skin - even if you are young. This product is the best thing I have ever used to help with the removal of callus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle of the head is set so that you do not have to think about how to hold the machine to work on your feet. It very gently &#x27;sands&#x27; away calluses or other dead skin on your feet. Even my husband is using this little gem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No kidding, I wish that I had found this product years ago!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works amazing. My feet are so soft and nice after using this callus remover. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works really well for me. My heels are really rough and calloused all of the time, and regular use of this product keeps that under control.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money, especially when I add together what I&#x27;ve spent on other products. I used it on just one foot for a few days to see the difference - let&#x27;s just say that foot didn&#x27;t stick to my sock like velcro anymore.  Will be buying more roller refills right away so that I always have some ready to go now that summer is here.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a pedi since I got it! It has taken care of all of the roughness on my heels.</li>
    <li> I have deformed feet that require me to make appointments with a podiatrist for callous removal every three months.  I am now able to safely remove the callous at home, saving me a lot of time and money.  I am very, very pleased!</li>
