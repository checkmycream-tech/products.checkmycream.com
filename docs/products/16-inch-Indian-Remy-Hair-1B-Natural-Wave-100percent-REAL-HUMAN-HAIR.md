      <li>but I guess the price was way too good to be true.</li>
      <li>I really love the weave.</li>
      <li>and yes I love the hair</li>
      <li>i love amadon</li>
      <li>this hair is okay for the price.</li>
      <li>You guys will be seeing my name more often .</li>
      <li>just try it out you will love it to</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shred it&#x27;s smooth and has a nice silky tone to it.</li>
      <li>You are better off going to a beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>This hair was ok</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>I will provide another update after I wash it but for right now it is just ok,</li>
      <li>I saw this hair at a local beauty supply which was going for $125 per 4 oz glad to find it here at amazon even though its not 4oz but 3.5oz you need to buy 2 packs for the whole head to be covered great product</li>
      <li>At first I took a glane at the hair and THOUGHT that iwasnt satisfied because of the length .</li>
      <li>for this I said to myself i will write one to help those who arent sure is this is a real product.</li>
      <li>I bought a 14 and 16 inches true to measurement too.</li>
      <li>The hair is great jus not true to length more like a 14 bt still satisfied so far.</li>
      <li>My first impression was how light the color was.</li>
      <li>soft i love it .</li>
      <li>Very cheap became nappy very quickly will never order hair from amazon again because I am a perfectionist when it comes to hair and this was very below low quality.</li>
      <li>Your better of at a local beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>I worn this hair wavy, wand curled,  and straight and the hair remains soft, manageable and tangle free.</li>
      <li>It is pretty, though and blends very well.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast</li>
      <li>it is very manageable.</li>
      <li>But if you really think about it , its curly so the length isn&#x27;t as it appears to be until worn or flattened .</li>
      <li>I am so sad because the hair was so beautiful upon arrival</li>
      <li>i ordered two bunches of 16\\&quot; and it was full of grey hairs</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new</li>
      <li>Better than expected actually !</li>
      <li>When I got it the first thing I did was cut a piece off and flat iron it.</li>
      <li>I went to a hair store and bought real virgin brazilian hair For just about da same price</li>
      <li>The hair came early but it was old as hell.</li>
      <li>but it really was short for 16 inches.</li>
      <li>I am a professional stylist of 20 years and also teach cosmetology</li>
      <li>I would make another purchase in the future with this company since it is very affordable.</li>
      <li>I only give it a 2 star bcuz the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>I hate that because it was great when I first put it in sooo</li>
      <li>I cowashed colored with professional creme pigment and low volume developer.</li>
      <li>so I do have access to professional products; however extension hair must be treated differently, Drug store/supermarket products are a must for this hair.  </li>
      <li>I dont normally write reviews even though I have been an amazon customer for a long time but</li>

<li> so I do have access to professional products; however extension hair must be treated differently, Drug store/supermarket products are a must for this hair.  </li>
<li> I dont normally write reviews even though I have been an amazon customer for a long time but</li>
<li> It seems less then that it actually feels like a whole pack opposed to a pack and a half.</li>
<li> the curl simply doesnt curl the way I expected.</li>
<li> I also got it earlier than expected.</li>
<li> The only problem I had with the hair is that I wish it was a little bit neater, but that was only from the shipping.</li>
<li> Once I washed it, it became tangled, matted, dry, and lifeless.</li>
<li> The curls fell and when wet it doesn&#x27;t revert.</li>
<li> This hair has  a lot of dead and short ends!</li>
<li> I recommend it to people looking to do a partial sew-in.</li>
<li> I never wear the hair straight because of the ends they&#x27;re fuller at the top and has always been thinner at the bottom, it&#x27;s looks horrible.</li>
<li> I mean like soo old that when I took the band that holds together the hair I had to get I comb</li>
<li> I have gotten hair that says its human hair and when you flat iron it it feels stiff a little afterwards or</li>
<li> /&gt;i have bought this name brand in the past ,but this was not the same..</li>
<li> At first I was skeptical to buy this hair extension since no one has written a review on it.</li>
<li> Other than that it&#x27;s been holding up well.</li>
<li> i mean it had a lot it also had some red and pink strands.</li>
<li> , it been 2 months and a half that I been waiting for it</li>
<li> this hair typically lasts up to a year but all ii received was a months wear</li>
<li> I brought it from her and its like a pack and a half.</li>
<li> but the hair is also dull not very silky or shiny.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is heat-able though.</li>
<li> but that is because the wave pattern ... It doesn&#x27;t mat , tangle or shed like a lot of the hair I used in the past... I will be buying again</li>
<li> Horrible, The hair looked used and  came in a cheap box</li>
<li> It is not good quality hair.</li>
<li> It does tangle a little bit but shedding isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
<li> sorry Sassy Mitchell</li>
<li> will i order this hair again probably not unless i was desperate.</li>
<li> Poor quality hair came in a horrible packaging and with some glue on parts of the weft as if the hair has been used already</li>

    <li> This hair was ok but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It wasn&#x27;t enough hair in the bags to get the fullness I wanted and the curls didn&#x27;t last but a week. I braided it every night but that didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> My first impression was how light the color was. Other than that it&#x27;s been holding up well. The curls fell and when wet it doesn&#x27;t revert. It does tangle a little bit but shedding isn&#x27;t too bad. For the price, it was a good deal and shopping came in about 6 days</li>
    <li> Horrible, The hair looked used and  came in a cheap box and I want my money back</li>
    <li> This hair was good at the most for 3 days. When I bought the hair I thought it&#x27;ll look nice and feel nice but it on looked nice for 3 days. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this hair! Your better of at a local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I had this hair for a mmonth and it matted up .... ugh ! I hate that because it was great when I first put it in sooo I rate this at a 1 this hair typically lasts up to a year but all ii received was a months wear</li>
    <li> When I washed it the hair dye came out and it wouldn&#x27;t contain moisture. It constantly tangled. Do NOT buy this hair...</li>
    <li> i love it but please notify  me  when  you have 22in  when its become avaliable is good wow. i will recommand this heir to my friends i love amadon</li>
    <li> Poor quality hair came in a horrible packaging and with some glue on parts of the weft as if the hair has been used already</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical to buy this hair extension since no one has written a review on it.I took a risk and bought.The shipping was fast I received it within 4 days iam in california and it came from louisiana.This is 100% real human hair no doubt about it.I bought a 14 and 16 inches true to measurement too.I saw this hair at a local beauty supply which was going for $125 per 4 oz glad to find it here at amazon even though its not 4oz but 3.5oz you need to buy 2 packs for the whole head to be covered great product and you wont be disappointed.I dont normally write reviews even though I have been an amazon customer for a long time but for this I said to myself i will write one to help those who arent sure is this is a real product.</li>
    <li> The hair is really good. it is very manageable. soft i love it . just try it out you will love it to</li>
    <li> This was initially advertised as human hair and was definitely not human hair. Once I washed it, it became tangled, matted, dry, and lifeless. I would not repurchase this hair.</li>
    <li> I love it ! Better than expected actually ! At first I took a glane at the hair and THOUGHT that iwasnt satisfied because of the length . But if you really think about it , its curly so the length isn&#x27;t as it appears to be until worn or flattened . I purchased 2bags of 16\\&quot; and 18\\&quot; and I am VERY satisfied with the shipping service and the hair itself ! I love it ! And I&#x27;ve recommended several others to this site . You guys will be seeing my name more often . lol .&lt;br /&gt;signed , AMAZONS&#x27; SATISFIED CUSTOMER !</li>
    <li> Amazing hair!! I ordered 14\\&quot;&amp;16\\&quot;. I have it installed with 12\\&quot; sassy mitchell brazilian body wave. This hair is a better quality than the vendor hair!! I will be ordering again!!!! I cowashed colored with professional creme pigment and low volume developer. I deep conditioned via microwave and plastic bag treatment., sealed the wefts all prior to my install. I am a professional stylist of 20 years and also teach cosmetology so I do have access to professional products; however extension hair must be treated differently, Drug store/supermarket products are a must for this hair.  I use suave, garnier, and organix coconut serum. I worn this hair wavy, wand curled,  and straight and the hair remains soft, manageable and tangle free. I love it...sorry Sassy Mitchell</li>
    <li> My friend had brought the hair and she didn&#x27;t want it it wasn&#x27;t something she wanted. I brought it from her and its like a pack and a half. It seems less then that it actually feels like a whole pack opposed to a pack and a half. But the hair feels beautiful its so healthy and full silky and smooth. A 16 looks like a 14 actually. But its good over all I Give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> this hair is horrible it was good when i 1st got it but after a few days it started to get very tangled and matted i wont recommend this hair</li>
    <li> I order the hair and it came in earlier. I loved everything about it. It doesn&#x27;t shred it&#x27;s smooth and has a nice silky tone to it. It has a great quality to it.It&#x27;s really worth buying!!!!:-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person to order my hair only because I&#x27;m very impatient, but the hair came very fast. It was delivered way before it&#x27;s deadline so that was one thing I was very pleased with. Secondly, I tested my hair as well. My tracks were a nice size, I ran my fingers through the bundle and I only had three strands come out. The only problem I had with the hair is that I wish it was a little bit neater, but that was only from the shipping. I would make another purchase in the future with this company since it is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Very cheap became nappy very quickly will never order hair from amazon again because I am a perfectionist when it comes to hair and this was very below low quality.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for refund!!! Ordered  16 inches the hair look 12 inches way too short for the wavy look. You are better off going to a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> this hair is okay for the price. it took about two weeks to get here i ordered two bunches of 16\\&quot; and it was full of grey hairs i mean it had a lot it also had some red and pink strands. it doesn&#x27;t shed a lot but it sheds.i have not washed it yet and i had it in for about two weeks now it curls really nice with flexi rods. but the hair is also dull not very silky or shiny. will i order this hair again probably not unless i was desperate. i prefer remy saga for my money</li>
    <li> about it for a friend no commit</li>
    <li> The quality is great but it seems more to be 14 inches than 16inches .... service was  good and i would recommend persons to purchase but it really was short for 16 inches.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received my stuff and I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t recieved it I been waiting for it, it been 2 months and a half that I been waiting for it</li>
    <li> I purchased the 16 inch... It appeared to be short but that is because the wave pattern ... It doesn&#x27;t mat , tangle or shed like a lot of the hair I used in the past... I will be buying again</li>
    <li> The hair came early but it was old as hell. I mean like soo old that when I took the band that holds together the hair I had to get I comb just to loosen it my hand couldn&#x27;t even get through it. Then it said it could be bleached so I bleached it and left it on for 25 mins no change! I did the same thing to my friends hair nd it changed with in 15 mins. Then I washed it and the dye came out in the shower and it wasn&#x27;t even the the bundle I dyed. It hasn&#x27;t even been a three weeks nd I&#x27;m taking it out. I got what I paid for</li>
    <li> Waste of money. I only give it a 2 star bcuz the shipping was fast. It is not good quality hair. I have not installed it. I went to a hair store and bought real virgin brazilian hair For just about da same price</li>
    <li> Hair looks and feel nice ,however I ordered two packs of 16\\&quot; inches and instead got two 18\\&quot; inches also I ordered Indian hair and they sent Brazillian! I haven&#x27;t installed it so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up. Also the hair look it has been processed.</li>
    <li> It was horrible, the hair that came to me was all used up. I don&#x27;t think I trust to order anything else from them</li>
    <li> the hair was not as described it was mixed with synthetic ...shame on them!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have bought this name brand in the past ,but this was not the same..</li>
    <li> The hair is great jus not true to length more like a 14 bt still satisfied so far. I would recommend people to purchase this hair</li>
    <li> I bought the hair and it looked beautiful and showed up quickly but after my install last week it started to tangle after 4 days and after a wash the waves no longer revert. I am so sad because the hair was so beautiful upon arrival but I can&#x27;t give this product a good review with my conscience. It feels as if synthetic was mixed in but I guess the price was way too good to be true.</li>
    <li> I placed the order on February 20th and received it on March 5th. I really love the weave. It just sheds all over the place! every time i wash or brush it, it sheds. It is pretty, though and blends very well. I recommend it to people looking to do a partial sew-in. If not 3 packs are probably needed. I&#x27;m not sure if it is heat-able though. Question to the seller</li>
    <li> I got this hair cause I wanted to try something new and yes I love the hair and I&#x27;m telling all my friends and family that wear weave</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this hair. When I got it the first thing I did was cut a piece off and flat iron it. It worked perfectly and did not strip the hair and it still felt smooth afterwards. I have gotten hair that says its human hair and when you flat iron it it feels stiff a little afterwards or the curl simply doesnt curl the way I expected. I also got it earlier than expected. Just in time enough for my wedding.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this hair because of the reviews, it does not hold it&#x27;s wave pattern, I just purchased it 2 days ago and the waves are already gone. I have worn extension for over 10 years and this doesh not seem to be quality hair.  I will provide another update after I wash it but for right now it is just ok,</li>
    <li> This hair has  a lot of dead and short ends! I ordered 16in and the hair was not 16in, it&#x27;s more 14in&#x27;! I sealed my wefts since I&#x27;ve read the review, so I haven&#x27;t gotten any shedding but like all hair, it&#x27;s gonna break a lil&#x27;. The hair does tangle often. I never wear the hair straight because of the ends they&#x27;re fuller at the top and has always been thinner at the bottom, it&#x27;s looks horrible. I&#x27;ve had Virgin hair before And this is not it! I wouldn&#x27;t purchase the hair, because you probably will never get the length you want.</li>
