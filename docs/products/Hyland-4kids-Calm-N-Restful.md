<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This really works! Our pediatrician recommended this (it was recommended to him by the clinic&#x27;s child psychiatrist). We use it for our 16 year old (it has directions for ages 12 and over) who has Aspergers and high anxiety. I have tried it myself, too. The nice thing is there are no side effects. One dose doesn&#x27;t do much, but follow the directions...it says to repeat every 15 minutes for up to 8 doses until relief, then every 4 hours. Today my son was worried and it took 5 doses but it calmed him down. Homeopathy is different- not sure how it works, but it needs to be repeated to make it work.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!! My son has sleep walking issues (3yrs old). These help him sleep well and less restlessness that causes the getting up.</li>
    <li> Our vet suggested this for separation anxiety in a foster dog and also car sickness in a second foster dog.  I order four or five at a time and keep it on hand always.  This is the greatest thing ever when dealing with a traumatized rescue dog newly in our care.  My cousin tells me it works great for kids too.  She keeps it on hand for her 2-legged human kids.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working as it should and way too expensive</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these pellets do much for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works for my 2-year old.  I&#x27;ve trusted Hyland&#x27;s products since my boy&#x27;s infancy.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Hyland&#x27;s products and feel like they&#x27;re successful. This one was the exception. I&#x27;ve tried it, several times now, for my 2 boys (aged 8 and 10) and it seems to have absolutely zero affect on them. There didn&#x27;t seem to be any ill effects, but no benefit, either.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my 10 year old and myself and we were both within 10 minutes having the most severe symptoms of Aconitum poisoning. This stuff is toxic. Look up the first ingredient Aconitum Napellus, Monkshood--a deadly plant. We both had tingling in our extremities followed by the loss of sensation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting. My son fell asleep all covered in sweat. Next day we were both groggy, disoriented and my son missed two days of school. I called FDA about our reaction and they told me that it is not FDA regulated. The same very company made teething tablets with Belladonna, another deadly herb and number of babies got sick and some died in 2011 and then FDA made Hyland&#x27;s recall them. Stay away from this toxic concoction!!</li>
    <li> I know some people have success with this but we did not. It just wasn&#x27;t right for us.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old takes this at bed time. It helps her feel tired and relaxed. She still fights with OCD thoughts, but this supplements does help her to become sleepy.</li>
    <li> Works well for our 4-year old.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money! Does not work at all!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is OK. I use it in conjunction with melatonin and it works wonders. Alone it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> This product really works well for my kids. It&#x27;s something that I will continue to buy until they are simply too old for it. Just a few tablets even  help to calm down my seventeen year old boy who is as tall as his father and weighs just a little bit more than him. I would highly recommend this to anyone with children who need  little something natural to help them drift off to sleep at night. I rarely have to use more than one dose per child and it&#x27;s never every night, it&#x27;s an occasional thing. I&#x27;ve used this product for at least six years now and have no complaints what so ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been giving my kids Hyland&#x27;s Calms for Kids since they were babies. It&#x27;s wonderful stuff. I take the adult version when I can&#x27;t fall asleep. It gently relaxes them and unwinds their minds without any dragginess in the morning or other side effects.</li>
    <li> Found out after ordering this product that my grandson was supposed to pop 3 pills every 15 minutes up to I forget how many pills.  Too complicated and time consuming to use.</li>
    <li> Great, great great.:) This really helps my child get to bed quicker and calmly.:)</li>
    <li> My kids like the way they disolve easily and the taste. I think it works great.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference for our dynamo.</li>
    <li> My daughter gives these to my grandson when he&#x27;s having a hard time falling asleep.&lt;br /&gt;They really help to calm him down, so he can fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t use them everyday, just when he needs them</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for either one of my kids (5 year old boy and 4 year old girl). I followed the instructions and gave two every 15 minutes for 8 doses and nothing. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These work great most of the time to help get my 20 month old to settle down and go to sleep. She seems to fall asleep faster when I give her these before bedtime.</li>
    <li> Good price for the package.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for our 3 year old even though we upped the dose twice.</li>
    <li> Love these. Totally help my son relax into sleep and help my daughter calm down at night. If your child is restless at night these could help. They do the opposite for my grandaughter, she will stay up for hours even if I give them to her. Routine is key.</li>
    <li> This works amazingly for the nights that my kids just don&#x27;t want to settle down</li>
