      <li>The taste and smell is easy to get used to.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;ve got a dental hygeinist living in your house, this stuff will clean your teeth better than anything else.</li>

      <li>I okay not bad</li>
      <li>the black froth that fills your mouth is perfect for scaring grandchildren with...</li>
      <li>She died of a rare disease contracted in her travels but she always pride herself of her healthy gums and teeth; she never had to wear dentures.  </li>
      <li>When my sister noticed how much better my teeth looked, she stopped making fun of me started to use this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are smooth, shiny and whiter.</li>
      <li>My last check up came up great;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this product when I&#x27;m going out or in a hurry as it takes a fair bit of rinsing or time to clear.  </li>
      <li>First of all, shipping was SO quick, so that was really nice.  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest reading into all the ingredients that have gone into this product for your own.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s trave friendly and makes me look like a zombie when I brush my teeth.</li>
      <li>teeth feel really clean....</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s funky but most effective and am on the second helping -</li>
      <li>It does seem to get my teeth really clean, though.</li>
      <li>The powder does clean and polish the teeth well.  </li>
      <li>You didn&#x27;t know your mouth and teeth could feel this clean: clean aroma, clean taste, clean feeling.</li>
      <li>, its makes your mouth feel clean.</li>
      <li>I only wish it were more popular among the non-Asian drugstores.</li>
      <li>You are on the right track!</li>
      <li>, i don&#x27;t want to use the commercial brands with all the garbage in them, but is isn&#x27;t good either.</li>
      <li>, I have no idea whether it really cleaned the teeth better then Colgate.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it full strength.  </li>
      <li>Oooh, it&#x27;s been a couple good years since I switched to using tooth powders (Eco-Dent Daily Care Tooth Powder, Mint)</li>
      <li>More than what is readily stated this is truly a multifunctional product.   </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t really think there were many benefits in using it.  </li>
      <li>The taste is not bad, just takes getting used to.</li>
      <li>It leaves your mouth fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>wow wow guys , that is great to know that people are trying this tooth powder out here in the west.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly, I used it about 20 minutes ago and my teeth look whiter.</li>
      <li>This product is from India, from way back when products from India were considered sophisticated and exotic.  </li>
      <li>The smell of the powder is quite strong, but natural and easy to tolerate.  </li>
      <li>Not super bright dazzling white, but after just one application, I can tell the difference.</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s my new favorite tooth powder.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very poisonous!!</li>
      <li>Worth a shot for those who can find the charcoal paste, I guess you could make a paste outta this.</li>
      <li>Clearly my gums love the herb extracts, the medicinal oils in this product but my teeth can&#x27;t take the abrasiveness of the charcoal.</li>
      <li>and I began to search for it in health food stores and the like without success.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After using this tooth powder for some time, I&#x27;ve noticed very positive changes.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are always clean and are definitely protected from staining; my gums are also the most healthiest they have ever been.  </li>
      <li>My gums did feel good, as the other reviewer said.</li>
      <li>this clears it right up.  </li>
      <li>She was right, in those days there was no internet or Amazon to order it and have it delivered to your door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For him, it&#x27;s our new bathroom air freshener because the scent is that strong.</li>
      <li>and my whole mouth feels dentist clean.</li>
      <li>Not seeing much on the \\&quot;teeth whitening\\&quot; claims for charcoal, though it does clean well.  </li>
      <li>nothing else leaves my teeth as clean feeling, though I have to say, I follow it up with my own mouthwash to get the sharp scent out of my mouth.  </li>
      <li>the people complaining about the mess- this product will teach you how to brush your teeth without splattering on the sink and mirror- a good talent to have anyway.  </li>
      <li>Monkey Brand black toothpowder is an excellent product, inexpensive and efficacious.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found this stuff in a crazy Indian grocery store, which are always fun as most of the writing on the packages is in Hindi so you can&#x27;t really tell what a lot of the stuff is, just that it looks and smells interesting. And then you come across really super awesome stuff sometimes, like MONKEY BRAND TOOTHPOWDER. I had to have it for the package, basically. Now I&#x27;ve tried it on my teeth, but am not totally in love with the way that, as some have observed, the fine black powder goes *EVERYWHERE*. Really. And it looks pretty horrible while you are using it. And it makes your toothbrush black for awhile. So mostly I use my ayurvedic toothpaste for everyday. But the monkey is definitely living in my medicine cabbie and will have a home there for quite a while, just because he&#x27;s cool and a monkey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for things that are good for my body.  This tooth powder seemed promising, and I&#x27;ve already have had some experience using Uncle Harry products.  The taste is not overwhelming at all (in fact I could barely taste anything), and it didn&#x27;t leave my mouth and teeth black like some people might assume, plus the powder was easy to clean off of my sink.  The smell of the powder is quite strong, but natural and easy to tolerate.  My teeth were clean and my mouth felt fresh after using Monkey Brand.  I look forward to the future results of this tooth powder...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this tooth powder for some time, I&#x27;ve noticed very positive changes.  My teeth are always clean and are definitely protected from staining; my gums are also the most healthiest they have ever been.  They are pink and firm.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this tooth powder and am happy that I can get so much for the price!  I will definitely buy this in the future when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why I did not come across Monkey Brand much earlier, but this is better than any natural and unnatural tooth product I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly suggest reading into all the ingredients that have gone into this product for your own. The healing properties of each ingredient is immense,but combined together they are not only a preventative for various aliments of the mouth, but a cure. More than what is readily stated this is truly a multifunctional product.   The only issue for some might be the black powder that might not be the norm since modern toothpastes were invented, but that is what makes this powder so incredibly effective. Traditional methods are still the very best, and should not be forgotten about. Toothpastes in the past always served two functions, as healers (for the gums, infections,lesions,soars) and also as cleaners.  What we normally see in pretty packaged foamy creamy pastes today in thousands of colors only serves to clean (but only to prevent by cleaning).</li>
    <li> Back during the  previous 2 Years of the White Horse, I found myself in Hawaii wandering thru the markets. I saw Monkey Brand Toothpower and couldn&#x27;t resist the charcoal concept &amp; the scent. I bought it, and its ability to really clean my teeth to pearly white has not let me down. I only wish it were more popular among the non-Asian drugstores. My grandchildren enjoyed the novelty at first, but appreciated the cleaning it gave their furry little teeth.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Tired of poisonous fluoride and artificial sweeteners? It&#x27;s about time!  Want delightfully healthy gums? Good! You are on the right track! This product could certainly help keep you out of the dentist&#x27;s chair. I report to you that with just one use, I was hooked. The black is different, but very simple to clean up.... I will even say easier than gloppy commercial toothpaste.  The taste is mild and leaves you with a gentle, long lasting taste of cedar. Makes you feel like you&#x27;re in on a great secret!  Yes!!  It whitens amazingly and gives a cleaner feel than even a coronal polish from the dentist. How would I know? I&#x27;m a dental assistant! The ingredients in this product are superb for healthy gums .I&#x27;m a new lifetime customer now. Avoid all fluoride please ... it&#x27;s very poisonous!! Go with the Monkey .... zillions of customers since 1911 can&#x27;t all be wrong!</li>
    <li> Tastes so bad.  Leaves weird residue in my mouth.  Reminds me of brushing my teeth with a menthol flavored fire pit.  It is messy and altogether unpleasant.  I give it two stars because it does work. It should be that terrible of an experience. I truly dread using it.</li>
    <li> It works. I used Monkey Brand black toothpowder alternating it with regular toothpaste for years. At some point in time I started trying Crest whte strips and other tooth whiteners and in spite of their high cost and exalted claims, I saw little increase of stain removal. After several years of spending big $ on costly whiteners, I have gone back to Monkey brand black tooth powder and my teeth are much less stained than they were when I rigorously used the new commercial whiteners.  Yes, Monkey Brand black tooth powder leaves a dusting of black powder in the sink, but it is easily rinsed away with water and a sponge. I personally like the taste better than the nasty sugared toothpastes or weird peroxide taste of whitening strips which irritate the gums.  Monkey Brand black toothpowder is an excellent product, inexpensive and efficacious. I look for it in asian food stores where it is usually very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I bought this three months ago mainly to whiten my teeth.  I had to get used to the taste and how it made me feel like I was in a horror movie whenever I brushed, plus my sister made a lot of fun of me for getting this.  But after brushing with it, my teeth looked GREAT - they were much whiter and shinier.  When my sister noticed how much better my teeth looked, she stopped making fun of me started to use this stuff.  I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t whiten my teeth as much as it did in the beginning but perhaps my teeth are as white as this is going to make them. :)  Since I&#x27;ve become used to all the cons of this product, the only things that still bother me about this is how you have to brush for a lot longer to get rid of all the black (maybe that&#x27;s why my teeth are so much shinier) and how you get black gunk under your gums.</li>
    <li> If you look at the ingredients in most tooth paste they have glycerin in them. It takes some 27 rinses to get it off your teeth. This great powder has great ingredients and NO glycerin!  It leaves your mouth fresh and clean. And the fact that it is black is very disconcerting to others. Why are they watching you brush anyway?  Read the ingredients and look each one up and I think you&#x27;ll see why I like this product!  Don&#x27;t be so lazy go do it!  Stocky</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars, but it&#x27;s awkward dealing with powder. It does seem to get my teeth really clean, though. The taste and smell is easy to get used to. The powder in the mouth? Not so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months. At first I didn&#x27;t like it. It can be rather messy to use and I didn&#x27;t really think there were many benefits in using it.  I tried using it dry on my toothbrush. What a mess on me and in the bathroom.  So I stopped using it for a while I figured out a way to like it. Now I use the powder as a paste (powder/water). I use it in the shower. I have a separate toothbrush just for this product. I brush with the paste and then I swish around my teeth/gums and let it sit for about 5 mins. Mess is easily washed away and I can feel the powder doing it&#x27;s magic in my mouth.  Like others have said the smell is stronger than the taste. I don&#x27;t mind the taste, it&#x27;s pleasant but I don&#x27;t like the crunchy pebble like little pices of grit . The powder does clean and polish the teeth well.  As for whitening...yes perhaps some but not like bleaching. The charcoal is a good breath freshner.  I don&#x27;t use this product when I&#x27;m going out or in a hurry as it takes a fair bit of rinsing or time to clear.  But my main focus is strenghtening and healing my gums. I have found this powder helpful in this regard but I think it&#x27;s main benefit is with teeth cleaning then gum healing.  I prefer the quality of the VICCO Vajradanti powder for it&#x27;s gum healing and rejuvenation properties.</li>
    <li> You didn&#x27;t know your mouth and teeth could feel this clean: clean aroma, clean taste, clean feeling. Unless you&#x27;ve got a dental hygeinist living in your house, this stuff will clean your teeth better than anything else. Bonus: one bottle will last so long that you&#x27;ll probably only have to buy a new one about as often as you vote for President.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it full strength.  I still use my peppermint toothpaste, and have a little jar of this mixed with baking soda and DE (diatomaceaus earth).  I dab my brush in this mix and put a dab of paste on it - a great combination for me.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is powerful, so a little bit goes a long way. It can also be a bit messy, if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute little container.  Preppers should have this on the shelf.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist to help whiten my teeth. When I got it I was shocked, yucky black powder, messy toothbrush, black black black. Did it work... it sure did better than anything I have ever tried. I can certainly put up with the black toothbrush when the results are so much more than I ever expected. People are always commenting on how white my teeth are. My daughter remembers it from her childhood which at the time she did not want to use it. Now she is grown up and moved away she just asked me the other day to order her some. This is good stuff... I will buy it again and again and so will my daughter...</li>
    <li> If use charcoal already then u will like this the taste I okay not bad not great tastes like herbs. The benifit of this product out weigh the taste I really like it I will order more</li>
    <li> The best. I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding mMonkey Powder of late, I&#x27;m very pleased with the choice. Larger container too.</li>
    <li> yes, the blackness rinses out after brushing and the teeth are so amazingly clean that I simply will not be without this tooth powder - it&#x27;s funky but most effective and am on the second helping - I place a bit into a covered dish, wet the toothbrush and dip the tips of the bristles as a little is all that&#x27;s needed - thanks Amazon for carrying the product.</li>
    <li> Yeap. Definitely whitening (compared to my previous powder); definitely fresh and clean; definitely gotta expect that odd and very different flavor; definitely messy. Overall and despite the black mess and the funny flavor (which really wasn&#x27;t bad at all) I thought it was a good product. My gums did feel good, as the other reviewer said. That was the Monkey powder&#x27;s best attribute. Probably after just brushing three or four days my gums looked like I had been flossing faithfully for weeks. Yes, my gums were flat, not swollen and red, and they just looked healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then about a week later I started feeling that horrible pain from cold drinks. Oooh, it&#x27;s been a couple good years since I switched to using tooth powders (Eco-Dent Daily Care Tooth Powder, Mint) that I&#x27;ve been completely pain-free, no more sensitivity. Clearly my gums love the herb extracts, the medicinal oils in this product but my teeth can&#x27;t take the abrasiveness of the charcoal. It&#x27;s really too bad since I LOVE the fact that my teeth were not yellow any more, naturally - I thought, because that&#x27;s the only drawback of the Eco-Dent: yellowish teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So since this vendor does not allow a try-it-and-return-it-if-you-don&#x27;t-love-it guarantee (I tried) I might still try to swish it in my mouth with some water since my gums seem to really benefit from those oils, or maybe rub it gently on my gums with my finger. But I already went back to my Eco-Dent and after only a few days my teeth have gone back to not being sensitive to cold drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well. I&#x27;ve been looking at buying something to polish the headlights on my car back from a dull existence. Maybe I&#x27;ll give the Monkey a try...</li>
    <li> wow wow guys , that is great to know that people are trying this tooth powder out here in the west. This was my first tooth powder since I was  born and started cleaning my tooth . It did tasted good thats all I remember , I have no idea whether it really cleaned the teeth better then Colgate. I will order now and try to relive my child hood brushing the teeth with this product. Let see how it goes.</li>
    <li> First of all, shipping was SO quick, so that was really nice.  Second, it is a huge amount of product for the price - it will probably last me for a few years!  I tried it last night and although it did seem really weird to be brushing my teeth with black powder, my teeth felt really clean and I didn&#x27;t mind the flavor at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this powder to brush my teeth for about 5 months now. I use a very soft brush also sold here on Amazon ([[ASIN:B004CDA3VW B004CDA3VW]] I must say that I really think this Toothpowder is wonderful. My teeth have never been whiter or my gums pinker. It has an agreeable taste and each bottle lasts a long time if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t waste it. Everything in the bottle is healthy. Using it with a hard tooth brush wouldn&#x27;t be such a good idea, Use it with a soft brush!</li>
    <li> Well, as everyone has pointed out....its messy. OK, we got the down side of this product covered. Used once and my teeth are noticeably whiter......no kidding. Not super bright dazzling white, but after just one application, I can tell the difference. I like the taste, its makes your mouth feel clean. The fact that it has no chemicals in it is a big plus. I will update this review after I use the product for about 2 months to see if my initial impressions are justified. Delivered quickly, I used it about 20 minutes ago and my teeth look whiter. I am hoping multiple applications will really whiten my teeth up.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to when switching from paste to powder.  It is a bit messy  (Charcoal powder will leave a bit of a mess) .  Flavor is different but not bad. Key point it does not have the bad chemicals that some tooth pastes have.</li>
    <li> Great great stuff, use to brush and to dip floss into, it will get hard tartar off as good as the dentist for sure!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s strong ingredients may throw some folks back a bit, but I tried it.  Not seeing much on the \\&quot;teeth whitening\\&quot; claims for charcoal, though it does clean well.  Hard to use everyday, gotta rinse well. Worth a shot for those who can find the charcoal paste, I guess you could make a paste outta this.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a lot of Ayurvedic remedies lately so bought this on a whim from the Indian store when I was there buying henna. I already use natural toothpaste because I&#x27;m trying to stay away from fluoride, sls, gluten, etc but had never used a toothpowder before.  I was so shocked at how much I like this product!  It made my teeth super white, soothed my tender inflamed gums (gingivitis) and my teeth are as smooth and polished as when I get back from the dentist.  After using for 3 months I went for my dental checkup and the dentist says I can cut down from 4 cleanings per year to 2!  So it is healing my gums. I don&#x27;t use this every day anymore but alternate about every 2 days now with my regular Desert Essence toothpaste.  For those who don&#x27;t know how to use it, wet your toothbrush, then tap it on top of the dry powder to coat the surface of the toothbrush.  You don&#x27;t need much and it is pretty scary but it makes you rinse well, which is good.  Not sure how my Western dentist would feel about me using this product, but I&#x27;m not planning to tell!</li>
    <li> GOOD WORK I NEED MORE SUPPLIES.</li>
    <li> Very good and healthy product. Your teeth do get whiter in a healthier way. There are no harsh chemicles in the product.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE. Taste like chimney, feel like porcelain. WOW! Purifies the mouth and whitens with natural ingredients for long-term gum health! Dont be a fool, BLACK SOOT RULES!!!</li>
    <li> However while your brushing with it it makes you look like your brushing your teeth with black ink.  Great way to scare your loved ones in the morning.</li>
    <li> Taste is hard to manage</li>
    <li> This stuff will make a mess out of you bathroom sink (it has wood charcoal in it), but your teeth will be cleaner, and your mouth fresher than with any other toothcare product... and it has no nasty sweeteners!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to decant...I use formerly full tooth-powder bottles of other brands...and then fill them with this...&lt;br /&gt;The charcoal does make your teeth as startling white as an Indian&#x27;s...the black froth that fills your mouth is perfect for scaring grandchildren with...it is messy, but so clean &amp; tonic. Stay tuned to my other dentrifice reviews, i have just ordered several eclectic pastes.&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s the truth.</li>
    <li> This product really cleans well and leaves you with great smelling breath. The black color does stain your brush but no big deal</li>
    <li> The plastic red bottle looks a little scary with the worn black type.  Looks and smells more like something I&#x27;d see at a car service station.  But, it really whitens my teeth!  And seems to clean my teeth well too!  This has gotten my teeth the whitest.  It also feels safe, non-abrasive, on my teeth.  Hopefully, the ingredients are pure and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to cure a cavity and receding gum lines, which I&#x27;ve read you can do.  So, I&#x27;ve bought about a dozen natural tooth products.  Per Dr. Weston A. Price, I also bought grass-fed organic butter oil,  fermented cod liver oil and other nutrients to remineralize and strengthen my teeth.  I&#x27;ll know at my next dental appointment in a few weeks if my cavity is cured.  It&#x27;s very helpful reading the reviews.  I never knew that glycerin in toothpaste was harmful before, in that it coats the teeth, so they can&#x27;t remineralize as well.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews and when I first tried the powder by itself, it was a bit overwhelming - the texture, the smell, the experience in general (the black coloring doesn&#x27;t bother me because I don&#x27;t brush my teeth in front of a mirror).  I poured some of the powder into a condiment dish which I keep next to my toothbrush.  When I brush, I use my regular toothpaste then I turn the brush upside down and dip it into the powder.  I feel like I&#x27;m getting the benefit of both worlds - I still get the texture of suds I&#x27;m used to (yeah I know about all of the chemicals) and have the added benefit of the toothpowder.  I can definitely tell a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth.  The charcoal is a natural odor neutralizer so if you eat or drink something particularly stinky (garlic, alcohol) this clears it right up.  It will last a long time as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot about this product and finally decided to give it a try a few months ago. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another toothpaste if I can help it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted to the taste. It is strong and herbal in a way I love. My teeth look amazing after using it and there&#x27;s no annoying SLS or other weird chemical nonsense in it. Plus it&#x27;s trave friendly and makes me look like a zombie when I brush my teeth. I did pick up a Japanese toothbrush with black bristles to use with it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am not giving it five stars is the mess it leaves in the sink - seriously I have to wipe down the entire sink every time.</li>
    <li> This product works so well and is nowhere near as harsh as regular toothpaste. Sure, it&#x27;s black, but it leaves your teeth whiter than any toothpaste! The taste is mild but pleasant. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It may well be good for your teeth and gums but I can&#x27;t deal with black all over my sink and in my gums every day.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me that her sister uses this product to help whiten her teeth (she says it works) and that she&#x27;s a smoker. I&#x27;m an ex-smoker and have sensitive gums, I use Sendodyne cause it&#x27;s the only toothpaste that helps with the sensitivity. If I miss a day they start to hurt. So getting my teeth whitened will probably be painful for me, so I thought I would try this. It was very pungent when I opened the package but that&#x27;s the eucalyptis in the product.  The first time I tried it out, it was extremely messy but it did leave my teeth squeaky clean and my mouth feeling fresh. I used the toothpowder exclusively for a week before my gums started to hurt. I was very impressed, no other toothpaste except for Sensodyne has been able to do keep the sensitivity at bay. So now I brush with my regular toothpaste in the morning, which is easier and less involved and messy for getting ready to go to work. And the toothpowder before I go to bed, I have already recommended this product to two people I know who are both smokers. The taste is not bad, just takes getting used to. The texture really takes some getting used to, since it&#x27;s a powder instead of a wet paste the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t slide as easily past your lips while you brush like with a regular foamy toothpaste. And make sure you have water in your mouth to help spread the powder around, if it&#x27;s too dry it takes longer. I haven&#x27;t seen any significant whitening, but I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long and I did smoke for 10 years. I don&#x27;t expect miracles,  I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to regular toothpaste and whitening, just make sure that if you&#x27;re going to use this product in the morning that you have the time to clean up. Very Messy!!!  LOL!!</li>
    <li> Smells worse than it tastes. No taste at all really, just gotta get past smell. It looks scary but it did whiten after one use. My husband will be my guinea pig since he chews tobacco, I thought if this works on him, it will be a proven product in my book. This bottle will last forever as you only have to use a little bit. I will be reordering more!!</li>
    <li> I always like to try crazy things and this is one of the craziest! First of all this stuff is like talcom powder but BLACK so it goes EVERYWHERE!!!! When you use it your mouth, teeth and tongue are BLACK (my tongue for hours) and it seems to splash all over everything unlike white toothpaste for reasons I don&#x27;t understand. AND the SMELL! This stuff smells different than anything we ever smelled and it carries all through the house and my daughter cannot stand it. The thrill of using it wore off long ago!</li>
    <li> Wow, this really is the best tooth powder. I got instant results the first time I brushed with it and my whole mouth feels dentist clean. It really whitens teeth.</li>
    <li> This product is from India, from way back when products from India were considered sophisticated and exotic.  My grandmother, wife of a diplomat posted in India for years, gave away some of her belongings in favor of bringing back about 10 boxes of this powder.  She was worried that she would go without.  She was right, in those days there was no internet or Amazon to order it and have it delivered to your door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bottle of the Monkey tooth powder lasts for years, my grandmother past away while she still had a few bottles left.  She died of a rare disease contracted in her travels but she always pride herself of her healthy gums and teeth; she never had to wear dentures.  After her death, we divided amongst my siblings the Monkey powder leftover boxes and I kept mine intact as a reminder of my grandmother.  With time, the strong smell characteristic of the real Monkey powder was gone and the red box started to show signs of discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in my years when my dentist let me know my gums were bleeding and I needed to focus on getting them healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;I did remember my grandmother&#x27;s prise for the Monkey tooth powder and I began to search for it in health food stores and the like without success.  Not wanting to wait any longer to put some action to get my gums healthy and doubting the efficacy of the Monkey powder sample left over from my grandmother I began to brush with it nevertheless.  I was cautious at first, but if it was going to do some wrong I would be able to spit it out.  Well, nothing went wrong and after a few weeks if it was not doing any good, it was not doing anything wrong either.  I continued looking for the product every way I could while brushing daily with my grandmother&#x27;s sample.  I realized that a little goes a long way, and that a bottle lasts for a few years even with daily brushing.  To my surprise, my gums seemed to be getting healthier and bleeding less.  Observing the improvement renewed my interest infinding a new bottle of Monkey tooth powder.  I don&#x27;t know what prevented me from checking on Amazon for so long, but one quick browsing and . . .  success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do not recommend using this product after eon&#x27;s years of having it around, I do recommend this product to keep your gums and teeth clean and healthy.  My last check up came up great; no more gum disease!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s the annoyance of the black powder left on the sink after brushing.  I simply take one of those disposable wipes and get it clean.  And, now like my grandmother, I cannot go without.</li>
    <li> Woohoo! I am loving this tooth powder. I have previously purchased clay based tooth powder and enjoyed it. My teeth were always left feeling smooth but the price for such powder was really high. I did some Amazon searches and stumbled upon this little gem. There is a LOT of powder here, I would say it could last one person a year or so. It is BLACK and that was a bit off putting but it has a very medicinal smell/taste to it that I personally enjoyed. I encouraged my hubby to try it and he did NOT like it but I love it. For him, it&#x27;s our new bathroom air freshener because the scent is that strong. For me, it&#x27;s my new favorite tooth powder. I use it to brush then I rinse my mouth out really well. Then I brush again with just a wet toothbrush and it takes away any black/gray particles left over. My teeth are smooth, shiny and whiter. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it...teeth feel really clean....plan on changing your toothbrush quicker.</li>
    <li> Feels like you just left the dentist...  I haven&#x27;t been able to do that with regular toothpaste.  Although I&#x27;m not sure whether or not it&#x27;s destroying my tooth enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is much stronger than the taste.  I could smell it from outside the mailbox! But the powder works great, and you get used to it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people complaining about the mess- this product will teach you how to brush your teeth without splattering on the sink and mirror- a good talent to have anyway.  And if you&#x27;re having problems with it being a powder, try getting your toothbrush wet and dipping the bristles in.  I thought that was common sense but maybe it&#x27;s a helpful tip.</li>
    <li> The product is fine, works like it should, but I still feel like I should beable to brush my teeth with something healthy without gagging because it tastes so bad.  It isn&#x27;t so bad that i&#x27;ve given up using it, i don&#x27;t want to use the commercial brands with all the garbage in them, but is isn&#x27;t good either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the cleanest my mouth has ever felt.&lt;br /&gt;A container will last you for years. Years.&lt;br /&gt;The gritty texture and strong taste take some getting used to and I would understand those whose palates and gums were overwhelmed or over sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;There is always the challenge of cleanup unless you are brushing in the shower, but that&#x27;s exactly what I do.</li>
    <li> Tastes disgusting.  Would not mind taste is it met expectations but it does not.  Leaves crunchy black charcoal in teeth all day too</li>
    <li> I added a bit of cinnamon and clove and bentonite clay to mine and keep a small amount in a tiny Rubbermaid container in my bathroom. nothing else leaves my teeth as clean feeling, though I have to say, I follow it up with my own mouthwash to get the sharp scent out of my mouth.  I don&#x27;t think the scent of breath it&#x27;d create on its own would be all that pleasurable for anybody.  price was awesome and a little goes a long way!  my husband and son didn&#x27;t like it at all.  be careful where you point yourself while brushing (maybe it&#x27;s just me) but I end up with little black dots sprayed in whatever direction I&#x27;m facing, so I stand facing the tub. also, if you&#x27;re a rough brusher, you&#x27;ll have to watch yourself with this sort of thing as you could end up with abrasions on your gums!</li>
