<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this perfume was a favorite of mine I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The only avon perfume I wear.  Everyone loves it on me.  Best price.  Easiest way to buy, will keep coming back.</li>
    <li> Been wearing Far Away since I was a teen. Has a light sensual smell. Jasmine, freesia,tuberose and a hint of peach I think. Still to this day I get more compliments wearing this fragrance than any other. Men seem to love this stuff.</li>
    <li> my favorite if you like a light sweet fragance try it.</li>
    <li> Love this purfume  fast shipping  thanks</li>
    <li> I love Far Away I use it now for many Years and for the first Time I found it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This is a very old fragrance. When I was younger I remembered smelling it on my mom &amp; it was calming &amp; soothing. I purchased 1 for her &amp; myself &amp; I wear it on special occasions. People even comment about how good it smells</li>
    <li> It never disappoints, you got to love it. I will definitely order again. I just got my order today and cant wait to wear it tomorrow.</li>
    <li> The perfume came at the expected time and while the perfume box was a little crushed on one corner the perfume bottle was in excellent condition.  I have had no problems and am satisfied with my purchase.  This was a blind buy for me and I am glad I took the risk.  Good price.</li>
    <li> This is on sale in the Avon book for $9.99 most of the time.  It is a wonderful fragrance, but should not be sold on amazon.  Avon does not allow this.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think it smells great at all as soome reviews mentioned. It wears off quickly, other Avon perfumes smell way better. Is it expired or something?</li>
    <li> good smelling perfume</li>
    <li> I received it quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I remember.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, or if the perfume is old and turning.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my sis as she&#x27;s in love with its smell but me, not so keen. She says she receives heaps of compliments when wearing this perfume but only when bought from Avon. I guess its due to its originality and the change in colour because the one i bought from Amazon is always pinkish in colour but the one from Avon is slightly orangish golden. Plus the fragrance lasts longer when bought from Avon!!!</li>
    <li> Great shipping time !!!!! I love this perfume</li>
    <li> This is a very sensual smelling perfume and can definitely be worn on an everyday basis. Never smelled this perfume prior to buying, but after reading the reviews for the perfume through amazon, I ordered it on a whim. Very good for the price and a very beautiful perfume.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I do love the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s smell lasts for a long time and most of people ask me what your perfume is.</li>
    <li> I always love this perfume ever since I was a kid when my ma &amp; grandma would order it out of Avon! Love the smell!</li>
    <li> My daughter gave this perfume to me as a gift more than 10 years ago.......I have not purchased another fragrance since!  This fragrance makes me feel dressed up and special, even in jeans-----lasts all day (and night). Truly gets noticed--- and lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I got it earlier than I expected</li>
    <li> i love this perfume!!</li>
    <li> love it, love it, love it, i have been looking for this perfume.</li>
    <li> The best scent!!!!! Gets better as u wear it because it softens. A nice warm scent soft and not overpowering. Very sensual not strong or floral. Closer to a musk vanilla amber fragrance. Strong scents give me a headache this is nice n soft yet noticeable</li>
    <li> The perfume smell amazing.</li>
    <li> I looooove it. Planning on getting it for my mother inlaw. #perfect</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance but not long lasting. At most 4hrs.</li>

This makes an ok side gift, as long as you have something else to give with it.</li>
