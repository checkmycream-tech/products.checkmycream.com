      <li>Why did I wander away from this fine product, offered since 1845?</li>
      <li>I love using witch hazel as an exfoliant and often buy fresh aloe leaf to use for moisture.</li>
      <li>I love these, I use them on backpacking trips for a quick evening clean up.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, shipped fast and is super easy carry around.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t realize that the original formula has alcohol in it unlike the scented Thayer versions.</li>
      <li>I usually use witch hazel in the liquid form, but found these as a perfect alternative.</li>
      <li>They leave me refreshed and clean before I crawl into my sleeping bag for the night.</li>
      <li>I also find it hard to find those perfect textured pads for exfoliation</li>

      <li>They left my skin tone looking better than it has in years.</li>
      <li>Witch hazel was the first cash-generating export from Virginia to London markets (followed by sassafras, then by tobacco).</li>
      <li>I went on and off several times to make sure it was the product.  </li>
      <li>This is such a refreshing astringent.</li>
      <li>It was first manufactured in Lynn Massachusetts</li>
      <li>Love the pads, helps to have the ease of these in order to have a daily and nightly regimen.</li>
      <li>This way is for the rich and people who are busy and in a hurry on the go sorta speak.</li>
      <li>great product, pads a little smaller than expect.</li>
      <li>The alcohol, while less than other commercial witch hazels, still doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my skin as the rose version.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
      <li>This stuff really works, cleared up my face.</li>
      <li>Not only is it blemish free but it is extremely soft,</li>
      <li>Pore reduction and smoother skin is the main result.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft!</li>
      <li>Plain witch hazel is fine.</li>
      <li>The aloe vera also leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>He has eczema and sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stop the breakouts completely, but it did reduce the amount of acne and the size.</li>
      <li>so I wanted something that was all natural and would not irritate his face.  </li>
      <li>I like the convenience and no waste of the product.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I gifted two jars to a senior friend in Michigan this past week who raved about it when she used mine while visited a few months ago.</li>

    <li> great product, pads a little smaller than expect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing! I use it in the morning for a quick wash. I like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s organic so I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable using it. And I like see the dirt from my face the cleaning pad ^^ heehee</li>
    <li> Love the cooling pads. Came quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as great as everyone says. I&#x27;d rather use the liquid bottle. This way is for the rich and people who are busy and in a hurry on the go sorta speak.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I use it on my face several times a day.  It has made a total difference in my skin.  Not only is it blemish free but it is extremely soft,</li>
    <li> Why did I wander away from this fine product, offered since 1845? Witch hazel was the first cash-generating export from Virginia to London markets (followed by sassafras, then by tobacco). There are a lot of superstitions about it. It was in every Southern medicine cabinet before air conditioning, to soothe insect bites and skin irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pads are handy. And this is the Best. Product. Ever for cleaning a tablet screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops, almost forgot to note: Not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for traveling! I usually use witch hazel in the liquid form, but found these as a perfect alternative. They came in handy after a treacherous hike on Kauai. Great for cleaning skin abrasions and soothing on mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Great witch hazel, love the pads. They are soaked which is great. Used for postpartum healing.</li>
    <li> Pore reduction and smoother skin is the main result. It didn&#x27;t stop the breakouts completely, but it did reduce the amount of acne and the size. Smells nice, shipped fast and is super easy carry around.</li>
    <li> handy and no search for elusive cotton balls-</li>

    <li> I like the convenience and no waste of the product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the witch hazel-aloe vera pads, but I wish it was double the count (120 rather than 60).</li>
    <li> This broke my skin out.  I went on and off several times to make sure it was the product.  Yes, it was the astringent pads that caused the break outs. Plain witch hazel is fine.</li>
    <li> Gentle, works good and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> My son is 10 and starting to get tiny pimples on his forehead.  He has eczema and sensitive skin so I wanted something that was all natural and would not irritate his face.  These work great!</li>
    <li> This is such a refreshing astringent. My skin is looking better. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product - great service</li>
    <li> I gifted two jars to a senior friend in Michigan this past week who raved about it when she used mine while visited a few months ago. She phoned recently to ask me where I got them, saying her skin felt so much better, smoother. It was fun to surprise her..</li>
    <li> This is an &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; astringent used for hemarhoids that actually works. It was first manufactured in Lynn Massachusetts</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful and the service was excellent!</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin and keeping acne at bay. Best make up remover for sensitive skin. I noticed that my pores are smaller .</li>
    <li> Works well for travel, although pricy. When I finished the pads, I just put more of my own in, and added some more Thayers Witch Hazel on top, to save money and be eco-friendly with out wasting the container.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft!</li>
    <li> This was a total disappointment...it was missing all the pads.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Do that job just tiny pads for the price :/</li>
    <li> Works good.  Got rid of my acne.</li>
    <li> Love this product, can feel changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of being able to travel with these. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell so I just took some of the formula out and put in the Thayer Witch Hazel in Peach, and now they smell great and make my skin feel and look even better.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, cleared up my face. I was shocked, sometimes it&#x27;s the simple ingredients that work.</li>
    <li> I use these pads as a toner and they work great! The texture of the pads scrubs any remaining dirt, oil and makeup off my skin. The aloe vera also leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Perfect- super moist and fresh</li>
    <li> Great product.  Pads are very handy.</li>
    <li> I love these pads. they aren&#x27;t to harsh and make your skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;Try it. it&#x27;s the only pads I will use.</li>
    <li> I have been using the rose Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel for years and love how it is probably the best anti-wrinkle product I&#x27;ve ever used. I recently bought these pads since I will be going on vacation in a month and wanted something I can take on the plane. However, I didn&#x27;t realize that the original formula has alcohol in it unlike the scented Thayer versions. My bad. The alcohol, while less than other commercial witch hazels, still doesn&#x27;t feel as good on my skin as the rose version. I will use it but will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love using witch hazel as an exfoliant and often buy fresh aloe leaf to use for moisture. I love that this includes aloe as well. I also find it hard to find those perfect textured pads for exfoliation so it&#x27;s perfect they use pads that exfoliate bit aren&#x27;t too soft and aren&#x27;t too rough either. They left my skin tone looking better than it has in years. I noticed a difference the very next day. I&#x27;ll never go without these again. If you have dry, blemished skin these will work wonders.</li>
    <li> This is the best witch hazel that I have ever used and I love the fact that it is small thin pads that are soaked in the witch hazel so there is never any mess or waste.  I have been buying this product for years and will continue to do so.  It makes a great cleanser and toner for my face.</li>
    <li> Love the pads, helps to have the ease of these in order to have a daily and nightly regimen.</li>
    <li> Been using this somewhat obscure brand for a while, generous package quantity, does the job and is compact for storage and travel.</li>
    <li> Best thing you could ever put on your skin.</li>
