      <li>it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>While this will not measure up to Japanese standards (try it honestly)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have tried dozens of products over my lifetime, and a good 99% of the time they don&#x27;t do what they say they will.  I had little to no hope for this product, but the reviews were good so I went for it.  It.  Really.  Works.  If you are like me and wait too long between haircuts, this can help you go even longer.  My hair looks smoother and shinier and I would recommend this to anyone.  Do it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have stopped using conditioner in my hair and use this instead.  I have been dying my hair for 26 years, which can really dry it out, but with the Pantene, my hair is really soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Nehhhh its ok,not great for me</li>
    <li> This works great to soften dry ends for your hair.  Easy to use and you only need 1 or 2 pumps depending on thickness of your hair.  I&#x27;m so happy I was able to find this on Amazon after they stopped selling in it stores.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it, she is in love with this!</li>
    <li> African American gal here with natural (straightened) hair who has hair that is extremely prone to split ends and dies a little inside every time her hair dresser picks up scissors to trim them. I was looking for something to help my ends keep their act together that was also something I could leave-in my hair and not have to wash out and then I came across this.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, my ends have tamed quite a bit~! I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised because they were on the verge of splitting, lol.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and it made my hair even softer, love it~!</li>
    <li> It works, its not very heavy and smells lovely. Love how it makes my ends look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out, after multiple color changes and extensions which have damaged it pretty badly. My hair was frizzy and hard to manage with all of the damage. Enter Pro-V Keratin Repair. First of all, it smells delicious. I love the smell! Not overpowering, but a nice, pleasant scent. One pump in damp hair makes my hair soft and smooth all day. Love, love, love.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff worth every cent!!!!</li>
    <li> Does the work of many silicone-type split-end treaters - it&#x27;s not going to &#x27;cure&#x27; anything but it&#x27;ll fix the problem of dry/split ends until your next trim. The smell is okay - doesn&#x27;t bother me much, and 1-2 pumps totally fixes my medium length ends.</li>
    <li> Ok I am a hair junkie. I have dyed my hair since I was 11 yrs old and I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s now. That being said I know an array of products for hair from American, to European and the Much superior Asian, specifically Japanese. While this will not measure up to Japanese standards (try it honestly) This works better than even some of the brands like Kerastase, Wella, Paul Mitchel etc. You can wear it after showering or on dry hair. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and didn&#x27;t expect a lot from it since I have fine hair and almost everything I tried didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair. But!!! This one really works! After the first use, I can already feel the difference. I use this hair serum along with the shampoo and conditioner. Love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> My ends are so much better now! I trimmed my ends yesterday and I li had to trim a quarter of the amount that I normally do. I can definitely say that this product is the reason for that. Purchased a back up, just so I have extra on hand. Lol</li>
    <li> Great product. I not only use it on my hair but I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well. I have noticed a difference in her hair after using it for a few months. Not only is it growing faster but looks healthier, too.</li>
    <li> Love how it helps my hair look &amp;feel!</li>
    <li> Do you want shiny and beautiful hair? I&#x27;ve tried everything out there. High to lower price points and this is the line that is the best ever.</li>
    <li> Great for repairing split ends, which in turn keeps my long hair from tangling during the day.</li>
    <li> This actually competes with higher end leave in conditioners in its efficacy.  It makes my hair feel smooth and shiny and one pump is all you need so it&#x27;s economical as well.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and tangle free!</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Advanced Keratin Repair Split End Fuser is the best leave-in treatment for anyone with fine hair.  I recommend working it into the very ends of your hair after shampooing.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  One or two small pumps works magic on my dry hair.  This winter has been extremely cold and the wind has been brutal and at the end of the day my hair looks dry and lifeless.  A  bedtime a  pump of the cream, rubbed  into my palms  and gently run through my hair  returns  life and manageability the next morning.  The only drawback is the waxy smell which disappears pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent, exactly as described</li>
    <li> I recently took my dark almost black hair to caramel (ombre is all the rave after all) and my ends were fried! After spending almost 3 years growing my hair out from a previously horrible attempt at ombre, I was scared I would have to cut off my ends. My hair, although gorgeous in color, no longer felt soft, it felt like straw. I searched the internet for hair-repair and came across this product. I figured, for the price, what the heck - why not just try it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway -- I used this recently and my hair does feel better! Now-- are my ends still split and totally damaged? Yes, can you ever really un-damage them after bleach? who knows....but I only used it once and it made a difference for me, and I look forward to using it again to see how it continues to work.</li>
    <li> this product also keeps hair looking more youthful!! Love it,  I won&#x27;t use anything else. Easy to use, detangles too!!!!</li>
    <li> this fuser for my ends its just perfect for my ends its works well,..to me was a not a special price at all,but I need it so I had to purchased it,hope the next time I wll get it at a better price.</li>
    <li> My hair gets a fair amount of heat applied to it between blow drying, flat ironing and curling irons... I alternate between putting this on in the evening and leaving it overnight before washing my hair the next morning and putting it in my hair before blow drying. I have very long thick hair and can get away with 2 pumps. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: What I do is split my hair in half and use one pump on one half and one on the other. I start at the ends and work it about halfway up. Don&#x27;t use too much (start with one pump) and don&#x27;t go all the way up your hair shaft--it will be too greasy.</li>
    <li> My friend liked the product.  She tried it the first chance she had. Friend has always used Pantene for dry  and split end hair.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!!!! i have tape-in extensions and this stuff helps keep my hair nice and soft and easy to comb thru!! LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> It really did not do the job for me.  Having medium length, natural curly &amp; living in Texas, wish I can find something that works well.</li>
    <li> Really helped my damaged hair to return back time. I am 66 but hair resembles the same hair I had at age 18 to 20, I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I get so fed up with products that don&#x27;t do what they say they do that it almost comes as a shock when one actually WORKS!  I have long hair and despite frequent trimming have problems with very dry ends and split ends as well.  I use argan oil and all kinds of other things that help for the short term but I still end up dry.  This stuff made my split ends/dryness smooth and straight - WOW... I don&#x27;t know if it would work this well for everyone but it did the trick for me and I plan to keep using it!  Hooray!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s reversing my split ends, but they don&#x27;t seem to be getting worse. Smells decent, I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  I have thick curly hair, and it makes my hair manageable and less frizz</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually fusing my split ends, but it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing my hair really well.  It keeps my ends from getting brittle.</li>
    <li> Works great and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve searched a long time for a hair product this good. Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is the best there is when it comes to super curly and dried hair. It is not sticky or heavy, or greasy, so my hair feels very natural and breezy.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and fine and I straighten it and dye it. I have split ends from hell!!! This made my hair super silky soft, crazy Shiney and just altogether beautiful and healthy looking. This won&#x27;t &amp;#34; fix &amp;#34; split ends but it hides them pretty well for between hair cuts and really makes hair soft and keep tangles away. Love it</li>
    <li> I was abusing my hair everyday with the blow dryer then flat iron and wanted something to repair and protect my ends as they were getting damaged. I tried this for a little while and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. my ends were continuing to get damaged and I did not notice any repair or mending of the split ends I already had. I wish it would&#x27;ve worked as well as it did for others, but it did not. I went the old fashioned route and got my ends trimmed and stopped using so much heat!</li>
    <li> My daughter has severe split ends, and I have noticed a difference in her hair since using the product.  Its much smoother and healthier looking.  I will definitely continue to use!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Works the best on damaged hair. Mine has been bleached for years</li>
    <li> Great price! Love this product and pleased I&#x27;m able to buy on Amazon in bulk and save money.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser said the ends of my hair look healthier.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time! This is my third bottle. It detangles and makes your hair look healthier and definitely more manageable! I put it on my wet hair, my hair salon expert says she puts it on her dry hair...either way, it is great! Love!</li>
    <li> I have been using this faithfully for about 6 months now. I put some on after shampooing, and a little each night before I go to bed. I have received so many compliments about &#x27;how shiny my hair is&#x27; since using this product.  I have rather frizzy hair, and this has made such a difference. Nice fragrance too.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased the sample pack; it came with a bottle of shampoo, conditioner and the repair cream for about $10.  I really thought this would be a waste of money. It&#x27;s Pantene right? Doesn&#x27;t exactly scream salon grade.  The 1st week my split ends were nearly gone and I noticed a DRAMATIC reduction in hair lose.  I once lost handfuls of hair in the shower but not anymore.  Buy this product you won&#x27;t be sorry, hands down the most effective product I&#x27;ve EVER used on my hair.</li>
    <li> Calms down the frizz and leaves the ends softer.</li>
    <li> I see a difference in my hair, it looks healthier. Also it smells nice.</li>
    <li> It really makes my damaged hair look healed.  However, it does not actually repair the damage.</li>
    <li> Best product for split ends and keeping the hair smooth.  Three pumps, do ends of hair first, then run through rest of hair, blow dry and style.  Love!</li>
    <li> I would give this stuff 10 stars if I could.... It&#x27;s amazing. Best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick but fine hair that I am trying to grow out, and it tangles and breaks somewhat easily. But not with this stuff! I use a small pump of this on my shoulder length hair ends, and not only does it not tangle when I blow dry, but it makes ends smooth and lovely. I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to be that great, but I am hooked! I will order again and again and again. (not greasy, either. I mean, maybe if you used too much, but not 1 pump on a full head of hair.) Get this, you will love it! Silky &amp; shiny hair awaits!</li>
    <li> After using this entire bottle I saw absolutely no difference in my hair, I think it actually made it drier. I would not buy this product again, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Really helps my hair!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair with split ends and my hair has a tendancy to be frizzy after perms.  This has worked very well where other products have not.  My hair is much less like straw and is shiny.</li>
    <li> I use this on my african amerian natural hair.  After I gbraid of twist, I smooth this on my braids/twists from midshaft down to the ends. I&#x27;m not sure I even have split ends, but I use it anyway. Can&#x27;t hurt. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find this in any store, so I buy it once in a while here on Amazon.  If I have it fine. If not, fine.  And oddly there is no keratin listed in the ingredient list.  Very strange.</li>
    <li> Great product, soft, smooth hair that retains it&#x27;s style - unless you use too much then it turns sticky, matted and yucky!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the one that is no longer available - the Pantene &amp;#34;Split End Repair&amp;#34; I used that I could find in any retail store.  I have thick, coarse, long grey hair and both mentioned smooth out fly-aways.  I use it on damp hair after washing and daily before combing with &amp;#34;Tan&#x27;s Peach Wood Comb&amp;#34; (which I love).</li>
    <li> The product&#x27;s pump is deficient. I only got to use it 3 times before it stopped working. I would think twice before buying this</li>
    <li> disappointed! it does nothing to my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. i have color treated curly hair that can look frizzy &amp; dry.  This is the only thing that makes my hair look like HAIR again.  can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year. Great product! It&#x27;s getting harder to find in stores.. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, smells amazing and works extremely well. Works best on damp hair but use just a little less if putting it on dry. Silky smooth locks expected.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this product for relaxing her frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s a salon like treatment from the comfort of your home.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and leaves my hair soft and shiny with no sticky or heavy residue.  I&#x27;m very impressed with Pantene products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product, I bought some while in the USA last year, and when I tried to replace it here in Australia, I discoverd I can&#x27;t buy it here. Many thanks for sending it.&lt;br /&gt;Regards Carol wright.</li>
    <li> I bought a Pantene &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; of shampoo, conditioner and the Split End Fuser at the store.  I loved each of the products and went to by each one individually in bigger containers.  I was able to find the shampoo and conditioner, but not the split end fuser like the one in the kit.  I found something that said it was the same thing, but instructions said to put on damp or wet hair.  The one in the kit was for dry hair which is why I liked it so much.  So, I found exactly what I wanted on Amazon.com.  Price and service was great!</li>
    <li> A great leave in conditioner for fine, thin, curly hair.  I apply this to my hair is almost dry to the ends mostly.  If I don&#x27;t want to blow out my hair I really appreciate how this lets my hair ends curly without the frizz.  It last all day, even when out in the dry blowing winds of PA.  After sleeping on it, if the next day it is starting to look frizzy, I just dampen the ends of hair and reapply for another great day of non-frizzy ends.  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair is a bonus as most leave in conditioners do.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works I have used it for 3 months and retain my length. Be patient and use it with a leave in treatment it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 8 months ago and have to say my hair has been transformed!  My hair has always been super fine and fly away. Not anymore! Whether I shampoo every other day or have to shampoo daily, this is what I use as an after shampoo, leave-in treatment.  My hair is fuller and feels so healthy.  I agree that a little (one pump) goes a long way.  Starting with the hair that is most subjected to sun, heat styling tools, etc., I gently work over ends and the rest of my hair but avoid the roots and scalp.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as good for me as it has for others. My hair is think &amp; frizzy. My ends feel better with the aussie brand leave in end protector.</li>
    <li> Love this Hair Product, I Can C the difference in my Hair, The First time I used it.!!!!!@wm</li>
    <li> Smoothes hair without weight or sticky feeling. Great product</li>
