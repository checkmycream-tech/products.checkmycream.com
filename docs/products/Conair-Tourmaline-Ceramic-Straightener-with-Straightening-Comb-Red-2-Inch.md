      <li>It is a good idea, but with my hair, it pulled.</li>
      <li>It did a good job</li>
      <li>I used this product and my hair looks good now.</li>
      <li>I had been using the maxiglide for years and loved it.  </li>
      <li>materials, workmanship and superior design.</li>
      <li>The straightner is good.</li>
      <li>They probably putting in the hair and doing it quick, HELLO?!!!</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the product purchased</li>
      <li>I would spend your money on another product as I&#x27;m learning many people have experienced this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and it worked pretty good, not the best straightening ever though.</li>
      <li>On a good note, I think it did a nice job when it worked.  </li>
      <li>The straightener&#x27;s cord is a wonderful length and the swivel proves itself handy as well.</li>
      <li>, I finish the style with a lil more serum and the results are amazing!</li>
      <li>I love this item!</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with how quick I was able to straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>Wet/Dry irons tend to be more damaging, so I never ironed full length of my hair damp; however, I did use it very successfully on damp bangs, when in a rush, and the rest of my hair was tied up.</li>
      <li>this straightener works very quickly and very very effectively.</li>
      <li>Let me say I own the Infiniti by Conair SS9 1</li>
      <li>It handles nice and has a some convenient buttons on the side for wet/dry settings, so you can adjust it to your needs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I took the iron out of the packaging, and it had some kind of sticky substance that I cannot wash off.</li>
      <li>I really liked this hair straightener.  </li>
      <li>This is perfect for moms that don&#x27;t have much time like me.</li>
      <li>It gives me a fresh beautiful look everytime.</li>
      <li>Very easy to unknowingly turn off when using.</li>
      <li>but now I love it even more!</li>
      <li>This Conair with detachable comb, which I found on sale at WalMart for under $20, is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I liked it for the most part when I got it, but today it broke.  </li>
      <li>But this gets caught on your hair easily, and when it does it hurts!</li>
      <li>While I still find this straightener great, I don&#x27;t find it quite as effective without the two rows of pins to really permeate my hair...</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER.  </li>
      <li>It works better than I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use some type of leave in conditioner or serum.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to return it if I can.</li>
      <li>you can straighten more hair at a time.</li>
      <li>I love that its 2 inches</li>
      <li>All I can say, I can do better at weekends when I have more time to deal with my hair and stuffs.</li>
      <li>Anyway, yes I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>so I could always know my hair would look fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>One more con is too bulky.</li>
      <li>, that may be why my hair is not \\&quot;pin straight\\&quot; but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to risk more burns by turning the heat up.</li>
      <li>, I love that aspect about it.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love the color, and when I hold it, the weight is like nothing.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I think it would work on most types of hair.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder lenght hair, maybe it would work better with longer hair.</li>
      <li>I just bought this at Target a couple of days ago on a whim, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I went the inexpensive route, because, nowadays, most everyone is using ceramic and/or tourmaline in their straighteners.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>What I love about this straightener is that it works almost as a brush, dryer and straightener in one.</li>
      <li>I would love to stock up on one more in case this one breaks</li>
      <li>I want one that doesn&#x27;t take so many passes.</li>
      <li>This gives me more options.</li>
      <li>but I will be sure to try it out and update my review.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best flat irons i have ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s pretty good for a $25 item (I got mine at Walmart for that price).  </li>
      <li>Does a much better job and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Worth it and love it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this item! I recommend this item for those who r on the run and need to hurry up and get your hair straightned wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I have also gone through three of these. I like them, and they are cheap so I kept buying the same one. Until today when the third died. It worked great yesterday, and then like the others try to heat it up this morning, and nothing. When it goes it goes, with no warning. Bought another model today. If used every day, they have all lasted me for a year, maybe a year and a half. But now I would rather spend the money on one that will last.</li>
    <li> I agree with the person unhappy because this product died without warning. I have had this has also happen to me three times. I loved the iron so much, though, I just bought replacements each time. BUT, take into consideration, this last one I had was used for an entire year (maybe a little more) -- every day for my daughter and 3 times a week or so for me.  I think that&#x27;s pretty good for a $25 item (I got mine at Walmart for that price).  I wish, wish, wish, I had mine now. It died right before I needed to go somewhere a few weeks ago, so I replaced it on the fly with what I thought was the same iron. It wasn&#x27;t. It was a newer Conair iron that is cheap and flimsy, made of plastic and with plates that don&#x27;t meet tightly. I will be re-purchasing THIS straightener right away!  It is of good quality, the plates meet tightly and are sturdy. The iron is a little heavier, but that actually makes it easier to straighten hair. I highly recommend it!  I may even buy 2 just so I have a backup...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife so she could get done sooner and without her upset. This heats up QUICK and and it really works well and my wife is very happy.</li>
    <li> I just bought this at Target a couple of days ago on a whim, and I love it.  It straightens out the stubborn flip at the tips of my just-shy-of-shoulder-length hair and the unruly curl at the front by my face.  The only warning I would give is, because of its wet/dry capabilities and the relative shortness of the handle, beware of how damp your hair is when you start ironing, the proximity of your hand to the plates, and the angle you hold it out.  I&#x27;ve given myself a couple of small steam burns.  Nothing lasting, but owie!    Still, a great product that works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I LOVVVVVVVE this straightener but I am now on my second one as the heating element keeps burning out :( I wrote to the Conair customer service folks and am waiting to hear back. Hopefully they will replace it!</li>
    <li> My sister has one that seems to work pretty well so I bought one and it didn&#x27;t even turn on. I figured it was a lemon and exchanged it for another one. That one turned on and heated up for about 10 seconds, then stopped and won&#x27;t heat up again. I&#x27;ve used a ton of different straighteners, dryers, curling irons, etc and I have NEVER had one that doesn&#x27;t even work once! COMPLETE WASTE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little more than 2 years now. And up until now, it was working fine. Now, the blinking light stays blinking, constantly trying to heat up, but not. I&#x27;m sad because I just missed the warranty. And I&#x27;m just writing a review now, because I was trying to find a fix for the thing.     I&#x27;ve starred it down to 2 stars because this isn&#x27;t that great of straightener in general.     Pro: When its working, it heats up pretty quickly. I usually need the highest setting, and this one was pretty decent.     Cons: Bulky size.   Part where you&#x27;re suppose to hold onto and place your fingers gets really hot and unbearable to hold on.   The same parts to hold on to is uncomfortable regardless of heat, the ridges start to wear your fingers out.   There is a weird guide in the middle of the straightener, to keep the two paddles aligned. But this gets caught on your hair easily, and when it does it hurts!</li>
    <li> I got this as a present last Christmas. My hair normally takes forever to wash, dry, and straighten; this can cut a little tiny bit of time out of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get my hair completely dry or completely straight. What I normally do is towel dry my hair or partially blow it dry before using this. I use it on the wet setting to get my hair more dry and then I put it on the straighten setting to finish drying and to straighten it. Its a long process and I have to go over each section several times to get it straight. Normally doing a really good job on my own hair and getting it completely straight takes about two hours. This thing takes about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this for my type of hair which is long, extremely thick and wavy/curly AA hair. I have to use it on the highest heat setting, I think it&#x27;s 30. I think it&#x27;d work on finer, thinner hair that doesn&#x27;t hold as much moisture. If I wash my hair and let it be, it&#x27;ll be damp three days later, it&#x27;s so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the red paint is coming off around the ceramic plates. I assume that it&#x27;s from the steam coming from my wet hair. Another reviewer mentioned getting burned by hot steam from her hair and I have to agree with that. I learned how to hold the thing so that it doesn&#x27;t happen but every now and again I&#x27;ll forget and get a steam burn for my carelessness. I think it&#x27;s just about the way you hold it, but learning that is not a fun experience.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used practically every make and model of flat iron, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and I&#x27;ve never really been satisfied with the results.  Until now! This Conair with detachable comb, which I found on sale at WalMart for under $20, is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The comb attachment is sheer genius.  It holds the hair in place as I iron and it smoothes the hair as it&#x27;s been straightened.  It also helps me achieve a bit of a curve on the end, which I prefer to the stick straight ends that most flat irons give.  For the money, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used...at any price.</li>
    <li> I really hated this product I don&#x27;t understand how it got so many good reviews. First of all, the hot steam kept escaping through this part near the handle and it burned my hand several times which really hurt, second of all, the results: bad. Straighter than it is naturally (my hair has a little wave to it) but not \\&quot;pin straight\\&quot; as the box promises. It looked like I had blow dried it straight without a diffuser, and I&#x27;m TERRIBLE at blow drying hair. My hair also feels more coarse. I only did half my head couldn&#x27;t stand doing the other half my experience was that bad. My hair was damp when I did this (and it&#x27;s still a bit damp), I have thick hair a little longer than shoulder-length. I had the setting on 10 because that&#x27;s what the instructions said for wet hair and also I&#x27;d read that straightening wet hair may damage it, that may be why my hair is not \\&quot;pin straight\\&quot; but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to risk more burns by turning the heat up. I guess this product worked for some people but not for me.</li>
    <li> -My story: My old straightener was stating to ask for a retirement, so I decided to give the Conair Straightener a try, after all, it looked pretty nice, durable and cool. But I don&#x27;t know if it is because I have very thick hair or what, but it took me almost an hour to straighten my hair (when normally I only would need about 30 minutes. By the way, my hair is about shoulder length) and in the end it felt dry and was frizzy, even though I used leave-in conditioner and anti-frizz serum. I was pretty disappointed with this straightener after the first use, but because I thought that maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it properly, I decided to give it some more tries.  So, I tried using different settings on the straightener, different hair products, used it on wet hair, on dry hair, etc., etc. but the results were exactly the same: dry and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;-My conclusion: I regret wasting my money on this product, to the point where I want to take a waste basket and slam dunk this straightener in it.&lt;br /&gt;-My recommendation: The best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had is the Remington Wet-to-Straight Flat Iron, so I&#x27;m not only recommending this to you, but also I&#x27;m planning on buying another one of those right after I throw away the Conair Straightener</li>
    <li> Horrible! I didn&#x27;t like at all....I had it for about two months and it died and didn&#x27;t straighten my hair. It just made t frizzyer.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over a year now and have not experienced any of the glitches or malfunctions that others have complained of.  The straightener itself is a bit bulky and weighty, and the hinge squeaks every time you close it.  It does a pretty good job on straightening my thick, wavy hair and it only takes me about 20 minutes on dry hair.  I have not used it on fully wet hair [just slightly damp], but I do not notice a difference in how the straightener performs.  For the price, it&#x27;s not bad at all and worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this flat iron as a less expensive replacement for my maxiglide.  I had been using the maxiglide for years and loved it.  I have long thick, curly and sometimes coarse hair.  What attracted me to this product was the straightening pins because it made me this of the pins on my maxiglide. Also, I have used other conair infiniti products and liked them.     After my first use of the product I was impressed, it did exactly what I needed, my hair was smooth and straight, also it did not take very long.  The second use was even better, I turned the heat up a little, my hair was slightly damp from being put in a pony tail right after washing.  My hair was smooth and straight and shinier than it has been in awhile. While my hair was a little damp I turned on the wet setting, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that gives me an indication of how well that works.    All in all great product for me and I think it would work on most types of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner while on vacation. The first time I used it I had a friend straighten my hair. I didn&#x27;t really notice until after the Second try when I tried to do my own hair that the straightening pins on the plates pull at your hair. It was a pain and I finally just gave up because it hurt so much. Other than that it would have been a wonderful straightner.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to get rid of my old metal straightener and go for the newer ceramic plates. This is a great choice. I have wavy hair and this makes my hair pin straight, even when my hair is wet. It handles nice and has a some convenient buttons on the side for wet/dry settings, so you can adjust it to your needs. A surprisingly nice product!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed getting this product because I&#x27;ve read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron.  I actually prefer the cheaper Conair&#x27;s ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one.  It doesn&#x27;t clamp down well on my hair (I&#x27;ve got thick frizzy hair).  The results for me aren&#x27;t that great, it straightens my hair a little but it&#x27;s still frizzy.  It&#x27;s lightweight which is nice.  I don&#x27;t care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair.  I definitely prefer other models over this one.</li>
    <li> As some previous reviews mentioned, you must move slowly on your hair inch to inch, it works quite well. But every morning I&#x27;m so rush to work, so the result is not completely perfect looking - the end of my hair is still little frizzy. All I can say, I can do better at weekends when I have more time to deal with my hair and stuffs. One more con is too bulky.</li>
    <li> I have the most unruly combination of wavy and straight hair. And, yes, I have that embarrassing crease near the crown of my head, too. I have tried every product under the sun, including flattening irons, water-heated steamers and curling irons, to give it that smooth straight softness you see in the magazines but nothing seemed to ever totally work. Before buying this straightener, I was using a combination of comb-brush-type dryers and thick curling irons to tame my thick head of hair. What a battle!    But, now my suffering is over. What I love about this straightener is that it works almost as a brush, dryer and straightener in one. The other reviewer commented that the pins hurt her head. I consider those pins to be a brush, besides; you almost have to have pins so the steam can penetrate all of the strands of hair. I can handle it and my head of hair is usually full of tangles. What I do is blow dry my hair until it&#x27;s almost completely dry, brush my hair really well, work the straightener through my hair, and BAM - perfectly straight smooth hair. My only complaint is that I wish I would have discovered this straightener a long time ago...    Update 1/15/08:  After accidentally breaking this one, I couldn&#x27;t wait to purchase another one. Upon opening my new Conair straightener, I was saddened to find they have remade the original design and have now removed the two sets of straightening pins. Darn! While I still find this straightener great, I don&#x27;t find it quite as effective without the two rows of pins to really permeate my hair...</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. My hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath. I used this product and my hair looks good now. It looks smooth and straight now and I can feel the softness when I touch my hair. I definitely will recommend this product to my friends......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight.  This past Christmas though I got the Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener as a gift and decided to try it out.  Not only did it not work for anything, it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass.  Also, it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be taking this back for an exchange. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good cheap straightener, I read some reviews on this and was super excited to get it. When i read the reviews many people said it had these pins on the side that help straighten the hair, mine however does not have any pins :( I don&#x27;t know if that would make a huge difference or not. The straightner is good. I does what it suppose to. But it does not elemenate frizz like other reviews i read. For the price, it is great!</li>
    <li> Well, my sister and I (this is my dad&#x27;s account, I am a girl) purchased this flat-iron for its wet/dry feature. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make that much of a difference as when done with the ordinary flat-iron, and my hair is still frizzy and definitely not straight. It does straighten it to some extent, but not as much as I would have liked. I bought this in July, and together we&#x27;d only used it twice when we noticed that the PAINT ON THE SIDE OF THE FLAT-IRON WAS PEELING OFF. It has thirty settings, and it was on twenty-five and burning the side of the thing off. Not a good sign. The cool tips at the top aren&#x27;t really cool, and it&#x27;s difficult to pull the iron through your hair without burning your fingers off. It&#x27;s also annoying trying to get it close to the scalp, because I&#x27;m afraid it will burn, but on a lower setting it doesn&#x27;t work at all. All in all I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for coarser, thicker hair, but my friend has very fine, just slightly curly hair and it seemed to straighten hers well. I also wish it would come with a heating pad, because I&#x27;m afraid to put it down on the wood floors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and it worked pretty good, not the best straightening ever though. It took about 40 minutes to get it perfectly straight, I have curly frizzy hair. About 2 months ago it started acting weird. After i use it for about 5 minutes it would turn itself off so i have to turn it back on and wait for it to heat every few minutes. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even turn on, I have to unplug it and wait like 10 minutes, then plug it back in and wait for it to heat. Oh, it also takes almost 5 minutes to heat up, unlike some newer irons.</li>
    <li> Initially I would have said I loved this straigtener. I bought one a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked on my thick, naturally curly, shoulder length hair. I never used it on the wet to dry setting, but would dry my hair first and use the straightener on the highest heat setting. I could straighten my hair in about 20 minutes. It always left it perfectly straight and smooth. The reason for only 3 stars is that they keep breaking. The first one lasted maybe two years and just quit working one day. The light would come on, but it would never warm up. I figured the heating element was just worn out from wear and tear, so I bought another one. That one lasted a year. I just replaced it four months ago, and already this one is dead. The light will come on, but it will not heat up. It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating when these things are around $40. I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another one. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I felt it was a little heavy and the pins pulled at my hair.  I have shoulder lenght hair, maybe it would work better with longer hair.</li>
    <li> I put the order on 9th and just got it today. I haven&#x27;t done a lot of online shopping, so I am not so sure whether this is fast or not.   I love the color, and when I hold it, the weight is like nothing. I have straight hair but thick and curling in the middle and the end due to the new hair cut. I used to use my roommate&#x27;s Revlon and it works fine, just a little bit heavy when holding it for a long time and the hair smells wierd when got wet after using it, like burned, and the hair gets dry and tough after straightening. Compared to the Revolon, with a even low temperature of 15 which the instruction suggests for my kind of hair, this one heats faster, styles faster, makes hair silker, and no wierd smell. with the Revlon one I have to turn it to be between medium and high to make it work well. this one does make some noise when using it though. i think it is because of the comb in the middle of the ceramic board.   anyhow, i just used it once, and haven&#x27;t tried the wet function yet. it works good for the experimental use so far.</li>
    <li> Let me say I own the Infiniti by Conair SS9 1 1/2\\&quot; Nano Silver Steam Straightener which works great however, I live in an area which requires 220 volts or a transformer to use my silver nano. After looking around and reading the reviews I purchased the Conair Tourmaline 2 inch because the reviews and description read similar to my nano silver. The product is indeed dual voltage however, in order to use it wet, the hair has to be wet. The temperature gage is awkward and it broke my daughter&#x27;s hair off. When I used the Nano silver there was no hair breakage. After an hour of trying to straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair I gave up and turned the product off. Now I am in the market for another dual voltage product similar to my SS9 Nano silver. I will be returning product back to Amazon for a refund. Also another website has the same product for $5 or more less than Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite hair product. It works the best, gets hot enough to straighten my thick hair, and the middle comb helps immensely (trust me, once you use a straightener with a built in comb, you cannot go back to using a straighener without combs).  I have had three so far, because they only last ONE YEAR.  FYI.  But they do come with a 2-year warranty I believe, so if I wasnt so lazy I could probably get one for free.    Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> this plate can be used with wet and dry hair, it is best to not damage the hair and leaves it shiny and silky!</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with this flat iron with the very first use. My old flat iron just sort of crushed my hair in a semi-straight look leaving lots of frizz behind. I have very thick course curly hair so it&#x27;s really hard to get my hair to whip into shape and be straight. With a little of [[ASIN:B004Y4HWWW Aussie Heat Protecting Shine Spray, 8.50 Ounce (Pack of 12)]], my hair is pin straight, shiny and softer for it. The pin comb inside keeps the iron from crushing my hair while combing and heating it at the same time. And a big bonus...No Frizz.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. &lt;br /&gt;My friends come over and don&#x27;t even bother bringing their own straighteners because mine works the best.  &lt;br /&gt;The straightening pins have been complained about, and look it doesn&#x27;t hurt I promise you. You have to be capable of doing your hair atleast a little bit otherwise it WILL hurt, but you&#x27;ll catch on, and just brush it out before you straighten if it does hurt. Must have.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly, but not difficult to straighten.  The wet setting button does not provide enough heat to dry and straighten my hair.  The dry set button does not provide enough heat either.  The pins don&#x27;t do much to help pull the hair straight. The result was frizzy, course, partly straight hair, it took a long time, and I got so hot during the process that I&#x27;m sure it frizzed my hair more.  Also, the vents are on the side, which made it easy to burn myself from the steam. Probably best for lightly wavy, thin caucasion type hair.  Everyone else, spend the extra money for the Maxi-Glide.  Does a much better job and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this flat iron. I have really long, thick, wavy Asian hair, and it worked really well straightening my hair. I usually kept it on like the 25 setting [they are out of 30] for my long hair, and like 10-15 for my short bangs. It usually took me about 20-25 minutes. It kept it shiny and straight for most of the day. I live in South FLA though, so the humidity still got to it, and eventually it would get a little frizzy. I rarely ever used the Wet-to-Dry part b/c I always hear about how it&#x27;s terribly unhealthy for your hair. But when I did use it on my slightly dampened hair, it worked well. I love that its 2 inches wide-- you can straighten more hair at a time. However, obviously it still doesn&#x27;t work AS WELL as if you only used a smaller amount at a time. The small little combs on the inside honestly did very little to comb my hair or keep it in place while straightening. I just used a regular brush. I used it every other day, and it never seemed to have any adverse effects on my hair. It also heats up very quickly and lets you know when it&#x27;s ready.    What I hated about this product is that it died after a little over a year of use-- it just stopped heating up. It did the same to a friend of mine too. My cheaper, lower-quality flat iron from W*l-m*rt has lasted me almost 4 years. Figure that one out..</li>
    <li> I have a thick long hair and always hoped that I could get a product like this that makes me look like I just came back from the beauty salon. I could not believe my eyes the first time I used it. It gives me a fresh beautiful look everytime. Convenient, fast and sturdy. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and wish I had it long ago. It is a GO!</li>
    <li> This was my first straightener.  It did damage my hair, there are places hairs can get caught and break. I later bought a Remington and it is such an improvement over the Conair!  My hair has never been this straight and I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakage.  I don&#x27;t recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a week or two ago.  I liked it for the most part when I got it, but today it broke.  I used it maybe 5 times total.  I did not drop it.  The product will not turn on at all.  I would spend your money on another product as I&#x27;m learning many people have experienced this.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this straight iron until one day it just stopped heating up.  It was on christmas in fact, and she got it from santa just the year before. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.  Good luck if you choose to risk it.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener a few weeks back, and I love it !!  I was a little scared after reading the previous reviews concerning the straightening pins and the problems that other people were having, but I think it is one of the best features.  It holds my hair in place so that I get pin straight hair everytime.  Please keep in mind that my hair is very soft and baby fine, so the pins are not a problem for me.  However, I can see that another person with thicker or wavier hair might have a problem.  If that is you, this iron is not for you!  I am afraid that the pins would get stuck in your hair and it would become very painful.  As for me, this is one of the best and easiest to use that I have come acrossed.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, really leaves my hair really straight without even blow drying!! I have curly hair and it worked pretty well, my hair was smooth and shiny, I&#x27;m very happy with my straightener.</li>
    <li> my daughter has very thick curly hair and gets her hair thinned to be able to straighten it. this straightener works very quickly and very very effectively. she hasn&#x27;t wanted to try to straighten her hair with the wet feature yet. not sure how well that works. it does get your hair pin straight especially if you use some sort of straightening creme with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the price was right and other reviewers said they liked the inner comb to help separate out strands of hair as it goes through the iron. I have to disagree. Even though I comb my hair prior to using it, my hair does not go through the iron smoothly because of the teeth inside the iron. Kind of annoying when I am in a hurry. I have thick hair so maybe that has something to do with it. However, I don&#x27;t straighten my hair every day so it was not worth returning. It basically does what it is supposed to do. Also please note that the outer portion of the iron gets very hot - be extra careful when handling.</li>
    <li> I have used hair dryers in combination with flat irons and curling irons for years, and hated how long it took, how my hair never got quite straight enough, and how hot I would get using the hair dryer. This device is a miracle worker! It works amazing, my hair is very wet when I use it, it takes a few passes and then I usually touch up on the dry setting just before leaving the house - but it&#x27;s truly a miracle worker. However, this morning, mine broke. And for the $40 I paid at the local drug store for a few months of using it, I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy another. It just wouldn&#x27;t work this morning, after doing 1/2 my hair. I was so upset, and had to wear a hat today! Anyway, so today I am trying a Remington digital type, to see if it&#x27;ll last longer. We&#x27;ll see, but I would still recommend this product, if it has lasted longer than a few months for others using it daily, maybe mine just had something wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Even though, this is clearly a device meant to get, hot, the plastic became gummy when hot and stayed gummy after the first heating.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and BEST RESULT EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is that the hair doens&#x27;t get all DRY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!!!</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron for mothers day, and my husband really surprise me with this present, I never thought he was going to pick something good. I always been wishing to buy the chi iron but it is too expensive. I thought it was nothing like that out there like chi , It does work excellent!. For those past comments, I think maybe they are not using it right. They probably putting in the hair and doing it quick, HELLO?!!! there is not miracles!!!!. you have do it slow!. This is perfect for moms that don&#x27;t have much time like me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this straightener for several years now and I absolutely love it. I can&#x27;t imagine getting my hair this straight and smooth with any other product (and I&#x27;ve tried tons, believe me). I love how many heat options there are with the dial and the fact that you can use it on damp hair, without scorching it or not giving it enough heat.     Be careful, though, because I just used it this morning and the power cord actually split right up by the swivel while it was plugged in. Huge sparks came out and for a second I thought it was going to catch fire. Now I have to order a new one, so just watch how much you wrap and unwrap the cord.</li>
    <li> I had to return this.  There was some sort of sticky coating all over the straightener.  Not very good quality either.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a really great straightener. I had one just like it for 5 yrs and never disappointed. I just didnt like the comb. They didn&#x27;t snag my hair or cause damage to it, but I found them annoying and pointless. The only reason i got sold mine, though, was because i have long hair down to my hips and had to run over it a few times before it straightened it completely and it got tiring (naturally lol). I want one that doesn&#x27;t take so many passes. $150 is overpriced though. My mom bought this for me on sale for $40 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> This product has all the same technology as the $200.00 Chi wet/dry straightner. I am very impressed with how quick I was able to straighten my hair. I have very cury &amp; wavy hair. Plus I live in a humid climate. My hair is soft and silky after using this product. I had no problems with frizz all day. Made my hair very straight. I recommend this product to any one thinking of spending $200 on a Chi. This product was only $33.00 and it is the same. Thanks Conair!!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener ever and I&#x27;ve used 3 others! you can go from wet to poker straight and shiny hair in exactly 10 minutes. I just divide my wet hair into 6 sections, rub some serum and iron on wet setting, once dry, I finish the style with a lil more serum and the results are amazing! My usually dry frizzy hair looks salon styled straight and the effect lasts upto the next hair wash!</li>
    <li> This straightener is one of the best ones out there in the market. It&#x27;s affordable and can be compared to other expensive irons such as the ones at the mall stalls [Corioliss] or ones you can find at folica.com. Make sure you use some type of leave in conditioner or serum. I recommend Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Serum or Garnier Fructis sleek &amp; Shine Leave in Conditioner. They really make my hair soft and smooth after I use the flat iron. Don&#x27;t waste your money on some expensive one when this one works just as good!</li>
    <li> This iron is just plain sticky. When it heats up its sticky. If any product gets near it, it&#x27;s sticky. I&#x27;d love to return it if I can.</li>
    <li> Although the product reaches adequate temperature for thick hair like mine, the problem is that something about the coating on the plates seems to grab up the hair instead of facilitating a smooth glide thru the plates. This increases time spent on each section thereby increasing heat damage to hair. I would use this only as a last resort and only if straight hair was required for the occasion; otherwise, i&#x27;d rather pin it up or anything other than trying to straighten it with this particular flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons i have ever purchased.  Great on thick hair.  Love it. I was skeptical at first (wasn&#x27;t sure if i wanted a built in comb), but glad that I got it.</li>
    <li> loved it ! great job ,I got it on time it worked the way I hoped it would, and the way it is put together it will last a long time</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER.  It works better than I thought it would.  I am an African American,  I do not have a perm on my hair, have not had one for years.  This straightener is different design from the one I used before.  I did not think this would straightener my hair, but it worked for me and my granddaughter.  She even sit still while I was doing her hair.  I bought something for her and benefited for myself.  That is definitely a win/win.  THANK YOU.  I was so excited I dropped the straightener.  Anyway, yes I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and this straightener could not handle it.  It seems like it would be fine ofr other types of hair but if you are black or just have hair that takes a lot of effort to straighten, I would not recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> I must say I have bought every flat iron out there and this is the only one that really gets my hair super straight with no frizz or fly aways! I was told that chi was the best and I was unhappy with it but this conair is cheap but yet does the job I&#x27;ve always wanted from a flat iron. My hair is thick and frizzy and course but after I&#x27;m done using this iron you would never know! And it holds the whole day! I wish I could stock pile this iron so I could always know my hair would look fabulous! Worth it and love it!</li>
    <li> excellent! 100% recommended. materials, workmanship and superior design. excellent value for profit. I am very satisfied with the product purchased</li>
    <li> I received this straightener for Christmas and was happy to finally be able to straighten my hair even when it was wet. I have wavy hair which I like to straighten, and face framing which needs to be curled in. As the box said it would, this straightener literally made my hair pin-straight. The ceramic plates are two inches wide so it is a great width for simply straightening hair, but not for trying to curl at all!&lt;br /&gt;  I found the Wet-Dry capability very helpful, but whenever I straighten my hair while wet, the hot steam scorches my fingers. When the straightener is warming up it smells really bad, but once you start straightening your hair the smell fades away. The way the handle is curved feels very natural and helps your grip, but I wish it had some sort of latch. That way it would stay closed when it is being stored, because now it takes up extra room and gets dust on the plates. The straightener&#x27;s cord is a wonderful length and the swivel proves itself handy as well. I was also excited to see if the built-in comb really worked, Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.&lt;br /&gt;  Although a few things could have been better, I would suggest this to anyone who just wants to straighten their hair (wet or dry). However, if you are thinking this iron is good for other things, you are wrong. I just got it,, so don&#x27;t know how long it will actually last, but it came with a two year warranty. Taking all this into consideration, I would still probably recommend this to other people.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best straighteners I have ever purchased. I have very course hair and it works the first time. Heats fast too!</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick, very curly hair that usually frizzes and gets really static whenever I straighten it, this is the ONLY straightener I&#x27;ve found (and I&#x27;ve had probably 8 to 10 different kinds) that actually gets my hair straight and it STAYS straight, and it usually doesn&#x27;t dry out and get frizzy, I love that aspect about it.  Unfortunately, it dies. It&#x27;s hard for me to find, only one retailer sells it where I live so I think I may start getting it offline, but I always paid 30 dollars for it, and it would die 6 months to a year after purchase. It&#x27;s really frustrating because it did it while I was in high school the morning of my picture day :O   But, I still would recommend it, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it because it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s come close to getting my hair to stay straight. I haven&#x27;t tried the wet/dry feature, just not interested in that part.</li>
    <li> When I bought this straightener I read the reviews on it.  Several people said that it pulled their hair.  As I have a pretty tough scalp I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have pretty wavy, thick hair.  It did a pretty good job of straightening, but it definitely pulls your hair.  There are little teeth that cover the straightening pad, these are designed to keep the hair from sliding out the side.  It is a good idea, but with my hair, it pulled.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace what I thought was an identical iron. I took the iron out of the packaging, and it had some kind of sticky substance that I cannot wash off. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old one, either. The teeth are not like they used to be, they tear the hair.</li>
    <li> Great straightener and a great value for the money. Excellent features: temp controls, comb feature, ergonomic handle, stylish color. Heats up quick.</li>
    <li> Very easy to unknowingly turn off when using. As with all Conair products I&#x27;ve ever used, it died after using it only a couple of times. It was cheap, but you get what you pay for. No more Conair products for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product specifically for the comb feature (the little teeth that help guide the hair as it moves through the iron).  Unfortunately the teeth are worthless to me.  I have an old Conair straightener that I love which has teeth at the edges of the iron and it works great!  I can&#x27;t find anything else out there on the market that does the same thing.  This doesn&#x27;t even come close, even with the teeth deployed fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this disappointment, it seems like a really nice straightening iron that would probably make most people perfectly happy if you&#x27;re not interested in a comb feature.  It seems to be well built, well designed.  The cord swivels at the point where it attaches to the device.  The on/off switch and temperature control seem like good features.  It has the other good things like ceramic/tourmaline/ions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could sell mine because it&#x27;s perfectly good and brand new; it just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.  I&#x27;ll keep using my old one until I find a replacement with a decent comb.</li>
    <li> its a good product for the price, have work since day 1 perfect, so yes! buy it!m the color its great and about size its 4x4</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Just be careful with the steam, as you could get burnt. It is wide and it makes the job easier.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and the price is great.  Came well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I have not opened the product. I got as a gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> This Freaking sucks!! it does not heat well at all and it leaves my hair puffy and not straight at all. I have really think curly hair and it did not work for me, I don&#x27;t recommend it. I thought it would actually work cause of all the 5 stars of ratings it had and people saying great stuff about it. Even my sister didn&#x27;t like it and she has thin some what straight hair and for her it takes longer to straighten. Maybe I got a defected one or who knows, but I personally don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had one previously &amp; it finally it &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; so because I couldn&#x27;t find one in a local store I went on line, found it and purchased it.</li>
    <li> My Conair Infinity straightener died so I went to Amazon to get another one.  It worked great.  Well, apparently I didn&#x27;t pay attention to what I was ordering and ordered one that LOOKED the same, but it was NOT.  It is a piece of trash.  My hair is naturally straight, so I&#x27;m not asking miracles from this thing, just smooth it out.  It is awful.  It doesn&#x27;t even glide down the hair...it jerks down and feels like it&#x27;s pulling my hair out the whole way down.  Terrible.  Too bad I threw away the packaging.  I wish there was an option for zero stars.  It does not deserve one.</li>
    <li> This was my fourth, and thus far, my favorite hair straightener, purchased in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;I have super-long hair (down to my waist), and my hair tends to frizz, so straightening it can be tough. With this Conair though, I was able to straighten it to sleek and smooth, in a reasonable amount of time. All irons can damage, and Wet/Dry irons tend to be more damaging, so I never ironed full length of my hair damp; however, I did use it very successfully on damp bangs, when in a rush, and the rest of my hair was tied up. I never noticed any damage, but I trim my bangs often.&lt;br /&gt;The auto shut-off feature saves me from having to go back home, when I&#x27;m heading to work and suddenly can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve turned off the iron.&lt;br /&gt;Other pros: It heats up quickly, has adjustable heat settings, indicates when it&#x27;s ready vs. in heating mode, it never once snagged my hair, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SAD:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a year. Yesterday, it died out of the blue - conveniently when I was trying to get ready for an event. I turned it on, and it just blinked as though it was in heating mode, but never got hot.&lt;br /&gt;I also have noticed some extra split ends. This is despite being very careful about heat protection and not straightening all of my hair every day (only the bangs). That&#x27;s to be expected with heat styling, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I was all set to buy another, but stores don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore. I turned to Amazon, and took a few minutes to read through other reviews... just out of curiosity. I&#x27;m thankful I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD:&lt;br /&gt;As many other reviewers have experienced and attested, the suddenly-stops-heating-up-after-about-a-year issue is typical of this iron. I&#x27;m adding my same experience to the list.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out some other Conair models, and they seem to die similarly.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing another Conair. I&#x27;m not keen on investing another $35-$40 to have it conk out (again) within a year.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews &amp; thought this would do the trick. My daughter does not like the results at all. It does not straighted her hair as it states. I wish I would have spent a little more $$ on a better one.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and it is already broken.  It won&#x27;t turn on and she used it maybe 5 times.  On a good note, I think it did a nice job when it worked.  It has a warranty but I have to send it in.</li>
    <li> Update:With prolonged use, I find the Conair flat iron to have lost its ability to deliver the results I saw shortly after purchasing it. That said, I&#x27;ve since switched back to using a higher-priced flat iron. I still use the Conair flat iron, but only for my bangs.      Works just as good as a high-priced flat iron if you go slow and do 2-3 inch sections at a time. I was using a ceramic flat iron by HAI, and I loved it. Yeah, it cost a pretty penny, but it lasted 5 years before finally biting the big one. I went the inexpensive route, because, nowadays, most everyone is using ceramic and/or tourmaline in their straighteners. Your high-priced flat iron has slightly better ceramic coating, which means you can achieve your look in less time (better heat disbursement)--a pro. The con, of course, is the price. This Conair flat iron can achieve the same result, as long as you move through the hair slowly and at a high heat (I used the highest heat setting on already-dried hair, despite the instructions claiming the setting is ideal for wet and/or coarse hair). Overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
    <li> It was too heavy and bulky to use.   It did a good job but it was hard to control.</li>
    <li> I really liked this hair straightener.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it if my hair was compltely wet, but my hair is thick, and takes forever to dry, so it really helps that I can start straightening when it&#x27;s still a bit damp.  The little teeth in the center seem to keep my hair in place while it straightens, and the fact that it&#x27;s wide means a lot of hair can go through at once.  It is the fastest, best straightener I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I had the same hair straightener for the last 12 yrs and didn&#x27;t want to part with it. After it stop working I finally purchased this. It was the best thing I could ever imagine. It used to take me 30 to 45min to straighten my hair. It took me 15min.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only flat iron that works on my hair to give it volume and fulliness with some curls. Love it but so sad that they don&#x27;t make this type of flat iron. I would love to stock up on one more in case this one breaks</li>
    <li> I had this one before and I think it was a little bit better, now it doesn&#x27;t have the tiny thing in the plates which use to hold your hair better, I&#x27;m even thinking on changing the plates from the old one to the new one, but I like the shape that allows you to give the hair the form you want and overall I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully, I get my hair done in much less time than with last iron I had.  Works best on dry hair, only problem I&#x27;ve had is that if my hair is not 100% dry, I burn my fingers with the steam.</li>
    <li> The pins that glide thru my hair seem to keep it from getting limp/flat like some flat irons I&#x27;ve tried before.  I like the way my hair looks when I use it.  Now, I can wear it straight or curly...  This gives me more options.</li>
    <li> I have 3 different ones and each one I got here this one is my every day one it does detangle&#x27;s and it does what it say it will on my hair I like it so much all of my sisters have one</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed to open this and see that it&#x27;s a different model than the one shown in the pictures! I have the same exact one as the pictures show and after being very satisfied with the product for about 6 years it decided to stop working. I was extremely happy to find the exact same thing online and couldn&#x27;t wait to order it. I haven&#x27;t yet tried this product on my hair but I will be sure to try it out and update my review. Hopefully, if it&#x27;s not satisfactory, my money will be refunded seeing as how it isn&#x27;t even what I paid for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the flat iron I received was TERRIBLE. I couldn&#x27;t even use it once, I tried it on one little section of my hair (which was thoroughly combed) and it would get stuck in my hair! Keep in mind the product I received was different from the one pictures above, if you can ever find the one in the picture, BUY IT. it&#x27;s a terrific flat iron, my hair is very long, wavy and thick and I could do ALL of it in a matter of 10 minutes if I was in a hurry. But do not order this from this seller, it is a different flat iron and it&#x27;s TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  It heats up quickly and very hot!  It does an awesome job on the straightening.  This is my second one - since I love it so much, I leave the other one packed for travel and know I have a backup.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace the identical one that I had from 10 years ago.  A couple of changes have been made to the design but now I love it even more!</li>
    <li> The comb on it isn&#x27;t like they used to make it.  It&#x27;s more like little spikes poking up in the flat part.  It just doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair like my old one.</li>
