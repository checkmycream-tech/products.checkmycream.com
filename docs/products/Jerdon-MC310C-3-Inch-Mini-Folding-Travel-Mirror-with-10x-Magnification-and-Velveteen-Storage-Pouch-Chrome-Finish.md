      <li>I thought it was a good size</li>
      <li>good purchase for travel</li>
      <li>It seems like good quality</li>
      <li>I got this mirror thinking that it would be the perfect size to set on that shelf and use it hands free.  </li>
      <li>but it is a good size for travel</li>
      <li>I should get 5 more (but I will wait for the price to drop!)</li>
      <li>I bought the 5&amp;#34; one before, and it&#x27;s a bit large but wonderful for makeup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with mine so far!</li>
      <li>While the mirror fit nicely (with room to spare)</li>
      <li>Everything is better up close.</li>
      <li>But for sure this is should be in you purse or make up bag</li>
      <li>It is nice and small, fits well in purse or perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>Very well made size good.</li>
      <li>Is not as strong of power as my countertop 10X magnifier.</li>
      <li>This defeats our purpose of using a hands free mirror.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something that would leave my hands free to do makeup.  </li>
      <li>I wish I had gotten the larger mirror, but this will do the job, and is great size for travel.</li>
      <li>Great quality, love the little bag it comes in.</li>
      <li>However, it is solid and well made, and good for travel.</li>
      <li>This 3&amp;#34; can accommodate one eye at a time and good for short trips or camping.</li>
      <li>(although a bit smaller than I&#x27;d thought) and does come with a nice velvet bag.  </li>
      <li>I love that there are 2 different views and the stand makes it easy to place on a window sill when plucking eyebrows which is what I mainly use it for.</li>
      <li>Great magnification, but too small.  </li>
      <li>This mirror is good for the touch ups or to focus on the eyes or any other parts of the face but not the whole face.</li>
      <li>I would like better magnification and a bigger size.</li>
      <li>This is very sturdy, unlike similar ones that I have seen and is a better size.</li>
      <li>the mirror is indeed a mini one, sooooo small, but the quality is good.</li>
      <li>The metal ring is all one piece and the stand is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>If you want something for every day, get something larger, with a light.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t very tall</li>
      <li>Not quite sure what I will do with this little mirror yet.</li>
      <li>A real help for us with old eyes when we try to put on make up.</li>
      <li>it is small (good for travel but probably not regular home use).</li>
      <li>If you were looking for a mirror to help you thread, clean, or just wear make up for the whole face, this is not for you because it will be really small.</li>
      <li>This one is okay, a little smaller than I realized.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good little mirror, but of course it&#x27;s quite small.</li>
      <li>Unlike other mirrors that fail to hold up the rigors of travel, this one holds up well, and while solidly constructed, does not spare the design aspects that make it look like the indulgence your should expect in such a beautiful tool.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought it was a bit bigger but helpful still.</li>
    <li> Waaaaaaay too small. I thought it was a good size but it&#x27;s too tiny to do anything with, you might as well use a compact.</li>
    <li> Very well made size good.Im very happy.Thanks</li>
    <li> Broken when received, but return was simple!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok. But it is too small to everyday use. It is just a little thing for travel.</li>
    <li> My mom has a mirror just like this but I don&#x27;t know where she got it. This is so great I love that there are 2 different views and the stand makes it easy to place on a window sill when plucking eyebrows which is what I mainly use it for. Great quality, love the little bag it comes in.</li>
    <li> Tiny little sucker but I use it every day.</li>
    <li> The perfect size for me that fits in my make up bag &amp; it is fold-able XD. If you were looking for a mirror to help you thread, clean, or just wear make up for the whole face, this is not for you because it will be really small. This mirror is good for the touch ups or to focus on the eyes or any other parts of the face but not the whole face. But for sure this is should be in you purse or make up bag</li>
    <li> It was to small, MY problem</li>
    <li> A little small, but serviceable for travel.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this in drug stores and other stores with no luck. This is very sturdy, unlike similar ones that I have seen and is a better size. I bought something like this before but it was not well made and the compressed metal ring that was holding it together came apart. The metal ring is all one piece and the stand is very sturdy. It is also 30% smaller, which I like because it doesn&#x27;t take up allot of space. I&#x27;m very happy with mine so far!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a smaller magnifying mirror.  This one is okay, a little smaller than I realized.  I would like better magnification and a bigger size.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for travel.  If you want something for every day, get something larger, with a light.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality --travel size mirror.  It is nice and small, fits well in purse or perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Great concept.  Just wish it could be in a 5 in form.  Traveled well on last two trips.</li>
    <li> This thing is perfect.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This well-constructed mirror is of the highest quality, and tucks easily into my travel gear to meet my needs perfectly when I am on the go.

    <li> good purchase for travel</li>
    <li> the mirror is indeed a mini one, sooooo small, but the quality is good.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. So do my sisters. I should get 5 more (but I will wait for the price to drop!)</li>
    <li> Perfect for home or travel, can be set up on the stand or hung from a hook for ease of use.</li>
    <li> Too small I put it in bin sorry</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the size my bad I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> This item was one of those &amp;#34;if it works great, if not &amp;#34;oh well&amp;#34;&amp;#34;. Well, it works perfectly and is just what my wife needed for her carry on for our trip.</li>
    <li> A real help for us with old eyes when we try to put on make up. Everything is better up close.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good little mirror, but of course it&#x27;s quite small. It&#x27;s difficult to find a place to put it at the correct height, especially with the correct light, so I usually have to hold it up with one hand.  It can be a bit difficult to put on makeup with it. However, it is solid and well made, and good for travel. Not a mirror I would use every day, it&#x27;s simply too small and inconvenient, but nice and small in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with my traveling mirror. It was much smaller then I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot to say about a mirror but it is a good size for travel (although a bit smaller than I&#x27;d thought) and does come with a nice velvet bag.  It seems like good quality and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it but just keep in mind it is small (good for travel but probably not regular home use).</li>
    <li> ...but it is bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Great magnification, but too small.  I wish I had gotten the larger mirror, but this will do the job, and is great size for travel.</li>
    <li> We like to cruise.  Over the sink in the bathroom of our stateroom is a metal shelf. Above that is a mirror.  I got this mirror thinking that it would be the perfect size to set on that shelf and use it hands free.  While the mirror fit nicely (with room to spare) it isn&#x27;t very tall and you either have to stoop to see into it, or hold it up to your face to use it.  This defeats our purpose of using a hands free mirror.  It is also small in diameter.  You get an up close look at your eye or nose, etc.  I was looking for something that would leave my hands free to do makeup.  This isn&#x27;t it.  I think I am going to get the 5.5&amp;#34; travel mirror with 7x magnification.  Not quite sure what I will do with this little mirror yet.</li>
    <li> like the size.  Got it to replace a 7x one.  Is not as strong of power as my countertop 10X magnifier.</li>
    <li> Bought this for travel. I bought the 5&amp;#34; one before, and it&#x27;s a bit large but wonderful for makeup. This 3&amp;#34; can accommodate one eye at a time and good for short trips or camping. If I&#x27;m staying in one place, though, I&#x27;m taking the larger one.</li>
