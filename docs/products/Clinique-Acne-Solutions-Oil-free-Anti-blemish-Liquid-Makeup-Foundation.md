### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I take very good care of my skin.</li>
      <li>and it does a great job covering it up.</li>
      <li>I stuck it out though, because it felt great to look at the cotton pad I had used to apply to toner and see all the impurities it was removing from my face.</li>
      <li>:) works great!</li>
      <li>:) i liked it so much,the best one really,for my oily skin its perfect :) i advice everyone to buy it</li>
      <li>The color is perfect and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Good for my acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>My skin looks flawless and matte, it feels so smooth</li>
      <li>am medium/dark skinned, and the color choices werent very appealing to me</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT and will re-purchase it over and over again!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Wishing you all happy, clean, clear, and beautiful skin!   </li>
      <li>I did not have many breakouts as a teenager.</li>
      <li>Mary Kay, Proactiv, Neutrogena, and many others.</li>
      <li>After just one use, my skin felt softer, cleaner, and more radiant.</li>
      <li>I am not extremely pale but the level 2 fresh alabaster looks perfect.</li>
      <li>Nothing has ever worked so quickly and effectively as the Clinique Acne Solutions system.</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t good coverage and it has a lack of colors, very upsetting,</li>
      <li>so it covers everything great without having to add extra concealer on the top.</li>
      <li>I did find a pretty good match with Fresh Neutral though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s oil free and it lasts well.</li>
      <li>but I had such a great experience with this that I felt compelled to write one.  </li>
      <li>Needs a light moisturizer underneath.</li>
      <li>It is good for all of the dirt and oil to come to the surface rather than staying in the skin which will only lead to more breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I was a loyal Super Fit foundation wearer and then Clinique stopped making it.  </li>
      <li>The cleanser isn&#x27;t really designed to remove make-up, but it does a great job at cleaning the bare face.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job of covering blemishes and red areas.</li>
      <li>Clinique should come out with a cream foundation that provides full coverage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had acne problems since my high school years, leaving some not so lovely reminders.</li>
      <li>I love this make-up, normally I have red/pink skin</li>
      <li>I surely hope this system works just as amazingly for anyone else who tries it as it has for me!   </li>
      <li>When I woke up this morning my mild acne had dried up and my skin looked great.  </li>
      <li>#4 fresh vanilla  </li>
      <li>So keep that in mind and stay positive!   </li>
      <li>Super Fit actually didn&#x27;t come in a color light enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is worth it to me to have clean, clear, acne-free skin!   </li>
      <li>First, I will say that before I tried the acne solutions system, I had tried everything.</li>
      <li>It is  what I wore when I lived in Hawaii and was very tan!</li>
      <li>this is not full coverage but does match my freckled, slightly pink skin tone perfectly.</li>
      <li>Honestly, for me, this product is reasonably priced compared to other acne systems.</li>
      <li>Following the directions and using the product as directed will hopefully lead to the same amazing results I have had with this system.   </li>
      <li>My daughter really likes all the Clinique makeup</li>
      <li>The coverage for Clinique Acne Solutions is buildable, so you can adjust it depending on how much you need.</li>
      <li>about a couple years ago, since I didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
      <li>My face breaks out less with this compared to Super Fit as well.</li>
      <li>seriously, I almost look airbrushed (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>arrived quickly, the same as what I buy in the store.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with acne.</li>
      <li>I tried several others in their line and found this one not only stays on in a similar fashion, but had a much better color match to my skin tone (Fresh Ivory).  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I actually left my house for the first timein months without putting any make-up on!</li>
      <li>Upon the first use, I was pleasantly surprised on how natural it looked.</li>
      <li>It normally takes about one month to see viable results from any product.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed if I missed even one day of taking it, I would get a new breakout.</li>
      <li>I have not had any new breakouts at all.</li>
      <li>I have mild acne and this foundation is so dry.</li>
      <li>The clarifying lotion, which is actually a toner, did sting when I first started applying it to my face.</li>
      <li>But WOW!</li>
      <li>Last, but certainly not least, if you notice MORE breakouts in the first few days, don&#x27;t get discouraged and definitely don&#x27;t stop using the system.</li>

      <li>After using the system for just ONE WEEK, my face is almost completely clear.</li>
      <li>My husband even complimented me on how clear my face is now.</li>
      <li>applies well with fingers or brush, does not cake - natural looking.</li>
      <li>The antibiotic was helpful, but it never cleared my face up completely.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use all three of the products together at least 2 times a day.</li>
      <li>In just three days, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have any new breakouts and my face was beginning to heal from the current breakouts.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really too dry and gets flaky.</li>
      <li>and it really made my skin dry.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have found that this Clinique product is the only one that works for me.</li>
      <li>Spreads smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>My 48 year old skin is confused....dry and oily at the same time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old and have occasional breakouts.</li>
      <li>I am a twenty-five year old female.</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because the acne clearing ingredient (salicylic acid) is just a bit drying for the less oily parts of my face (a light moisturizer underneath takes care of this), and the color selection wasn&#x27;t as wide for this line as it is for some of the other types of their foundations.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good for my acne prone skin. Needs a light moisturizer underneath. My winter go to product.</li>
    <li> Product and service as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to leave reviews on websites for the products I use, so it says a lot when I do leave one. I&#x27;ve had acne problems since my high school years, leaving some not so lovely reminders. This past Christmas, I received Clinique&#x27;s acne solutions liquid makeup as a gift from a family member. I&#x27;ve always been very skeptical about using foundation since most foundations come off looking cakey and fake. I almost didn&#x27;t even open the box, but figured I might as well give it a try. Upon the first use, I was pleasantly surprised on how natural it looked. I didn&#x27;t even need to blend it into the sides, like I had to using previous products. Not only did it look natural, but it made my scars a lot less noticeable. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over two weeks now and have noticed a dramatic change in redness and my acne has cleared up a lot with the help of the three step by clinique. I highly recommend this product to anyone with acne.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have found that this Clinique product is the only one that works for me. The color is perfect and it&#x27;s easy to apply. When my skin gets dry, I add a little moisturizer to the product and that takes care of the problem. This is THE product for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn several different types of Clinique foundations and this is one of my favorites. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and it seems I do have fewer blemishes when I&#x27;m wearing it. It&#x27;s oil free and it lasts well. The coverage for Clinique Acne Solutions is buildable, so you can adjust it depending on how much you need. It does a good job of covering blemishes and red areas. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because the acne clearing ingredient (salicylic acid) is just a bit drying for the less oily parts of my face (a light moisturizer underneath takes care of this), and the color selection wasn&#x27;t as wide for this line as it is for some of the other types of their foundations. I did find a pretty good match with Fresh Neutral though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually bother writing product reviews but I had such a great experience with this that I felt compelled to write one.  I put on this foundation last night to go out, and I fell asleep without washing it off.  When I woke up this morning my mild acne had dried up and my skin looked great.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, the same as what I buy in the store. which is of course, what I expect. As for the product - matches my skin tone well, applies well with fingers or brush, does not cake - natural looking. I also always find after I wear it that any blemishes or pimples recede/go away - of course, assume thta is why it is part of the &amp;#34;acne solutions&amp;#34;! :) works great!</li>
    <li> First, I will say that before I tried the acne solutions system, I had tried everything. Mary Kay, Proactiv, Neutrogena, and many others. Let me tell you a little bit about myself and my skin. I am a twenty-five year old female. I did not have many breakouts as a teenager. I have always had oily skin, especially in my t-zone.. In the beginning, I broke out in my t-zone only. Eventually, my entire face was breaking out, to include my hairline, scalp, and even my neck and chest. It was discouraging and embarrassing. I would not leave the house to go ANYWHERE without putting make-up on my face to cover up the breakouts. Not only were the breakouts depressing to look at, they were also painful. I had open wounds on my face where I had picked at the breakouts. I had pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes cyst like bumps. I even went on an antibiotic to try to help my acne. The antibiotic was helpful, but it never cleared my face up completely. I also noticed if I missed even one day of taking it, I would get a new breakout. I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend years on an antibiotic, so I was always searching for another solution.  When I purchased the trial size of the Clinique Acne Solutions system, I was at a point where I was crying when I looked in the mirror at my face. It looked like I had a bad case of Chicken Pox. There were red spots all over face, open wounds from my attempts to pop the zits, and the beginning phases of scarring from past pimples. I did not have much faith in the Clinique System because every other product had failed me, but I figured I would give it a try anyhow. After just one use, my skin felt softer, cleaner, and more radiant. In just three days, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have any new breakouts and my face was beginning to heal from the current breakouts. After using the system for just ONE WEEK, my face is almost completely clear. I have not had any new breakouts at all. My skin feels like silk. I actually left my house for the first timein months without putting any make-up on! The results I have gotten from this system have truly blown me away. Nothing has ever worked so quickly and effectively as the Clinique Acne Solutions system. My husband even complimented me on how clear my face is now. I am so thankful to have found this miracle system!  A few things I wanted to add in you plan to try the system:  1.For some, this product may seem expensive. Honestly, for me, this product is reasonably priced compared to other acne systems. I paid $28 for the trial kit.   2. I suggest using a make-up remover cloth to take off make-up before using foam cleanser to wash your face. The cleanser isn&#x27;t really designed to remove make-up, but it does a great job at cleaning the bare face.  3. The clarifying lotion, which is actually a toner, did sting when I first started applying it to my face. Like I mentioned, my face was broken out, I had open sores, and the product was new to my face. I stuck it out though, because it felt great to look at the cotton pad I had used to apply to toner and see all the impurities it was removing from my face. After a week of using it, the burn has almost went away. It is worth it to me to have clean, clear, acne-free skin!   4. Make sure to use all three of the products together at least 2 times a day. Following the directions and using the product as directed will hopefully lead to the same amazing results I have had with this system.   5. Last, but certainly not least, if you notice MORE breakouts in the first few days, don&#x27;t get discouraged and definitely don&#x27;t stop using the system. It is good for all of the dirt and oil to come to the surface rather than staying in the skin which will only lead to more breakouts.  It normally takes about one month to see viable results from any product.  So keep that in mind and stay positive!   I surely hope this system works just as amazingly for anyone else who tries it as it has for me!   Wishing you all happy, clean, clear, and beautiful skin!

    <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old and have occasional breakouts. I have combination/oily skin and I take very good care of my skin. I actually started using foundation about a couple years ago, since I didn&#x27;t really need it. But WOW! This product is amazing. My skin looks flawless and matte, it feels so smooth and I don&#x27;t feel worried when I apply it knowing I have a few zits underneath... seriously, I almost look airbrushed (in a good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation isn&#x27;t heavy and a little goes a long way. I LOVE IT and will re-purchase it over and over again!</li>
    <li> Not much coverage and it really made my skin dry. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this make-up, normally I have red/pink skin and I use this to cover it up and it does a great job covering it up.</li>
    <li> My 48 year old skin is confused....dry and oily at the same time. This foundation allows me to wear make up and not get break-outs quite so bad. A little goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> Actually made my skin break out.  Very sad and disappointed.  Heavy makeup feel and skin did not breathe well.  Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I used to use Neutrogena but switched to this. It is thick so it covers everything great without having to add extra concealer on the top. Spreads smoothly and a little goes a long way. Did not make acne worse, no greasy feel, seems to help dry the spots that are there. The shades tend to run a bit dark. I am not extremely pale but the level 2 fresh alabaster looks perfect. In summer I switch to the #3. Watch out...#4 fresh vanilla  is actually quite dark despite the name. It is  what I wore when I lived in Hawaii and was very tan!</li>
    <li> this is not full coverage but does match my freckled, slightly pink skin tone perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was a loyal Super Fit foundation wearer and then Clinique stopped making it.  I tried several others in their line and found this one not only stays on in a similar fashion, but had a much better color match to my skin tone (Fresh Ivory).  Super Fit actually didn&#x27;t come in a color light enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.  I like the way it wears, it mattes well with loose powder and it covers up variance in skin tone.  My face breaks out less with this compared to Super Fit as well.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne and this foundation is so dry. The powder also sucks. Clinique should come out with a cream foundation that provides full coverage. I have oily skin too and this product sucks on oily skin. This provides basic coverage, it did not cover red nor dark spots even when my skin didnt have a bump on it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for acne/ red/ dark spot coverage. I purchased this product at Macy&#x27;s and had it applied by the beuty rep but it&#x27;s really too dry and gets flaky. Will not buy ever again.</li>
    <li> Once I started using this makeup I haven&#x27;t gone back to using anything else. Just ordered my 5th bottle today!</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes all the Clinique makeup</li>
    <li> :) i liked it so much,the best one really,for my oily skin its perfect :) i advice everyone to buy it</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t good coverage and it has a lack of colors, very upsetting, im sticking with Elizabeth Arden.&lt;br /&gt;If anything you could use Maybelline&#x27;s BB Cream and it would worker nicer than this, it&#x27;s also cheaper,&lt;br /&gt;I am medium/dark skinned, and the color choices werent very appealing to me</li>
</ol>
