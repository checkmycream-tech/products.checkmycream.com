      <li>I was able to use the Gillette fusion power razor and it was awesome.</li>
      <li>you want the best, smoothest shave on planet earth with minimum irritation and you don&#x27;t want to spend more time in the bathroom tending to your face than your wife?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> since i picked up the Gillette fusion power razor all i can say is WOW.  who knew shaving could be like this.  Ive used it a few times now and all i hear are comments about how my shave looks better, smoother, last longer etc.  Ive used the fusion shaver for awhile now and had no idea how much of a difference one little battery could make.  i recommend it!</li>
    <li> the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle does the job really well.  I like that the handle is slip resistant to help get you a closer shave.  I love it when a blade and handle shaves clean and saves time too. the free razor was provided via a program run by Gillette</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have tried a lot of different razors over the last 20 years.  I can honestly say that Gillette mach III has been my razor of choice.  I received this razor from a program run by Gillette so I gave the fusion power a try after not shaving for a couple of days and I am amazed at how close a shave I got.  I needed less pressure than a usual blade razor and did not nick myself even once.  The handle is very comfortable and makes shaving a breeze.  My only concern and reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is the price of the replacement blades.  I guess you get what you pay for...  I will definitely use this again.</li>
    <li> if you need a vibrator for cheap that doubles as a razor this is still a junk product. Just finished shaving with it, I had to go over my entire face with a another razor that was getting on the dull side. Basically it caught hair more then it actually cut anything. The blades are placed so tight together and at such a acute angle that it never reaches the base of the follicle. This left me with a five&#x27;o&#x27;clock shadow in patches. I ran my fingers over the blades to see if they were dull, and surprisingly they slide right over them.&lt;br /&gt;Over all substandard quality. I&#x27;ll be sticking with my plain old three blade Schick. I&#x27;m just glad I had one left over to clean up after the Gillette.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought into all the hype and picked up a Gillete fusion power to compare against my regular Mach 3 razor. My face was burning after my first shave and sprouted little red bumps. I wanted to make sure the razor was to blame and not something else so for the next two days I shaved my face half and half: Fusion on one side. Mach 3 on the other. On the second day I switched sides. The result? Every time I shaved, the burning side of my face had just been shaved by the fusion. The Mach 3 side was just fine.    That burning sensation must me the shave was closer/better right? Wrong. Both sides of my face are equally smooth from both a visual and tactile inspection. The only difference is the burning.    Conclusion: Don&#x27;t buy into the hype. 3 blades are better than 5.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I have used it for years, and plan to continue to do so. This razor has 5 blades which work really well in giving me a close shave. Then, you can flip it around to the \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot; on the back of the razor to get those tougher to reach spots. I don&#x27;t find the precision trimmer to be too sharp (or useful for that matter) but it is nice to have, and usually gets at least the hairs right under the nose, which are tougher to get with the wider blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power part of this razor is activated with the push of a button, and can be used in the shower. It causes the razor to vibrate or pulsate while shaving, which supposedly gets the hairs to stand up for a closer shave. I&#x27;m not convinced that it does much, as I only use the power function once or twice out of every 5 shaves, and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, but maybe for other people it actually does help (or maybe it helps more while shaving outside of the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AAA battery that came with it lasted for what seems like forever (over 2 years) - however, as I mentioned, I don&#x27;t always use the power function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone will react differently to razors, but I liked this razor better than any other. I transitioned to this one years ago from the Mach 3 type razors. The only recent comparison I have is the [[ASIN:B0047E3LHE Schick Hydro 5 (1 Razor + 1 Cartridge)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Gillette Fusion better because the blades are closer and it doesn&#x27;t have the slimy residue that the Schick Hydro leaves behind. For a good close up comparison photo of the two razors, look at the photos for the Schick Hydro razor posted by a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased a 16-pack of the cartridge refills for the Gillette Fusion - [[ASIN:B002WQJP1U Gillette Fusion Manual - Replacement Cartridges - 16 Cartridges]], so I will definitely be shaving with it for a while.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve been using the M3 power for a while now, one problem I&#x27;ve had is the mustache hairs under my nose. Well, the new precision trimmer fixed all that, no hairs left, anywhere. I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation at all, no hassle to get hairs out of the blades either.</li>
    <li> I found that the M3 Power gives a much closer shave than the Fusion Power.  I have a very heavy beard and the Fusion Power left me with a very slight stubble while the M3 Power always gives me an incredibly close shave.  I only used the \\&quot;free\\&quot; cartridge that comes with the power handle, though.  I am now wondering about initial quality &amp; consistency and if a future purchase of later run cartridges might provide a different outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found the single blade to be absolutely worthless.  It seemed to be recessed and unable to shave at all.  Again, perhaps an initial quality issue.</li>
    <li> I am sticking with my Gillette Sensor with 2 blades -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these products are getting to be like a bad Saturday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night Live Skit - how many blades can we shave with now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 2 blades is just diminishing returns and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;increasing costs.</li>
    <li> Antes de esta maquina tenia una Mach 3 y la diferencia en la afeitada es poca. El dise?o es espectacular, muy f?cil de agarrar. El haber incluido una hojilla en la parte de arriba para los vellos de debajo de la nariz o de las patilla es quiz?s el gran paso en esta maquina.</li>
    <li> like many other negative reviews, i&#x27;ve experienced the same problems with this razor.  i guess less blades is more and i&#x27;m going back to the m3 power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll be brief about the problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  there&#x27;s more \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; when you shave.  it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  the razor is harder to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  it&#x27;s more expensive than other better razors out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so there you have it.  if you HAVE to try it out, hey it might work for you.  but please, keep your receipt (and packaging) in case you want to get a refund.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  if you&#x27;re reading this is 2009, chances are that gillette&#x27;s money back guarantee will no longer be around.  however, there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then.</li>
    <li> Received this razor as a gift, Co branded as \\&quot;Art of Shaving Brand\\&quot;.  Basically I have been a single blade bic, or double edge schick disposable guy, depending on which 20 pack was on sale.  I even bought a safety razor with premium German blades, but after getting my first cuts, went back to the bics. I think this qualifies me as a guy who doesn&#x27;t chase the razor fads.&lt;br /&gt;Needed to shave on Christmas, and had a two day growth.  The light was bright, and this was the most comfortable shave ever.  My wife could immediately tell the difference. Will probobly not shave on days off to afford the blades, which I agree are way overpriced.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Power Razor is the only razor i will use.  I have not found any thing better.&lt;br /&gt;If you know of something better let me know.&lt;br /&gt;ranrog@cableone.net</li>
    <li> Picked this up for less than $10 with free Gillette shaving gel.  Decided to give it a try.  What&#x27;s to lose?&lt;br /&gt;This offers a VERY close shave.  It badly irritated my skin and made it feel very itchy.  I used [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]].&lt;br /&gt;  The single blade for hard to reach places is handy design feature.  The only flaw of this whole Gillette Fusion shaving system is that it is made entirely for one reason:  Pure profit.  Have a look at the price of the replacement blade cartridges.  Anyone who actually uses this to shave daily is mad.  The shaving cartridge gets clogged with hair and is no good after 1 or 2 shaves.  That is a huge price to pay for doing a simple thing: shaving.  I am going to do it the normal, or as most would consider \\&quot;the old fashioned way\\&quot; and purchase a double edge razor [[[ASIN:B000JPKLUU Merkur Solingen Futur Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor]], made in Germany, chrome and gold finish also available] and see how it performs to all these shaving systems developed by Gillette and Schick of just more and more blades and more \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; strips that haven&#x27;t worked quite well at all for their promises and simple purpose of shaving hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> I bought this razor based on some reviews and because it was on sale at Costco (with a lot of blades...). From the moment I tried it, I despised this razor. The 5 blades make the experience worse than 1 because they take up so much room you can&#x27;t get to certain spots on the face. Also, I go through these blades faster than I ever have with a single or 3-blade system. And lastly, the razor cuts my face. The 5 blades is supposed to make the experience easier but it doesn&#x27;t. I never cut myself with 3-blade systems. Overall, this is a horrible razor and I encourage you to look to others.</li>
    <li> THE POWER OF THIS RAZOR IS SUPERIOR</li>
    <li> The Fusion Power has one distinct improvement over previous Gillette razors: the precision trimmer. It is handy for shaving tricky spots such as the area under the nose and between the upper lip. That being stated, I have not noticed a more comfortable shave with the micro pulses. Also, five blades has not reduced the number of required strokes when compared to the three on the Mach3 Turbo (the number of strokes is the same). Finally, the frequency of having to replace the cartridges does not justify their cost. After only three shaves, the cartridge needs to be changed. The blades for the Mach3 and Sensor product lines last longer. If you shave daily, do not upgrade to this.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, and no, I don&#x27;t own stock in or work for any shaver companies. It&#x27;s a cross between the old stick razors and an electric -- and I can use it while I take a shower. I get the closest, most comfortable and nick-free shaves from this little guy. Even when I occasionally take a week off from shaving (vacations, etc.), I fire this puppy up, take my time, and soon have a great close shave just as if I&#x27;d been doing it all along -- without the whisker tugging, bloody cuts, and uneven finish like the old days. Yes, the blades are expensive, but they last me a long time. I also like that I hardly ever have to replace the battery, and I like the little backside trimmer for my ever-growing nose and ear hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> First of all,...\\&quot;STEALTH\\&quot;? Really? Well, I can certainly ...detect it sitting in my trash bin. The only thing I fail to see is the what all the fuss was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it shave? Sure. Is it closer? Closer than what? Oh, you mean compared to those...ancient 2/3/4-blade ones? Well, not detectably. If it does shave any closer I for one could not tell. And no, the vibration adds to nothing detectable either besides a small humming noise.&lt;br /&gt;And, what is worse, the new head is too big with only a small portion of its surface corresponding to the blades: one has very little control under his nose and chin. It will nick you if not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Similar to digital camera manufacturers who are engaged in the \\&quot;more-and-more megapixels\\&quot; marketing war (only to end up with more and more...noise as no one seems to consider whether the lens can keep up or not), the \\&quot;more-and-more blades\\&quot; race has reached the point of ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So closer it may or may not be, but less comfortable it surely is. I use to shave against the grain my cheeks and under my jawline. And apparently, all these blades and vibration and \\&quot;comfort strips\\&quot; make the experience not something to long for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, to add insult to injury, if you have any old Gillette blade cartridges knocking around in some drawer, forget about using them with this new holder. Contrary to the previous editions of Gillette blade holders that had retrograde compatibility, this baby will only take new (and more expensive) [[ASIN:B000BUUVTY Gillette Fusion Power Blades]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like printer companies, that are eager to sell us their printers below cost - only to charge an arm and an leg for their inks and toners, the shaving blades oligopoly (after all the buyouts, all of ...two major companies remain to \\&quot;compete\\&quot;) has turned our morning ritual into their mil-cow. Bells and whistles and over-the-top adds do not hide the fact that only some years ago, blade cartridges came in fives (not fours!) and cost less than half of what the new brightly colored and over-marketed new ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really ironic is that the single blade at the back is so much better than the overloaded front that I was reminded of why, years ago, I had taken the advice of my father and chosen the path of traditional blade holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a conference trip and kept is as a backup until its blades run out. After about a month I went back to my trusted [[ASIN:B002IFFSOS Safety Razor]]. Paired with a traditional [[ASIN:B000K7GP3Y Badger Hair Shaving Brush]] and a good [[ASIN:B00158S4RM Shaving Soap]] there is simply no comparison in both sensation and result.cost less than half of what the new brightly colored and over-marketed new ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really ironic is that the single blade at the back is so much better than the overloaded front that I was reminded of why, years ago, I had taken the advice of my father and chosen the path of traditional blade holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a conference trip and kept is as a backup until its blades run out.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week, compared it to the M3 Power and an earlier Gillette blade.  I have a dark, fast growing, above average thickness bristles with average density.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly closer shave than the M3 Power, of little difference if you have a lighter hair or beard.  I found I could shave a little faster with this blade.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly less comfortable for me: the blades pull my hair just a little, the vibration is a little too strong (I&#x27;m somewhat sensitive to vibration in my right hand) and I found the handle more likely to get slippery in the shower vs. the M3 Power.&lt;br /&gt;I found the trim blade to be a good addition for under the nose and sideburns.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Very good price.</li>
    <li> Close shave and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head flexes and allows for reach into those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the replacement blades are expensive!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only get 1 week of shave out of it and it costs $3+ to replace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 x 4 thats $12 a month Gillete is making out of me :(</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard. I shave daily. I have been using Gillette sensor-series products almost exclusively since the Gillette sensor debuted in 1990.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I graduated from Sensor, To Sensor II, to Mach 3, to Mach 3 power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally shave wet, with no shaving cream, and with down strokes, although I use some upstrokes. I have tested the Mach 5 both wet and dry, with no cuts or major problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Gillette Fusion for 1 week, and here are my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) An overall great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The Fusion shaves better dry than any previous Sensor model. (Although I rarely have a reason to shave dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) More blades. More microfins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The plastic handle, while bulky, is very nice. The plastic is gentle to the touch, aa nice departure from the rigid, cold metal of the M3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Comes with a coupon for $2 off additional cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The confort strip wear out WAY too quickly.  My Mach3 blades last 3 weeks, My Fusion blade needs replacement after 1 week. Hopefully, the replacement blades will be better than the original ones (if so, I&#x27;ll edit this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Since there are more microfins with a larger area, and sincen the microfins become more imporant to the overall shave, the microfins trap more hairs than ever. Even washing the blade doesn&#x27;t get rid of all of the microhairs trapped in the microfins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The 5 blades make upstrokes more difficult and don&#x27;t offer the precision of the M3 and previous models for the tough spots (e.g. under the nose). On the soft ares of the face (e.g., the cheecks), the larger footprint makes it harder to press close and cut hairs close to the skin. However, this problem is somewhat offset by the additional blades and microfins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) As always, the blades are more expensive than previous version. At this rate of inflation, Gillette blades will cost $50 each by the year 2030. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great product. I am undecided if I will keep using Fusion or switch back to the M3 as my primary. I might use both together (as I previously did with the M3 and Sensor Excel).</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars but... it isnt perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST razor for everyday use.  That means shaving everyday or every other day because you go to work.  Because there is so much more surface area in the blade design it really is a breeze to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have quite senitive skin, and I can now finally shave everyday with out getting cut up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER... If you leave your face unshaved for more than 3 days... like a full weekend.  It doesnt shave as well.  The long hairs get caught up in the blades and almost rip out.  The Mach 3 does a much better job at long hairs.  It is possible to shave with the fusion, but it takes a longer time since you have to keep rining it out every inch of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this razor since the first day it came out.  The best thing  I have noticed is that each blade lasts about 2 weeks. My Mach 3 usually lasted a week.  ( Like i said i have senstive skin and once the blade starts going, my face gets all cut up. )  So blades are more expensive but they do last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.  Best razor every if you need to shave frequently.  If you are a contruction worker or someone that only shaves once or twice a week... I wouldnt recommend it.</li>
    <li> If I ran Schick I&#x27;d immediately pull the Quattro from the market, declaring it a flawed product.  I would then focus on a new ad campaign touting the benefits of the good ol&#x27; fashioned two blade models.</li>
    <li> This razor is actually the most uncomfortable I&#x27;ve ever used. It seems much harder to shave with and pulls at my face more. This is coming from someone who loves the mach 3 in its various forms. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is. Maybe the blades are too close to each other or something. Maybe trying to cut so many hairs at once is a bad idea. All I know for sure is it&#x27;s not smooth.  It&#x27;s not just a slight difference either. I go back to the mach 3 which I still have and I immediately notice the difference. Maybe others with different beards will have better luck but for me this razor down right sucks. I&#x27;ve given it a fair shake too. I&#x27;m still trying to use up the blades I stupidly bought.  However I can&#x27;t ignore the fact it is far worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I want to add one more thing. Whey you first put a new cartage in the razor does a pretty good job. If you tested it for one shave you might think it was good. However it really degrades very quickly. The second day it&#x27;s noticeably worse and it just goes down hill fast after that. Again I am comparing this to a Mach 3 which I can keep for a much (and I mean MUCH) longer time and have it shave pretty good.  There is definitely some technical problem with this razor and I think a lot of people posting good results have a) tested it once b) are shills for Gillette c)  are in denial after spending a lot of cash on it or d) have a beard like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> I am keying in this review while I&#x27;m finishing up shaving with the other hand. That&#x27;s how safe the safety razor has become.  I&#x27;ve not nicked myself in over a year of use. The blade it came with lasted 3 months - but, as with previous models, the replacement blades are apparently made of less stern stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The wider spacing of the blades is vast improvement over previous models. Finally, you do not need torrential water pressure to clean your razor.  Actually, cleaning the Fushion reveals its best feature.  Under the flow of tap water, with the motor on, it sounds much like a mini didgeridoo, the Austrailian aboriginal instrument. I don&#x27;t know if this was by design, but, if you&#x27;re a world music fan, it&#x27;s a delightful addition to your day. This is probably why they called it Fusion. Listen next time.</li>
    <li> I almost never review products apart from books, CDs, movies, DVDs, and electronic devices.  This is one of my rare exceptions.  So why am I do ing this?  Last April I developed a blood clot in my right calf as well as a small one just above my knee.  As is usual in these cases, I was placed on the anticoagulation medicine Warfarin (the generic form of Coumadin) for six months.  This past saturday I was officially taken off Warfarin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I bring all this up?  I was told in April that I was going to have to be very careful not to cut myself shaving.  If I did, I might have a great deal of trouble stopping the bleeding.  I had bought this razor literally the week before my blood clot.  I had been using the Mach 3 before this and often cut myself using it.  I was somewhat dubious about using this new razor and its five blade, but I liked the very, very close shave it gave me.  So I stuck with it.  The result?  In six months I did not cut myself a single time.  This is far and away the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gives an amazingly close shave and protects my skin from scraping or cutting better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thanks Gillette for not making me find out what cutting myself when shaving would have been like.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I bought it, even though I&#x27;m a female, because I loved my husband&#x27;s so much and he got annoyed with me always using his.  I wish there was a female version, but who really cares, right?  This is one of the best and smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift, and I must say that I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on it myself. The vibration doesn&#x27;t do one bit of good to make your face smoother. They strapped a battery on a four blade razor as a marketing gimmick. Not a bad razor if it&#x27;s free, but not worth any extra money paid for the \\&quot;power.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!Attention Gillette!!&lt;br /&gt;You can call your next razor Fusion Power Ultra Magnum Viral BOOM Stick and put an mp3 player on it, but that won&#x27;t necessarily amount to satisfied customers.</li>
    <li> It works really well, and gives a real decent shave; but even with the power on it doesn&#x27;t really give that much better a shave than the Mach-3. If there is an improvement, it&#x27;s negligible. Its head&#x27;s a little bigger than the Mach-3 as well, which isn&#x27;t a HUGE deal but it noticeable enough. I have used both side by side, and can safely say that both will give you a fantastic shave. It is also a cool looking blade. The battery-powered operation is just gimmicky and doesn&#x27;t improve your shave a great deal.</li>
    <li> I bought the New Fusion Power Razor on January 26th at CVS. I&#x27;ve been shaving with it almost everyday starting January 27th. It is a totally new shaving experience! The razor glides over your face easier than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and there is less...almost no...irritation. The time it takes me to shave has not been significantly reduced, but it has helped some and I do like the less irritation that it provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the new razor lasts me 5 to 7 days of shaving before it wears out. However, the blue strip does wear out after about 4 days, but I continue to use it for a few more. I had used the Mach 3 Power razor for several years and the new Fusion Power is the best shave yet. I had similar results with the Mach 3 blades lasting about 5 to 7 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually let me face have a rest on the weekend from all the shaving during the week, and I haven&#x27;t stopped that tradition. For the past two weekends I skipped a day and shaved on Sunday or Monday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has had no problems shaving through two days of growth. I have thick stubble by day two and the shave is as good as ever. The razor doesn&#x27;t get clogged and can be cleaned out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting use to the new precision trimmer on the back of the razor to shave under my nose and side-burns. I&#x27;m more impressed with the results than I was on day one, but not as I am with my old Sensor razor, which is what I still find myself using for those hard-to-reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products for 17 years. I started with the Sensor and have bought and used every razor Gillette has made since! I have &#x27;em all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is high, I&#x27;ll admit it! But I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the New Power Fusion for now. I still have some of the Mach 3 Power blades I need to use so once those are gone, I&#x27;ll be strictly using the Fusion Power Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to consider is the kind of shaving cream or gel you use. I&#x27;ve noticed that the better, \\&quot;more expensive\\&quot; ones provide a better feeling during and after a shave. I currently use Gillette&#x27;s Shaving Gel, but I want to try the new Fusion Hydra Gel. I also want to try the King of Shaves gel. I&#x27;ve also found the Neturogena razor defense post shave lotion to be a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the razor looks good and feels good in your hand. The shave is great and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I had read about this razor and being a bit of a shaving fanatic myself, I waited patiently for my local store to get the razor in stock.  When I finally spotted it, I imediately purchased it, took it home and tried it.  So, does this razor live up to the hype?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came home and took the razor out of the package I was glad to see that the battery (1-AAA battery) was included but I was a little put off that it only came with one razor cartridge.  I figured from past experience that there would be two but only one???  The razor itself has a decent weight and a nice shape so I quickly got over the fact that there was only one cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought the razor in the shower, washed my face and applied my shaving gel and was preparred to be wowed.  I turned the razor on and it came to life with a solid hum.  The power button on it seems to be better than the M3Power&#x27;s because it protrudes a little less and it seems less likely to be accidently turned off while you&#x27;re shaving.  That being said, I began to shave.  The first thing I noticed about the razor was the size of it&#x27;s head.  It seems rather large in comparison to the M3Power or even the Schick Quattro blades.  Even though it did seem bigger, it didn&#x27;t seem awkwardky big and I was still able to shave without it being cumbersome.  The razor cut clean and smoothly though my beard and gave quite a comfortable shave.  The blades easily rinsed under running water even though they are spaced quite closely to each other.  I noticed on a few of my problem spots I still had to take multiple passes with the razor so in spite of having five blades, it couldn&#x27;t perform miracles!  There was the single trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge too but it really didn&#x27;t seem to be very functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was quite satisfied with the quality and comfort of the shave.  The question that I have now is that, in spite of a good shave, is this razor worth the extra price versus say, the M3Power or theSchick Quattro?  Locally the refils go for about 30% more than the other \\&quot;older\\&quot; razors so, there is a signifigant price difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ll continue to use this razor for a little while and look for the cartridges to be on sale but I honestly don&#x27;t think the Fusion&#x27;s shave is that far superior to either the M3Power or the Schick Quattro to justify paying that much extra.</li>
    <li> This razor is by far the closest and most comfortable shave ever. The shave is closer than the M3, and much more comfortable; I&#x27;d say 50% more comfortable. I am amazed at the quality of the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I haven&#x27;t lost my mind yet to pay almost 4 bucks a blade. I would if they lasted more than 2-3 shaves, but they don&#x27;t. You can do the math, but $400/year for blades is more than I can stomach. I can well afford it, but somewhere you have to put a line in the sand and say, enough. This is ridiculous and Gillette is taking advantage of the marketplace. Right now, they clearly have the best product, and can charge whatever price they would like. The first alternative that arises, it&#x27;s adios to Gillette for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the Mach 3 for now because it&#x27;s plenty good enough, and already way overpriced.</li>
    <li> So far, the best shave I&#x27;ve had. Was a big fan of Mach 3. The Fusion gets much closer, and is more comfortable. I&#x27;ve tried them all, including Schick. Schick&#x27;s blades have always performed inferior to me. I&#x27;ve had problems shaving for a long time. I&#x27;ve tried everything from $300 electrics, to straight-razors. I&#x27;ve tried about 35 different shaving lotions from around the world.Fusion blade are a bit expensive for disposables, but so far, seem worth it.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Gillette Sensor Excel, Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, and Schick Quattro, among other lesser-known razors, and shaved with them all while being increasingly more disgruntled at how much a little piece of plastic and metal costs. While I was impressed with the Mach 3, and more so with the Mach 3 Turbo, when I switched to the Quattro, I knew that was the razor for me. Close shave, smooth glide, rarely any cuts at all even on my difficult-to-shave face. Recently when I went to the store, they were out of the 4-pack of Quattro blades, and so instead of buying an 8-pack, I decided to try this brand new razor from Gillette. I&#x27;d never had a 5-blade razor before (let alone a battery-powered vibrating one) and so I decided to go all out, even though I was very disappointed to find that the cartridges cost $3.50 EACH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice easy-to-open clamshell package with a cheesy-looking but convenient holder that can either lay flat or stand vertically, which is what I prefer. It comes with a battery, which was very easy to install, and is touted as being shower-proof. I wouldn&#x27;t know, because I don&#x27;t shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration was not at all what I was expecting. I don&#x27;t really know what I was expecting since this was my first powered razor, but when they say \\&quot;gentle micro-pulses\\&quot; I think of a soft intermittent buzz. Not so. This razor is strong, and it vibrates like a cell phone, constantly, insistently and very noticably. I was surprised by how strong the vibration was for a small appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my standard Gillette foam shave cream, and set to work trimming my face. The first thing I noticed is that I couldn&#x27;t really feel the razor on my face as it vibrated and shaved my whiskers. The second thing I noticed is that I also couldn&#x27;t feel when my face was clean-shaven while the razor was vibrating. I rely on the way the razor feels and sounds on my skin to know when I&#x27;m done shaving a spot, and the vibration drowned out any noise or sensation or any other feedback I might have gotten from the razor. However, it didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference, because I had to go over the same spots four or five times in order to make them clean-shaven. I&#x27;m not sure what the 5th blade is doing, but I don&#x27;t have to shave the same spots that many times with even an old blade on my Quattro. However, when I was done, the final result was a pretty good shave, with a few nicks here and there--the Fusion doesn&#x27;t work well with bumps on the face when vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the single trimmer blade on my sideburns. It seems to work as advertised, and it is easy to use for accurate trimming of the sideburns. The problem, however, is that the single-blade end is no good for shaving a larger area such as your entire moustache, but the five-blade side is way too large for such a task. I found it very awkward to shave my moustache area with either end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I will be returning the Fusion and exchanging it for a set of replacement cartridges for my Quattro. It still outperforms the Fusion in spite of having one less blade in the area of comfort and shaving sensation, and the cartridges are $1.50 cheaper each. I may go back to the Fusion sometime, but if I did, it would be the manual version, never the vibrating version. This was my first and last experience with a battery-powered razor.</li>
    <li> Folks i have been trying to find a razor that will give me the closest possible shave without all the skin irratation. I thought this was it , but no, the fusion is bulky compared to the Mach 3 the razor on the back is not very sharp/strong and hard to clean it is smoother when u shave but thats about the only difference no closer than the mach 3 i still have to go against the grain to get a smooth close shave . I understand that not everyones face is the same but i have been unable to find a razor that will give me a close shave without going against the grain not even th 5 blade fusion. Cotaray to popular belief the closest and most comfortable shave i have been able to get is from an electric razor the Braun Actviator.So there u have it other than the new fancy look theres really not much difference or advantage over the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I finally gave in and bought this parody of a razor--and I got taken. Even with its five blades, I am left after shaving with the exact same edges of my chin left rough and unsmooth. I was used to this with my Mach 3, but bought into the fact that two more blades really WERE the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little single trimmer blade? I see it in there, but I definitely don&#x27;t feel it doing anything. Maybe you have to hold it at just the right angle, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute worst time to use this razor is after a few days of beard growth. The vibrating blades felt like they were trying to grab the hairs and actually rip them out of my face faster than I could draw the razor across my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I didn&#x27;t throw my Mach 3 away. I&#x27;ll be going back to that.</li>
    <li> The whole \\&quot;power\\&quot; thing used to freak me out but I finally gave in and tried the Fusion Power the week it was released and now I&#x27;ll never go back to the old Mach 3. I&#x27;ve never had a razor shave this close and this clean. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and there&#x27;s no sign of a low battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint - and this is a complaint about the disposable razor industry and all industries built on this model (ink jet printers anyone?) - is that the blades cost waaaay too much. $14 for 4 blades is criminal. I&#x27;m still trying to find the best price but $13-$15 for the 4-pack seems to be the norm. Ugh. The good news is that I seem to be able to use the blades longer. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I hesitate to rate this item low because it really does give a nice shave. However, in comparison to the Mach 3, the Fusion&#x27;s outrageously priced blades and clownish appearance are something of a step down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is comparable to Mach 3. Some may quibble about subtle differences (Mach 3 better on the downstroke but Fusion better on the upstroke? :-), but however you slice it, we&#x27;re well into the domain of greatly diminished returns on additional blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As near as I can tell, the sixth blade on the back of the razor does... absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is approximately the size of a battleship and maneuvers with all the grace of a 1967 Impala.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this razor! Design, power indicator, its power which seems to be more powerful than the M3, the aloe strip and the extra blade on the back of it! BUT, this thing has one blade too many in the front, this razor WILL CUT YOU if you are not careful! You could probably kill someone with it! The blades on the cartridges are extremely sharp and shaving time increases to over twice the time as with the Gillette M3, due to that extra fourth blade and the size of the cartridge, which forces you to be extra careful and shave very slowly, so as not to cut yourself. If it only had one less blade in the front, it would certainly be the best razor in the world! Gillette, if you are reading this, consider this advise seriously and remove that fourth blade, because you created one hell of a scalpel. I am rating it two stars, despite the many pluses already mentioned, but since its primary and only purpose is to shave, I cannot honestly say it does a good job. I&#x27;ve used disposable razors that are about $0.49 cents that are faster and better. I do not recommend it, unless they remove that fourth blade. I do recommend the M3 Nitro from Gillete as well and which is the one I am now using.</li>
    <li> Even though five blades sounds absurd, I bought this because I thought three and four blades was absurd, but really noticed a difference.  Maybe that&#x27;s where the advances end since I could not tell a difference in shaving between this razor and the Schick Quattro and M3Power razor.  I don&#x27;t feel like it gets a closer shave.  In fact, I don&#x27;t notice any advantages in this razor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used a \\&quot;Power\\&quot; razor before, try it.  The vibrating that is put off by the batteries is very slight but definitely makes for a closer shave. Battery life is long, and one advantage this razor has is a low battery life indicator. That&#x27;s about it though. The trimmer that was hyped so much is pretty much useless.  I am not a very hairy guy, but I tried it on my sideburns and it didn&#x27;t do anything. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly but I couldn&#x27;t tell what it was supposed to do.  As for under the nose, it was worthless there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major disadvantage of this razor are the blades.  You&#x27;re going to pay an average of $3 per blade! Considering a blade lasts two weeks at most (which is how often you should replace them, regardless of whether they still work), prepare yourself for a $60 a year razor budget.  The M3Power blades are only $2 a blade, and backwards compatible with previous razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If money is no object and you don&#x27;t already have an M3Power, this isn&#x27;t a bad razor, but it&#x27;s not nearly worth the hype and price when compared to its predecessor.</li>
    <li> I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it&#x27;s my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon!</li>
    <li> Gillette is the mafia of shaving.  I mean, really, if you&#x27;re a man and you&#x27;re reading this, you probably already own/use Gillette products.  It&#x27;s a given.  They really are the best.  They are also really the MOST EXPENSIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the regular Gillette Fusion for years now - and just made the \\&quot;leap\\&quot; to get the Fusion Power.  Why now?  I mean the blades are ridiculously expensive as it is, what&#x27;s another buck or two on top of that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it for the first time today.  It works well.  The vibrating is a bit weird - it&#x27;s like a hand massage while you shave.  Shaving doesn&#x27;t feel like shaving.  That vibrating thing feels bizarre to shave with.  It certainly is painless to use.  It worked well - my skin is smooth.  No telling if it&#x27;s smoother than the regular Fusion.  How could you tell?  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a gimmick or what - but I did like it.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it, since I bought the darn thing and have no choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ EDIT 4/23/2010:  I now hate this thing.  Here&#x27;s why: Within one or two shaves, the \\&quot;lubricating strip\\&quot; is completely gone.  After that first shave with a nice new blade, it hurts like hell to shave with.  It&#x27;s as if the vibrating effect speeds up the wear and tear on the blades!  It&#x27;s horrible.  It truly is.  On the weekends, after a couple days growth, shaving with this thing is horrendous - I&#x27;ve never had a more painful shave.  The vibrating thing is just a gimmick: aside from that first shave with a new blade, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the other non-vibrating shaving razors out there.  I find areas all the time that it just did a horrible job on - rough spots.  I can&#x27;t use it on my upper lip - because the vibrating makes my lips chap!  Even turned off, shaving HURTS with this thing!  I&#x27;m throwing it out.  I had this old spare new Schtick razor I keep around and shaved with that a few days ago - WOW.  It&#x27;s awesome!  So smoooooth.  The vibrating thing is a total sham, folks.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED MANY RAZORS IN MY TIME BUT I COULD NOT GET A GOOD CLEAN SHAVE. I HAD TO TAKE THE SKIN OFF MY FACE TO GET  A GOOD  SHAVE. BUT WITH THE GILLETE FUSION POWER SHAVER I GOT THE BEST SHAVE EVER. I HAVE A VERY TUFF BEARD BUT THIS SHAVER GOES  THRU IT WITH EASE. THIS IS THE BEST MONEY YOU EVER WILL SPEND ON ANY RAZOR.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> I happen to suffer from three things that my wife described until 5 years ago a hughe problem; 1) Extremely sensitive skin, 2) Very (and I men VERY) thick facial folicules, and 3) Keloid cicatrization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I solved my problems through trial and error (which means many cuts and sores!) and different blades and gel trials, I went from shick, wilkison blades, remignton, braun (Electrical) to gillette. And I came to always the same results, cut, burn, soring, irritation, razor burn, you name it I had it, and you can guess, many scars, which made the opperation of shaving worse every morning. The gel to keep it short I went from clinique to gillette and always the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was using one blade that made shaving more tolerable gillette&#x27;s sensor excell when my wife arrived from one of her shopping errands and presented me with what came to be my salvation for the next four years, the mach3, which I put together with the Neutrogena sensitive skin gel and clinique&#x27;s aftershave balm and the rest is history. Then I reluctantly accepted my wife&#x27;s new present the Mach3 Power, and voila! My perfect match I haven&#x27;t been this happy in years, comfy with minor irritation and no cuts for months! Until last week! When I felt so confident and adventurous about gillette&#x27;s new product, I spotted it cueing in the supermarket and thougt \\&quot;It&#x27;s gillette! More blades, better shave, what can go wrong?\\&quot; Well, when I arrived home my wife told me, that machine looks mean, and I replied, yes and I hope its mean with my beard and gentle with my skin, we shared a laugh. Next morning I went to the bathroom and started sahving, one pass, second pass, not bad... third pass... slash, hughe, and I mean big, cut just on the border of my mandible! I was pulling down when this happened! I was being extra careful due to the sharpness of new blades. It peeled off about 3/8\\&quot; by almost 2\\&quot; of my skin, I have only seen this kind of surgical precision on dermatomes! It took me eons to stopthe bleeding. You can imagine my dismay, I got my refund and be done with it for good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t Gillette just have a mach3 power with the nice features of battey indicator and the chip set as well as a more powerfull motor? That would work perfectly for anybody, hell... I would buy it, eventhough their product slashed my chin open!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My wife told me \\&quot;I told you it looked mean\\&quot; I did not laugh.</li>
    <li> POWERED, significantly smoother shave than Mach 3.  Gel further helps, gave all my Mach 3 blades to my dad.  I agree this is a more expensive blade, but lasts all day into the next for me.  Otherwise, with my older Mach 3 handle with new blades had to shave again by 5 PM for a smoother face!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion is undoubtedly the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used--not only does it give me an incredibly close shave but it also reduces (thanks to the five blades) the need to reshave. I must say, however, that the powered models&#x27; great disadvantage is that the \\&quot;micropulses and vibrations\\&quot; feel fun but can increase the risk of razor burn, nicks and cuts if you lose your grip on the handle. The bottom line: get the manual Fusion over the powered versions for the smoothest shave ever.</li>
    <li> I love the Mach 3 and looked forward to this upgrade.  However, I cannot get a good shave with it, despite weeks of trying.  It&#x27;s clumsy and just won&#x27;t get as close as the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I thought this razor was just another gimmick. Over the years, as my hair has gotten grayer, my beard has gotten rougher. As a consequence, my wife and daughter could not stand how rough my beard was by the end of a workday and refused to kiss me. So, I decided to give this razor a whirl. It&#x27;s terrific! I get an incredibly smooth shave that lasts through the day. The vibrating motion from the battery must be the key to such a close shave. I recommend this razor to anyone with a tough beard.</li>
    <li> I have used the Mach 3, the Quattro and now the Fusion Power, the Mach 3 for 6 years, the Quattro for three years and the Fusion Power for one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mach 3 was an absolute revelation when I first started using it and people thought I was a bit over the top in blissfully describing how good the razor was.  Cynics of course would find it hard to eulogise over what was obviously just another fad and a rip off.  10 years later the Mach 3 is still VERY highly regarded and widely used even with the coming of the might Fusion Power with a whole two more blades and a built in vibrator to pleasure you even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d experiment with the Quattro a few years back and I thought it was an improvement on the Mach 3.  I just liked the way it felt and shaved although it didn&#x27;t shave any better than the Mach 3.  I did have one irritation though as it clogged up quite often and it was hard to get clean.  I even used scrubbing brushes to clear it, not always successfully.  I must have liked the razor though as I didn&#x27;t toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad was over on holiday and had forgotten his electric razor and was forced to buy a razor.  He happened to get the Fusion Power and he laughed about the five blades and vibrator.  He was soon mightily impressed with it though.  I haven&#x27;t found out though whether he has continued to use it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month ago after the blades for my Quattro were done, I decided to buy this Fusion Power.  I did read the review which were split on whether it shaved any better but everyone, almost, who used it liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it and wasn&#x27;t disppointed.  It is a lovely razor to use and the vibrator is novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then bought a brand new Mach 3 to compare this Fusion Power with.  I showered then lathered up and did half my face with each one then looked closely.  The shave was pretty much the same for both sides but bear in mind that the blade on the Fusion was a month old!  Mind you both sides felt very smooth although on closer inspection this wasn&#x27;t the case.  It just proved to me that my technique may be a bit average and that you can&#x27;t shave the hairs to the surface of the skin (unlike the simulations you see on TV).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though that the Fusion is one hell of a razor.  It looks so cool and the tactile feel and shape is a big improvement over the Mach 3.  Shaving itself feels much the same though.  I don&#x27;t have a challenging growth though, it is pretty average and I think the most important thing to get a good shave is to shower first.  After a shower you can almost get away with no shaving cream , that&#x27;s how big a difference it makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall in spite of the blades being twice the price almost, I love the fusion.  Gillette have made a product that is a perfect synthesis of engineering genius and marketing passion to produce a truly wonderful prodcut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate them of course as they have tempted me to buy a product that is objectively, no better than the Mach 3 but in the final analysis the sex appeal of this fine razor won me over.</li>
    <li> Some nice little features over the mach3 power.  Battery life indicator, recessed power button, single blade for trimming under the nose/sideburns, cool battery compartment lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I can&#x27;t figure out why the fusion power blades cost more than the fusion non-power blades.  The only difference I can see is the color. Oh I&#x27;m sure Gillette spent big bucks to make the fusion power blades stand up to the imense stress and vibrations that occurs during the blades one week lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most likely they just think people are stupid enough to either want the color coordinated ones or that customers will think something bad will happen if you use the non-power version blades. Or people will think the power ones are better.  Bottom line: Gillette thinks you are gullible. Buy the non-power blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall shave is good if you shave everyday. For longer growth the mach3 is better since you have a wider spacing between blades to avoid clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the mach3 power the vibrations seem to give a better shave: soothes the skin, helps unclog the blades, might lift hairs better.</li>
    <li> Here are the pros/cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; 1) Excellent shave, although I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between it and the Mach 3 power in a controlled experiment where I shaved half my face with each one.&lt;br /&gt; 2) Swivel mechanism is better than M3&lt;br /&gt; 3) Great sturdy design&lt;br /&gt; 4) low battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; 1) Bigger than the M3 (not by much), but enough to make shaving under the nose harder than with the M3.  The trimmer is single blade and not very useful.&lt;br /&gt; 2) Different blade design means you can&#x27;t use M3 blades.  For several generations in the past, you could have used the previous blades.&lt;br /&gt; 3) Shave similar to M3 (see above).</li>
    <li> I used my Fusion Power this morning for the first time.  I have pretty thick facial hair, though it is not especially fast-growing (no big problems with five o&#x27;clock shadow and I only shave every two or three days - though on day three, I&#x27;m pretty grizzled). The Fusion gave me the closest shave ever - especially on my neck around the Adam&#x27;s apple, which is an always-difficult area. I usually find a few stray stubbles, even with my Mach3 Power that I&#x27;ve been happily using for quite some time, but today my neck was smooth and clean with no \\&quot;re-do\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five blades of the Fusion are closer together and thus occupy about the same amount of space as the three blades of the Mach 3.  This results in a very smooth feel to the shave - you don&#x27;t feel the five separate blades, just one shaving surface.  I did feel some tugging on the heaviest parts of my beard (I hadn&#x27;t shaved since Sunday morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found I didn&#x27;t need to go back to \\&quot;re-shave\\&quot; certain areas.  My facial hair is pretty dense and there are certain spots on my upper cheeks, directly under my jaw and on my neck that I tend to miss or just don&#x27;t get a close shave on the first go-round.  This wasn&#x27;t a problem with the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra sixth blade works exactly as described and is a fantastic addition.  I was able to easily (and accurately) straighten out my sideburns and get those few stray and hard-to-get-at hairs under and next to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed.  I recognize that there is a certain amount of hype surrounding new introductions from Gillette - but it seems like they really do their homework.  When they first came out with Mach3 Power, it seemed like a gimmick - but I found it gave me a closer and more comfortable shave.  Now, with the Fusion, it feels like another leap forward in shaving technology...  I&#x27;m sold and give the Fusion Power my unqualified recommendation.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from folliculitis, this may just be the razor you were waiting for! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and, boom!, my face would break out with folliculitis. Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation, I always found it super irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things seem different about the Fusion. The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3. The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin. Not so with the Fusion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave. I haven&#x27;t noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion&#x27;s blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3, but still, I think it is slightly different. I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin. It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the \\&quot;hinge\\&quot; farther back on the shaving cartridge. Thus, the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face. Truly an improvement however it was achieved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used the Fusion, I thought five blades were a little ridiculous. I figured you could never get close in front of the ears, under the nose, etc. However, I have found that five blades aren&#x27;t ridiculous. The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I don&#x27;t hardly need it. I can get into close spaces generally without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought the Power model but am not sure yet which mode I like best: power or manual. But since you can choose whether or not to turn the power on or not, buying the power model seems best to me. You can get the best of both worlds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it! I really like the razor.</li>
    <li> Thanks to a brother i am now the proud owner of this razor living here in england.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that this razor is very high performing but it is difficult to tell if it delivers a better shave than the wilkinson sword/scheik quattro, that shaving in the direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has 5 blades on the front with a single precision blade in the rear of the cartridge, for doing sideburns and moustaches but i think it looks very neat with the extra little blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i first used it i did nick the top of my lip as i didnt think that i had to stretch my moustache area more due to the increased blade area, so at first i thought you had to use this single blade to do the moustache area with, i discovered otherwise that you dont, later today, just stretch the moustache area further by making that face you probebly make aswell to shave under your nose, more.</li>
    <li> I have used almost all of the Gillette razor and Gillette Fusion is  the best. The shave is really very smooth and after shave I don&#x27;t get any irritation as well. After Mach 3, I think that this is the best razor around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I&#x27;ll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I&#x27;ve finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&amp;Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I&#x27;ve finally found the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They&#x27;ve gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn&#x27;t take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don&#x27;t work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I&#x27;d have a five-o&#x27;clock shadow around 2PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it&#x27;s more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Highly recommended.sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the expense of the blades.

    <li> I love this razor and blad.  I have a close shave every time I use this razor and blad.  I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I think went down in the Gillette Marketing department recently:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing Guy #1: Hm, how can we increase razor blade sales for next quarter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing Guy #2: Well, we&#x27;ve been selling 3-blade razors for quite awhile, why not step it up to 4 blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing Guy #1: Better yet, let&#x27;s go for 5-blade razors!  Then we can charge twice as much for replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing Guy #2: Perfect.  Any consumer would think that 5 blades is far superior to 3.  Let&#x27;s make the thing vibrate too.. that&#x27;ll really blow their minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing Guy #1: This also buys us some time for when we decide to release the 8 blade razor.  Helloooo promotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a gimmick.  It works just as well at any 3-blade razor I&#x27;ve tried.  In fact, packing 5 blades into such a small space requires you to constantly rinse the razor, making for even longer shaving sessions.  Depending on your skin, you will be more susceptible to razor burn with this razor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this thing doesn&#x27;t do anything better than a 3-blade razor.  So, unless you have a burning desire to try the latest razor and a massive amount of money for replacement blades, stick with your current razor.</li>
    <li> The ravor gives a good close shave when the blades are fresh, but they wear out way to fast (especially for the price you pay per blade). If you go a few days between shaves this razor has a heck of a time getting through your beard. The space between the blades is so small that stubble gets caught up in there immediately. I didn&#x27;t notice a closer shave with this than I get with my Mach3. Save your money and go with one of the three blade razors out there. They give you the same shave and cost a lot less</li>
    <li> This razor ranks right up there with the Miller Lite Vortex Bottle in terms of gimmickry.  I got a good shave, but nothing better than with my old Gilette Sensor.  I think 2 blades is more than enough.  I do like the rear blade feature for getting through a 3 or 4 day growth.  I got it as a gift, so I&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s done for, probably won&#x27;t buy refills.</li>
    <li> The Fusion razor looks snazzy, but in NO WAY does it give a better shave than the Mach 3.  The blades are dull and worn out after one use, whereas you can get 2-3 shaves with the Mach 3 before you need to change the blade.  At $3 per blade that is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting rid of the Fusion and sticking with the Mach 3, a better and more reasonable product....until GE comes out with another over priced product that doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.</li>
    <li> Proving once again that Gillette is the best a man can get, the fine folks at Gillette produced this gem of a 5-blade razor.  This is not only a 5-blade razor, it possesses and enhanced indicator lubrastrip and a precision trimmer.  The electric mode works exceptionally well, massaging as it shaves.  Simply amazing...this kills the Schick Quattro and leaves Gillette&#x27;s own Mach 3 in the dust.  The Fusion gives a smooth close shave like no other.  No doubt this is the best razor on the market...until they come out with a 7-blader!</li>
    <li> Ok I was a little scared about using this shaver.  For one 5 blades is just a scary idea for me.. I mean overall the head is pretty big I say, even if the blades are small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the biggest concern is since the blades are so close together, that they are going to get clogged up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I bought it from the store yesterday, and just got done shaving with it right now..  Wow.... For one it really has cut the time it usually takes to shave.  That&#x27;s considering all the other shavers i&#x27;ve ever had... It really has cut the time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is scary cause it feels like the blades are sticking to your skin, yet the whole shave is surpisingly smooth.  I was able to shave under my nose and under my lips, and not a single cut, or even the sense that I&#x27;d be cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really made short work of my face... Which I personally only shave once or twice a week.  So my hair does grow over the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surpisingly not once did I have to actually Clean the blades, or try really hard to get the gunk out.  Everything just seemed to clean just fine under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this is the reason I am giving it a 4 stars rather then a 5 stars (but seriously is there such a thing as the perfect razor in the first place?).  I feel that these blades won&#x27;t last as long as say the mach 3 power blades..  Just cause they are so close together.  While I was really happy with the first shave and how smooth it was.  I feel like i&#x27;m waiting for something to happen.</li>
    <li> I picked this up yesterday at Costco (17 bucks for the razor plus 4 cartridges).  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the M3Power since its release.  I didn&#x27;t buy in to the hype of the Quattro, especially since it&#x27;s a manual razor.  I thought, \\&quot;three blades is good enough, what good could four blades do???\\&quot;  I only picked up the Fusion because I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience with a Gillette razor...even when I picked up this Fusion, I was a little skeptical about the difference five blades would have over three.  BOY, was I wrong.  It&#x27;s been written in a few other reviews here, but it bears repeating:  This is easily the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Moving with the grain, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like a razor is touching your face.  Even going against the grain, there&#x27;s smooth action and no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only problem i had was with the head being a little too big to effectively catch the area under your nose.  HOWEVER, there is a single blade on the back of the cartridge for this exact purpose.  I applaud Gillette for the research and customer feedback that went in to the design of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to sound like a commercial, but my wife felt my face after I shaved, and she said that it was the smoothest my face has ever been.  I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with my purchase, and you will be too.  I love this razor (as much as a man is allowed to love a razor.)</li>
    <li> As an M3Power owner, I was unsure of whether or not to make the purchase for the Fusion, as I am sure most people are. When I bought the M3Power, I assumed that I would never feel the urge to buy another razor because it had 3 blades (seemed like plenty) and had the power component, so what else was there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I started hearing about the Fusion and I read these Amazon reviews, and I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot (oh how I miss the days when they used to send the Mach3 free in the mail!). Costco has a nice deal where it is $18 for the Fusion Power with 4 blades (and handle) so I should be set for some time. I used each M3Power blade for at least a couple months without incident so the same should be true for the Fusion. I remember when the Mach3 first came out and it was recommended to change the blade every 3 months, but now because of that Aloe strip, they only last 3 uses? To me that is nonsense and wasteful as the blades themselves work just fine down the road and so do the microfins which IMHO work fine even if there is no more Aloe left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I couldn&#x27;t wait to have my first shave with the Fusion, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I was finished shaving my whole face! Because the blades are closer together, it felt as though I was shaving with barely even one blade, and I did not find that hairs got stuck between them which was my only concern with the design. With the power turned on, the razor went smoothly across my face, and I barely felt anything which is really what one wants when shaving. I personally don&#x27;t like to go against the grain on my neck, but the Fusion did a decent job going with the grain so I was most pleased. The single blade on the back was nice for evening out sideburn hair and getting at those pesky under-nose hairs. Lastly I felt as though the pivot motion of the blade head was even more forgiving than the predecessors which made the transition between shaving my face and shaving my neck hair even smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripes I have are its cost, but that&#x27;s obviously a supply/demand issue, and its color which is orange and quite bright. I like the blue of the Manual Fusion better, but I like the power that I get from the Power Fusion, and since color is superficial, it is hardly a big point of concern. I just wonder if Gillette intended this color to displease people so they will be enticed when they come out with the Fusion \\&quot;Nitro\\&quot; or some other color scheme!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still this is the BEST razor on the market and worthy of a buy if you are like me and don&#x27;t go through a razor head every week.</li>
    <li> It shaves your face.  You put on the shaving cream, you wet the razor, then you move the cutting surface around on your face and behold the hair is removed.  The face is shaved just as it was with three blades &amp; power, three blades &amp; no power, two blades, I even remember shaving with a single bent razor and that worked quite well.  And with all those other razors I didn&#x27;t need a second mortgage to change the razor cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of the handle, I like the battery indicator, I like the new design, but seriously the increase in the quality of the shave isn&#x27;t enough to justify the cost of the replacement cartridges.  At just under $15 for 4 pack, just under $30 for and 8 pack I&#x27;ll stick with my Turbo Mach 3 razor, where I can get 8 cartridges for $7. I&#x27;ll use the 4 cartridges I have and wait for the price to come down when Gillette comes to their senses in about six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I have it; I look forward to using it when it loses its newness on the market and the price comes down, and then I&#x27;ll be one of the cool kids.  Until then I&#x27;ll continue to put the money in that bottomless financial pit--my gas tank.</li>
    <li> I have read some of the reviews here and decided to give one of my own. I have always been a Gillette Razor user since I started to shave over 25 years ago. I have sensitive skin on my face and neck so shaving is a difficult process for me. My job prohibits beards so I need to shave every 2 days. With razors I have used in the past, with a 2 day growth,  my beard wasn&#x27;t long enough to soften the stubble so it&#x27;s like shaving sand paper. This always resulted in razor burns, nicks and cuts. Sometimes I looked like a victim of a masacre. My last razor was the Mach 3 Turbo. Very good razor but still got some nicks and cuts. Then I saw the commercial for the Fusion razor with 5 blades. My first thought was \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; It will be just like any other razor, so I was reluctant to buy it. Eventually after seeing the commercials over and over again they stated with 5 blades there is less friction on your face and it will reduce problems, I broke down and bought one- the power version. The first time I used it I had&#x27;nt shaved for a few days so I had pretty thick growth. The razor was incredible. It hugs your face like no other razor I have ever used. Even on the curves. It feels like it&#x27;s sticking to your skin. When I was finished, not one nick or cut, and no burning sensation. It was the closest shave I ever got. My face felt as smooth as silk. The real test would be 2 days later with a minimal beard growth. That&#x27;s where most of my problems occur. So here I was looking in the mirror with shaving cream on my face and the razor in my hand. I turned it on and went to work. To my surprise and delight it performed with flying colors. No nicks, cuts or burns!! At last a razor that lives up to the hype! I am sold and will use it until Gillette comes out with a 10 blade version! hehehe. Please remember, everybody&#x27;s face, skin, and beard texture is different so you may not get the same results as I did. The blades are very expensive but last a little longer than the Mach 3 blades. However for the shave I got, I&#x27;ll pay it. The one thing that takes a little getting used to is the single blade up on top. Great for shaving  under your nose or marking a sideburn line but takes some practice to use it. I cut the bottom of my nose with it the first time but have gotten the hang of it. All I can say is give this razor a try. If you don&#x27;t like it you can always go back to your old one.</li>
    <li> I conducted the classic test. I shaved one side of my face with the new Fusion power razor and the other with a Mach 3 Turbo. I had a day and a half stubble, which is my toughest shave (after that my beard soften). The shaves were nearly identical. The Mach 3 might have been a little smoother but the Fusion might have shaved a little closer. The Fusion&#x27;s straight edge single blade was helpful with my sideburns. Both give great, close, smooth shaves but I couldn&#x27;t see the advantage of one vs. the other. Since M3 is much cheaper, why switch?</li>
    <li> Becoming tired of constantly being cut by one and three blade disposable razors, and hating how electric razors ripped the hair off of my face and left rashes, I decided to try this new creation from Gilette. This razor is definitely the greatest item ever created for male hair removal. Shaving is no longer a pain anymore when I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cuts, bleeding, and irritation that used to be associated with this everyday activity. The cost of replacement blades may be a bit high, but it is well worth it for the comfort and performance that this razor offers.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I found that I got more nicks and cuts from using it. My skin would hurt from the extra friction. Stick with the MACH III. It does a great job. The Gillette Fusion is not worth the price. I used it for about a month - Now I&#x27;m back to the MACH III.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor. It &amp;#34;razes&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It works and feels right</li>
    <li> As a deployed soldier i have to shave every day and dont have the comfort of home like places to do so. These blades are the only ones that WONT cut my face or irritate it. However Amazon does not ship them to APO (military) addresses so i rate the product a 1 with there was a zero button</li>
    <li> yeah i&#x27;m sure this is a close shave blah blah blah, but seriously, i&#x27;ve used a merkur twin blade razor for 2 1/2 years now and nothing can compare... you gotta buy blades online but honestly...10 blades, for approx. 4-5 bucks, which last about 3-5 shaves or even more... i&#x27;ve spent 30 bucks on my last 2 years of shaving (including one 5 month beard growning session. yeah check the math of some of the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  one time i forgot my razor at my house on a trip and had to borrow a M3, and i couldn&#x27;t believe how difficult it was to use,it would shave about half an inch and then it slides all over the rest of your beard. it honestly takes about twice as many strokes to clean my face (mostly b/c i&#x27;m in college and i only shave when i get some good stubble. 2-5 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  granted you don&#x27;t cut yourself as much with a M3, but seriously that&#x27;s part of being a man, and if you shave everyday it reduces the chance you&#x27;ll cut yourself incredibly. so buy a $40 stainless steel merkur you&#x27;ll use for life, or just keep spending 10-15 bucks every other year on the new model disposable piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for 22 years now and shave every day.  It&#x27;s one of those things that I don&#x27;t like to do.  So when I bought this razor with its promises, I found myself waking up excited to see if the shaver was really a cut above the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used one of these battery razors but had wanted to.  The 5 blades scared me a bit too....ouch, would that really hurt!  To my surprise, and delight....the thing ROCKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a smooth shave and seems to save me time...to my surprise.  Like others have mentioned, it is a bit bigger so a bit tougher to get under the nose....but it&#x27;s doable.  The extra edge blade on the top is kind of cool...but I have only used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the three things that make this work are (1), battery vibration, (2) part under the blade that hits your skin first before the blades do....seems to lift the beard so blades cut better and, (3) five blades...5 makes a difference but the big difference is the closeness of the blades.  It seems this closeness makes it less likely that the blades cut me.  I seem to get less razor cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I can see is the cost...I have had a hard time justifying the cost of razors in the past...seem too expensive, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you try it.  By the way, shaving in the shower for 22 years...only use a mirror half the time.  Way to go.  I also highly recommend Aveeno shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette&#x27;s other blades.  Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market, and I expected the Fusion to blow me away, but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out, I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- With so many blades, I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin.  I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic, and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I wasn&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shave isn&#x27;t much better than the Mach3 Turbo.  While shaving my skin felt really smooth, but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo (no noticeable improvement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Design and look of the Fusion isn&#x27;t as slick or nice as the M3 Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Blades are no longer interchangeable.  They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back, and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The single blade on the back is useless.  It&#x27;s very hard to get the angle correct, and it barely gets anything off.  The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I plan to stick with my M3 Power.  3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face.  While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion (on the large surface area portions of my face mind you), the M3 Power just seems safer in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it&#x27;s a nice shave, but it&#x27;s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDEDt seems safer in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more like 3 1/2 stars.  Yes it&#x27;s a nice shave, but it&#x27;s not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> The way some reviewers are raving about this razor really makes me question their integrity. There is absolutely no way this is a 4- or 5-star product. I call shill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the few good things about the razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It feels very nice in hand. The \\&quot;grippies\\&quot; are in just the right place. It has a nice heft with the battery in. The size and shape fit the hand nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It looks very cool. I really like the orange and grey/silver meme that has been going through design the past few years. If anyone watches you shave, they will be impressed seeing you with this. However, I, for one, typically shave alone so this isn&#x27;t worth much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The battery level indicator is very cool and effective. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I wish everything I own that uses batteries had this indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The single blade on the back of the razor is brilliant. It&#x27;s not as effective as I&#x27;d like, but it is much better at keeping a sharp sideburn line than the five blades. I suspect the angle/ position will be worked out in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t shave any better than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Yeah, it gives a pretty close shave. But my tried and true Sensor Excel blades, the handle of which I purchased in 1996, give just as close of a shave without any of the other problems listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s very expensive. $30 for 8 cartridges?! Ridiculous. Absolutely not worth it. The Sensor Excel 8 pack is literally half the price - still more than I think they are worth - but gives a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve never had a more uncomfortable shave. The blades catch my stubble, making for a very slow shave. Yes, of course, shaving with the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of your beard reduces this problem but it still happens. Most people have swirling grain somewhere on their face. This razor makes shaving those areas very difficult and slow going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The blades have a short lifespan. I am only ableto get 3-4 shaves out of a head before the stubble-catching problem gets so bad I can&#x27;t use it. By contrast, my Sensor Excel blades easily last 7-8 shaves - about two weeks, though by the 7th or 8th shave it is catching pretty bad too. My straight edge doesn&#x27;t have this problem at all, given a quick run over the strop before each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall experience is expensive and uncomfortable and results in a mediocre shave. It is a disappointing product and not worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I was a long time user of Trac3, and also used Quattro and was impressed, but the Fusion cut me almost every time I used it. I liked the single blade for those hard to get at spots, but that feature could not overcome the difficulty of keeping my face free of little cuts.</li>
    <li> well well well, i&#x27;ve been on a long search to find the perfect razor and read tons of reviews on every razor out there.  first off, a lot of people are judging this razor very unfairly because they&#x27;re mad about the price of blades.  well, that&#x27;s life.  there&#x27;s a site on the net where you can buy cryogenically frozen blades at about the same price that supposedly last 4 times as long.  they&#x27;re a great business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon overall gives the fusion mixed reviews, and i&#x27;ve found the fusion to be a mixed bag.  first, the design.  i loved the mach 3 design and the gillette fusion continues that.  it&#x27;s definitely a better way to shave than with the old designs.  also, the handle on the fusion is insanely comfortable.  it&#x27;s SO comfortable, it&#x27;s almost as if the handle has a life of its own!  it&#x27;s crazy.  way better than any other razor handle ever.  the design is mostly like the mach 3 except with 2 blades.  contrary to what you have heard, the head is NOT much bigger than the mach 3.  in fact, the blades start from the top at the SAME point.  i didn&#x27;t have trouble shaving under my nose or anywhere else.  the total blade area is slightly larger than the mach 3 which is a GOOD thing.  this + 5 blades &#x3D; a faster shave.  add the battery \\&quot;power\\&quot; feature to this, and you&#x27;re basically shaving with lightning!  you HAVE to try the power feature.  it&#x27;s amazing.. it eliminates tugging.  it slices right through facial hair.  absolutely brilliant.  it&#x27;s no gimmick, believe me.  also, the blades do NOT get more clogged, another lie.  in fact, these blades get LESS clogged than any razor i&#x27;ve ever used.  one other thing - the single-blade trimmer on the back is far from \\&quot;useless.\\&quot;  it&#x27;s incredibly useful and does exactly what you need.  it&#x27;s innovative and an improvement over the mach 3.  so with all this brilliance, what could go wrong, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;razor burn.  the same problem i had with the mach 3!!  i would lift my cheek up and see little razor burn all along it, and get razor burn on one part of my neck.  that wasn&#x27;t too bad, until around the 6th or 7th shave, when it suddenly tore up my neck with razor burn!!  now, you may say i used the blade too long.  however, there&#x27;s no good way to tell when the razor is going to cause you problems.  the lubrication strip wears out too fast, on like the third shave but the blades are still sharp.  so i kept using it, still getting close fast shaves and one day it cut me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shave itself - the fusion definitely does give a closer shave than the mach 3, particularly if you use the power feature and a great shaving gel (in my case, king of shaves magna gel ARB formula).  however, it seems to get \\&quot;too\\&quot; close in a way.  my face would itch.  i&#x27;d look in the mirror and see a kind of film over my skin, apparently skin that had been shaved off.  not cool!!  i would use the fusion if my skin could handle it..  maybe i will try using it without the power feature and see if that helps.  the power is so fast &amp; fun to use that it&#x27;s addictive.  but i&#x27;m afraid i may be doomed to using razors older than the mach 3...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor if you dont consider the price. If you are looking to pay this much, I highly recomend the Mach 3 over this razor.</li>
    <li> I have used both the powered version and the unpowered version. I like the shaves I get from both, but the design on the blade head is bad. I dont know why I am the only one commenting on it, but I seem to break the connection between the body and the head 40% of the time before I need to replace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have broken it by both banging the body against the side of the sink to clear out the hair, by dropping the razor into the sink, and by packing it in an shave kit and traveling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very delicate razor that is very expensive.</li>
    <li> Truth be told, the shave isn&#x27;t horrific. It gets reasonably close and is pretty smooth until you find it is time to replace the cartridge. This is where you hit a brick wall. $26.00 for a pack of cartridges is really one of the more ludacris ideas I&#x27;ve heard in a while. I get just as good a shave with a Bic disposable single blade so five blades really isn&#x27;t better. Hell, THREE blades is unecessary (and two can be downright painful). I have purchased a Mercur safety razor which I think will hold me over for a good forty years as it is a tried and true antiquity, is a single blade, and the said blades cost like a buck for ten at Longs (standard double edge). Horrendous value cartridge-wise and not really a terribly good shave to boot. I really should probably have given it a one star, but hey, it works. If you&#x27;re under eighteen, wait &#x27;till they send you a free promotional one (they most likely will). If you&#x27;re over, I highly recomend you stray from this series. If you like Gillette, get the Good Ol&#x27; Mach tres. Or, go smart, frugal (and coincidentally eco friendly), and purchase a safety razor.  Good hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Great Gonzo</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Power razor resulted in a very poor shaving experience. It definitely didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave, nor did it make me feel manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never cut myself shaving until I used this razor. Fortunately, vibrating action means you can&#x27;t even feel the razor&#x27;s five blades cutting you simultaneously. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two or three shaves, and the head needs to be replaced. Pathetic. I get more use out of cheap disposable razors.</li>
    <li> this is basically the same razor they have been putting out for the past several years, there is really nothing new except one more blade and it vibrates.next they will be raveing about the latest and greatest 20 blade razor when all you need is some good cream and an old fashioned straight or a double edged. i own a fusion but only use it when i have no other choice but the wepon of choice is a tried and true vintage 1960&#x27;s gillete double edged the cost is higher to start but in the long run the savings cost will more than outweigh the usage of this over hyped [...].</li>
    <li> I have used twin blade razors all my life, never got into the three blade hype as I found them a little expensive. I hated shaving every other day as I found the shave quite uncomfortable. But with my ever increasing stubble, I wanted to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this one at Kroeger and decided to give it a try. I was very impressed with the shave, it was very smooth and much more comfortable than any two blade razor. What was most impressive was it cut far less than the other razors. The turbo option doesnt really improve the shaving experience though and so I shave without the turbo power. I do have to shave on the same spots again but I do not feel any discomfort as compared to the other razors. The trimming blade too is useful especially when working on the sideburns and underneath the neck, but it takes some time to figure out the \\&quot;correct\\&quot; way of holding the handle in this position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, all good things have a price and this one might be too expensive in the long run. I will have to see how many shaves my blades last to get the economics right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you are still stuck with two blades and want to move to better options, I highly recommend this razor if you can afford the blades in the long run. But give it a try and see the difference !</li>
    <li> Well my personal opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I had to put extra force with fusion compared to M3Power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Shave not closer than M3. I even doubt if it matches M3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Under-nose area is usually the one which doesn&#x27;t get a clean shave due to these now-a-days wide blades. After shaving my under-nose area with fusion with regular 5 blade side, I tried to see if the side blade can make it any better. BUT....sorry gillette guys.. but I dont think even a single hair was cut.</li>
    <li> I shaved off my beard for this razor, shelved the electric razor, and find myself passing my hands over my chin in amazement several times in the course of the day. The five-blade Fusion is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Fact is, you might want to take out some extra insurance on the esophagus. Close means *very* close in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about an economy that spins out choices like a five-blade razor is that you don&#x27;t *have* to buy it. Gillette&#x27;s earlier products will clean you up just fine, not to mention comparable razors and blades manufactured by the Other Guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want close to mean &#x27;as close as it currently gets&#x27;, you might want to invest in the Fusion (a small investment) and the replacement blades (a large one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have often suffered an irritated face while shaving with a blade, one of the reasons I moved to a beard and an electric shaver some years ago. But so far, in the thick of the Midwestern winter, I have yet to feel any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery-powered, chip-driven gizmo may be overkill, I must admit. I seem to get as good a shave from the Fusion with the power off as with the little hummer humming away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Factor in the cost of the blades. Then, if you still want a shave as close as it gets, the Fusion would be the thing.</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviewers before me, I bought this almost as soon it came out. It actually shaves pretty well, though I must confess, I do use the gel and after shave. However I only shaved with the grain, because going against it, would usually leave me razor burn. Especially when I&#x27;d forget to shave a day or 4. Also going with the grain you wouldn&#x27;t get as smooth a feel as you would going against. Then, out of pure curiousity, I used, according to what the reviewers before me said, the seldom used single blade on the back, to go against the grain. Wahla! It gave me the smooth shave I wanted, and even when I&#x27;d forgoe shaving for a couple days, I have yet to receive any razor burn. Give it a try, and that 2 star shave becomes a 4. By the way, I gave it a 4, becuase it just so damn expensive, buying the new cartridges, and shave gel. Yet here I am going to the store anyway.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:  I&#x27;ve used the Mach III for my barely-less-hairy-than-an-ape face since it came out in the early-90&#x27;s.  The Mach III served me well, but the head kept coming off, the result of dropping it about 4 dozen too many times.  I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user for a couple of decades, now, but I&#x27;m open to anything which works.  Hint:  I consider any electric, as much as I&#x27;d like to have one, useless.  I&#x27;ve had a few, it was a waste of money for me, but my friends got exceptionally good hand-me-downs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was *ULTRA-SKEPTICAL* about a 5-bladed razor, *especially* a \\&quot;powered\\&quot; one.  I mean, my triple-bladed beast was still cranking along, and after 15+ years, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to having my facial hair more pulled out than cut.  It&#x27;s a genentic thing not many people seem to suffer from, which is good for the greater population.  Put it this way, I have &#x27;5 o-clock shadow by 10 AM&#x27;.  It&#x27;s not a good thing.  If I skip shaving for 36 hours, I start to look like a psycho-drifter who has been on the road for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I sprung for the powered version, figuring I could use all the help I could get.  Shockingly, no pun intended, the shave was not only *amazingly* close, but I didn&#x27;t have the typical 2-5 cuts from having a new blade.  To make matters better, I mananged to have even sideburns for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in Vegas about a year and the mid-to-late-70&#x27;s fat Elvis has started to transchannel my sideburns.  Not mutton-chops...yet, but they&#x27;re obvious.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after not my first, but third powered-Fusion shave, about six hours after shaving (at which point I&#x27;d ususally give my wife a rash if I gave her more than a peck on the cheek) I said to her, \\&quot;hey, feel my chin.\\&quot;  I got an immediate \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot;  It&#x27;s so nice to look normal for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are downsides.  Blades are stupidly expensive and don&#x27;t seem to last more than a week, but the behavior was similar with my Mach III.  I&#x27;ve considered having aton of cartridges treated with near absolute zero cold, as that appears to help longevity, but have never gotten around to it.</li>
    <li> The two blade razors made by Gillette gave a much more comfortable shave than this razor.</li>
    <li> This is the first razor that did not make me bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did have a hard time with my facial hair, but that is nothing new - those other crappy razors that I tried in the past always did, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money. Expensive cartridges, though.</li>
    <li> My father has had all kinds of razors, including fancy electric ones that sit in a bath of cleaner fluid. After having used the fancy expensive ones, he says this razor is the best! Closest shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> I have used the Mach 3 for many years, and have no complaints.  Good shave.  However, the Fusion is even better.  Smooth &amp; close shave.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor brand and model for many years and been very satisfied. Recently I purchased a replacement through Amazon because on my old one the on and off switch malfunctioned. However it gave me 15+ years of service.  The razor is well made, gives a clean, easy shave with no nicks or cuts. Battery and blade life are excellent. It also has a color band on the blade that alerts you to when the blade needs replacing.  The only concern I have which is the same for similar competitor products is the cost of the replacement blades seems high. However they do last a long time and generics are available at a reduced price.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, who practically bald. He has to shave his head as well as his face &amp; neck though, and this razor seems to be the one that is most comfortable to use for both purposes. It&#x27;s a little pricey at stores and the price found here is much less expensive. The free prime shipping is an extra bonus.</li>
    <li> well, well, well, I received it for my fianc&amp;eacute; he need it but u can buy this at target anywhere its works but I guess they need to lower the price</li>
    <li> Among other things my wife got me a Gillette Fusion battery operated razor for Xmas.  It has the best of both worlds, three blades on one side and a single blade on the other for hard to get at places.  If you shave you really ought to treat yourself to one of these.</li>
    <li> For shaving closeness, more is better . . . more blades that is.  I have a heavy beard and have carried a slight shadow for most of my adult life (particularly in the afternoons).  No more.  I was initially skeptical about the abundance of gadgets here - five(!) blades, a battery, a single \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; blade, lubri-strips, and who knows what else, but this thing really, really works.  I do not understand the purpose of the vibrating feature, but to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t cut me to ribbons, and does indeed seem to have the effect of cutting closer.  There is no substitute for the right shave cream (I use a product called King of Shaves), but the lubricating strip on the Fusion adds quite a bit of \\&quot;slick\\&quot; on its own.  I have never had a closer shave, and cannot imagine one.  I have had professional straight razor shaves at that barber, and have come home to let the Fusion finish the job.  Yes, the razors are \\&quot;price of oil\\&quot; expensive, but I find that they last a loooooong time (maybe 2 weeks out of each?), and actually improve with use (they work better with a little seasoning).  I also own a Schick Quattro by the way, and the Gillette smokes it.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Power Men&#x27;s Razor With 1 Razor Blade Refill And 1 Battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED ITEM IN THE LAST CONSIGNMENT I RECEIVED FROM AMAZON WAS DISAPPOINTING. WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT OUT OF THE FIVE ITEMS ABOVE MENTIONED ITEM WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL PROPER PACKING. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT SOMEONE OPENED THE PACKAGE TO SEE THE PRODUCT KEPT INSIDE AND I AM NOT SURE THAT THIS IS A USED ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ITEM I BOUGHT WAS FOR SOMEONE AS GIFT. VERY DISAPPOINTING. HOPE AMAZON I WILL TAKE CARE IN THE FUTURE CONSIGNMENTS.</li>
    <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. The battery lasts at least six with daily use. My only criticism with this razor is it is difficult to clean when soap scum builds up. There are a lot of nooks and crannies that are hard to get to. Overall, this is a superior razor and a great value. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Only one detail: both the razor itself, as the gel stick should last a little longer. For the rest, are well gentle with the face (if new or almost new they are).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Fusion a couple times now, and the shave is NOT as close as my old Mach 3. After I finish shaving I look like I have an afternoon shadow.  I do have thick, dark facial hair, so this may not be a problem for all.  In addition, I found the single blade on the back relatively useless as I was able to trim my sideburns and under my nose with the five-blade side. So far, I am not impressed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product from the moment I saw it. I purchased a M3 Power razor about a year ago and had little complaint with it, the biggest complaint I had was that the button on the handle was in a bad position, mainly the space that I like to grip the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it seems, the new generation of Gillette suffers from even more problems than the previous generation. The button is still in that same godforsaken place. On top of that, the downstroke, or rather, the stroke with the grain is almost completely worthless. I will admit, it didn&#x27;t grab the stubble or tear at my face, and it was a smooth stroke, exactly like the previous generation, but it left a horrendous amount of stubble. The cause of this I believe to be the huge blue buffer pad on the bottom edge of the blade. Even the new blade on the back end of the razor is practically useless. It cuts even worse than the ones on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can say about this is the redesign of the handle. Unlike the M3 Power, you can use your index finger up higher on the handle if you so choose to but your continuously pressing against it and bumping the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion would have to be that this is a subpar razor for a radically outragous price. $14 for the Razor, $14 for 4 replacements, and $30+ after tax for 8 replacements. It seems like Gillette was more concerned about getting as much money out of your pockets as they could than they were about designing a better razor. I will be returning to using the M3 Power, if only to save myself time whilst shaving.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;soothing Micropulses&amp;#34; were much stronger than I expected, leading me to think that this product was the result of a drunken dare between two marketing executives to convince men to hold a woman&#x27;s sex toy to their faces every morning. The vibrations made it impossible to sense the resistance I would normally use to guide my shaving strokes. I got cleaner results with the un-powered 5-blade razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had this conspiracy theory that when Gillette indroduces a new razor they dull the previous model&#x27;s blades just a little bit.  Oh well, on to the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really cannot tell a difference in the quality of shave between the Fusion and the M3.  I agree with another reviewer, if all things are apparently equal why spend the extra money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback to the Fusion is that it is hard to clean thick shaving cream out of it.  I&#x27;m not talking about a thick layer of cream, but the cream itself being thick.  I use Zirh shaving cream, which is incredibly thick, but that is what I like about it.  Even the thinnest coat applied to my face seems to clog the Fusion up and I have a hell of a time cleaning the shaving cream out.  I suppose this is simply due to the closeness of the blades.  Either way it annoys me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up...sure it&#x27;s a good razor, but it seems more novelty than anything else.  The M3 is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I have only one criteria for any razor -- that it give me a close shave in the shower without cutting me. It&#x27;s amazing how few razors meet this criteria. The new unpowered Gillette Fusion razor does this better than the older Gillette model it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, my beard tends to outgrow razors. I can live with one for a few years and then, suddenly, I find it no longer gives me a close shave. That&#x27;s when I know it&#x27;s time to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s different with Fusion is I need hardly any effort to remove facial hair and don&#x27;t need much pressure from the hand or wrist. Just get the thing on my face and move it and it does the job even on my chin, under my nose, off my jawbone and in those other spots where lines are hardly flat or straight. The razor has another cutting edge on the back you can use for straight cuts to sideburns or elsewhere,  if you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut myself a few times the first time I used Fusion and was concerned the five cutting edges may be too much for me. But I quickly adjusted by releasing the pressure in my shaving hand and now take a close shave sans cuts for granted every morning of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergo, this razor meets my only criteria expertly. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that wants what I want, a close shave without cuts.</li>
    <li> The Fusion is a great razor.  Closer shave than the Mach 3, and less irritation under the neck.  Here&#x27;s a tip that will save you much money.  I used to get only about 2 weeks works of shaves on the Mach 3.  Years ago, I read an article in Fortune magazine that you can extend the life of a blade by spraying the product \\&quot;Clean Shower\\&quot; (by Arm and Hammer) after each use.  As a result, I now get 2 months of shaves per blade on both the Mach 3 and now the Fusion.  Really helps since the cost of Fusion blades are so high.</li>
    <li> lets just say fusion power is better than mach3 power. leaves a smoother and cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about since it started selling. I use the Power Fusion version for my face since it gets rid of facial hair so much easier than using the manual one. All you have to do is put on adequate amount of gillette gel on your face (all types of gels for selection) including on your side-burn, turn on the power, and run it through your face just one time. I get the closest shave ever, and my hair grows fast. So I do this about 2 to 3 times a day.</li>
    <li> Updated 29-Jan-2009.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several months, after waiting to hear from others just how well it works.  I have a fairly tough turf, shaving only MWF, resting on the weekends.  Up until this point, I liked Sensor Excel best, and detest every electric unit I&#x27;ve tried. Since I really like the razor, I was surprised by some of the low rankings. I use Edge gel with extra lubricants, and I shave in the shower (yes, these things make a huge difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Blade life appears improved over my Sensor Excel&lt;br /&gt;-Vibrating handle not a gimmick, works well once you get used to it. Initially I found a lack of my normal \\&quot;feel\\&quot; when shaving, but quickly adapted&lt;br /&gt;-A beefy well-weighted handle with a secure seal for the battery.  Other razors have popped apart with the blade flying off on me if I dropped them, but not this one.  My Sensor Excel was notorious for this.&lt;br /&gt;-Large blade \\&quot;eject button\\&quot; is nice, yet doesn&#x27;t let the blade pop off prematurely (see above)&lt;br /&gt;-The \\&quot;hole\\&quot; in the handle head is great! I have a wire rack that holds my shampoo and soap.  This same rack has a few \\&quot;hangers\\&quot; that this razor slides onto nicely&lt;br /&gt;-Very good battery life (still on the first one months later)&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic holder has a bigger \\&quot;foot\\&quot; to stay upright better and it&#x27;s easier to see at a glance how many blades that I have left due to the clear sides, a feature that my Sensor lacks&lt;br /&gt;-On/off button flashes when battery gets low... hard to miss and allows you to get a least one shave&lt;br /&gt;-Best for last: a very close shave on a very tough face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-Razor head is large, single blade on the back is a good idea and is sharp, but I can&#x27;t seem to make it work as good as it sounds. It&#x27;s a first generation idea that I am hoping gets some refinement.&lt;br /&gt;-Price... Ouch! Fewer blades per pack AND much more expensive. Buy in bulk, look for sales, save coupons&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic tray is much larger than my Sensor yet holds fewer spare blades (4).&lt;br /&gt;-Old blades from Sensor are not compatible with Fusion (you can mitigate this problem by taking your old shaver to work for those embarrassing days when you miss a small spot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Recommended if you&#x27;ve got a rough face! Doing it all over again, I would buy it again.  Also, I recommend that you try different gels, shaving in the shower, different shaver brands as each face is different and Fusion is pricy.</li>
    <li> I got one of these due to some rave reviews and finding I was traveling and had no razor.  First impressions meet all the rave reviews - and I did not get the snagging of others.  A slightly better shave than unpowered fusion or mach 3 but OK.  I have now had the battery run out.  Razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  Check battery - not down in power but swap for new one - razor runs for 5 seconds with flashing light then stops.  That&#x27;s it - I now have an unpowered fusion with a thicker handle for several $ more.  I doubt I will spend the $ required for more cartridges I can buy a new mach3 and blades for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;This is a disposable razor masquerading as a real razor - I wondered why many stores here were not selling the cartridges.</li>
    <li> This product ruins the classic Gillette name.  Who really needs five blades on a razor?  I have coarse facial hair and the last thing I want is five blades scrapping my face at the same time.  Even when I shave very careful and go with the grain, I get very painful ingrown hairs and razor bumps. I won&#x27;t even start on the price Gillette charges for this razor and its cartridges...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tossed this razor and now use a \\&quot;old school\\&quot; safety razor, the razor that made Gillette a household name.  I get a much closer and more comfortable shave.  Gillette, now owned by Procter and Gamble, definitely isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  I gave this product two stars instead of one simply because those with finer facial hair may have better luck with this product than I had.</li>
    <li> If you like hacking your face and throwing your money away, by all means, this is the razor for you. I wasted hundreds of dollars on cartridges through the years on this piece of garbage, and I now wonder why. Why did I spend morning after morning after morning carving my face, wasting 20, 30, 40 minutes with numerous band-aids or styptic pencils trying in vain to stop the blood from flowing onto my clothes? Why did I believe Gillette&#x27;s fraudulent commercials claiming more blades equaled a better shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the money I wasted on this terrible product, I could have bought at least five years&#x27; worth of double edged razor blades, or I could have bought an excellent straight razor, strop and hone. But no, I was suckered. NEVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Expensive electric razors, no matter how fancy they are, always make my neck look like sausage pizza when I&#x27;m done.  Manual razors, especially disposable ones, are more effective for me, but with my skin as sensitive as it is, I&#x27;m usually decorating my face with little bits of tissue when I&#x27;m through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, I get the best of all worlds.  With 5 blades, it&#x27;s hard to miss a spot, and it takes less time overall to get the job done.  The vibrating gives it an extra \\&quot;kick\\&quot; and makes the shave more effective.  The best part is that there is virtually no sign of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are having trouble using this razor against 2- or 3-day-old beards, just be patient and let the razor (and its vibrations) do the work.  Pull your skin so the part you&#x27;re shaving is good and tight and the stubble is separated as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives me, by far, the closest shave ever, and with no irritation.</li>
    <li> This razor is very overrated. I purchased the razor with one cartrige and three replacement cartriges.  I shaved once a day for one week. I was extremely dissapointed.  I went back to the Mach 3 turbo and I returned the three extra cartriges.  The Fusion power shaver went into the trash.  Please share this review with Gillette.  Give them my e-mail address, I would like to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, D Hatch</li>
    <li> It shaves well I just dont think the high price of the blades justifies the price.  I dont know that my shave is any better than a razor blade that Gillette made 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel Simkhai</li>
    <li> This product is really good. Being of African descent it&#x27;s hard to shave and not get razor bumps but the GILLETTE FUSION POWER RAZOR left me with no razor bumps what so ever. I&#x27;m not sure of the motor makes any difference but it&#x27;s cool anyways</li>
    <li> I have always been a Gillette razor kind of man, and I am currently using the regular Gillette Fusion Pro Glide non power, so I was very excited to try the power version and my opinion is.....wonderful!! It is exactly the same razor but the power moves the skin and let&#x27;s the shave get even closer!! I waited 2 extra days to shave!! Thank you!! #gotitfree #bzzagent #gillette</li>
    <li> I chose five stars because this razor is a very decent one. It leaves your face with a clean close cut shave. You don&#x27;t have to shave every day to just keep the stubble off your face. The battery lasts a long time and the blade doesn&#x27;t have to be changed too often either. I loved this razor and use it all the time now! This is the new go to razor when I need a to shave! I got my razor free by being a bzzagent!</li>
    <li> This is the third &amp;#34;Fusion Power&amp;#34; Razor I&#x27;ve purchased. They have worked like a charm for me. I don&#x27;t know if the vibratory action really helps, but I get a close shave with no nicks. I have a light beard, so I can get a couple of weeks worth of shaves out of a cartridge.</li>
    <li> For the first time in my long life I can shave without pain, cuts, and effort.</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor. Attacks big hairy problems with ease.</li>
    <li> I’m posting this same review for two of my recently purchased products:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032ANCUU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4 and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUW8WM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad always, ALWAYS used an electric shaver.  Ever since I was a child I could not stand the rough stubble feel and vowed I would never, EVER use an electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m nearing 60 years old.  I have tested and tried many various razors and shave creams/gels.  In my some 45 years of shaving I have never, ever found a better, closer, more comfortable shave than by using the two products linked above.&lt;br /&gt;____&lt;br /&gt;Additional….  Daily, I listen to a lot of talk radio.  Due to incessant advertising I decided to spend ten bucks testing “Harry’s” introduction offer.  A waste of $10.</li>
    <li> It shaves!  but out of some odd reason, refills are far from being free... the Gilette business structure at work</li>
    <li> This is the third one he&#x27;s owned.  They do last a long time before they die, though.  He&#x27;s tried others, but none take the place of this power razor.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion Power Men&#x27;s Razor to try free from Gillette. With this razor and all it&#x27;s features I get the closest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I like the way it glides smoothly over my face with the micro pulses and the precision trimmer on the other side, the 5 blades and comfort strip. This by far is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever tried. No irritation just a smooth comfy shave. It stores easily, and let&#x27;s you know when the battery is getting low and the comfort strip let&#x27;s you know when it&#x27;s time to change the cartridge refill.</li>
    <li> Gillette, I just don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;Does shaving have to be this complicated and expensive?&lt;br /&gt;5 blades, a battery, $15 for the razor, $30 refills.  This should have been the shave of a lifetime.  Unfortunately, it was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary Fusion from Gillette to try, so the price was right for me.  Thank you Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning following receipt, I installed the battery and was ready for shaving excellence. Standard lather, press the battery button for the vibration, and shaved as I normally would.  The shave was &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; - close, no cuts....  but not what I was expecting.  I was expecting &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; to go with it&#x27;s price tag, it&#x27;s 5 blades, it&#x27;s battery powered vibration et al.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I didn&#x27;t feel the shave to be much better than the disposal single blade shave.  It should have been a ton better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a second opinion, my wife tried it on her legs that same day.  She raved about it stating it was a super close shave with no cuts.  The next day she tried it again, stating that the shave was not near as close as the previous day.  Neither of us have used it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my bottom line:  I&#x27;m a simple guy who just wants a simple, close, inexpensive shave.  I don&#x27;t feel we need 5 blades, we don&#x27;t need a battery to vibrate it, and we don&#x27;t need to spend this money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is a great company with great products, this one just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> When I received this razor from Gillette to review I must admit I was skeptical of the advantage of the battery power. I had been using a Gillette three blade disposable razor so figured the extra blades themselves would provide a better shave. I decided to do a test for a week of shaving. I shaved one side of my face with the razor turned on and one side with it turned off. The side shaved with the razor on was noticeably smoother immediately after shaving! As the day progressed, this become less noticeable, but I think that would be expected.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day for work and this one really does the job.  Much better than expected.  Nice clean shave thanks to the five blades and the power option.</li>
    <li> I received The Gillette Fusion razor for free and this razor gave me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time, if not the best shave ever.  The vibration while shaving seems to provide a better and closer shave with no razor burn or cuts.  I really like the 5 blades too.  The cartridges are pretty unique as well.  They go on pretty easy and stay on very secure.  I would highly recommend thjs product.</li>
    <li> I like the Gillette Fusion Power Men&#x27;s Razor but I didn&#x27;t love it. I like the vibration on my face, it made for a smoother shave but it didn&#x27;t get as close as I thought it would. I would use the razor again but it is not my first choice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product for the overprice and for the itchiness I now have because of it. This isn&#x27;t necessarily exclusive to just blade razors, I&#x27;ve had other brands in the past and they were better. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t buy a pack of blades with it. I was close to doing that actually.</li>
    <li> Today I received and tested the Power Fusion(PF)by Gillette. At first glance the razor stood out for its orange/silver/grey color scheme, which was a plus compared to my black/grey Gillette Mach 3(M3). Although I have to say that might be the only thing I preferred over my trusty M3! The product in itself isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just the fact to me that it didn&#x27;t really offer a big difference to the M3.&lt;br /&gt;  First off, there was no noticeable difference in shave when compared to the M3 despite the fact the the PF sports two more blades than the M3.&lt;br /&gt;  The PF is a bit bulkier as well, which is not that big of a negative. I understand it&#x27;s to compensate for the battery which  gives the PF its vibrating motion. My issue is that the vibrations didn&#x27;t make for a smoother shave compared to the M3, so what&#x27;s the point of it other than to give my face a massage while I shave?&lt;br /&gt;  I really wanted to like the razor cartridge with its single razor on the reverse side for precision trimming but it really isn&#x27;t that effective. It&#x27;s good for blocking off your sideburns but the angle of the blade makes it difficult to do any type of detail to your facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;  Lastly price of the cartridges is the main factor on why I rate this product low. For a shave similar to the M3 you are going to pay nearly double the price for the PF cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall the PF is inferior when compared to the M3. It&#x27;ll give you no difference in shave at a higher cost to use, it&#x27;s definitely not worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, when I saw this razor came with batteries, I was put off.  I could not imagine rubbing vibrating blades against my skin, and I was sure I would end up bleeding out all over the floor.  In fact, it sat on my bathroom counter for almost a week before I got up the nerve to use it.  (And by nerve, I mean my wife made me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by this razor.  Not only did I not slice my face to ribbons, the razor was seemed to float effortlessly over my skin.  Not one tug along the hairs, not one nick of the skin, and my face felt smooth and silky afterwards.  This is a great razor.  It</li>
    <li> I was able to use the Gillette fusion power razor and it was awesome. My face felt so smooth and didn&#x27;t get many nicks or cuts. I would recommend this Gillette fusion power razor to my friends. Thanks Gillette for making a great razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old Gillette razor for a long while now. I was elated when I received the Gillette Fusion Power to test for free. I usually become very dedicated to a single product and will use it for years until someone makes me try something different, so I was a little uneasy trying something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is sleek and has an easy hold design. The vibrating takes a bit to get used to if you are familiar with a stationary razor. The size of the handle fits perfectly into your hand and makes guiding the razor simple and efficient.</li>
    <li> If I hadn&#x27;t received this razor as a trial I never would have bought a razor with a vibrating function. I was of the opinion that it would not be worth the extra money to purchase such a razor because I did not think it would be any better. Well after spending a month using one I can say that there is a difference. I have tried to use this razor in a wide variety of scenarios to see how it works and I must say that the vibration makes it the best razor I have ever used when I don&#x27;t have good shaving cream. I know this is not a scenario that most usually shave in, but occasionally we all are stuck and have run out. Due to the vibrations I did not feel like I was ripping the hairs out of my skin while shaving with nothing more than water put on my face. It even gave a really close shave with no razor burn. I don&#x27;t know how long the vibrating feature will last, but I have used it daily for a month and have not had a need to consider replacing it (It uses AAA). I have used it in the shower a number of times with no ill effects (everything is sealed up as it should be). One thing that is nice on the razor head (not sure if others now have this, but it is a nice feature) is that they have included a single blade edge touchup razor on the end. To use it you flip the razor around and can straighten out your sideburns with a single blade so you can get a nice clean edge everytime. They must have spent some time working on the angles as it seems to be set correctly to use it without cutting a chunk of your skin off. Overall I have been impressed with this razor. I had been using an electric razor for the past few years because of the convenience, but I think I am now switching back to a manual blade since I get such a better shave with it.</li>
    <li> I have twice not just nicked myself, but lain my chin open with this razor! First, I am not a complainer or nutcase - I am a 58 year old businessman who needed a new razor and had a coupon. I bought the 5-blade Fusion vibrating razor for that reason only - I had a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Gillette has apparently figured out, 5 blades is a dumb idea because it is so wide you can&#x27;t negotiate those tight places around the nose, etc. To account for this - rather than addressing the actual problem they added a single \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; blade to the opposite side. Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can not remember the last time I actually CUT myself with a razor until this razor came along.  Twice in transitioning from my neck to chin I have managed to drag the trimmer blade across my chin laying it open the entire width of the blade!  Not a nick, mind you, but a freakin&#x27; wound!  Sure, I could continue to use it and just \\&quot;be more careful\\&quot; but that would be wrong. There are too many better products on the market for me to make allowances for crappy and dangerous design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two major cuts in the same spot and I now have an actual scar.  Just thought you&#x27;d want to know.</li>
    <li> Call me a skeptic. A critical thinker if you will. Wary of profit margin mentalities in the marketplace. But about a year ago I decided to test razors. Everything I could get my hands on. Even vintage razors from the early 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to like this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it along with its Mach 3 cousins are damn good razors. Easily the best I&#x27;ve handled. And anybody that says it isn&#x27;t is either crazy, or is being disingenuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are 5 blades really necessary (is a Cadillac necessary compared to a Dodge Neon)? Get what you pay for I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best, smoothest shave on planet earth with minimum irritation and you don&#x27;t want to spend more time in the bathroom tending to your face than your wife? Then this is your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to shave with a piece of flint, save a few bucks and thumb your nose at the system? Not my problem. Will lesser razors shave your face? Yep, especially if you like nicks, cuts, razor burn, multiple passes, shaving against the grain, re-shaving, $20 shaving creams, $80 shave brushes, pre-shave oils, soothing aftershaves, witch hazel, styptic sticks, hanging out on internet forums wondering what you&#x27;re doing wrong, etc... And if you can find the economy in that, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention this razors performance in more private areas? Nothing even comes close. And electric personal groomers are poor in performance by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cost, for me this is a non-issue. I can get months out of one cartridge relatively easily and with a little common sense that seems abundant out here in the woods, less so in the city. Therefore, this and other razors of its type (Mach 3 innovation) are no more expensive to me than a &#x27;classic&#x27; double edged razor which I have as well. It stays in the drawer mostly. But easily accessible if I suddenly need to go back in time, or I care to remember why at one time most men grew beards.</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette razor free and was excited after using the proglide version for sometime now.  Both seem to give the same result but this one feels more like an electric shaver with the mess of shaving cream.  I use both an electric and the Gillette Proglide so really did see the benefit of this version over the Proglide version.  But as with all Gillette razors I really like the shave they provide over other brands.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;m sorry for the name on this review our account has my wife&#x27;s name first. For my birthday back in April I got a one blade razor that was suppose to be comparable to getting a shave with a single blade at the barbers shop. I have been attempting to use this razor with good results, thats when I don&#x27;t cut the crap out of myself! When I received this razor in the mail from buzzagent I was looking foward to trying it. I was hoping for better results that my single blade experience. I like the way the razor felt in my hand. The rubber grips are nice because I know that I will have a good grib on it while shaving. I like how the head has some movement to it, and the single blade on the back for better precision on my side burns. Overall I like the razor a lot. It has a very close shave and left my face smooth. I would recommend the product. The reason I did not give it five stars though is the price. Razors have become way to expensive.</li>

    <li> I recieved the Fusion Power Razor for Free Thanks to Gillette and have been using it for a bout a week now. The razor is light in weight wich i was not expecting,the micro pulses seems to help to achieve a closer shave and keep my skin from getting irritated like it does from my usual Razor. I also enjoy the Precision Trimmer on the backside to get the tricky spot under the nose. The function of the Low Battery light is a added bonus,i will definitely be keeping this one around for a while.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this razor. The handle was comfortable, and very easy to add the battery to it. It was easy to adapt to the vibrating feature, it reminded me of using an electric razor. Got it for free from Gillette</li>
    <li> So far I have shaved my face twice with this razor. I wanted to use it at least two times before I wrote my first review so I can compare both shaves. I am avid user for the Gillette Fusion proguide so when I had the change to try the Gillette Fusion power thanks to Gillette, I was thrilled for this chance. For the over all razor I give it 4 stars. I am not sure I completely understand what all of the added benefits should be by having a power manual razor but here is what I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;1. When shaving with the fusion power the sensation of having the razor vibrat distracted me from normal feelings you get from shaving. I didn&#x27;t feel it as bad when a hair got caught/tugged. The vibration made it feel like I was tingling vs cutting the hair off my face.&lt;br /&gt;2. It took about the same amount of time to shave, so I didn&#x27;t fly over it like you can with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;3. I did notice that the handle was longer which did give me better grip while I was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;4. I did end up with razor burn on one side of my face the first time I shaved with it. I do not know if the razor burn was from adjusting to the new style of razor or will be a common occurrence moving forward. I will review this further as I use this razor more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the blades I give them 3 starts. I don&#x27;t see anything new or improved with these blades. I have shaved 2 times and the first time my facial hair was very short (I had shaved 2 days prior) and there was no issues minus a little razor burn. I had a close shave, no catching of the blade and it felt like a regular razor. However by my 2nd shave my facial hair was a little bit longer (I hadn&#x27;t shaved 3 or 4 days this time) and my razor blade felt like it was becoming dull while I was shaving with it. It was catching the hair and pulling it more and the shave in the end didn&#x27;t feel as close. I am used to getting many many shaves from my regular proguide fusion razor so to me this was a bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you Gillette Fusion for letting me try this new razor for free via bzz agent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years! I love it! Very flexible as well.</li>
    <li> Best razors.. my Italian hairy wife uses it and I don&#x27;t feel her hairy legs for a few days... Close shave.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. It gets a good close shave. The blade lasts along time I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and the blade isn&#x27;t dull yet. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Loved the handle.</li>
    <li> We received this as a free sample to try from Gillette. I liked the way I was able to grip it and the smooth shave. After several times of shaving it didn&#x27;t shave as smooth as my electric razor, although I did still like it. I was shocked when I went to see how much this razor was in the store. If I had some good coupons I would probably purchase, but I don&#x27;t think I would pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> This was the best shave i love these razors they work wonderful definitely will buy more. I received this razor from Gillette for free to test and review. No Razor Rash, close shave which is the best... Got the Power one which is great the Trimmer is great for the beard to get the fine areas. This is my favorite razor to shave my head with.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette.  I have used different Gillette razors in the past so I have always liked the products that they have put out.  On thing I really dont see the use for is that power part.  Razor just vibrates and is kinda an annoying buzz.  Like using an electric razor.  Other then that the razor performs as great as all Gillette razors do.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and got the Gillette Fusion for free to review from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a Mach3 razor before this one and by far the Fusion Power surpasses it. The level of vibration from the micro pulses allowed for a gentler shave across my face minimizing the friction that would cause skin irritation. The blades are super sharp and having five blades prevent any snagging of any kind. However, it&#x27;s been a bout a week and the lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I thought it would. It&#x27;s been about a week and I&#x27;ve utilized it about twice a day and the strip has a visible wear of over half already. The handle has a very good contour to it that fits in my hands very well. The razor head has just the right angle movement making the razor to travel along my face with precision. Looks like the Mach3 will be retiring.</li>
    <li> i would recommend this razor to anyone that shaves, it it that good.......i was given one for free to try from gilette and thank them a lot for that. The razor has a good feel to it, almost like it was made for my hand and the low battery indicator is a great touch,</li>
    <li> For the longest time and for as long as I can remember I have been using Gillette razors.  Recently, I have been forced by them to move to Schick.  Not happy with being a virtual monopoly when it comes to men&#x27;s shavers Gilette decides to over-engineer and to greedily get more profits by going so overboard that they have successfully made me give up on them after decades of being a loyal consumer.  As other reviewers have alluded to I actually got cut a couple of times which has never happened before!  I&#x27;ve come to realise that the battery operated vibrator is a gimmick that does nothing at all to get a closer shave except to cause more batteries to be consumed and to fill up our landfills.  Thankfully, I&#x27;ve been using rechargables for years and hence haven&#x27;t had to buy batteries for years.  For people like me with sharper facial features, this 5-bladed \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; has such a large amount of rubber that it makes the overall blade area too high/thick (the breadth or height i.e. the vertical edge of the blade) to cover my chin area below my cheeks close enough without cutting my face.  Quite clearly the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns doesn&#x27;t dawn on them when clearly there is a limit to the number of blades before you actually start spoiling the product!  For me it seems any \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; from going to 5 from 4 blades is so negligible to be non-existent in addition to giving me multiple cuts as the blades now do not contact my face as closely as before when I go from my cheek to my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Schick where all their blades fit on all their holders greedy Gillette makes us \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to various blades by having to buy ever new blade holders.  Not content with profits from the blades alone, they have to insist on us buying the new holders to increase their revenues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sick with the blatant exploitation of consumers, I have tried for the first time I can remember the Schick Quattro and I am happy now to get a close shave without cuts for a lower price knowing that any future blade enhancements will still fit my blade holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette for pushing me to your competitors; I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely NOT recommended!s for a lower price knowing that any future blade enhancements will still fit my blade holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette for pushing me to your competitors; I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely NOT recommended!</li>
    <li> I like the razor a lot. The pulsing feels good when shaving and the trimmer is good for difficult spots. I was miffed that they only shipped it with the one cartridge when they used to ship with the replacement cartridges in the base. I was curious to know when this practice started, especially with the price of replacements these days.</li>
    <li> In the quest for the perfect shave, I recently abandon my Gillette M3 for this new model.  The M3 was a good razor, the Fusion is a very good razor.  Both M3 &amp; Fusion give close comfortable shaves but the Fusion blades seem to hold their edge a little longer.  The Fusion is a little bigger than the M3 and is comfortable to hold. Just wish that the blades were less expensive.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really enjoyed this razor, which I received as a sample from the manufacturer. It gave me a nice, close shave and it worked very well multiple times. However, I have very sensitive skin and the moisturizer still irritated my skin a little. I will definitely buy this again, but I will be sure to use extra shaving cream in the future.</li>
    <li> have always used disposable razors, but I received this one for free to use from BzzAgent. I gave it a try and I love it. It offers a clean shave with little effort and I would recommend it to anyone. I have since purchased the cartridges, but not sure if I will be doing so again since they are so pricey.</li>
    <li> Tha blades are great,it feels really smooth and i didn&#x27;t have to pass it several times to get the result I wanted. Just one pass and I was ready, when normally I have to pass it 2 or even 3 times (disposable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only contra I have is the price of the cartridge, but besides that, I would use it as my regular razor, I think is great!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected, good razors, quick shipment.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package, I figured it was just another razor. I have never had a multi-blade razor that vibrates and to be honest, I was a little skeptical. The razor itself was comfortable to hold, and the battery went in easily. I wear a goatee and have always had trouble getting a close shave around my mouth. The Fusion cleanly shaved around my beard on the first stroke and left my skin smooth. The single blade on the back side of the cartridge came in handy for getting under my bottom lip and under my nose. Overall a great razor and I seem to have fewer razor bumps between shaves.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette&#x27;s razors since I turned 18 and they sent me one for my birthday while I was serving in the Navy. I really enjoy shaving with this razor compared to the original razor. I love that you get a product that has batteries included that requires them. I use the razor when I am in the shower in the morning and it works fine in the water. The battery meter is great because no one wants a battery to run out half way through shaving. Obviously battery is not required to use the razor but it does make it feel better. The power feature cuts down on the tugging and irritation even after a couple days without shaving.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the Gillette Fusion razor. I received the Gillette Fusion Power Razor to try free from Gillette.  I tried it and I love it. It&#x27;s clean, smooth and I love how close it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Excellent shave&lt;br /&gt;2) Swivel mechanism is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;3) Very Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;4) I&#x27;m loving the low battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Different blade design means you can&#x27;t use M3 blades. For several generations in the past, you could have used the previous blades.&lt;br /&gt;2) a bit spendy.</li>
    <li> Here, again...tried it for the first time, and working out extremely well...thank you.</li>
    <li> But also very fusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut hairs fine, has precision blade on back for precision shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Also vibrates, doesn&#x27;t change anything but that&#x27;s kinda cool.</li>
    <li> This is my second Fusion Power razor.  My first one lasted me 6 years.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a double blade.  I don&#x27;t like electric shavers and never have.  This thing is nice.  The battery lasts forever and the razor is super heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I bought this same razor about 6 years ago and I just changed the battery one day and it would not work anymore, so i had to break down and buy this new model. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> this is great when I shave in the shower I love to be smoother.</li>
    <li> Like any other razor blade, these guys do feel a bit pricey. But you get what you pay for. These blades are sharp and leave my face feeling very smooth after I shave. If you have a lot of hair, they can dull pretty quickly, so you may want to replace your blades frequently. (I only get about 2-3 shaves out of each blade... but I really like clean, fresh blades when I shave.) I&#x27;ve tried other blades (and even done the whole Dollar Shave Club thing a few times), but I always keep coming back to my Gillettes. Give them a try!</li>
    <li> Amazing product gives the smoothest shaves ever and greatly extends the life of these expensive blades. I have gifted several of these because I like them so much.....after a steamy hot shower the whiskers come off without a tug.</li>
    <li> For the last few years I have been using an electric shaver to handle my daily shaving needs.  But, after my shave died due to battery issues I decided to try the Gillette fusion power.  Honestly, I could not remember the last time I had that close of a shave.  I originally switched to an electric shaver because traditional razors would irritate my skin, especially around the neck. The Gillette fusion gave me a close shave and no irritation. I thought the power feature was just a gimmick, but surprisingly it helped prevent irritation and gave a smooth shave.  I will not be switching back to an electric shaver now that I can get a closer shave and have no irritating red marks on my neck.</li>
    <li> I bought Gillette Fusion Power few days ago.  It is the worst shaver I ever bought.  I think the blades are so close together that the hair get stuck in them and it hurts to shave.  If you have thick hair/tough beard then stay away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I already spend money on this new razor so I shave with my old Gillette sensor first and then shave again with Fusion just to feel Kool on being on cutting edge of technology :-)</li>
    <li> Let me tell you that in the beginning I was a skeptic.  Could the Fusion be that much better than the Mach 3?  Was it worth spending $10 on?  In short answer YES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FUSION follows every curve on your face like an Ariel Atom sticks to every curve and corner on the race track....The MACH 3 on the other hand feels live a Ford Festiva going around your face on 4 donut spare tires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the MACH 3 leaves short hairs for the 2nd pass the FUSION annihilates them in 1 pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the MACH 3 lets your face feel like you need to shave again right after your done the Fusion turns your face into a smooth sheet of glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last point is that you need to invest in the Fusion cream (or some high end cream). This is the biggest problem; people skimp on the cream and don&#x27;t get the best results.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well and gives a very clean shave, although I would say it is maybe only 20% better than the M3.  It was a little rough for my first shave, but that is to be expected with any new top of the line razor.  It took me a while for skin to get used to the previous M3 razor as well, but once you are used to these razors, they work very well.  This does give an awesome shave, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a whole heck of a lot better than M3.  The blade on the back is ok, but is too big for small spaces.  It does work nice for trimming the hard to get to corners of my mouth.</li>
    <li> It never ceases to amaze me how often Gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it&#x27;s loyal clientele.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion is a classic example, from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a Sensor Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy into the hype, the Fusion is an expensive joke of a product.</li>
    <li> Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have thought of that? I smell noble price here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn&#x27;t test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the \\&quot;adding more blades\\&quot; thing is getting exhausted.</li>
    <li> Great razor, just wish they would provide additional blades with the starter pack.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted and my husband was happy with the price.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Procter &amp; Gamble. My razor for comparison is a Gillette Mach 3. I found this to shave noticeably smoother and with less effort. I could not get used to the vibrating handle and could not discern any performance improvement with the noisemaker on. I prefer the heavier metal handle of the Mach 3, but will stick with this for the better shave.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver and use it all the time and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Before trying this razor, I was using the Mach III (which was a good razor as well, although I never used the Mach III Power); and despite my best efforts not to get sucked into advertising, I decided to try the Fusion Power after seeing the commercials. But now I&#x27;m glad I switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shave every other day, and rarely on weekends, so sometimes I&#x27;ll go 3 or 4 days without shaving. And the Fusion does a great job with the extra growth. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and the \\&quot;comfort guard\\&quot; helps make it a smooth cut. And the power part is a big help; once I&#x27;m done, it&#x27;s a closer shave than the Mach III was. I also have a goatee, and the main blade of the Fusion can actually trim the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only 2 minor negatives to the Fusion: Cleaning out the comfort guard is a bit of a hassle, and the blue guard makes it hard to see any hair (mine is dark brown) that&#x27;s been caught in it; and the battery indicator is basically useless. It&#x27;s been \\&quot;low\\&quot; for several weeks, and a brand new battery didn&#x27;t make a difference. So I guess when the razor stops working I&#x27;ll know the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good step up from a simple razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (11/17/07): It seems I misunderstood the battery indicator, which I apparently didn&#x27;t look at very closely when I bought the razor. I thought the battery symbol on the razor would indicate when the battery was low, and that&#x27;s why I thought it was \\&quot;low\\&quot; for so long; I didn&#x27;t realize that it was like that all the time! The entire area around the battery symbol and the power button will actually flash orange when the battery is low, as I discovered this week. So I apologize to anyone that might have read my review and was misinformed because of it. And now the only minor negative about the razor is still the issue of cleaning the comfort guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, however, it seems the Fusion will last quite a while on one battery: Mine was still going strong in April when I originally posted this review -- and I had had the razor for some time then -- and despite the fact that I don&#x27;t shave every day, the original battery (which I put back in after a new one didn&#x27;t matter) lasted until now.</li>
    <li> This razor system does not give a close enough shave for me.  The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all.  They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me and I don&#x27;t think its the case for most people.  Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving.  I now use the Norelco 8150XL electric shaver exclusively and it works like a charm every time.</li>
    <li> It cost more than any other blade but does a better job so its worth it.</li>
    <li> Looks like a lot of the positive reviews are straight from Gillette&#x27;s marketing material. The bottom line is the Fusion does an adequate job of shaving my face but so does my Mach 3..at a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This seemingly bi-annual ritual of adding blades is getting ludicrous..</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because my old razor was cutting me so badly.  (It wasn&#x27;t a cheap one!)  It works wonderfully!  I don&#x27;t have to use any pressure to get an accurate shave and the vibrating helps massage my face.  The razor itself is not that expensive but watch out for the cost of the refill blades!</li>
    <li> I used a [[ASIN:B000052YHS Gillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 system]]for two years until It finally broke on me last Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this at a local Walmart due to its excellent ratings here. And it worked great on day 1 and 2. Very close and smooth and with less irritation then my old Mach3. However on day three Sunday I didn&#x27;t leave the apartment so I didn&#x27;t shave. When I went to shave today. It had trouble cutting the stubble that formed over day and a night. It would cut some and leave others. Some it just teared out. I had to shave twice just to get a clean shave!!! plus Ive only used 3 times and the blade looks like it will need to be replaced soon! And the refills are expensive $25 for 6 retail? You got be kidding me! If I choose to keep this its going to cost me a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE The price of the blades are unreal!!! And They last a bought a week. I have given up on this razor and bought a new Gillette Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;And on closer inspection its actually doing a better job on my lower lip.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor i have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appear to have a tougher beard and more sensitive skin then most.  This tends to do the best job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design really is top notch with a lot of thought into the placement of the razors to make cleaning very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is i&#x27;m still looking for a better razor.  I do still get some irritation.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product, but it works better than the track3 that I had been using. It works smoother and the trimmer is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Let me give you one piece of advice: don&#x27;t buy it. For one simple reason: it is NOT watertight. I will repeat: IT IS NOT WATERTIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one and in a matter of weeks it stopped working. I wrote to Gillette and they were very prompt and polite and within a week they sent me another one. That one only lasted one use in the shower and it stopped working the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, I am not kidding: THIS THING IS NOT WATERTIGHT!</li>
    <li> Best razor there is, period.</li>
    <li> Gillette is so dependable and easy to use I don&#x27;t know why I had switched.  I&#x27;m back to Gillette now and the only reason I don&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is I think the individual blade cost is still too high.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked some people do not like this razor. I&#x27;ve been shaving with one for quite some time now, and once you get used to it, it is the closest shave you can get. You have to alter your traditional shaving method by doing nice, slow strokes, and let the vibrating blades to all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gillette came out with the single blade edge trimmer on their blades I thought it was ingenious. With a powered, vibrating blade, the edge trimmer is by far the only trimmer that gets the stubble just under and around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who thinks 5 blades is simply a marketing gimmick, I urge you to think again. With the right technique, it is a very close, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I am a woman; I own both the manual and this power version of the Fusion razors and for shaving legs, I haven&#x27;t noticed *huge* differences between the two. The power version has a slight advantage in giving a quicker and *slightly* closer shave but if it came down to huge differences in price, for my purpose of shaving legs I could easily go either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does do an excellent job at getting a close shave and in my experience I find that razors designed for women have not worked any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only quibble I have is with what I feel is extremely high prices for the refill blades. This is definitely one to compare prices on, coupon shop, and/or catch sales when you can.</li>
    <li> i shave my face and head Sunday night and friday morning with nivea in the blue and white can.... gilette fusion is a primo product at a primo price, but for me its worth it... i keep a jar with an inch of rubbing alcohol handy and a final swish draws water out of the steel to make a bkade last me nearly 2 months...  my son is just coming into shaving and he will know nothing of the troubles we&#x27;ve all had for decades with poorly functioning razors.... 4 stars only because of the high price, otherwise its a 5...  i once heard gilette was bidding on a large ship to buy for scrap price and i imagine the profit margin on a \\&quot;ships worth\\&quot; of razors... jeez, buy gilette stock, haha</li>
    <li> Best Battery Powered Razor!</li>
    <li> The Fusion Power Razor, which I discovered by accident, gives me the best shave above all other methods electrical or safe razor.  It&#x27;s like a miracle.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice razor. Am not sure the battery powered cutter is necessary, but would recommend this razor to anyone with or without the power option. I have recently tried the Gillette Altra product, as well, and liked this very much.</li>
    <li> It is nice shaver, but &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; function (vibration) absolutely useless, you do not feel how smoothly you shaved while it works and it doesn&#x27;t give you any advantages.</li>
    <li> I must admit it was the Super Bowl XL commercial that enticed me to try this razor.  I&#x27;d had a not-so-good experience with the Quattro, so I was a little wary when I discovered this one had even more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the Fusion: It does grab the stubble and take it off slightly better than the M3 Power, but ONLY shaving counter to the direction of the beard growth.  When I shave, I usually mix my strokes up and down, and found that this razor did not remove the beard as well as the M3 Power when shaving on the downstroke.  So I had to restroke my face on certain areas which remained rough after the initial shave, which actually added to my shaving time.  I can only assume the other reviewers who said shaving time was decreased, use only upstrokes when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I was very disappointed when the blue indicator strip disappeared completely right after the first shave.  Refill blades are more expensive than the M3 Power, which usually last me 2 or 3 shaves at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last con I have is that the battery button is a bit too sensitive and placed exactly where I like to hold the razor with a firm grip.  Twice while I was shaving I accidentally switched it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  I would use the Fusion to shave only for special or formal occasions, because of the cost of replacement blades and the shaving style needed for optimum work outweigh the benefits of the slightly better shave I could get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For regular everyday shaving, I&#x27;m sticking with the M3 Power.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the one I purchased for over 2 months. I&#x27;m not impressed. I expected a smoother shave or at least not having to go over the same spot 3 or more times as I normally have to. Unfortunately this razor changed nothing. It doesn&#x27;t cut better, not faster, not smoother. In the past I&#x27;ve purchased one and two blade disposables and this works pretty much the same only many times more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if they try six, no eight, no no 12 blades! Yep that&#x27;s the trick, and make it vibrate 20 times faster, yea ultrasonic!</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All i can say is whoever said a blade shaves closer than an electric never tried the Fusion......this is the worst shave ever. even worse than cheap disposibles. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Been using the mach 3 since it came out. Saw this new fusion on tv and hopped on the boat to try it out. Was I disapointed. I have a thick beard and shaving down or up, I felt like my face was being cut up or like sand paper was going across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the five blade it almost looks like the razer is getting cloged up more easily than the mach 3. The Precision trimmer was pretty useless. Although it did get the side burns pretty straight. Hard to shave around the nose area with the fusion. The head of the razer on the fusion is larger than the mach 3. Blade on the fusion not interchangable like the mach 3, mach turbo, m3 turbo, mach nitro. Marketing I guess to force you to buy a new handle. I felt the quality of the fusion felt more plastic while the M3 turbo I am currently using feels more heavier and well built. The vibration from the fusion although does feel better than the m3 turbo. I also agree with the other post the blades are ridiculously overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I give Gillete Fusion a 3 great idea though. Sticking with my m3 power.</li>
    <li> I should tell you from the start, I&#x27;m a marketer&#x27;s dream. I&#x27;ve progressed over the years from an electric razor to progressively a one blade, two blade, three blade, and now a five blade gillette - battery powered and otherwise. Have I ever noticed a major difference moving one to the next - not sure - but like many others of you I tend to buy the latest just to say that I have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving differences well truth be told the biggest revelation for me was when I switched from electric to the one blade gillette - I&#x27;d used the electric for twenty years since the time when I had to shave in the first place. What a revelation! The electric took for ever and seemed to grind your beard down much like a power sander. By contrast the one blade hand gillette was quick clean and gave you the impression that you&#x27;d actually had a shave in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I suppose I have detected minor improvements as I&#x27;ve progressed from one blade to two and more etc. But the changes are only apparent initially and you soon just don&#x27;t notice, and they are sure not as marked as the transition from electric to manual. It&#x27;s a bit like the difference between an expensive bottle of wine and a slightly cheaper one, or a good hi fi system and a not quite so good hi fi system - the differences are suttle - but there sure must be a big difference between a one blade and a five blade gillette. The only \\&quot;primitive\\&quot; razor I&#x27;ve tried recently is a disposable and it is sure streets ahead of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the disposable I&#x27;ve never gone back to a lesser (ie fewer blades) gillette to test the extent of the improvement - perhaps I should. Anyway it&#x27;s a good, well presented, piece of marketing - and as I said like many of you I&#x27;d rather have the five blade than many that went before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way I don&#x27;t cut myself with the five blader as I have with previous fewer bladed models so there is something tangible! Perhaps that is a good pointer to a better razor.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Mach 3 Power (M3Power) razor, I didn&#x27;t think there was a significant difference in actual shaving performance. I think the 5 blades is more of a gimmick, though I like the overall design, handle, and the fact that it vibrates. I am only giving it three stars because of the high replacement blade costs and the somewhat gimmicky design of 5 blades, but it&#x27;s not a bad razor. I think the shaving performance is good but not great.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you first, I&#x27;m a Gillette fan, I have been using Gillette razors for over 18 years, I was always excited when they released a new razor because every time it was better than the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, possibly you wonder why I gave a 1-start poor rating to this product. I was excited to buy this new line of product, as being certain it would have been better than the previous line Mach 3 Turbo. Result a real disappointment. Here are the reasons from a Gillette fan you can trust:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. 5 razors don&#x27;t work. Over the years for the sake of competition they made double blades, triple blades than it was not enough they released 5-bladed razors like this one. However, since they needed to put the blades closer to each other to fit 5 blades in a limited area of razor head, it simply didn&#x27;t work. Let&#x27;s continue,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This product has very sharp blades but since 5-very sharp blades are located very close to each other it resulted very bad maneuverability. You simply cut yourself easily if you made a slight side movement while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Blades are so sharp it doesn&#x27;t allow you to focus on flat surfaces for a close shave. It just goes through and if you insisted on getting for a closer shave you will cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You might think I have a sensitive skin type, BUT believe me I don&#x27;t. Believe it or not with a Mach 3 I never cut myself never, never. I have very thick and strong hair, I can&#x27;t use a regular razor for shaving. Only and Only Gillette Mach 3 handles my facial hair but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. This product has engineering flaws which is resulted from competitive 5-blade which are put very closely together and you cannot handle this razor well even if you are a surgeon. I know because I&#x27;m  very successful with using my hands because of my profession. But thanks to engineers who developed this I cut myself with this razor, for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. It&#x27;s your choice whether or not you buy this product butI want to remind you that for the first time I&#x27;m taking my time and writing a review for a razor, be careful it&#x27;s a razor not a Gillette anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final personal shaving tip: If you want your high quality razor blades last longer than usual, do not rinse them with hot or warm water while shaving. If you use cold water for rinsing blades, you will see them lasting sharp for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> ive never had or used a vibrating razor before, but man let me tell ya, this is great. closer shave than ive ever had in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;came with amazon multi purchase. fast in the mail. great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon rocks !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the fusion power  razor for years. On a recent trip, some jerk took my carry on from the plane and didn&#x27;t bother to return it. So what did I do when I got to my destination? Got on Amazon and ordered me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Love it love it love it. Close precise shave every time.</li>
    <li> It is a very good shaver for cabelleros. Gillette created a very good design for this type of shaver. I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> gracias por los comentarios son muy prcticos  era lo que esperaba muy suaves son una delicia los recomiendo a a</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try this Gillette Fusion Power razor free from Gillette.  I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 Power and am loyal to the Gillette brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the look of the razor - the metallic orange and silver color scheme is cool - and it is comfortable to hold.  I thought that perhaps the battery would cause it to feel bottom-heavy, but I didn&#x27;t really feel any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I found the on/off button of this razor to be in an awkward position, I kept turning it on and off when I was trying to shave.  This was a common problem I had with my other powered razor as well though, so maybe the design flaw is in my hand and not in the razor&#x27;s design.  :)</li>
    <li> While it may look like a part of a time machine, it is not, but you will call it one when you see how fast you can get a super smooth shave with this razor.  When I first used it, I kept going back over the same spots like I would always do with my old disposable razor.  It took a few passes to realize that I only needed one pass with this razor.  My face was baby smooth in one pass.  It took some getting used to, but now I spend 1/3 less time shaving because this gets it all in one pass.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the vibration or the multiple little razors, but this thing is amazing.  It performed just as quick with 3 days growth as it did with a 5&#x27;oclock shadow and never cut my face once.  I&#x27;ll never use a cheap disposable again.  You may save a few bucks but you will never get this good of a shave and you will never get one this fast!</li>
    <li> I think this razor is great!! IT does a fantastic job getting a close shave and I didn&#x27;t even have to go over my face twice! The trimmer also works great for those hard to reach hairs ( nose hairs and side burns) I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
    <li> This was actually a great razor to use. I was able the shave my full beard and mustache with out the pulling and yanking I would get from other razors. I use to have to use my electric razor first then finish it off with a regular razor, not any more.</li>
    <li> As you would expect from a Gillette product this is a high quality razor that delivers an excellent shave.  A bit pricey but worth the extra dough.</li>
    <li> I use these razors for myself (female) and my husband also uses them for his beard. We both love them! I&#x27;ve tried several brands before I found Gillette Fusion-I will never use another razor!</li>
    <li> I had the Gillette MPower Power razor, which lasted for years, and used everyday.  The battery only had to be changed about once every 8-9 months.  The on/off switch finally broke after about 3 years, and they no longer make this razor, so I purchased what, I assumed, was a newer, improved version called the Fusion Power Razor.  Bulkier, shave NOT as close as the 3-bladed version, harder to get into the tight places, have cut myself several times with it (where I never cut myself in past with the 3-bladed version), shave is NOT as close unless you make many extra passes, AND, even with brand new AAA batteries, the batteries only last about 2 weeks before the darn low battery flashing light comes on...I&#x27;ve gone through 6 batteries since I&#x27;ve had this upgraded (in my opinion, it is a downgrade) of a razor.  Very disappointed...even on Amazon, the blades are expensive, and they do NOT last as long as the 3-bladed ones did.  I want the older MPower Power razor back...you can still get the blades, but not the power unit itself.  Some people goofed in the engineering of this newer razor.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product, it is somewhat expensive, is Chinese manufacturing&lt;br /&gt;In any case, it is very good to use</li>
    <li> I got one of these from Gillette, and was pretty excited to use it . I normally use an old school safety razor, and that is the best shave you can possibly get. The first shave with this was close, but I noticed my shave didn&#x27;t last as long as when I shave with my safety razor. The shave isn&#x27;t super smooth, and I got some serious shave bumps compared to my other razor. For a razor to use if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning, this isn&#x27;t bad... but for one to use everyday, I am still hooked on my safety razor. Another thing to consider is the cartridges are EXPENSIVE. It&#x27;s okay, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t make it my everyday razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using it averaged of 2-3 times/week for a little over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 2-3 times/week during summer, 1-2 times/week during winter.&lt;br /&gt;- I am a triathlete.&lt;br /&gt;- I use it to shave my legs only.&lt;br /&gt;- I tried it with my face once and it did not perform as well as my electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;- I can perfect my shave 90% of the times. I do get razor burns here and there (only when I rush) but nothing too irritating or appearing.&lt;br /&gt;- One AA battery lasted me 11 months. When the battery runs low the light will blink.&lt;br /&gt;- I only had to replace the blade ONCE at ONE year mark.&lt;br /&gt;- I compared my shave using the 1-year old blade v.s. a authentic 1-day old blade (I bought from my local drug store) and I can not tell the difference in terms of performance and smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy I got this. However, I am planning to get a new one with the &amp;#34;flex-ball&amp;#34; towards the top of the razor to see how that one performs. Otherwise, I recommend this!</li>
    <li> I was unsure about this power razor I got to try it free from Gillette. Once i tried it i loved it My shave was very smooth and no knicks love the grip and the added weight of the battery,</li>
    <li> My husband loves this Fusion product.  Says it&#x27;s a great shave and makes his face smooth as a &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s butt&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This product is just like from the drug store only it was much cheaper and just as easy to acquire</li>
    <li> My power mach 3 died and I was looking for another.  tried this one.  the first shave nicked and burned.  Knowing that I got multiple shaves form the mach 3 I kept going.  After the 3rd shave things got better! but not great, just ok.  I have a beard and like to shave every other day.  When new this does not work so good but after a couple of shaves, again it is ok.  At the cost of these blades I keep going, and going.  I lose track of how many times but it is a lot.  I shave in the shower so after the first time with the shaving cream I just use lots of water to lightly go over it a second time.</li>
    <li> YES THIS RAZOR CUTS, MY LAST BLADE LASTED 7 MONTHS, REALLY. IM BLOND AND HAVE A LITE BEARD,I USE IT IN THE SHOWER 3 TIMES A WEEK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONE THING IS THE PRICE.25-33$$ A PACK IS ALOT- OH WELL THE RAZOR COP. WILL NOT MAKE AS MUCH $$ ON ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT FOR A BLUE BEARD IT MUST BE ALOT OF $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S TRUE---BLONDS HAVE MORE FUNN........:)AND SPEND LESS........</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Power. Just the title of the razor made me excited to give it a test drive. Before using this razor one can only admire the quality and innovation that Gillette has incorporated into this product. The razor is well constructed and extremely easy to use. It contours to the hand to form a solid grip. The battery indicator on the top of the razor notifies you when to change the battery to give you the most optimal shave. I enjoyed this product. It is not only appealing to the eye but functions very well. A rare product that works as advertised. Hats off to a well made and innovative razor from Gillette. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Got to try out a sample product from Gillette company. Great product! Overall razor - I like the grip of Gillette fusion. Its sturdy and comfortable. The best part is the five blade shaving surface; I don&#x27;t have tobgo back over the spots I have been to and I leaves the area smooth. Being able to flip the razor to use the precision edge has come in handy for me many mornings! However, I don&#x27;t think its exceptionally different from other Gillette products I have tried before.</li>
    <li> Gillette fusion power razor is a very nice, sleek, durable looking razor from a brand I trust. I already use the Gillette power shaving cream and I love it. Its the only shaving cream I will use.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin if I wait to long to shave my face brakes out, if I use soap to shave I brake out,If I use a razor to long I will brake out. so with that being said I do not normally use other razors  I stick to my tried and true disposable razors. I decided to go ahead and try the Gillette fusion Power razor because I had been toying with the idea of using an electric razor. I had never used one before and since Gillette is a brand i trust i chose to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I like the visual that the razor provides, bright colors, sleek look. It has a great hand fill. the weight is perfect, not to heavy, not to light good balance weight and I feel that is very important. So this razor meet all my initial needs.&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor on two separate occasions with the same result it feels like it is pulling my hair not cutting it. I tried the razor both on and off with the same end result.I do not know if it is  because of my sensitive skin, my thick facial hair, or a flaw in the razor design. It did leave my face feeling soft and smooth after a shave and it is something i would be very interested in using permanently if it did not pull my hair. maybe if the blades where sharper?</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the Gillette Fusion razor.  I have tried several different disposable razors and semi-disposable razors and have always been less than impressed.  So I stick with my electric razor.  When opening the Gillette Fusion razor I decided &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and gave it a shot.  I was very impressed with the closeness of the shave.  So much closer than my electric razor.  I still have to deal with the shaving gel/cream, which I must admit is less than appealing, but I think the closeness and softness of the shave is worth it (at least a couple times a week).  Especially, when I throw in the extra kisses my wife wants to give me because my skin is so soft.  Now my wife of the other hand is so completely sold by Gillette Fusion she says they wish they made something that shaves her that close every time.  She deals with the gel/cream every time, and the close shave allows her to shave less often.  So we are literally fighting for the Gillette Fusion razor on occasions.  It is worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> I loved the precision  i get with gillette fusion power razor it makes the morning routine  much easier. With gillette i get a very good smooth shave without any cuts and the trimmer is great for the sideburns and to get the desired look i want. I also liked the way it looks and feels .It is great to have sophisticated razor wich is very economical.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Power Razor would make a difference in shaving. It does, and I am ordering second Power Razor for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I got this razor for my husband.  It pulled his skin and was a very uncomfortable shave.  Neither of us can figure out what the battery \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; is supposed to do, but it certainly didn&#x27;t increase comfort or improve performance. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I like the Fusion Power razors. If only Gillette, or someone, would make a nice little (protective) travel pouch/case for these Power razors.</li>
    <li> Nice an smooth shave, the best shave I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;One blade last for 2 months using it 3 times a week</li>
    <li> The product looks good but does not perform well.the razor does not shave well and require repeated going over and over again.</li>
    <li> Had this for about or over 2 yrs and it stills works!! I recommend this!! :)</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase - very satisfied</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for the optional vibration option,  but ended up not liking it, and I don&#x27;t feel like it gave me a closer shave. It might have been a closer shave than my other manual razor, but I think that was because it&#x27;s just more blades than my other razor. I&#x27;m glad it was only $10 since it&#x27;s going into the garbage.</li>
