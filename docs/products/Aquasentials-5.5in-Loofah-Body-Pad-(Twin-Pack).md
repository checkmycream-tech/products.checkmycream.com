### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have which is a perfect size for the shower.  </li>
      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>This Loofah is a perfect size for me.</li>
      <li>Best exfoliation ever.</li>
      <li>good pricing on this great loofah</li>
      <li>These worked good.</li>
      <li>They held the soap nice and scrubbed well.</li>
      <li>This loofah is the perfect size for my body and fits in my hand really well</li>
      <li>good for exfoliating though four more words required</li>
      <li>the loop on the top (for hanging it in the shower) is teeny ...</li>
      <li>I prefer microfiber products better.</li>
      <li>This loofah is much better made than plastic loofahs though so hopefully I won&#x27;t be replacing them all the time like with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, it is an okay product.</li>
      <li>I really like pampering myself in the shower/bath, and this really does the job on making my skin look perfect. :)</li>
      <li>These are wonderful for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Would be great if you were 5 years old or maybe using on your face</li>
      <li>It is a good value but for those who want a really scrubby, stimulating loofah, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>These will break easy</li>
      <li>One did make it into the dryer, but seems fine.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>For more petite people I think it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
      <li>The strap in the back is very nice in maintaining a grip on the pad.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of abrasive-ness... Makes you feel clean but not painful.</li>
      <li>makes your skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>These loofahs are good -- once you get them wet</li>
      <li>They have an elastic strap on the back which is handy when you using it.  </li>
      <li>Still worth a try.</li>
      <li>so luckily it&#x27;s a twin pack at a real decent price</li>
      <li>It is interesting that regular store in my neighborhood do not carry this item.</li>
      <li>does lather up well, but wanted something larger &amp; more textured.</li>
      <li>I bought it here because it&#x27;s getting harder to find natural loofahs in stores, as more and more synthetic scrubbers are being sold.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great exfoliator for the body but my biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
      <li>I guess I was expecting the surface to be flat to be able to scrub with the whole loofah pad.</li>
      <li>I was using a regular loofah with the plastic mesh and that was fine until it fell apart.  </li>
      <li>Good but hard loofa - doesn&#x27;t soften up.</li>
      <li>I really thought this product would have lasted awhile...</li>
      <li>It does a great job in removing dry or dead skin leaving my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I felt like I needed something a little bit more</li>
      <li>It really leaves my skin soft and glowing once I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>This one is painful, to say the best.</li>
      <li>The design makes it take a little longer to rinse clean of soap, but otherwise it does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
      <li>would say though, as many others already have, that this may not be big enough for people who are larger.</li>
      <li>Loofah did not help to produce more suds or soap, scratched my skin and was extremely small.  </li>
      <li>You have to really lather it wet in order for it to get back to its original shape.</li>
      <li>so I end up using much more product than I usually needed to with my old plastic loofah.</li>
      <li>Instead I was only able to scrub with a little part at a time.</li>
      <li>This is just your basic loofah pad in a 2-pack at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>so I went with a natural loofah material.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the thick loofah sponges.</li>
      <li>This product does curl slightly when it gets wet, but when you put your hand behind it through the strap it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle so the exfoliating factor is minimal.</li>
      <li>The only positive is that I could return it, and hopefully will get my money back.  </li>
      <li>It is way too small to fit a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
      <li>The elastic in the back wraps comfortably around my small hands.</li>
      <li>Really works and very long lasting.  </li>
      <li>I suppose for large hands it may be tight.</li>

<li> Really works and very long lasting.  </li>
<li> I suppose for large hands it may be tight.</li>
<li> I throw them in the washer after each use, then air dry.</li>
<li> The one thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the loofah edges curl up when dry.</li>
<li> so I understand that the sponges are getting smaller, however, the strap on the back is a little tight and</li>
<li> but it was not at all as it softens when wet.</li>
<li> I find the synthetic scrubbies to be too harsh -- and the softer synthetics don&#x27;t exfoliate well enough.  </li>
<li> but I would think it&#x27;s too rough to use on your face.  </li>
<li> I understand that loofah is getting harder to find</li>
<li> When it&#x27;s wet</li>
<li> it&#x27;s small size compare the one sell at the any pharmacy, but the qty same as the one sell on any  pharmacy</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the curling that other reviewers have had.  </li>
<li> Overall they are too small.</li>
<li> However IMO they are on the smaller side -- when you are trying to scrub hard to reach places it would be nicer if they were a bit longer.</li>
<li> It gets hard when it gets wet, and each time you try to use it, the pad becomes harder and less pliable.  </li>
<li> small and hard to hold; I would get a larger one</li>
<li> Is not as harsh as some loofah&#x27;s, too.</li>
<li> Way to small.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think these will hold up compared to the loofah pads I have purchased in the past.</li>
<li> I gave up on the synthetic ones after too many times coming out of the shower with insanely itchy legs.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t be disappointed when they first arrive.  </li>
<li> This product will scrub, but what makes it difficult was when I got it wet.</li>
<li> This loofah is not a good product.  </li>
<li> I was afraid it would be too rough on my skin</li>
<li> The worst product I have purchased on Amazon.com thus far.  </li>
<li> (ummph silly me).</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> The size and quality was disappointing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s small size compare the one sell at the any pharmacy, but the qty same as the one sell on any  pharmacy</li>
    <li> Why do people complain about the size? Haven&#x27;t they read the measurements?&lt;br /&gt;I always read all the info about any product before acquiring it.</li>
    <li> does lather up well, but wanted something larger &amp; more textured.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Really works and very long lasting.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality product it is.</li>
    <li> This product does curl slightly when it gets wet, but when you put your hand behind it through the strap it works perfectly. Much better than the thick loofah sponges.</li>
    <li> Good but hard loofa - doesn&#x27;t soften up.</li>
    <li> makes your skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This product will scrub, but what makes it difficult was when I got it wet. When it&#x27;s wet it curls. I guess I was expecting the surface to be flat to be able to scrub with the whole loofah pad. Instead I was only able to scrub with a little part at a time. I prefer microfiber products better. Sorry.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for my dry skin. I throw them in the washer after each use, then air dry. One did make it into the dryer, but seems fine.</li>
    <li> good pricing on this great loofah</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet, soon, I feel that these will work out just like the discription says</li>
    <li> It is interesting that regular store in my neighborhood do not carry this item. I tried to look around and decided maybe someone still carry this and voila.....</li>
    <li> I combine this with Dr.Bronners Peppermint Castile soap. Best exfoliation ever.</li>
    <li> The illustration looked like the loofah mit I have which is a perfect size for the shower.  It is way too small to fit a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
    <li> It is a good value but for those who want a really scrubby, stimulating loofah, look elsewhere. It is very gentle so the exfoliating factor is minimal.</li>
    <li> This is just your basic loofah pad in a 2-pack at a reasonable price.  If you like loofah pads, you will like this one.  I bought it here because it&#x27;s getting harder to find natural loofahs in stores, as more and more synthetic scrubbers are being sold.  I gave up on the synthetic ones after too many times coming out of the shower with insanely itchy legs.  I find the synthetic scrubbies to be too harsh -- and the softer synthetics don&#x27;t exfoliate well enough.  So... back to basics for me.</li>
    <li> These loofahs are good -- once you get them wet they expand and roughen up so don&#x27;t be disappointed when they first arrive.  They have an elastic strap on the back which is handy when you using it.  However IMO they are on the smaller side -- when you are trying to scrub hard to reach places it would be nicer if they were a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I was using a regular loofah with the plastic mesh and that was fine until it fell apart.  I felt like I needed something a little bit more &#x27;scrubby&#x27; so I went with a natural loofah material.  It works just like it should.  The design makes it take a little longer to rinse clean of soap, but otherwise it does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> I really thought this product would have lasted awhile...(ummph silly me). It didn&#x27;t give me the results I was expecting from it. I guess different strokes for different folks.</li>
    <li> These loofah does it&#x27;s job. However, it is an okay product. The one thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the loofah edges curl up when dry. You have to really lather it wet in order for it to get back to its original shape.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of abrasive-ness... Makes you feel clean but not painful. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face though.</li>
    <li> Way to small.  I wanted it to double as my washcloth in the shower.  Would be great if you were 5 years old or maybe using on your face but I would think it&#x27;s too rough to use on your face.  I threw mine away and ordered a bigger one.</li>
    <li> I like loofah pads and use them instead of a wash cloth. The size and quality was disappointing. I don&#x27;t think these will hold up compared to the loofah pads I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> This loofah is not a good product.  It gets hard when it gets wet, and each time you try to use it, the pad becomes harder and less pliable.  The only positive is that I could return it, and hopefully will get my money back.  Spend the extra bucks for the sponge loofah or a different pad.  This one is painful, to say the best.</li>
    <li> does not hold shower gel well and that&#x27;s why i bought it.  good for exfoliating though four more words required</li>
    <li> These will break easy so luckily it&#x27;s a twin pack at a real decent price otherwise I probably would&#x27;ve passed it up. Still worth a try.</li>
    <li> I use this loofah pad all over my body, but focus on my feet, legs, and arms. It really leaves my skin soft and glowing once I get out of the shower. I really like pampering myself in the shower/bath, and this really does the job on making my skin look perfect. :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the curling that other reviewers have had.  It works great!  The strap in the back is very nice in maintaining a grip on the pad.</li>
    <li> This loofah is the perfect size for my body and fits in my hand really well (I&#x27;m about 5&#x27;1 98 lbs.) It&#x27;s a great exfoliator for the body but my biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well so I end up using much more product than I usually needed to with my old plastic loofah. This loofah is much better made than plastic loofahs though so hopefully I won&#x27;t be replacing them all the time like with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say though, as many others already have, that this may not be big enough for people who are larger. For more petite people I think it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
    <li> This Loofah is a perfect size for me. The elastic in the back wraps comfortably around my small hands. I suppose for large hands it may be tight. I was afraid it would be too rough on my skin but it was not at all as it softens when wet. It does a great job in removing dry or dead skin leaving my skin soft.</li>
    <li> small and hard to hold; I would get a larger one</li>
    <li> These worked good. They held the soap nice and scrubbed well.</li>
    <li> I considered throwing it away as soon as I saw it but I figured I should give it a chance. Loofah did not help to produce more suds or soap, scratched my skin and was extremely small.  The worst product I have purchased on Amazon.com thus far.  I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> My last loofah sponge was a bit bigger and that made a big difference in ease of use. I understand that loofah is getting harder to find so I understand that the sponges are getting smaller, however, the strap on the back is a little tight and the loop on the top (for hanging it in the shower) is teeny ... it takes two hands to get it to loop over one of the tines on the shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, though. Is not as harsh as some loofah&#x27;s, too.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t cover your hand while scrubbing, and they slip/slide off your hand in use.  Overall they are too small.</li>
</ol>
