<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I see a slight reduction in persperation, maybe 25% less, which doesnt really help at all. i had high hopes with all the good reviews. Guess it&#x27;s just me...</li>
    <li> did not work at all!!</li>
    <li> It began working on the first day. After that, not a whole lot changed. :/ I still sweat even when I&#x27;m doing nothing and I&#x27;ve been forced to keep by black t-shirts. But that&#x27;s me. Maybe it could work for another person. Everyone&#x27;s different. I totally recommend this. Its a good product. Good luck.</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied, stop sweat for weeks.  Minor irritation if you use salt/rock deodorants.</li>
    <li> At first, I really believed this was a miracle product. I had problems with extremely sweaty pits for the past four years. I tried it again recently and it started to not work as well like the first few times. I&#x27;m willing to give it more chances because I NEED something to control my sweat. I do recommend this product because it did work but I am unsure if it will continue to work for everyone. I pray it will work again for me!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. That said, unfortunately, it went from working for four days to working for three days and now I&#x27;ll be lucky to get two days out of one use. And it itches like a sunnafabitch.</li>
    <li> I bought this product directly from the manufacturer but i can t comment in there so i do it in here.Im white woman and i suffer from severe hyperhidrosis from head to toe..I always looked like i was constantly under shower with no effort whatsoever...i suffered for 7 years.Recently i discovered this product and i use it every day...at day3 the sweat almost dissapear..now i hardly sweat.I even use it on my head ,inch by inch..im not even sure if i should continue for a whole 7 days like most folks use it..but im going to continue twice a week until dissapear for good..i bought 3 bootles but one was good enough for all body..it is really impresive giving the fact that in the bootle are only 30 ml lotion.Is really good stuff! i recomand it to all of u.I have realy thin semsitive skin and i didn t have any problems caused by the lotion.</li>
    <li> I feel like it irritated my skin and made me sweat more, smelly sweat. I only used it for a short time so I&#x27;m not sure if you use it longer, it may make a difference?</li>
    <li> I have been using Odaban for about a year now and I do have to say it works.  After suffering from embarrassing under arm sweat my whole life, this seems to be the only product that works.  I do find that it burn quite a bit after application.  What I do \\&quot;for those considering this product\\&quot;.  Is I make sure that I shower a couple hours before bed to make sure that my under arms are clean and dry.  I apply before bed but with only 1-2 sprays per arm and then I rub it around the entire under arms to make sure It gets everywhere because I notice that if you miss a spot, that spot will sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The burning does happen still, but not as bad.  I never used this daily or weekly....but I notice that after a spray, it lasts for about a month for me.  When I start to notice sweat, then I reapply and all is well!</li>
    <li> Just great!! This is awesome Like all odaban products, my cousin recommended and I absolutely love it, use it!! Is very good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It does exactly what it says!!!</li>
    <li> I read this and thought it too good to be true, but for the price figured it was worth a shot. I suffer from embarrassing underarm sweat regardless off the temperature, meaning I have to avoid certain fabrics and can only comfortably wear black or white tops.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product as a last ditch attempt before considering botox and I&#x27;m on my third day of application. It has made a huge difference already!! Much less dampness and no smell whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;Using as directed so far (spraying onto a cotton pad before wiping onto skin) and no irritation. Slight itching sensation after application but managable.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading these reviews you are obviously struggling. For such a reasonable price you should definitely give it a try, it genuinely has worked for me in a very short space of time!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I have been using prescription Drysol for over a year to control scalp sweat.  But Drysol burns and stings my scalp to the point I almost can&#x27;t use it anymore. They say to put Drysol on before bed but there is no way I could sleep with all that stinging on my head. Odaban is the same medication as Drysol but in a lower dose.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  It takes a few more days of use to get the results you want, but I can sleep in this product.  You will need to use it every night for about 4-5 nights to get the desired result.  Then use for 1-2 nights every other week to maintain.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Way too long to arrive and Way Too small amount for the money...works as advertised!</li>
    <li> If you have overactive sweat glands, this is for you. I&#x27;ve been using Odaban since 2007. When I first started using this spray I used it once a month. Almost 5 years later and I only have to use it once a year. Works wonders and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my armpits sweating through my shirt anymore!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Totally stopped my underarm sweating and my groin area..... No complaints. It started working the next day as the box said that it would.</li>
    <li> Was delivered really quick ... I have tried pretty much everything else but finally this antiperspirant has stopped my excessive underarm sweat. I don&#x27;t rate products this is my first but find the reviews helpful to me so thought I&#x27;d give this one a review. I&#x27;ve noticed some itching the night and morning after I spray ... But so worth it to feel confident wearing clothes that there won&#x27;t be pit stains. Started working pretty quick I used it 3-5 days in a row at first but now just 1-2 times a week and use certain dri am in the morning. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product.  I bought it to control my excessive underarm sweat.  It was embarrassing to have sweaty arm pits at work. Regular antiperspirant just didn&#x27;t prevent it. Using Odaban I no longer sweat at my desk! I feel normal again.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream . This product works very well I use it on my forehead because I sweat a lot from there . Definitely recommended . Don&#x27;t be afraid to order just because is coming from the uk shipping is decent, I had the product before I knew it .</li>
    <li> Wow! Finally something that actually works - I can&#x27;t believe it!! My advice is to follow the directions exactly and you will be free of annoying, embarrassing sweaty armpits. This is a festivas miracle for nervous sweaty people!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT... I GOT IT FOR A FRIEND AND SHE IS VERY HAPPY. DELIVERY WAS QUICK. PRICE WAS RIGHT BUT DON&#x27;T EXPECT A BIG SPRAY.</li>
    <li> This product is great! If you are an excessive sweater like I am, and no other deodorant seems to work, this try this! It&#x27;ll last forever. I buy one bottle every 3-5 months (not a big winter sweater). You only need to use 2-3 a week (first week, use every day). Apply at night before bed and wash in the morning. Smells really bad when applied but you&#x27;ll get use to it. Doesn&#x27;t help with smell. I still use a little deodorant every other day for smell but the sweating has stopped! Great for underarms but I have used it for my chest and scalp sometimes. I&#x27;m sure it would be great for feet too.&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: Will sting a little but not painful; and it has stained one shirt of mine but when I washed it the stain came out. Do not get in eyes or mouth!</li>
    <li> I have all of a sudden started excessively sweating from my head this year and only purchased this because I saw people commenting that it did work on them for that situation. For me it didn&#x27;t, but I can&#x27;t say that it may not work for you.</li>
    <li> I am an RN and was interested in reading other peoples reviews of this used not just at the arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered both this and Drichlor.  They are essentially the same and similar price.  The dif is this comes in a small squirt bottle and is only 30ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for money savings I&#x27;d just recommend buying a small squirt bottle and pouring the 75ml Drichlor into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both contain the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;20% aluminum chloride.  Both recommend applying at night and with reduced frequency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both about $10 for&lt;br /&gt;30ml Odaban&lt;br /&gt;75ml Drichlor (2.5 times as much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the spray bottle much more than the roll on however Drichlor comes as a bottle and you can add the roll on roller or just keep it as a bottle of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have successfully used both to prevent moisture on my face, pits, and as a guy my groin!  That was the main reason I wanted to try either of them.  I sweat excessively at my groin.  It feels gross and makes my skin raw and inflamed.  This has kept me dry!  Being dry has changed my comfort level big time.  It works quick and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said I will prob just keep the spray bottle and refill with less expensive Drichlor.  Same results.  Half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd purchase of this product because NOTHING but this has worked for me before!!!! This does.... and i do use more sprays or back to back for a couple of days, but then I can go without for a while and it ACTUALLY WORKS!!! You do have to suffer with the tingling and a bit of sting, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s doing the job and if you have had over active sweat glands in your armpits like me, you would find it to be soooooo worth it! Where has it been all my life &amp;#60;3  ?</li>
    <li> It does its job thats for sure. It just stings a little but it has been the first thing that has worked for me. Make sure to follow directions exactly!</li>
    <li> bought for my son. He said it works but burns like crazy when it first goes on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a really sweaty guy, no matter the weather. But Odaban totally takes care of my problem. Use it once, maybe twice a week and even in the hot, humid summers I&#x27;m good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL THOUGH, this is powerful stuff. Read the directions, understand the directions, and use it like they tell you to. I&#x27;ve given myself a burn or two from over-applying, or from thinking that I should be fine using it after a shower. This isn&#x27;t kids stuff, it&#x27;s seriously strong.</li>
    <li> Use as directed and your underarms will not perspire when they typically should not be.</li>
    <li> The product helps to keep my hands a little dry, but not NEARLY as much as I thought it would. They still sweat a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for nearly a week and still no progress. I&#x27;ll start using talc at night and putting on gloves to help out the product, but I have little hope it&#x27;ll help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hands only get a little sweaty, this product may work for you, but I guess my sweaty hands are too much.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything under the sun for years...nothing has ever worked like this product. I see that people complain about it stinging a little...or a lot. Obviously they do not suffer from extreme perspiration otherwise it would be a small acceptable price to pay for.......dryness.! Hooray! I am HOOKED forever!</li>
    <li> Working great. My son works outdoors and he feels much more confident and have to change clothing two three times a day because of the effectiveness of this product. WE ARE REORDERING!  Do wish it came faster and wasn&#x27;t so costly but that is the trade off ... we are willing to do for this for the security this product delivers!</li>
    <li> My fiancé has a sweat problem and over the years has tried many products to promises to stop sweating. I bought Odaban for him to try and he was really pleased with the results. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my feet and It does what it says.  I did not give it five stars because, even though I don&#x27;t sweat into my shoes anymore, it feels like I&#x27;m sweating, as if I was sweating inside.  Maybe this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to be, I don&#x27;t know enough about body reactions to express a good opinion about that.  I like expensive shoes and the sweat was ruining them, so for that I&#x27;m thankful.  It did take care of the sweat.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used it for 1 month as described in directions. I did not notice a difference, and actually some areas became worse.</li>
    <li> Works great for our sweaty hands.  I have a child who&#x27;s a teenager and hands sweat like crazy right now.  This has stopped it!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant product I have ever used that actually kept me dry.  When I say dry, I mean like desert dry.  So sometimes I have to actually put moisturizer on my armpits, otherwise they become violently itchy. But its a small price to pay for me to actually feel like a woman again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be warned: this is a very strong product so it may not be for some people with sensitive skin.  The first few weeks of using it I had TERRIBLE burning (seriously, like fire) and itching and had to use creams to soothe it.  But my skin got used to it and the product works so well that it was worth it (guess I was desperate).</li>
    <li> I am one of those that has had to buy certain shirts because of sweating.  Ever since the first night of using this product, I haven&#x27;t had any problem.  I use it every other night.  Had 1 day of a little red irritation but it healed quick.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I suffer from excessive sweating and I have never been able to find any product, men or womens, that would lessen my sweating.&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions on the bottle and spraying one squirt on each under arm at night and then washing off in the morning (only once or twice weekly) really does work.&lt;br /&gt;The first week of using this product I kept checking my underarms as I was in disbelief that I wasn&#x27;t damp. I was able to switch back to women&#x27;s deodorant and it is effective when I supplement it with Odaban.&lt;br /&gt;This product is also safe to use on other parts of the body, I have also tried it on my feet and the nape of my neck and it is just effective there!&lt;br /&gt;My only advice to anyone about to try this product, DO NOT APPLY TO BROKEN SKIN!!!! The first time I applied it my skin was broke out from using men&#x27;s deodorant and it burned so bad that I couldn&#x27;t put my arms down for hours after squirting it onto my underarms. The burning literally brought tears to my eyes, it felt like I had dumped rubbing alcohol on myself!&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict: This product really works and it is effective at reducing/eliminating perspiration.</li>
    <li> I bought this spray for my mother. It can preserve from sweat, but not so good, that she want. Again she has problem with sweat :(&lt;br /&gt;May be she has problem with health, so spray can&#x27;t help with it.</li>
    <li> It burns like hell for the first minute after you put it on, but its the only thing to ever actually work! So the uncomfort is worth it considering how uncomfortable I was being wet all day!</li>
    <li> I used this and it didnt WORK. I tried AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN and AGAIN still didnt work....SMMFH</li>
    <li> Took a little bit of time to get rolling, but now my hands are completely dry. Easy application before night time, just spray the affected area, make sure you didn&#x27;t miss any spots (in my case the very tips of my fingers and the sides of my palms were spots I often missed) and sleep! No need to apply in the morning, just once a night.</li>
    <li> My husband sweats profusely and he absolutely loves this stuff.  No more wet arm pits.  He highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products and this one actually worked! I have had very mild burning but not enough to notice! I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after the first night so I tried again the next night and I was outside in 90+ heat and not a single drop of sweat!! Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews! The price is definitely worth it!! :)</li>
    <li> Did not reicive an item. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This is the Only over the counter that works, there is nothing in the US like it!!  Its a god send.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly a life saver.  I used to have under arm wetness all the time.  A couple sprays under each arm before I go to sleep for about a week and I am dry all day.  I can go about a month and then do it again for a week.  Sometimes it lasts longer and sometimes I can go for more than a month but it seriously works.  I first found this about 10 years ago when you could only get it from Europe and wait about a month to get it, now through Amazon it is super convenient.  This is much less money than injections  and works so much better!!</li>
    <li> It has been nothing short of a war fighting hyperhydrossis.Without the help of doctors,meds,etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all different types of antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;Certain dri was the first brand to give me hope.I mean,when I first got it.It would last 3 or 4 days at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I thought to myself,problem solved.But after a few months,I started to notice that it just wasn&#x27;t working anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I thought,&amp;#34;does this stuff expire?&#x27;Its almost as if my body got use to it.Or maybe I just bought a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;It got to the point to where I had to wear certain dri,and a clinical brand(Gillette clinical) at the same time to stop sweat,and mask odor.&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Driclor,which works also(by itself).But when I came back to purchase it again,the price had seriously gone up.And I was like No Way.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought Odaban which so far works better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried.When you first get the bottle,you&#x27;ll think what the heck,this bottle is REAL small.But after you spray it twice under each armpit,you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised by the results.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn or anything.Barely even a tingle.It has kind of an alcohol smell and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;It says you can even put it on your face,(but not spray directly on your face.Use a gauze pad or something).But I haven&#x27;t tried that.&lt;br /&gt;Another tip I learned to help stop sweating a lot is to drink milk.Its a natural tranquilizer.And try green tea.Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face and neck and it works extremely well! I would recommend applying it every 3 nights or so because it will ware off.</li>
    <li> I purchased Odaban for my husband, who has an excessive underarm perspiration problem. He sweats through an undershirt, dress shirt, and suit jacket, even while sitting still in a meeting. Additionally, conventional deodorants/antiperspirants give him a terrible underarm allergic rash. He was having to get his suit jackets dry-cleaned quite frequently, which isn&#x27;t ideal.  He tried the Odaban according to the directions, literally having nothing to lose. Regarding the reports of stinging, he has pretty sensitive underarm skin, but he reported only a mild sensation of warmth. We were concerned that Odaban may cause an allergic rash, but it did not. He called me from work on the second day, thrilled with the results. His underarms were completely dry! To hear the relief and joy in his voice was so wonderful after watching him struggle with this problem for so many years. He has been using the product for one week now and is extremely pleased. We recommend Odaban to anyone who is struggling with excess perspiration.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertsied and has made me a very happy customer. Following the instructions on the package, I no longer experience ridiculous and random sweating. Not only does the Odoban spray work wonders, but after the first few applications it only needs to be applied maybe a couple times a week. Great product that has solved so many problems.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: been using this since May and I don&#x27;t sweat under my arms any longer. It does itch a bit but worth it to me. I use it twice a week at night and the next day I itch some but not unbearable.     This product works IF I use it at least every 3 nights. I did have to use it four nights in a row at first to see a result. I can&#x27;t go a week or two weeks like some have stated. I am not dry as a bone, but don&#x27;t have soaked armpits like I did before. So I still have to be selective in my clothing choices :(  It does work better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. Doesn&#x27;t burn unless you have broken skin or a rash.  It does have a stronge odor, but other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I will not exaggerate, this product changed my life. I had excessive sweating on my feet, hands, buttocks and armpits. Dripping wetness that would soak anything i touched and leave wet imprints on any chair. I tried many things like sweatblock which only helped me a little untill i found this. Now i pretty much only sweat when normal people would sweat in hot conditions or when exerting myself (sometimes not even then) I was miserable before using odaban and now cant imagine going without it.</li>
    <li> iv had hyperhydrolisis my wholr life, always hated hideing my arm pits or makeing sure i didnt sit close to people. on top of being very shy i figured no guy wud date me and if he liked me he wudnt after he saw and smelled my armpits, all summer and winter. used maxim for a good paranoid that i was still sweating year and then it stoped working, and wasnt supose to lol. been miserable for last 4 years first boy friend and all at 25, found this,stuff and the formula doesnt break down from the product touching your sweaty armpits. i love it hav my 1st bottle like 5 months remember to use it less.,i may get a tiny smell not offten but never sweaty arm pits</li>
    <li> I loved this product for the first few weeks &amp; slowly unfortunately it&#x27;s potency and effectiveness wore off.</li>
    <li> This item is not effective for hand palm at all.</li>
    <li> Okay if you&#x27;ve ever had to deal with Hyperhydrosis you&#x27;ve probably heard the disclaimer that everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is different, results will vary. Well after thirty plus years of dealing with excessive sweating I&#x27;ve finally found something that responds to mine!&lt;br /&gt;Few details, Asian, average build, and suffered from cranial sweating. The descriptions said could take up to few weeks to a month to work, but I got results the very next day! I should mention though there are a few things to be warned of. As the other reviews mentioned there is some burning or prickling, especially on the more sensitive areas, ie. Upper lip, corners of nose. This can keep you up at night so do yourself a favor and buy the 2 dollar baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;Also when the product starts working your body will start sweating in other places to compensate for not sweating in the usual spots. This is normal and if you&#x27;ve read enough about Hyperhydrosis you know we need to sweat to be healthy. That being said still way better than dripping sweat all over your face, all day. I&#x27;m excited to get into more social situations to really test it out, but since using Odaban, I&#x27;ve been working, and exercising with definite results.</li>
    <li> I got this Antiperspirant because in the summer my shoes smell after just a few wearings. I assumed I had overly smelly feet and researched this. I honestly cant say that it works or does not because I didn&#x27;t really follow through. You have to put it on after you clean your feet, leave it on all night and then wash it off in the morning. Putting it on after a shower was fine but I kept forgetting to wash it off iin the morning. I guess I am just spacey or lazy but it wasn&#x27;t like a normal deoderant where you just apply and go.</li>
    <li> For years I have tried other antiperspirants and they would sort of work or would not work at all. Within 1 week of use I noticed a huge difference! It is saving all of my dress clothes. Amazing product and would recommend it to anyone that has problems with perspiration!</li>
    <li> After 4 days, I no longer overly sweat from my head and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I work out, I&#x27;m hot, very little head sweat now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to get a product that does what it says.</li>
    <li> This products has been used before. Results are just as good as ever.. Would and do recommend to others. Very pleasing to know that it remains available</li>
    <li> Since the first day that I used this product it drastically reduced the amount that I would sweat, and after about a week of use my underarms were completely dry! This is amazing, I have tried so many other antiperspirants and absolutely nothing would work for me.  I would be embarrassed wearing anything that would show sweat but now i can wear anything!  If nothing else works for you give this a shot it is honestly the best money i have ever spent!! It&#x27;s so simple to use just a spray or two every night before bed and I am completely sweat free!! There was some slight discomfort the first night or two but it was nothing that i couldn&#x27;t tolerate, especially after seeing the results, I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for those &amp;#34;difficult moments&amp;#34;! 100% effective! Just give it a try and for sure you will be satisfied!</li>
    <li> Seriously, some of the other reviewers are hostile!  Okay, I&#x27;ve been using Certain Dri for over a year and it&#x27;s worked great for my underarms.  However, for my hands and feet I didn&#x27;t see any improvement (even with daily use for two weeks).  I tried Odaban and I have to agree, not only didn&#x27;t it work I think some areas became worse.  I used it every day as directed:  washed, clean, dry areas at bedtime for three weeks and no improvement.  The directions also indicate to wash it off in the morning which I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought SweatBlock and used it for two nights in a row and see an improvement. It&#x27;s pricey, but if I wind up using less overall and it&#x27;s effective it&#x27;s worth it to me.  Plus, it has some natural scent which smells like cloves to me.  I&#x27;m much happier with SweatBlock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned taking a long time to receive it. I received mine in less than a week (Odaban).</li>
    <li> This product is a life changer!!&lt;br /&gt;My son and I were the heaviest sweaters I&#x27;d ever known......We can both wear lite gray now with no worries!!</li>
    <li> It is works but I got an irritation. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Incredible&lt;br /&gt;I have hyperhydrosis on my face and armpits. I could not walk up a couple flights of stairs without dripping in sweat. Now I can go to the gym for 2 hours and barely perspire at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would like to see improvement on is the shipping speed. Takes literally 3 weeks to a month to get to my house in the US.</li>
    <li> Tried many antipersperants and this is the first that i would rate as a  truely life changing product.&lt;br /&gt;I use twice a week and have switched to just a light deoderant because i have zero sweat now.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work for hands or feet, but it cant be better for underarms. I turned my wife and a friend onto this and get nothing but thank yous over and over.&lt;br /&gt;Had slight irritation first use but went away next application.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a year and still using this product. Since I&#x27;m not sweating at all, I can wear shirts several times before laundering. Probably saved the cost in dry cleaning already. Love it.</li>
    <li> Odaban is one of the best products to self care. However it would be greater if they had a big package option.</li>
    <li> I have been using Odaban for about two weeks now. It has decreased my sweating. I apply it in my underarm area. I am a heavy sweater and I am pleased with the reduction in sweating. I am hoping to be completely dry in my underarm area with continued use. Shipping was quick, it arrived in two weeks via USPS instead of the projected 1 month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sweat like a malarial hog all of my adult life. In any weather, I could wipe my forehead and find sweat on my hand, even in sub-zero conditions, to say nothing about the rest of my body. After applying Odaban for two consecutive days (following the directions closely), it&#x27;s like I am occupying a normal body now. I can actually go work out without looking like a water balloon exploding in slow motion. I can drive across town and my back won&#x27;t be wet from the driver&#x27;s seat. It is truly liberating to now be able to go about in public without feeling like the Amazing Slug Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have tried other powerful, even prescription-level products. Maybe it&#x27;s the application method, maybe it&#x27;s the formulas the different makers are using. Whatever the cause, Odaban remains the only antiperspirant to produce the effect I want. I highly recommend it to anyone suffering from hyperhidrosis.</li>
    <li> the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything. This is the only deodorant that works for me. I use it every couple of days and I apply it when my skin is completely dry. This enhances the effect and then it does not burn your under pits. It is a great way to always wear colorful shirts even when it is 110 degrees outside. I recommend!</li>
    <li> This was an outstanding product. It worked just as explained on the box. I will defiantly purchase again. Thank you</li>
    <li> Tried this for hyperhydrosis of hands.  Did not work.  May work for others.  Waste of money.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never use a deodorant that is kept me so dry. Finally I can wear T-shirts again this summer. I&#x27;m going to order several bottles.</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles of spray for my daughter who has always had sweaty feet.  She is using this in combination with Odaban foot and shoe powder and has had great success, quickly, with the products.</li>
    <li> very indifferent about this product, I dont see a difference with my sweating at all and i have hyperhidrosis. :-(</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old... since I was in the teens I always suffered from excessive sweating caused by hypderhidrosis. If you too suffer from Hyperhidrosis then you definitely know how it feels and what life is like with it. Ever since I discovered this product from Odaban, I am soooooo grateful and relieved. I AM A NORMAL PERSON NOW! I&#x27;m not the weird one out of a group of people that&#x27;s overly sweating for no good reason. I&#x27;m not constantly and purposely trying to avoid social gatherings or people because of my sweating problems anymore and I owe that to Odaban.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re reading this Odaban, thank you so much. Even though I also sent you guys an e-mail for changing my life, I&#x27;d like to say that on here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply this spray. You apply it at night time before you go to bed in the troubled areas that sweat a lot, and for me that would be mostly my head/face and my bum (This spray works all over the body just so you know). The next day it already had taken effect! I couldn&#x27;t believe it... I was at first speechless and just shocked. I couldn&#x27;t believe all this time all I needed was a spray??? a simple spray of some kind of naturally blended chemicals to apply to my face and the sweat is gone!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lists that it has an effect of 24hrs or more. You don&#x27;t even need to apply it every day. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now and I am so happy now to be dry and not constantly wiping my face and hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one side effect that it has that I have noticed and that is \\&quot;Phantom Sweats/sweating\\&quot;. It&#x27;s when you get the sensation that you&#x27;re sweating but there&#x27;s actually no perspiration or sweat present on the skin it&#x27;s completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much and god bless to you Odaban!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would give this 1 million stars! definitely worth the $13 dollars to change my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change your life like I did guys...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[[ASIN:B001O1M6II B001O1M6II]]&gt;Odaban Antiperspirant Spray 30 Ml&lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li> Save my life. I use it once every two weeks and that&#x27;s all I need. I would recommend it. I&#x27;ll never stop using this.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving this 5 stars is because I can&#x27;t give it more. This is the only product I have found that works. I have tried all kinds of different antiperspirants and none of them worked AT ALL. I figured what the heck, I&#x27;d give this a shot. It was a little pricey with the overseas shipping, but it wasn&#x27;t all that much more than the \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; stuff I had tried from Target or Wal Mart or wherever.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it. It started working from day one even though the directions said it might take a couple of days. Now I only use it once or twice a week and it is working great. Once or twice a week is about all I can remember to use it too since even after having it a while it is still not part of my routine to use it before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I think this might be one of the very few items I have purchased that I am completely satisfied with. I will for sure be buying this again.</li>
    <li> My son was becoming self-conscious about underarm sweating. Gave this a try, after reading positive reviews. It works! Self-confidence restored.  Definitely would suggest trying.</li>
    <li> My second bottle, very happy with the product. Not as long lasting as drysol, but also not as harsh with less burn and less dry skin. When you use this product use it as directed and be prepared to use lotion where ever you use it on you body the next morning after you wash it of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part of my body that sweats long before I&#x27;m actually hot is also the most visible, my forehead. Its embarrassing and it also happens to be the part of my body that sweats the most when I am actually hot, to the point of wiping my forehead results in sweat flinging of my hand. With this spray I feel confident going into public on hot days knowing I wont be embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is also very effective at controlling foot odor, %90 of foot odor is caused by your feet sweating.</li>
    <li> I was so excited after the long wait for my Odaban. I put it on before I went to bed, problem was I couldn&#x27;t sleep. My armpits were all red and the skin was literally burning off &amp; started bleeding. Im great with pain, but this pain was excruciating! It felt like I had a million paper cuts on my armpit &amp; someone was pouring alcohol on it. Odaban worked very well, it stopped my hyperhydrosis which I was very happy about, but I dont think it&#x27;s worth all this pain. I also did some research and read that the ingredients in Odaban are very bad for the body and can cause cancer. Great product, but at what cost?</li>
    <li> This product smells like drinking alcohol when applied and I felt dizzy each time I applied this.  It temporarily relieves sweating but the product &amp;#34;Sweat Block&amp;#34; works phenomenally.</li>
    <li> I really was hopping for it to work but it made me smell worst :(. It also take a really long time to dry.</li>
    <li> If you have hyperhydrosis, this stuff will work for you. Yes, it will sting, but not as much as some of the other brands that work. What I also particularly like about this one is the fact that it comes in a sprayer, not a dauber or roll on. If you use this, you can wear silk the next day. It works almost as well as Botox, and it won&#x27;t stain your black clothes. If you get it shipped form the UK, like I did, expect it to take a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have always been a really sweaty person. I would sweat for no apparent reason, especially under my arms. I would have to change my shirt or undershirt at least once every day to feel dry and clean. I had tried the prescription strength of all of the major brands of antiperspirant deodorants and none of them worked. I felt like I was constantly trying to mask my under arm sweat and smell. I went on the hunt for something other than an antiperspirant deodorant. That&#x27;s when I came upon Odaban. After reading the reviews of other people on the product I decided it was worth a try. I have never been more happy with a product. It has literally changed my life. The first few weeks of using it, my under arms would feel irritated and itchy because I was using it every day, but they weren&#x27;t sweating! I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year and only spray it on about once a week and my underarms are ALWAYS dry. It&#x27;s amazing. Just remember that if your underarms are itching out of control or they start peeling, you&#x27;re using it too often. I do use a natural (Toms) non antiperspirant deodorant in the morning, just to stay fresh smelling throughout the day. If you are constantly dealing with underarm sweat and want to stop it, definitely try this product!</li>
    <li> It really works. Keeps your hands dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  Facial sweating runs in my family, that plus menopause...ugh!  I was pleasantly surprised to find my facial sweating had significantly decreased after the first application!  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This product works and works well. If you have a sweating issue, you need to try this right away. Make sure to read the directions and apply it correctly.</li>
    <li> really irritating to skin - have not used more than twice</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to really help with perspiring.  However, you must follow the directions carefully.  The first time I used it, I used too much and ended up with burns on my armpits.  Oww!!  That said, I have used it since and have not had that problem again.  You really need to apply it about every week.</li>
    <li> I have had over active sweat glands my entire life, and could never find an antiperspirant deodorant that really worked. Even the strongest had no significant effect. I found out about Odaban from a friend, and have been using it for about a year now. It works amazingly. For the first few months I applied it every day or so for a week, and then was fine the rest of the month. Now I apply a few days every two months or so-the problem is effectively gone. Great product! Can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
    <li> Works well. Use cotton ball to apply. Make sure your face is dry. Powder helps.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from hyperhidrosis my entire life just like many of the other reviewers. I can recall being laughed at in kindergarten when we had to hold hands. Since I was 12 years old I have tried Maxim, Certain Dry, Drysol, Drionic (the cheap iontophersis machine), biofeedback, hypnosis, Botox injections in my palms (very painful and very expensive), Sweatblock and MED e TATE towelettes.  I have been using Odaban for the last 10 years. I have always ordered from their website. I am thrilled to find it on Amazon. My advice and comments:    -Historically the only product that worked for my underarms was Drysol.  It never worked on my hands or feet.  Like another reviewer, Drysol stopped working as effectively as it had in the past. I bought Odaban while visiting England and I was hooked.  -Ladies, do not shave your underarms for at least two days before application  -Wait until you are about to go to bed to apply.  If you do it earlier you may start to perspire.  -Apply the product with a cotton ball or spray on your fingers and dab on. This will decrease the potential for stinging. If you spray your armpits I feel like too much product is applied and overspray gets to other areas of the body.  -After the product dries, put on a tight cotton tshirt. This helps to protect nice clothes and I feel like it keeps the product where it needs to be.  -I only have to apply Odaban every 3 weeks to a month for my underarms since I have used the product for so long. I would suggest experimenting to see what you need. Less is more.  -As I mentioned, unfortunately, I perspire everywhere. I will occasionally put a VERY small amount on my upper lip (I suggest a small patch test if you opt to do this), at the nape of my neck and my lower back.  -Odaban does help decrease palmer and plantar sweating, but not to the 100% cessation I experienced with my armpits. I have noticed the same feedback on other posts. I will say that with the hands and feet I have found that nightly application is needed for a least a week. It does not cause the itching as sometimes seen with the armpit application. It does make the hands very dry.  I put on cotton socks and if I am feeling really dedicated I will put on gloves to keep the product on my hands.  I think that I stop with the hand application too soon because I forget and I&#x27;m too lazy to get back out of bed!    I hope this is helpful. I have seen comments concerned with the connection of aluminum containing products and Alzheimer&#x27;s.  I understand that concern and there is data on both sides of the argument. Only my fellow reviewers will understand the heartbreak of being laughed at as a child during games, people pointing at my sweat ringed top, avoiding social situations and having people recoil after they touch your hand.  I recently had a doctor wipe his hands on his pant leg after he shook my hand.  I am a successful business woman and the perspiration is not anxiety related. It&#x27;s just me--my father, uncle, nephew, and grandmother all have (or had) hyperhidrosis. I wish the best to all.</li>
    <li> I started using this spray before going to bed as the instructions says, and I noticed that its working fine.BUT the itch will drive you crazy and may leave you with scratches on your armpit. Cant use it anymore because it burns the skin after a couple applications.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on/off for the past 4-5 years and have been pleased with the results.  I tried another brand but it caused itching so I stopped it.  With this product, I feel it gives a very generous delivery of medicine so you don&#x27;t use as much of it. It still causes some drying (so my skin flakes sometimes), but if that happens, I just stop using for about a week.</li>
    <li> Even though I followed instructions by applying it sparingly with a cotton pad, at bedtime, not near the time of a bath or shower, and rinsed it off in the morning, it still gave me a chemical burn where I&#x27;d applied it.  Won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years and now either my feet are used to it or it is not as strong as it used to be.</li>
    <li> Out of the several antiperspirants I&#x27;ve tried such as Certain-Dri, Maxim, and Odaban, Odaban did its job the best out of the rest. I never had an issue with over sweating while I had this product applied. However, I felt a slight burning and itching throughout the day with this product where I haven&#x27;t with the others. I am not sure if it is just my skin being sensitive or the product being more chemically harsh.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I followed the directions carefully because I did not want to have a bad reaction - I had no problem.  Now I use it about once a week.  It definitely works!  I live in Houston and I am outside all the time with my sons who play baseball.  The sweating under my arms really made me feel uncomfortable.  I had tried everything, including changing my wardrobe to all dri fit clothing!  I can really see and tell a difference.  I would not recommend spraying directly on your skin.  I would spray a very small amount on a makeup remover pad and gently dot on the area you are applying to.  Only use at night.  It took a couple of weeks to notice a difference but I was motivated to give it a try.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend insisted I try Odaban when we were talking about how much I perspire. He raved about it, saying he doesn&#x27;t even need to use it anymore because it has stopped his underarm perspiration completely. I said, &amp;#34;Bring it on!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about once a month now, and my shirts are dry at the end of my shift in the factory!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an annoying spokesperson to all my friends and family ever since!!</li>
    <li> really works. especially after stinky teen boys coming home from sports</li>
    <li> Good experience  Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com  [...]</li>
    <li> This works just like it says, I like this so much more than the little wipes - to spray a couple like squirts is all that&#x27;s required!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. The application, since is in spray, is really convenient, but the product itself, is not quite good as Maxim.</li>
    <li> I have been using Odaban for 14 years. It works! I use once a week like directed and it really works. One bottle will last for years since it takes only just a tiny spritz once a week. In all those years of using weekly, I will be buying my fourth bottle. Glad to see Amazon finally selling it.</li>
    <li> Best anti transpirant ever</li>
    <li> My daughter and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  It keeps our clothing dry under our arms; nothing else has worked as well, or even at all!  I purchased this product at an earlier date and also let my daughter try it.  We both sweat under our arms alot and when wearing dark clothing it really showed.  It was really embarrasing!!!  I researched products on-line that might help and came across this product.  We couldn&#x27;t believe it, but it worked beautifully.  So this is the second time that I have ordered this product (ordered 4 bottles) and will continue to do so whenever we run out!!! THANK YOU!!! I have never bothered to write a review before, but I HAD TO this time!</li>
    <li> I bought this cause I&#x27;m one of the few girls in my gym class that actually tries to excersize and I&#x27;m also a heavy sweater. The two don&#x27;t go well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions said to make sure to avoid spraying when you will be active and wait one hour after showering to apply. I did so for the first few nights and the spray actually worked. However, I shower at night right before going to sleep so I&#x27;d have to adjust my routine to showering an hour before sleeping. Somehow, I still haven&#x27;t been able to do that and, as such, have not been able to use the spray as often as I should.</li>
    <li> Was delivered early. Unfortunately gave me underarm rash. However, worked well on face, neck, arms, and hands - comparable to prescription product but easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Works great, so far I&#x27;m wearing it for a week and a half and my sweat on my underarms went to 0% I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> What a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE A SWEATING PROBLEM, I WOULD DEFINITELY JUST TRY THIS PRODUCT. AT THE AGE OF 10 I BEGAN HATING HAVING TO WEAR ANYTHING BUT BLACK. UP UNTIL RECENTLY I COULD WEAR BRIGHT COLORS AND NOT HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD. THIS PRODUCT IS DEFIANTLY LIFE CHANGING. GET IT ASAP!&lt;br /&gt;  *** IF YOU LIKE SHAVING EVERYDAY, I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE YOU WILL ITCH LIKE CRAZY. I USUALLY APPLY THIS PRODUCT AT NIGHT BEFORE HAVING TO SHAVE THE NEXT DAY ***</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with sweating from my scalp - PROBLEM SOLVED!.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> For the individual who wrote the review titled \\&quot;Waste of time and money\\&quot;, did you try applying to your underarms via cotton pad? This might mitigate some of the irritation and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought the product, I sprayed it directly underneath the center of my armpits. By morning, I would get a really bad eczema rash, which I hadn&#x27;t seen since childhood. I applied generous amounts of Eucerin and Hydrocortisone creams to heal the underarm area, although it took a few days of applying these creams regularly to reduce the eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am using Odaban three times a week via cotton pad. It seems to reduce sweating, although moisture has not disappeared entirely. I will still start sweating by morning as soon as I get working on a computer (like now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other question lingering is what to do about odor, for which Odaban does not seem to mitigate. After showering in the morning with Dove soap, the odor does not appear to fully dissipate. I am unsure what to use underneath my arms after drying off. When I apply a typical Old Spice deodorant that I&#x27;ve used in the past, it often re-triggers sweating! Do you have suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/28/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using Odaban after about four weeks. It wasn&#x27;t the right product for me. I sweat more not less during this treatment. I suspect it was irritating my skin, which outweighed its supposed benefits to reduce perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most helpful solution I found most was to stop washing my underarms with soap every day in the shower. Now that I wash my underarms a few times a week instead of daily, sweating has notably dissipated. Sometimes to mask residual odor, I use Nivea Dry Impact spray around the underarm, but not directly in the armpit.</li>
    <li> I came across this product by accident! I suffer from hyperhydrosis like so many of you that have reviewed or reading reviews. Well, look no further this ODABAN WORKS! I have tired everything over the counter and botax and this beyond surpasses all my expectations. I&#x27;m finally feeling confident again wearing my dark dresses for work with out the fear of sweaty underarms or horrendous underarm smell. Hyperhydrosis is very embarrassing and definitely keeps your arms down. Give this product a try you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Effective but can cause irritation .read and follow directions.</li>
    <li> Man, this stuff can cause some serious discomfort when I try to sleep at night after application. However, this is worth it considering the embarrassment of sweaty arm pits at work. Now, I can still sweat through my shirt under heavy stress/physical work, but for every day activities, this keeps my pits relatively dry. Biggest problem for me, is remembering the apply it every 2-3 days before I go to bed, haha.</li>
    <li> Odaban saved my life. I used to sweat like crazy no matter if i was doing anything physical or not. I could be sitting at my desk at work and my arm pits would be soaked.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product a couple of years ago, the first couple of weeks were tough because every time i sprayed it in my armpit area, that area would start burning so bad that i couldnt&#x27; even sleep. It looked like i actually had a burn. It was bad.&lt;br /&gt;I found a solution though: I spray a small amount of the solution on my finger and then i rub it in in my armpit area and that avoids the contact with the outside of the arm pit area. It works like a charm. Dont apply too much, just a little over a curse of a couple days or so and your sweating will prettty much stop for a week or so. Then just apply it once every 2-3 days or maybe once a week and that will keep you dry.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I have hyperhydroisis under my arms.. I sweat so bad and I can never wear silk shirts, or button down shirts because I sweat through them. Its so embarassing...... so i took a &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; and i wore a button down shirt today and its 11:30 and no sweat stains....!! I am acutally shocked thats its working because nothing has worked!! So I will give this 5 stars because for the first time in over 10 year im able to wear my shirts!!</li>
    <li> The Odaban did not ban perspiration or odor. I was not satisfied, like I was hoping to be. I bought this based on other reviews, and the reviews led me to believe this product is strong enough. It is not, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Didnt help me at all.....</li>
    <li> After following the directions for a few days didnt notice any difference. I will stick with my Drysol. Pricey but at least I know it works.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews at all, but this stuff deserves it. I can honestly say it has changed my life. I had zero negative side effects and it worked after the first application. Awesome stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Not recommended for use on the face, which was what i needed it for. I can buy regular antiperspirant from the grocery store for way cheaper if i just needed it for underarms.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I only have to spray once a week and I&#x27;m dry. I wish they had this in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;As with other strong stuff, if you use too much or apply it too often, your skin will react.</li>
    <li> Applied correctly.  After 2 weeks there is no improvement on scalp or underarms.  Literally none.  Secondly it must be pointed out that the pain after applying this to underarms even using a cotton swab, is pretty bad.  It feels like all of the hairs under your arms are being constantly ripped out at the same time.  Lasts around 2 hours and makes it impossible to sleep through, and I&#x27;m a ripped, 190 lb grown man with a high pain tolerance.  Eh....  A waste, but only $15</li>
    <li> It is fantastic if you are trying to stop under arm wetness, but you should be careful of some things. It creates horrible burns! If you do not put on deodorant after applying it, you will wake up with red, giant burn marks on your armpits. It&#x27;ll hurt severely for the first day but will be way better the second day. I clean my armpits with baby wipes before applying. I wait for it to dry and spray Odaban. When I feel my armpits start to itch, I apply Suave clinical strength antiperspirant to prevent the chemical burns Odaban creates. NEVER SCRATCH THE ITCH YOU FEEL!! I can not stress this enough! I scratched when it itched and I woke up with the area I scratched  bright red and burning me whenever my shirt touched it. It says to apply this once a week after a while of use and I have used this for about two months now and the longest I can go with out applying is 2 days. From age 12 to 15, I would always have giant wet spots under my arms(I&#x27;m 17 now) but this has helped completely stop the sweating. Just be careful about how you use this. I am thinking of trying dricolor because Odaban is such a hassle to apply. If you dont apply it properly you&#x27;ll be all sweaty the next day. I would recommend this product because it stops severe sweating, but like I said, be careful on how you apply it.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been by far the best stuff to stop my excess sweating.  I tend to sweat a lot, even when I am not working out or hot.  I have been using Odaban for years and it is great.  Perfect for stopping the sweating. BUT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY do as it says and do not wear it while active...only when going to bed.  I have been irritated by it when I did not wash it off soon enough after waking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff if you are tired of ruining clothes.</li>
    <li> Unsure if it would work...have suffered for years with this problem.  This product is great, worked after a few days!</li>
    <li> i had problems sweating for the longest i cant even remember when i was sweat free, weather it was cold or hot i would sweat. I went tried certain dri solid, roll on, Certain dri AM, Mitchum, EVEN SWEAT BLOCK WHICH DIDNT WORK AT ALL!!! I Felt defeated and thought i would never find a solution to my problem. Then i found odaban applied it the first night, didnt feel a burn or anything feel asleep. the following day at school i felt like a whole new person my armpits where for the frist time completely dry. I COULDNT BELIEVE IT, it has changed everything for me. my self confidence has sky rocketed. Now that i got a job i feel free to try my best without the thought of embarrassment of sweat batches beneath my arms from small tasks. Before i believed my sweat issues were from smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee now with odaban i dont have to worry what i put into my body and i have 0 sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation is to also invest in some regular deodorant because after a long day u do have a bit of body odor, but then it could be just me who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS WAS THE BEST INVESTMENT OF MY LIFE HANDZ DOWN. TRY THIS BEFORE SWEATBLOCK. I BELIEVE THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT.</li>
    <li> Works for 2 weeks for me</li>
    <li> Only a few applications in this bottle,  it is mostly denatured alcohol and does not live up to the cl a ims.  Very unhappy and will mot order this again.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life. I dried RX strength deodorants (Drysol, Certain-Dri, etc), electric shocks to my underarms, and SweatBlock. Absolutely none of those worked. I&#x27;ve had a problem with underarm hyperhydrosis for about 10 years now. About 2 years ago, I stumbled upon Odaban. Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made! I am so much happier and more confident now.</li>
    <li> life ruined because of SWEAT?? no sweat..pay us 12 dollars wait two weeks for delivery- so you will be hyped up.. then use it ..but remember it takes like 2 weeks or a month to start working so..if it don&#x27;t work ..we told you..OK? ..then by the time you see you wasted your money...you will  be thinking about your PROBLEM again...not the refund......[so we keep the money almost every time]it SUCKS folks- use mechanic soap lol  seriously-and hand lotion got even worse reviews.lol</li>
    <li> I sweat through suits. Wearing an undershirt all the time and ruining clothes from smell and sweating has been happening to me for 15 year. I have used doctor prescribed drysol and many others that don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 7 days of using Odaban...the problem is GONE. My only regret is not buying this sooner.</li>
    <li> This is the only antiperspirant that works for me. I order it every year about two to three times a year and wait for it to come in from England. Yes, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great on my palms but you have to be consent I always forget to put it on. But when I do consently it works great.  But you have to know when to ease off.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant for the person who sweats excessively.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to put it on every day and it definitely does the&lt;br /&gt;job.</li>
    <li> satisfied with my purchase. fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I went through a period in my life where literally nothing would stop me from profusely sweating from my armpits and palms. I tried prescription products, covered in saran wrap, etc. Nothing would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across this on Amazon. Based on the reviews, decided to give it a try. Wow! A couple sprays of this product once or twice a week at the effected areas stopped it in its tracks. Buy this if you need an effective way to stop sweating where other antiperspirants don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working pretty good</li>
    <li> I am 41 and suffered with hyperhydrosis since I was 12. I have tried everything short of Botox. I&#x27;ve used every prescription, every underarm pad, and this is the only thing that worked for me... and it works well. I used it a few times the first week, then easily went to about once per week. I can actually wear whatever shirt I want to work meetings! I now usually forget to take it because I&#x27;m no longer obsessed with sweating. I&#x27;ll notice a little sweat and realize it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks. One application and I&#x27;m good for another week. I still use ordinary stick in between. If you are suffering, try it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he sweats a lot and has that sweating disorder.  He started using this and when he uses it properly it really helps.  He does not sweat as much.  Before he would literally be sitting still and sweat would pour from his underarms.  Not anymore!</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant works wonderfully! Stings a bit the first few times you use it, but after that you will barely feel a thing. Stops sweating almost completely and this small bottle lasts a long time!    Update 1/6/15: Just want to add a little background for others who may be in my same situation. I have always dealt with excessive sweating since I was a teen; no white shirts, sweating from simply walking on a warm or hot day, even sweating in the winter. I never did sports or anything strenuous to cause it, just existing was enough. I would use public restroom hand dryers it got that bad lol. I tried every otc, american brand anti-antiperspirant known to man and nothing worked well. Certain dry was as close as I ever got to being sweat free, but it starts to loose it&#x27;s effectiveness over time and never worked exactly how I wanted in the first place. I found out about odaban from some forums on excessive sweating and decided to try it out. Changed. my. life. With regular use I would say that it has reduced my sweating by about 85%-95%, I can now wear whatever I want even in the middle of a hot a humid summer day (95 degrees here). There are days when I don&#x27;t sweat at all. The most I get now is a little bit that barely shows. When you first start using it, it will take a few weeks to slow the sweating down, within the first month you will notice significantly less and less. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and it still works great. Stings a bit at first but you get used to it, just don&#x27;t use after shaving or showering if possible. Good luck!</li>
    <li> it works pretty good to take care of my sweaty palms. i think i will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Ok I have cranial hyperhidrosis for my whole life I don&#x27;t know when I start heating up and then scared that my shirt will be soaked wet, like i just came out of the shower but this Antiperspirant you can use it the night before and it will start working the next day. You might need to take it twice per week but then your set. It might get itchy but the feeling goes away.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t battled with sweaty armpits all my life, really only started occuring about the last 5 or so years. It is definitely embarrassing and humiliating. I looked into the botox and other methods because none of the OTC products worked. I tried SweatBlock and all of variants. After trying all of the other products, this is the only one that works for me. A bottle lasts a long time (over 2 months and counting...) and I have bought a couple spares to have on stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, this stuff works!</li>
    <li> For as long as I can remember I have suffered from excessive sweating; it was eating away at my confidence and causing unnecessary stress in my life. I couldn&#x27;t buy any shirts that were too tight around the underarms and forget about buying shirts/sweaters/blazers that were  certain colors, like gray, green, or light blue. I would sweat through three layers if that&#x27;s what I was wearing that day. I sweat during the coldest winter days as well as in the summer. No deodorant worked for me; not degree, not overnight dove sport, not certain dri, not even a prescribed hyperhydrosis deodorant prescribed to me by my doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Odaban for a couple weeks now, and I was finally able to wear my green blazer in public, lift my arms, and not be sweating! I can&#x27;t believe how well this works. There was a two day period of slight underarm irritation but it has passed. I have changed my shower schedule around a bit but if that&#x27;s all it takes, then I&#x27;m staying with this. As long as you follow the specific directions, this will work for you. I don&#x27;t even use it everyday anymore, I use it MAYBE twice a week. Spend the $10.00 because this will change your life around if you suffer from hyperhydrosis.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is thank you odaban. I finally do not sweat like a fool all the time, and can different colors instead of just white and black. Thank you</li>
    <li> I put this on twice a week, in the mornings and throughout the day I defiantly feel my hands dry.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It works real well.  I will be buying in the future as well.</li>
    <li> It works a little, but the alcohol in it makes my face burn really bad. If I can manage to get through the part where it burns, it will feel ok after about 10 mins when it dries. But I still manage to sweat through this somewhat.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. You use it at night and no sweating the next day. It can irritate the skin if you use too much of it, use it right after showering, or right after shaving. I&#x27;ve tried many other things and this was recommended by a friend and I have to say this is the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Odaban for a few years now.  It has never failed me and I don&#x27;t have to worry that perspiration and odor will creep up on me during the day.  Now my daughter uses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Shipping was faster than expected, and I had high hopes for this spray but it didn&#x27;t make a difference for me.  I gave it a couple weeks and nothing.  The stinging was stronger than others described, and I got a weird taste in my mouth every night I used it (used it on my face fyi).  That alone freaked me out so even if it did work, I&#x27;d probably discontinue use anyway.  Now that I know I don&#x27;t want it I&#x27;m trying to return it, but can&#x27;t seem to find a way, even though I read everything about a product before I buy it and don&#x27;t purchase without a return/money back option.  Could have been my mistake and it&#x27;s only $12 but still a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows of a good treatment for hyperhidrosis that doesn&#x27;t include aluminum, please spread the word!</li>
    <li> it is awesome...it really works!!! Great for teen boys. Will order more for him. love it. Thanks so much. michael</li>
    <li> Definitely works...will dry out your skin and can sting a little bit but overall a very good product</li>
    <li> I use this product since 3 year and i am very happy with it. Everyone should use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This products works! While growing up I had underarm wet rings. Not cool. Embarrassing.  Uncomfortable. As I became an adult I still had the problem. Discovered Odaban and it was life changing. This was well over 10 years ago. The wetness just recently started coming back, bought this product again and within a few days of using it, no more wet spots. Only a  few sprays is all it takes.</li>
    <li> Wow. I was hestitating buying this because most products that promise to do something amazing almost always disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;That is not the case with Odaban.&lt;br /&gt;Do not listen to the people that have negative feedback. They&#x27;re just trolling, and probably didn&#x27;t even apply the product how they should&#x27;ve.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is honestly amazing. If used right, you WILL obtain restults that are simply astonishing.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it for the first time, and the next morning, not ONE drop of sweat under my arms. I have been using it for 3 days now and am sweat and worry free.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though; I thought it would be okay to do 2 small sprays, and this stuff felt like pepper spray under my arms. I had one miserable night trying to sleep with the burn.&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions word by word, it will be okay! Keep it to one small spray, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you suffer from hyperhidrosis like me and many males and females; give Odaban a try.&lt;br /&gt;You will be amazed. Thanks Odaban!</li>
    <li> I have embarrassing perspiration... actually HAD... This is a life changing product and few people would understand but those who do, trust me that this works! It only took a day or two of use and now I use it once every couple days and my freedom is priceless. :)</li>
    <li> The bottle was less than half full and it really hasn&#x27;t helped with my perspiration problem.</li>
    <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
    <li> Again i need an explanation from the manufacturer why this product doesn&#x27;t work at all as claimed.I bought this product with high expectation but totally dissappointed.</li>
    <li> It works!! I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Good but too expensive.  I buy it because it doesn&#x27;t smell and it isn&#x27;t aerosol which smells toxic.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for the last week and my palms are super dry during the evening after I spray. My  sweaty palms are not as bad during the day, but it is still a problem, especially when working out.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the other comments say it takes about 2 weeks to see significant results. Overall it seems like a good product.</li>
    <li> I take ADHD medication that makes me sweat more than I would have liked. I always wore black or always had to have a jacket on because of sweating. The clinical strength  antiperspirants barely helped. This stuff is amazing. It stung a bit the first time I used it. It wasn&#x27;t painful just kind of annoying. The second time I didn&#x27;t feel any stinging. I can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff works. I have had absolutely no sweating. Even after I spent two hours cleaning and had been running around all day there was no underarm wetness. Shipping was extremely fast. I had been given a month shipping estimate since I am in the United States and i got it in a week.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was a little apprehensive in trying this product but after several weeks, I am really impressed on how it works, stops and or prevents the sweating and works well only a few sprays 2x a week.....</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter was having trouble with excessive sweating during the day. She was scared to wear certain colors for fear her sweat stains would be obvious. She started using this a few weeks ago and it has definitely helped. She followed the directions exactly and one week later she noticed a big improvement. She continued to use regular deodorant during the day. We will buy again if her problem persists.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it enough to see if it really works! I tried it once -it didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped but I&#x27;m hopeful that it will work if I continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old male.  I have sweated profusely my entire life.  I sweat so badly that people ask if I&#x27;m nervous about something.  I can sweat through two shirts on a winter day, and that&#x27;s just the drive to work before any work is actually done.  I am not exaggerating, which if your looking into this product, you can most likely relate to my predicament.  After tons of money spent on every antiperspirant and deodorant known to man, including the clinical strength stuff like Certain-Dri, I had given up.  Luckily, I came across the name Odaban.  I did some research, saw the price, and said why the heck not.  I really wish I had found this product in high school.  After the first two nights of spraying one pump onto each underarm, it was already worth every penny.  The third night I was supposed to use the product, I fell asleep on the couch and missed my application for the next day.  It didn&#x27;t matter!  I did not sweat at all that day!  Now that is an antiperspirant!  I have zero burn when I use it, so I am extremely happy.  Don&#x27;t second guess yourself if your researching Odaban.  Just buy it!  You&#x27;ve already tried everything else to stop your excessive sweating... What have you got to lose?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why, but this product did not arrive for over two months, very annoying. It does seem to work, but depending on the area you are applying it, the spray may not work (only upright). Make sure you follow the instructions as it may cause irritation or excessive itching.</li>
    <li> I wish that the manufacturers would make a very similar product that can also be used in the day. This is the best product I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all for me :( was very disappointed</li>
    <li> I sweat way to much from my arm pits. At the beginning it takes time to start working 100%. Eventually after a couple if weeks it work guaranteed!</li>
    <li> I used to sweat all the time under my arms. Now with this handy spray I dont. Be aware follow the directions do not shower or shave before hand better yet wait 3-4hours after showering or shaving because it burns like crazy if you don&#x27;t wait.  I can go 5-7 days after using as directed before I sweat profusely. I still sweat but only when I exercise or do something that requires sweating. I used to go thru my shirts as soon as I put them on now no more. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other product for sweat under arms. Completely stops it after about 2 weeks of using. Now only use about once every two weeks. Awesome product</li>
    <li> I really recommend Odaban.&lt;br /&gt;Even in the Brazilian summer heat, it has kept my pits dry, which is a first!!!&lt;br /&gt;I experienced a bit of a burning sensation when I first applied but that has not been the case for the other times. Overall, it is a great prduct!</li>
    <li> It is better than regular and &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; products.  Small package and certainly did not eliminate all under arm wetness</li>
    <li> My sweating problems have been cured for a year now! I originally used this every night for the first two weeks, then cut down to twice a week. I now only use it once a week, and I no longer have any sweat problems! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> At our house we&#x27;ve tried the old fashioned stuff, which doesn&#x27;t really work.  We&#x27;ve also tried the Certain dry and Sweat block wipes, which are labeled to have the same ingredient as this product, but at a reduced strength.  I don&#x27;t have excessive sweat problems.  I think I&#x27;m pretty typical.  The Certain Dry and Sweat block works great for me.  Both my daughters complain of excessive sweat, feel they can&#x27;t wear many shirts due to the sweating problem.  They say this version works for them, while the others didn&#x27;t.  They say &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34;, which is what I noticed for the Certain Dry/Seat block.  None of us use it every day.  That just doesn&#x27;t seem to work right.  Once every few days works better.  And stick to just the area where you grow hair.  Outside of that or too frequently and it will burn enough to be irritating.</li>
    <li> First off, I don&#x27;t do product reviews this is my very first one. The reason I am doing this is because I remember how helpless I felt dealing with excessive sweating under my arms and hope this will help somebody. I tried certain dri and other clinical deodorants but nothing worked for me. I started to feel hopeless and was about to schedule a doctors appointment until I read about Odaban and saw the positive reviews. I decided to give it a try and I am very glad that I did. I didn&#x27;t really see a difference the first two nights after using it. I did not apply it the third day just to see what would happen and I noticed that I didn&#x27;t sweat at all so I&#x27;m guessing the product just had to settle in. I haven&#x27;t applied it since and my armpits are still dry but I am going to use some tonight just to be on the safe side. This product works and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects at all. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I am a amputee and has a lot of sweat build up into the liner. The product does stop the perspiration however it did cause a rash in several places.  Everyone is different so do try it. It is relatively inexpensive. The downside for most would be it is a small bottle and has to be shipped from England. I received it in about two weeks after ordering.</li>
    <li> Before Odaban I was using certain dry and sweat was dripping down my arms.  After one usage of this product and my sweating was non existant.  I no longer have to plan my outfits every day by how noticeable my sweat rings will be.  I would recommend this product to anyone who sweats excessively.</li>
    <li> First time use and 100% result. This product is incredibly effective.I recommend you buy this amazing spray. I&#x27;m going to buy it over and over again.</li>
    <li> The delivery was amazing it said that I was going to wait like for a month, but it came in a week.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for my hyperhidrosis, but it did work for some extend. Also, I have to put it every night and it doesn&#x27;t improve anything.&lt;br /&gt;It only worked for a limited extend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Odaban for 10 years, the stuff works great!  I can go about two weeks now in between sprays, so a bottle lasts me almost a year.  One problem with this stuff, is when the solution gets down to about 1/3 left, the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work very well, it shoots out a hard line of spray, instead of a gentle mist, I&#x27;ve e-mailed the company about it but they don&#x27;t seem to have a fix.  Besides that, enjoy being sweat free!  Make sure you are 100% dry before putting on before you go to bed or it will burn.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this. I thought that I didn&#x27;t apply enough the 1st time. This time I used more and applied to different parts of my body. Face, hands underarms, feet, chest and etc. I did absolutely nothing. I hope that I wasn&#x27;t scammed with this bottle.</li>
    <li> This product has given my 16 year old son so much more confidence, it worked in under 10 days and I will be ordering more.  I wish it was easier to get in the US but so worth going to you for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connecticut, USA</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;ve been dealing with sweaty armpits for quite sometime. Mostly due to heat, stress and just being a guy. I did some research online and found some other products, yet they all seemed a bit sketchy, until I stumbled upon Odaban. After doing some research I found that it had no bad side effects, concerning hormones etc. Some reviews sad it burns a little, for me it didn&#x27;t burn AT ALL. All you have to do is follow the directions. The first time I used it it was a 90 degree day, I applied it the night before, I was astonished that there were no sweat marks under my armpits of my shirt. I was happy and a lot more confident, I could actually lift my arms up! The effects for me are quite amazing, I applied it once and it lasted a good week the first time, second time it lasted around 2 weeks and now I&#x27;m up to 3-4 weeks with just two quirts under each armpit. It is an absolute MUST HAVE! I highly recommend it to any guy/girl who is having any sweating under their armpits! IT HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE!</li>
    <li> I am in my 20s suffer under embarrassing facial sweating. During the years, I tried many products to help me out to get my sweating under control. Botox is currently not option for me. However, Odaban Antiperspirant Spray actually works for my facial sweating. The only down-side is that it itches for a couple of minutes when applied. But it is well-worth it. Finally, I have my facial sweating under control!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference except for the burning.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m sure it works,  I just can&#x27;t get pass the stinging...</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deordant I have ever used and I have I tried and used them all from over the counter including certain dri. Just a few sprays is all you need. I wish I knew about this years ago and I will definately be rebuying again...it works excellent and I feel fresh all day and into the night even while wearing sleeveless tops...</li>
    <li> I believe it is a good product otherwise my nice in Brazil wouldn&#x27;t ask me to bring to her</li>
    <li> Excellent product - the only thing that works for me!</li>
    <li> I recently discovered that I was allergic to certain deodorants that had cologne in them. I purchased this with the impression that it would replace deodorants. It didn&#x27;t do that great of a job at all and it seemed to make my allergic outbreak worse.</li>
    <li> Good for people with bad hyperhidrosis! I gladly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sweat Block, Certain Dri, Mitchum, and nothing really made a difference. I tend to sweat irrespective of temperature and have been severely limited in clothing choices as a result. I tried this the first week and was not impressed. By week two however this made a huge difference and has been working ever since. It&#x27;s not impossible to sweat, but whereas before I&#x27;d be pitting out all day, there&#x27;s nothing now and I can confidently wear shirts I was reluctant to wear before. I use deodorant (not anti-perspirant) every day in addition to the weekly use of this. I cannot recommend highly enough, better than anything else I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I had to use the wipes two nights in a row because the first application didn&#x27;t work at all. After the second time it worked well enough for a day. I could still feel a little sweat in my armpits but it wasn&#x27;t enough to be visible like usual. The day after I had an interview and after I left I realized it hadn&#x27;t helped at all. I want to try to combine the wipes with a daily antiperspirant, but the package says not to so I have just been using the Crystal deodorant. The deodorant works great-Crystal is a great product for smell, but obviously I am still dealing with sweating through my shirts.</li>
    <li> So to be fair, I gave this product over 30 days before I decided to write a review. For starters, you can only use this at night and it BURNS; like to the point that sleep was nearly impossible for the first week or so. I was willing to deal with that if it actually worked, but unfortunately all the pain was in vain; did not work in the slightest. Not satisfied at all and plan to return to the manufacturer as the product does claim to be &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. I was using sweat block and it would burn and itch after putting it on and for the next few days. With this it did itch a little bit the next day but I put some cortisone cream on it and no problems. No wetness after the first night of application.</li>
    <li> This is the first antiperspirant I use which makes me not to sweat a lot. It says to use it only twice or three times per week but in my case I have to wear another deodorant the day after not using it as I sweat a lot. If I use it tonight I do not have to wear any other deodorant the morning after but I have to use something the following day as. This antiperspirant really works. I know the price is a little bit high for a deodorant but believe me if you have sweating problems this is the item for you.  I recommend this product in a 100%.</li>
    <li> Is change my life im so happy. Very good</li>
