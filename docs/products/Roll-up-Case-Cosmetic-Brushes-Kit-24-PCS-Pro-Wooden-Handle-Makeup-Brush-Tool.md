    <li> the brushes are a great accent to all your make up</li>
    <li> am actually a bit picky with my brushes but for the price these are some amazing brushes. The hairs do not fall off and do the job well. i recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! The only down fall is the faux leather case they come in has a very strong odor. I aired mine out for a couple hours and it was fine after that. Definitely worth the $ I spent.</li>

    <li> These brushes are AMAZING! Extremely soft but still dense enough to get the specific job done. I especially love the big fan brush perfect for highlight and contour blending.</li>
    <li> I really like these however the brushes are nowhere near as thick as they show on the picture, they will work but since i was buying for the fan brush i&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to get such a large quantity of brushes. Quality of bristles are very nice and the leather case is durable and requires less space that most cosmetic bags.</li>
    <li> They are good to work with, they shade a little when washing tho. But they do the job. The roll could be better quality.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price! It&#x27;s nice that the brush names are on the back of each brush. Smell kind of funny, like new hair extensions, but I&#x27;m sure it will go away after they are washed. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted  works  perfectly!</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok if you&#x27;re just starting out. I mainly use the face brushes which work very well. They are real soft. I haven&#x27;t used the eye shadow brushes yet because they seem too flimsy.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased kit for my wife for Christmas.  Originally she was purchasing makeup brushes individually at the Mac store; very expensive.  Kit appears to be very will built with a quality look.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and the item was well packed and delivered very quickly.  Very happy with our purchase.</li>
    <li> I do understand the chemical smell that i see in the reviews but i washed them and they were fine (used olive oil and dish washing liquid) But these brushes are more than i thought they would be. If your looking for them to get here in a short amount of time without paying high prices for expedited shipping then maybe these aren&#x27;t the ones for you but overall these are of great quality, very soft and are just like the picture. I recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These ended up being a better quality than I anticipated.  They must be washed though, I used baby shampoo, in order to avoid a smell.</li>
    <li> This set comes with just about everything. The only thing it&#x27;s missing is one of the mega big brushes that I like to use for all-over face powder and bronzer. The brushes look expensive and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with shedding. Good item.</li>
    <li> I just started getting in to makeup but so far the makeup brush set is well worth the price.  I got the wood color brushes, they look so classy and elegant, it applies the makeup leaving you with a flawless look, the brushes are so soft. I saw a lot of people complaining about a strong smell my set did not smell just a little bit like plastic because of the packaging. I Received this set quick. The only thing I wished this set had was a buffing brush or kabuki brush other then that you will have everything you need or more.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes in this set. I ordered the wood set and got them on time. I loved them right away because they&#x27;re so soft. I would give it five stars but something horrible happened this morning while I was blending my eyeshadow. I&#x27;ve used the brushes about 3 times and the brushes labeled &amp;#34;eyeshadow&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; started shedding. That sucks because I was loving them. The rest of them are still great though! It&#x27;s worth the price !</li>
    <li> Love the product, will purchase again if I need to. Only tested it once so far but happy with results</li>
    <li> Soft brushes and great quality don&#x27;t shed much</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes. Good quality, Do not flake. I will definitely be recommending these to my family and friends and will be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Quality brushes at a great price.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes in two days, as advertised. I am so excited that all of the brushes are labeled for their purpose!!  This is so helpful!!  The price is very good for 24 brushes.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes was very nice. Honestly, not what I expected but fully enjoy. Each brush has its function somewhat engraved on it, which is difficult to tell on the photos but is very clear on the actual item. Brushes are soft and well organized and placed in the leather Roll up Case. I only wish the care was made of a stronger material, but overall very nice. Especially since it was shipped earlier than expected date! Great item for a great price!</li>
    <li> Loved it so many quality brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, the only problem I had was with one of the eye shadow brushes losing its bristles, but there are plenty to choose from! Very soft and blend well. Love the case too, easy to roll them up and take anywhere!</li>
    <li> Just like how I expected it. VERY SOFT! would order again, but lets see how long this will last me, I usually change brushes every yeah to prevent dirt and stuff build up.</li>
    <li> Honestly not much I can add here that the other reviewers didn&#x27;t. They arrived on time, in a nice package. Every brush is there, and looking great. There was absolutely no &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; smell or anything I could detect, and my sister absolutely loves them. Truly stellar, will definitely purchase again if I need another gift for a girl.</li>
    <li> They are great. Poverty soft. But they did smell when I first receive them . Just the case. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I kept my expectations low considering the price of only but I was more than pleased when I received them.  I got all 24 and there are no problems (i.e. shedding). They seem like they will last a long time and I even got a vouch of approval from my makeup obsessed friend.  Brushes look just like the picture plus they are labeled just so you know what it&#x27;s supposed to be used for; I got mine in wood because I like to keep things classy (n_n).  I like the roll up case it came in too.  In my opinion I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get much better for what you&#x27;re spending.</li>
    <li> These is just amazing I bought it for my sister she is a make up artist and she said that they&#x27;re the best brushes to work with I love it I already buy mine and for my cousin :)</li>
    <li> Love them good quality</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted a makeup brush set for Christmas, she was expecting I think something less than what she got. She was so surprised with the wooden handles and brushes! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This met all of my daughter&#x27;s vast makeup needs!  The case helps her stay organized.  Great purchase for the money!</li>
    <li> They smelled a little from the packing but beside that the brushes are really good for the pice. And they are soft and picks product good</li>
    <li> Just received in the post for my daughter, posting was much better than expected. All the brushes were there, including the bag and she love how on one side of each brush there was a description of what it was. Overall a good product and definitely Roth the money.</li>
    <li> These brushes are definitely worth the price but they are a lot different that I expected. There isn&#x27;t as much variety in these brushes as I thought. But as for everyone who says the pouch smells and what not, its just the smell of some classy fake leather. GET OVER IT :)</li>
    <li> I am not a make-up professional but I love these brushes! I received the product early (even better) and the case does have a strong smell (factory smell), however the brushes do not have a smell just the case (just let it air out for a few days). There are so many brushes to use I love all of them, I have this product for almost a months and have been using them regulary. No shedding and best of all they are very sturdy! Great product.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, so far no shedding.  So many to choose from.  The case is very nice too&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical,  but after reading the reviews, I gave in a bought them. I was very pleased with the quality of this set for the price.</li>
    <li> These are so great for the price I loved them the brush hairs don&#x27;t fall out or anything I have had them for a year now. I also love that on the brush&#x27;s it says what they are used for eye liner, blush, eye brown, ect. Great product.</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes exceeded my expectations for the price!  Every girl should have one of these brush sets!</li>
