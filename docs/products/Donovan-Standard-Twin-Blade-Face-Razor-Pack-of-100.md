### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>but very happy with the price,will buy them again&lt;</li>
      <li>If you like to have the highest end cars, biggest house, best restuarants, best of everything , well this may not be for you !</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Very good blades.</li>
      <li>great blades well worth it!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>GREAT BUY AND GREAT SHAVE!!!</li>
      <li>I found these on line for a great price.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Great value.  </li>
      <li>Great for the price.</li>
      <li>you a good shave</li>
      <li>good shipping times.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It shaved surprisingly well.  </li>
      <li>No complaints a lot of razors for a good price.</li>
      <li>Good disposable blades</li>
      <li>Work well, good price.  </li>
      <li>Nice Product with Good range of Price</li>
      <li>Now to figure out what to do with them,  Maybe some kind of arrangement for the bathroom?</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s to good to be true</li>
      <li>The best part is, if I let my beard grow out enough to jam the blades, I have no problem tossing out a 15 cent razor as opposed to replacing a $2 cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After three shaves on the same blade I believe this is greatest deal going for shaving.</li>
      <li>So, in that regard, this product is better.</li>
      <li>three shaves in on my first razor, so I&#x27;m already satisfied with the life regardless of whether I get 1 or 5 more shaves from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They work fine</li>
      <li>Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.</li>
      <li>Just for fun I am going to see how many shaves</li>
      <li>Comfortable with no irritation despite not prepping my beard or coming out of the shower first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No they are not as good as a super high end 3 or 4 blade razor with mulitible lubricating strips on the head, pivots,rotates ,ect,ect ect.</li>
      <li>I thought originally of giving 4 stars but then, after beginning to write this I realized that I&#x27;m paying about $0.19 a piece</li>
      <li>With each razor I get two clean shaves.</li>
      <li>This is as basic and good as it gets, and the price comes to about 15 cents a blade.</li>
      <li>I would put these above Bic&#x27;s disposable dual blade razors (which I cannot seem to avoid nicks with) and about even with Gilette&#x27;s Good News blades.  </li>
      <li>No it does not have the lubricating strip, the handle is a bit flimsy but really not bad at all.</li>
      <li>But they are a fine razor for someone who wants a value.</li>
      <li>The two twin blades are very sharp &amp; you will actually be able to get multible shaves out of one razor, very cost effective on that level.</li>
      <li>Not quite like their higher-priced ($3.50 a head) competition, but more than adequate to do the basic job of shaving.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted,</li>
      <li>The plastic handles are lighter weight and shorter than the higher priced ones, but its just a matter of getting use to them.</li>
      <li>I get just as many shaves if not more than ones that cost more.</li>
      <li>just started using the first shaver.</li>
      <li>If keeping your money in the bank while having a nice clean shave then shop no more...............</li>
      <li>These little razors are more than &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; adequate.  </li>
      <li>Very good blades with a mediocre handle.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Please ,all you high end fancy pants stick with you $2-$4 razors and keep on working forever !</li>
      <li>There is no more cost effective razor.</li>
      <li>Shipping was more than some Amazon items, but 100 of these razors cost less than 10 - 5 blade refills.</li>
      <li>The third shave was a close as the first one and with no razor burn or need to go over the same spot three or four times to get a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>This is pretty much the only downside I can think of as it makes it a little harder to grip the razor (though I&#x27;m sure its easy to get used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But if your like me and you drive a normal car, live in a normal home,cook at home alot,look for value, then you&#x27;ve found it with these razors.</li>
      <li>but and I was charged $1.02 sales tax, I don&#x27;t live in Illinois where they are shipped from.</li>
      <li>like to make for a worst-case scenario when trying a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>nicks, which is big for me as machine-sharpened blades are prone to give me weepers.&lt;br /&gt;The third shave from the same razor was as comfortable as the first.</li>
      <li>a little weak but overall construction is good and they work great, several saves on 1 razor, as of review and still razor sharp.</li>
      <li>So far it has cut my 3 day old beard twice without replacing it with a new shaver.</li>
      <li>far as the blades go, these blades do the job just as well as the Schick Hydro 3&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Not very sharp,but economical as hell.</li>
      <li>They are good razors and work as well as the expensive ones.</li>
      <li>shower beforehand, I splashed on some water, then applied the cheapest canned goo foam and shaved with no previous beard prep.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised by how much smaller the razors are compared to what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>Not quite at the level of Sensor or Trac, but well above any other price:performance ratio for any other cheap blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Not quite at the level of Sensor or Trac, but well above any other price:performance ratio for any other cheap blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Fantastic for traveling or camping as they are small with no significant weight.</li>
<li> The only difference I have noticed between these razors and the other big name ones is the weight in the handle.  </li>
<li> The handle is a little smaller then a more expensive razor.</li>
<li> Yes, the alignment is not normal but it gives a closer shave.</li>
<li> 100 of these razors should last a regular shaver at least a year.</li>
<li> Just need to be careful when shaving.</li>
<li> Minimal irritation and just as close of a shave.  </li>
<li> Sam&#x27;s quit selling the large boxes of double edge Gillette razors, and the only choice they offered was very expensive 5 edge blade refills.  </li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical at first</li>
<li> I took one star away because I expected the razor to be sharper than what they have sent me!?</li>
<li> So, average 4 shaves per blade and you are spending 4 cents a shave.</li>
<li> They are very sharp, have two blades and shave well.  </li>
<li> I can get at least 5 shaves out of a single razor.</li>
<li> I must use razors with no aloe strip and they&#x27;re not easy to find.  </li>
<li> This was an unbelievable value</li>
<li> I can get at least 4 shaves per razor.  </li>
<li> and each piece will give 20 shaves, at least.  </li>
<li> Very bad shave about the same if you left the blade cover on.</li>
<li> For the price of these razors you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> A difference from the 3- and 4-blade variety is I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m on a cliff&#x27;s edge away from cutting myself using these.  </li>
<li> Handle is so flimsy is worthless blade head is at the wrong angle.</li>
<li> Awful, no lubrication strip</li>

    <li> Very good blades with a mediocre handle. Fantastic for traveling or camping as they are small with no significant weight. I am getting about 4 uses per blade. This is as basic and good as it gets, and the price comes to about 15 cents a blade. So, average 4 shaves per blade and you are spending 4 cents a shave. There is no more cost effective razor.</li>
    <li> Awful, no lubrication strip</li>
    <li> Nice Product with Good range of Price</li>
    <li> The only difference I have noticed between these razors and the other big name ones is the weight in the handle.  These are lighter which is not a problem.  With each razor I get two clean shaves.</li>
    <li> Listen, If you like saving money this razor is for you. No it does not have the lubricating strip, the handle is a bit flimsy but really not bad at all. The handle is a little smaller then a more expensive razor.No they do not have a pivoting or rotating head.The two twin blades are very sharp &amp; you will actually be able to get multible shaves out of one razor, very cost effective on that level. No they are not as good as a super high end 3 or 4 blade razor with mulitible lubricating strips on the head, pivots,rotates ,ect,ect ect.But they are a fine razor for someone who wants a value. If you like to have the highest end cars, biggest house, best restuarants, best of everything , well this may not be for you ! But if your like me and you drive a normal car, live in a normal home,cook at home alot,look for value, then you&#x27;ve found it with these razors. If keeping your money in the bank while having a nice clean shave then shop no more...............Please ,all you high end fancy pants stick with you $2-$4 razors and keep on working forever !</li>
    <li> I ordered my razors from Treasure Zone.  I was surprised by how much smaller the razors are compared to what I was expecting.  This is pretty much the only downside I can think of as it makes it a little harder to grip the razor (though I&#x27;m sure its easy to get used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the blades go, these blades do the job just as well as the Schick Hydro 3&#x27;s I was using.  Minimal irritation and just as close of a shave.  I can get at least 4 shaves per razor.  The best part is, if I let my beard grow out enough to jam the blades, I have no problem tossing out a 15 cent razor as opposed to replacing a $2 cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I can&#x27;t give these razors anything except five stars just for the fact that its a heck of a deal and makes the cost of shaving seem almost nonexistent.  100 of these razors should last a regular shaver at least a year.</li>
    <li> I must use razors with no aloe strip and they&#x27;re not easy to find.  This was an unbelievable value and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Handles are a little weak but overall construction is good and they work great, several saves on 1 razor, as of review and still razor sharp.</li>
    <li> For the price of these razors you can&#x27;t go wrong. I get just as many shaves if not more than ones that cost more. The plastic handles are lighter weight and shorter than the higher priced ones, but its just a matter of getting use to them.</li>
    <li> Good disposable blades</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted,</li>
    <li> Sam&#x27;s quit selling the large boxes of double edge Gillette razors, and the only choice they offered was very expensive 5 edge blade refills.  I found these on line for a great price.  Shipping was more than some Amazon items, but 100 of these razors cost less than 10 - 5 blade refills.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp,but economical as hell.</li>
    <li> as described. good shipping times.</li>
    <li> Very good blades.These don&#x27;t have the moisture strips though...  but very happy with the price,will buy them again&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend for head shaving though .</li>
    <li> They are good razors and work as well as the expensive ones. The only 2 problems are that it doesn&#x27;t have the lubricating strip like in the picture (not a big deal) but and I was charged $1.02 sales tax, I don&#x27;t live in Illinois where they are shipped from. I am not obligated to pay tax to Illinois.</li>
    <li> this is an excellant value</li>
    <li> it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Cheap, Cheap, Cheap. Should have known. If it&#x27;s to good to be true IT IS. Got greedy and it got me. Handle is so flimsy is worthless blade head is at the wrong angle. Very bad shave about the same if you left the blade cover on. oh yea leave the cover on and no cuts. I got it. Now to figure out what to do with them,  Maybe some kind of arrangement for the bathroom?</li>
    <li> Great value.  They work fine</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY AND GREAT SHAVE!!!</li>
    <li> I would put these above Bic&#x27;s disposable dual blade razors (which I cannot seem to avoid nicks with) and about even with Gilette&#x27;s Good News blades.  Not quite at the level of Sensor or Trac, but well above any other price:performance ratio for any other cheap blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m three shaves in on my first razor, so I&#x27;m already satisfied with the life regardless of whether I get 1 or 5 more shaves from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to make for a worst-case scenario when trying a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;No shower beforehand, I splashed on some water, then applied the cheapest canned goo foam and shaved with no previous beard prep.&lt;br /&gt;It shaved surprisingly well.  Comfortable with no irritation despite not prepping my beard or coming out of the shower first.&lt;br /&gt;No nicks, which is big for me as machine-sharpened blades are prone to give me weepers.&lt;br /&gt;The third shave from the same razor was as comfortable as the first.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. It is an excellent product. I took one star away because I expected the razor to be sharper than what they have sent me!?</li>
    <li> just started using the first shaver. So far it has cut my 3 day old beard twice without replacing it with a new shaver. so I give it five stars. Yes, the alignment is not normal but it gives a closer shave. Just need to be careful when shaving.</li>
    <li> These little razors are more than &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; adequate.  Not quite like their higher-priced ($3.50 a head) competition, but more than adequate to do the basic job of shaving.  They are very sharp, have two blades and shave well.  A difference from the 3- and 4-blade variety is I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m on a cliff&#x27;s edge away from cutting myself using these.  So, in that regard, this product is better. I thought originally of giving 4 stars but then, after beginning to write this I realized that I&#x27;m paying about $0.19 a piece and each piece will give 20 shaves, at least.  So, I changed the rating to 5 stars.  I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I use these to shave my clients befor tattoos. No complaints a lot of razors for a good price.</li>
    <li> Work well, good price.  I&#x27;ll probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Been looking every where for these</li>
    <li> great blades well worth it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for, the handle is inadequate, to short, it does not&lt;br /&gt;give you a good shave</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but I bought them anyway.  After three shaves on the same blade I believe this is greatest deal going for shaving. The third shave was a close as the first one and with no razor burn or need to go over the same spot three or four times to get a smooth shave. Just for fun I am going to see how many shaves I can get on the same blade with no deterioration in quality. I know  I can get at least 5 shaves out of a single razor.</li>
