    <li> I love this stuff. I love how creamy it is. It&#x27;s not thin, it&#x27;s thick but not too thick to make it feel really heavy or look cakey. It has 10 different shades so it&#x27;s PERFECT for getting it to match your skin tone. The great thing is if one of the 10 isn&#x27;t the color you want, then all you have to do is mix two or more shades together to create the perfect color that fits you. I got this product free or discounted in exchange for my review and my review is definitely a good one (: I&#x27;m super happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, wish they had a lighter shade though.. Still, great for the price. Easy to blend</li>
    <li> I rated this a 4 because it is really creamy but other than that, I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This palette is amazing! I ordered it so I could try my hand at contouring and it works perfectly! It is much larger than I thought it would be and gives plenty of color for highlighting and contour. I am a medium skin tone and barely had to put any on my brush. It is also super blend able. You definitely need to use a finishing spray over it but it is worth it! I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> It was okay but it didn&#x27;t blend very well at all and the lightest color on the palate REALLY caked up bad</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:56c94a3e38a6f951e91f311e7900ebfd]]I really loved this palette. It has 10 different shades for highlighting and contouring.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are soft and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;It stayed on and blended easily.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a heavy contour person, and usually lose the contour anyway but this stayed on pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely pleased with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>

    <li> I had a good experience with this product. I&#x27;ve just learned to blend and contour and this was very easy to apply and blend. i see myself buying it again.</li>
    <li> I received this palette today. I tested out some colors to contour and highlight my face and so far I&#x27;m liking this. My sister who is way better educated about cosmetics than me even agreed that it seems like it&#x27;s a great palette. For a no brand, this works out fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool makeup covers pretty well, great price. But the coverage doesn&#x27;t last very well and if you have acne prone skin this is awful. I actually do makeup in a salon and I had put it on my assistant and she looked great. The next day she came in to work and the blemishes she had before looked much worse and she had a few more. I thought it was maybe hormonal till I used it on myself for about a week and I started getting clogged pores and bumps. Having dry skin not very common for me to have to worry about that. As well I notice it goes on very dewy which I like a lot for cheeks yet not for nose and forehead for it just looks greasy. You have to set those areas including under eyes with a setting powder of your choice. All and all it&#x27;s great for the price every beginner should get one for there kit great for contours just be sure to use your beauty blender tool</li>
    <li> I never write reviews on any items I purchase..but I have never been as satisfied as I am right now. I love this pallet. I definitely recommend it. Especially as a stylist.</li>
