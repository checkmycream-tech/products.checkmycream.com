      <li>They are the perfect size.</li>
      <li>These are a perfect size for travel.</li>
      <li>Perfect size for airline travel.  </li>
      <li>anything isn&#x27;t ideal</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Great set of bottles.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a great size</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, I was happy when my liquid/gel products did not leak after packing them in a suitcase and flying across the country.</li>
      <li>These are great and they keep the seal.</li>
      <li>Great travel set.  </li>
      <li>The great colors and price is a bonus.</li>
      <li>good buy.</li>
      <li>Over all a good product.</li>
      <li>Very useful &amp; great for traveling!</li>
      <li>I am sure I will get a lot of use out of !</li>
      <li>Love the colors too!</li>
      <li>This set comes with pre-printed &amp;#34;conditioner, shampoo, etc.) labels which is nice</li>
      <li>and they come in handy.</li>
      <li>These bottles leak very easily.</li>
      <li>The colors are very bright and vibrant!</li>
      <li>I carry one of these bottles in my purse filled with my favorite lotion!</li>
      <li>They worked fine for creating your own travel size shampoo and conditioner (no leaks), but if you put oily substances (almond oil, massage oil, etc  in these containers, they always seem to leak if you take them on a plane.</li>
      <li>I bought two of these kits, and the plastic bag is sturdy - much much better than a zipper bag from the grocery store.</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;d be able to differentiate what is what in each bottle.</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>they are soo cute</li>
      <li>I should have read the description better.  </li>
      <li>In two of those cases I lost most of my shampoo.</li>
      <li>but I think the stiffness of the plastic makes them more durable.  </li>
      <li>Now to find better caps.</li>
      <li>Okay, I like the bottles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had these for a while, and they started off OK.  </li>
      <li>I think the oil lubricates the push top opening</li>
      <li>Also make sure the caps are</li>
      <li>Leaks; cap top opens easily...</li>
      <li>Filled these with my favorite shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and oils to take them on the plane with me.</li>
      <li>Really not the best quality.</li>
      <li>I PURCHASED FOR EASY TRAVELING VIA PLANE.</li>
      <li>so the lotion is easy to squeeze out.</li>
      <li>Worked fine for a while</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with anything leaking out in my luggage and for the price they&#x27;re fantastic.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are clear, not colored as in the picture, and I would have liked colored bottles to distinguish between shampoo, conditioner, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>okay, thanks a lot</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this.</li>
      <li>The colors of the plastic bottles are very pretty.</li>
      <li>Really useful for traveling in case you don&#x27;t want to take the full product of something.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors!</li>
      <li>exactly as described!</li>
      <li>definitely worth the purchase</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall probably worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t try carrying something completely liquid, like water or rubbing alcohol, so beware if that&#x27;s what you put in the bottles, and make sure to put the bottles inside the pouch.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the bottles are the right travel size containers .</li>
      <li>Loved the color, but the lids could be a little tighter.</li>
      <li>They are exactly what they look like.  </li>
      <li>They are sturdy and the colors are nice but they do not have the hole in the center of the cap like they were displayed on a Youtube video.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient for traveling!</li>
      <li>I wish it had more blank labels (instead of just &amp;#34;shampoo/conditioner/etc&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>The identifying stickers stick on nicely, and didn&#x27;t wash off when wet in the shower.</li>
      <li>It is as described and it came in good time, but I have one small piece of criticism -</li>
      <li>The tops open easy while traveling.</li>
      <li>Nice, affordable little travel bottles</li>
      <li>What I like most is the cap, which allows me to dispense as little or as much as I want to.</li>
      <li>I like that they are colored &amp; not just clear, that way I don&#x27;t really have to pay attention to whats in them.</li>
      <li>so you cant put it in a purse or a fanny pack or a wristlet, its not hard</li>
      <li>its a bottle, it does its job, i use it to put my cocoa butter lotion in, my face is very sensitive</li>
      <li>Typed out labels and taped them on with clear shipping tape to take the guess work away.</li>
      <li>On the first kit, the tops didn&#x27;t snap closed very tightly, and they leaked, but on the second kit, the tops are very nice and tight.</li>
      <li>Also the oils I was using were very light and thin oils, not viscus like shampoo and conditioner, so that may also have something to do with the leaks with oil-based product.</li>
      <li>i bought the colored ones because i was planning on only using one item in it, but i guess you could buy the clear ones</li>
      <li>Not only lost product, but had a big mess to clean up.</li>
      <li>so that I could write down exactly what&#x27;s in it</li>
      <li>But the first few times I placed the bottles in my travel kit, two caps opened and leaked.</li>

    <li> I bought two of these kits, and the plastic bag is sturdy - much much better than a zipper bag from the grocery store. I used scissors to cut off the hanging loop, since I didn&#x27;t want that. The colors of the plastic bottles are very pretty. The identifying stickers stick on nicely, and didn&#x27;t wash off when wet in the shower. On the first kit, the tops didn&#x27;t snap closed very tightly, and they leaked, but on the second kit, the tops are very nice and tight. I guess I am finding that I need to use some smaller bottles along with the 3 oz bottles, so I&#x27;ll just use the tight lids, and purchase some little tiny containers to add to the kit. Overall, I am very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! Can&#x27;t wait to travel with them!</li>
    <li> Perfect travel size bottles for shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soaps. Comes w/ stickies to label each item. Only complaint (a small one) is that the sticky wasn&#x27;t very adhesive to the bottle. But didn&#x27;t take away from the usefulness of the bottles.</li>
    <li> I love them they are soo cute and they come in handy.</li>
    <li> They have served their purpose.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> this product was extremely helpful on my international trip, at least it was not asked of me to throw them in the garbage....definitely worth the purchase</li>
    <li> Really not the best quality. One of the lids doesn&#x27;t even close all the way.</li>
    <li> It is as described and it came in good time, but I have one small piece of criticism - I wish it had more blank labels (instead of just &amp;#34;shampoo/conditioner/etc&amp;#34;) so that I could write down exactly what&#x27;s in it... I know it sounds crazy and anal-retentive but it would be a small improvement that would help a lot... Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> its a bottle, it does its job, i use it to put my cocoa butter lotion in, my face is very sensitive so i cant just use any lotion on my face, so i use these bottles to put my cocoa butter lotion in. its small so you cant put it in a purse or a fanny pack or a wristlet, its not hard so the lotion is easy to squeeze out. i bought the colored ones because i was planning on only using one item in it, but i guess you could buy the clear ones so you&#x27;d be able to differentiate what is what in each bottle. good buy.</li>
    <li> Very convenient for traveling!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for airline travel.  It was a bit difficult to get shampoo and conditioner out of the pop top.  Thus, I ended up taking off the cap.  Otherwise, bottles met my needs for recent trip.</li>
    <li> The tops open easy while traveling.</li>
    <li> Received on time was what I expected. Can be used for a lot of different things and fits neatly into my travel bag.  Love the colors too!</li>
    <li> The bottles are clear, not colored as in the picture, and I would have liked colored bottles to distinguish between shampoo, conditioner, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I was happy when my liquid/gel products did not leak after packing them in a suitcase and flying across the country. I have usually had problems in the past with containers leaking. So the bottles seem to work, and that&#x27;s what counts. (I didn&#x27;t try carrying something completely liquid, like water or rubbing alcohol, so beware if that&#x27;s what you put in the bottles, and make sure to put the bottles inside the pouch. Also make sure the caps are closed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall probably worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Use these bottles for all sorts of things. I like that they are colored &amp; not just clear, that way I don&#x27;t really have to pay attention to whats in them. Very useful &amp; great for traveling!</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED FOR EASY TRAVELING VIA PLANE. HOLD JUST ENOUGH FOR A WEEKS TRIP AND SECURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY REOMMENDED TO ANYONE</li>
    <li> They are exactly what they look like.  They are sturdy and the colors are nice but they do not have the hole in the center of the cap like they were displayed on a Youtube video.  I&#x27;ll keep these and use for lotions, shampoo, etc.</li>
    <li> They are the perfect size. Like that they are different colors so that you can use for different products. Fits in your purse.</li>
    <li> Great set of bottles.  I have 2 sets.  One I&#x27;ve used for travel toiletries and the other I&#x27;ve used for massage oils.  This set comes with pre-printed &amp;#34;conditioner, shampoo, etc.) labels which is nice and they also come in a plastic, zippered travel bag.  The bottles with the oils do have an issue with leaking a little oil but that&#x27;s pretty typical with oils however I have had no issues with leaking with things like conditioner or shampoo.  Great travel set.  The colors are very bright and vibrant!</li>
    <li> Okay, I like the bottles. But the first few times I placed the bottles in my travel kit, two caps opened and leaked. Not only lost product, but had a big mess to clean up. Now to find better caps.</li>
    <li> Leaks; cap top opens easily...</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a while but in hindsight, I should have realized that the push-top dispenser was not very tight.&lt;br /&gt;Reached hotel late at night and had a BIG mess to cleanup in my toiletries bag.</li>
    <li> Hard to squeeze out the shampoo as the bottles as too soft.  The bottles are hard to take in and out of the plastic storage container, it tends to stick with the plastic, too staticky.  Otherwise, the bottles are the right travel size containers .</li>
    <li> They worked fine for creating your own travel size shampoo and conditioner (no leaks), but if you put oily substances (almond oil, massage oil, etc  in these containers, they always seem to leak if you take them on a plane. I think the oil lubricates the push top opening and then it won&#x27;t stay shut. Also the oils I was using were very light and thin oils, not viscus like shampoo and conditioner, so that may also have something to do with the leaks with oil-based product. I do appreciate that they came in a little zip lock pouch, that protected my clothes from the leakage in my suit case. Over all a good product.</li>
    <li> These bottles leak very easily. I&#x27;ve taken them on three trips and even in my carry-on they have come open and leaked on the contents of my quart-sized baggie three times. In two of those cases I lost most of my shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really useful for traveling in case you don&#x27;t want to take the full product of something. The great colors and price is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I carry one of these bottles in my purse filled with my favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> On time, and as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Filled these with my favorite shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and oils to take them on the plane with me. Typed out labels and taped them on with clear shipping tape to take the guess work away. Still using them at home in the shower, since the size is so convenient.</li>
    <li> Item received matched the description.  Nice, affordable little travel bottles I am sure I will get a lot of use out of !</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for but that was my mistake I should have read the description better.  I was looking for a flip open lid where I can dip a cotton swab into the opening.</li>
    <li> Loved the color, but the lids could be a little tighter.</li>
    <li> These are great and they keep the seal. No leaks!</li>
    <li> I was going on a trip where I thought I would need to hand wash clothes, so I put some dishwashing detergent in a bottle and put it in with my cosmetics in the quart baggie for carry-on.  When I arrived at my hotel, I had quite a mess to deal with.  I would recommend wrapping in plastic wrap or a separate baggie before putting in a baggie with other cosmentics.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of these and they opened up in my luggage-- soap everywhere! They&#x27;re a great size but you have to tape the lid shut if you&#x27;re going to travel with them.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect size for travel. What I like most is the cap, which allows me to dispense as little or as much as I want to.</li>
    <li> exactly as described!</li>
    <li> They open very easily :( and spilled the product every where twice!</li>
    <li> This travel pack has worked well on multiple trips now.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with anything leaking out in my luggage and for the price they&#x27;re fantastic.  The bottles themselves are a little stiff so squeezing out shampoo or hair gel or anything isn&#x27;t ideal but I think the stiffness of the plastic makes them more durable.  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> everything okay, thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while, and they started off OK.  Lately though, they do nothing but leak..and create a huge mess.  That&#x27;s what brings me to Amazon today.  I&#x27;m only going to buy leak-proof from now on!!</li>
