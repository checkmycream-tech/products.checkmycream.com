      <li>the best part...</li>
      <li>it was magnificent!  </li>

      <li>But even after walking to the restaurant, my hair still looked great.</li>
      <li>But I think it has helped with damage control, since I&#x27;ve colored my hair &amp; its still in great shape.</li>
      <li>It looked and felt great after sealing the product in~</li>
      <li>but for 2 $$ I figured I&#x27;d use it for sure!!</li>

      <li>I am very very pleased with results</li>
      <li>BUT I now love my curly hair!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>no commitment necessary...if you want to maintain this, you can use sulfate free shampoo and you can put this in as often as you like without damaging your hair with a relaxer--SCORE!!  </li>
      <li>The directions were easy to follow and the treatment smelled great.</li>
      <li>But, I have to say, (if this gets posted), that this stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>, my hair was wavy and kind of \\&quot;tight\\&quot; and I thought \\&quot;uh-</li>
      <li>Was impressed by the promise on this product to keep my hair straight up to 14 days after using it.</li>
      <li>Still loving this product for its ease of use and lack of fumes--</li>
      <li>Looks good and kept the hair looking neat and smooth all day while I was sweating and going in/</li>
      <li>So easy!</li>
      <li>I thought it was too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>It did leave it very smooth, and it makes it look healthier.</li>
      <li>I am glad it was inexpensive, but I will never purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>I cannot stop touching my hair.  </li>
      <li>That seemed to be OK.</li>
      <li>but I guess I wanted more straightening power.</li>
      <li>Over all, now day 14, still quite pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The best part is it only took about a silver dollar amount of the product and the product is so inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>The Argan oil line is my favorite.</li>
      <li>and ALSO forgot to add that it made my scalp very itchy!!!!</li>
      <li>Pretty good,</li>
      <li>Its now been two days of hot and humid weather and my hair still looks good.</li>
      <li>It is sooooo EASY to apply~</li>
      <li>Hair is usually fine and fizzy.  </li>
      <li>Lol.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s come out fantastic.</li>
      <li>Just smooth, shiny, manageable hair.</li>
      <li>While I spend a lot  of money to keep my curly course hair smooth</li>
      <li>I actually liked the shampoo and conditioner a lot, but this stuff - not so much.</li>
      <li>I have been chemical free for 2 years, but I needed something that would help maintain my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair looks like I have a relaxer, but minus the thinning, breakage and it has a beautiful shine.</li>
      <li>NO CRAZY FUMES!  </li>
      <li>I was excited to use this product when I purchased it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>I really hope this catches on with black women who are looking for a safe, easy method to obtain straight hair (or anyone looking to super-shiny smoothness to their hair, period), and I especially love the fact the it isn&#x27;t permanent</li>
      <li>*super soft &amp; straight great looking results  </li>
      <li>Ok, so it does not give me straight hair for 14 days</li>
      <li>It only made my hair more light weight and some-what more manegeable. . . . .</li>
      <li>Not a bad product at all</li>
      <li>I would advise anyone to try this, just be sure to use only sulfate and sodium free shampoos (Aubrey&#x27;s Honeysuckle Rose Shampoo and Conditioner is simply THE BEST moisturizing combo out there, hands down), and be sure use a flat iron the reaches temps of 450 degrees (most important).</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super curly...</li>
      <li>At least it didn&#x27;t turn my hair orange, &amp; no foul chemicals, so that&#x27;s a win in my book :)</li>
      <li>I found that I&#x27;m better off just putting some high quality oils</li>
      <li>I originally started out with Organix&#x27;s kit with the excellent results, but the fact the it reddened my hair annoyed me</li>
      <li>So, I say that it&#x27;s marketed incorrectly because, while I definitely have beautiful, straight, silky hair when I use it with the flat iron at about 400 degrees, the benefit I enjoy most are the days after I wash again...</li>
      <li>So for a treatment with shampoo and conditioner combo, these 3 are pretty good products (especially for the price!!</li>
      <li>After 48 years of hating my frizz head, I now love my natural curls!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s kind of wavy, whereas the rest is pretty straight (no pin straight, but not wavy either,</li>
      <li>8 hours later, my hair still looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>I applied it with my glove free hands which really allowed me to get in all the \\&quot;cracks and crevices\\&quot; of my hair.  </li>
      <li>(it is relatively cheap, much cheaper than Organix).</li>
      <li>Tryed it it was simple to use I liked the out</li>
      <li>I made sure to follow the directions completely.</li>
      <li>I think any product that does not have you cover up your hands with gloves when applying is a testament to how safe and natural it is.  </li>
      <li>The best part is if you just want something temporary to straighten your hair~this is perfect--if you decide you don&#x27;t want pin straight hair anymore, you can wash this out with normal shampoo and be back to your natural hair--</li>
      <li>It was really shiny &amp; feels really nice, &amp; it did help...but only somewhat.</li>
      <li>AND I NOW REALIZE THAT THE HAIR GETS VERY STRAIGHT BY</li>
      <li>My hair was very straight.</li>
      <li>--it is affordable (and safe) enough to do it again even sooner than the 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>My hair had grown so pretty after wearing wigs and braids for a year.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a fix to help maintain the smoothness during hot, humid NYC summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I only used 1/2 a bottle--if you get 2 bottles you should be able to do 4 applications  *</li>
      <li>I initial went loooking for the Organx brand, but I read to many reviews where people were questioning the ingredients</li>
      <li>but I always read reviews first before using a product(due</li>
      <li>/&gt;Their other products are amazing as well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair completely straight, but it comes pretty close.</li>
      <li>Well, despite the former promising reviews, this didn&#x27;t make my hair entirely straight.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll preface the rest with saying that my hair is pretty good, &amp; so much healthier than it was a year ago.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and not with the renpure shampoo, but this is SUPER easy to use.  </li>
      <li>After the first application, which I followed directions to a t, It worked ok but not the miracle that I expected.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll work for people with more extreme wavy or curly hair, but I would have assumed it would make hair that&#x27;s already pretty straight bone straight.</li>
      <li>PLUS, I can go straight and sleek</li>
      <li>and it stayed fairly straight.</li>
      <li>This stuff does not work like the real BKTs.</li>
      <li>I bought this about a month ago, since I was going to Florida for a conference &amp; since I know the humid weather kills my hair, I wanted something to use that would help to keep it frizz-free &amp; straight.</li>
      <li>It was a very humid night.</li>
      <li>After I finished, I did not use any hairspray or styling cream, because I wanted to see if the product really worked.  </li>
      <li>I did the treatment on a Saturday night and the whole process took about 1 3/4 hours.</li>
      <li>I bought this product hoping it would make my hair straight</li>

    <li> UPDATE**2/9/12** Still loving this product for its ease of use and lack of fumes-- but it does NOT hold up to humidity the way that the Organix BKT does~so therefore did not last the full 14 days, so I changed from 5 stars to 4-- I live in Houston (Humidity Central) and  it rained...ALOT...and my doo poufed up :(  Still--without the fumes, I can deal with this as I can re-apply this at the end of the week again.  I think I will possibly alternate between this and the Organix for future treatments because the Oraganix does hold up in humidity...alternating I think will keep the Organix from turning my hair too orange--&amp; I will still keep searching for more great at home BKT&#x27;s! :)  ****************************************************************************************************************************  I was previously using Organix at home BKT--and it worked and did its job well.  However the fumes when sealing the Keratin in started to get to me.  I ran across this product on accident and BOY am I glad I did!!!  It is sooooo EASY to apply~ no gloves necessary...it smells WONDERFUL~ I think any product that does not have you cover up your hands with gloves when applying is a testament to how safe and natural it is.  I applied it with my glove free hands which really allowed me to get in all the \\&quot;cracks and crevices\\&quot; of my hair.  Left in in for 30 minutes (no burning sensation whatsoever)...did a blow dry/flat iron --and the best part...NO CRAZY FUMES!  NONE~ it was magnificent!  Let me just reiterate the benefits of this product:  *the price...Helllloooo! $5.99 for 1 bottle, $11.98 for 2 bottles  *my hair is past my shoulders and I only used 1/2 a bottle--if you get 2 bottles you should be able to do 4 applications  *no gloves required  *no fumes when blow drying/flat ironing  *did NOT change my hair color  *super soft &amp; straight great looking results  As I am African-American and have coarse, unruly hair--I was skeptical of how this product would work on my hair--as I am with most products--lol--I thought--\\&quot;This is not going to work on my hair!\\&quot;  But **SURPRISE** it did--and worked AMAZING too boot!  It looked and felt great after sealing the product in~ but the true test is the next day when you wash it--after washing, my hair was wavy and kind of \\&quot;tight\\&quot; and I thought \\&quot;uh-oh, the $5.99 product was too good to be true\\&quot;  BUT--when I blew my hair dry, it was soft, supple, super straight and moved--just exactly what I wanted.  The best part is if you just want something temporary to straighten your hair~this is perfect--if you decide you don&#x27;t want pin straight hair anymore, you can wash this out with normal shampoo and be back to your natural hair--no commitment necessary...if you want to maintain this, you can use sulfate free shampoo and you can put this in as often as you like without damaging your hair with a relaxer--SCORE!!  It&#x27;s been over a week and my hair still looks amazing--heck, at this price even if it DOESN&#x27;T last 14 days--it is affordable (and safe) enough to do it again even sooner than the 2 weeks.  I could actually safely do this EVERY WEEK and STILL not spend as much as other treatments cost.</li>
    <li> Is suppose to straighten the hair but it didn&#x27;t do that on mine. It did leave it very smooth, and it makes it look healthier. I will probably keep using it because of that, but I have to find another hair straightener that will work on my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago, since I was going to Florida for a conference &amp; since I know the humid weather kills my hair, I wanted something to use that would help to keep it frizz-free &amp; straight. I saw this in my local Bi-Lo but I always read reviews first before using a product(due to my orange hair disaster with the Organix product...). Well, despite the former promising reviews, this didn&#x27;t make my hair entirely straight.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll preface the rest with saying that my hair is pretty good, &amp; so much healthier than it was a year ago. It&#x27;s pretty short, a pixie cut with fringe bangs, &amp; there is a part on the left side of my head towards the back that&#x27;s kind of wavy, whereas the rest is pretty straight (no pin straight, but not wavy either, if that makes sense).&lt;br /&gt;So, I applied this, per the directions, &amp;...well, when I blow dried my hair a day later, it wasn&#x27;t as straight as it was with previous keratin treatments. It was really shiny &amp; feels really nice, &amp; it did help...but only somewhat. It did help with the frizz so even if I had to straighten my hair it lasted, which was nice, since I hate using hair spray or drying products to keep the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few other times since then, around 4 total, but still my hair will not come out pin straight like the model on the box unless I flat iron. But I think it has helped with damage control, since I&#x27;ve colored my hair &amp; its still in great shape. This is something I will use for the keratin aspect to help strengthen my hair, since I have to flat iron regularly. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for people with more extreme wavy or curly hair, but I would have assumed it would make hair that&#x27;s already pretty straight bone straight. Not a bad product at all but I guess I wanted more straightening power. At least it didn&#x27;t turn my hair orange, &amp; no foul chemicals, so that&#x27;s a win in my book :)</li>
    <li> I started using at home BKTs this year after not relaxing my type 4b super-coarse, super thick hair for four years. I originally started out with Organix&#x27;s kit with the excellent results, but the fact the it reddened my hair annoyed me and I was a little apprehensive of the ingredient list. I stumbled upon Renpure website and decided to try out their treatment (it is relatively cheap, much cheaper than Organix). I am very very pleased with results - I can apply it with my hands, I can use as much or as little as I want, and it doesn&#x27;t discolor my hair at all. Just smooth, shiny, manageable hair. I&#x27;m sold. I really hope this catches on with black women who are looking for a safe, easy method to obtain straight hair (or anyone looking to super-shiny smoothness to their hair, period), and I especially love the fact the it isn&#x27;t permanent so I can go back to my natural hair texture whenever. I would advise anyone to try this, just be sure to use only sulfate and sodium free shampoos (Aubrey&#x27;s Honeysuckle Rose Shampoo and Conditioner is simply THE BEST moisturizing combo out there, hands down), and be sure use a flat iron the reaches temps of 450 degrees (most important). Also, Renpure&#x27;s Argan Oil products complement this excellently.   Black women with super curly or kinky hair, who use dangerous chemicals such as lye on their it (which causes irreversible damage), try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> On second rainy rainy day my thick hair is frizz free. For those who gave one star, keratin treatments are for smoothing hair, not straightening, even several hundred dollar treatments have the same claim. I used on highlighted hair and did not have a problem. Impressed w a $6 hair treatment that tames my hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this \\&quot;straightening treatment\\&quot; twice.  First time I did it at home, following the directions exactly.  I waited the 24 hrs to shampoo and condition, towel-dried my hair and watched it kink up into the usual birdnest.  I thought I&#x27;d try conditioning, rinsing and blow-drying.  Same poofy, frizzy mop of hair.  I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough or maybe my flat iron didn&#x27;t go hot enough so I had my hairdresser do it.  He used a full bottle (I have long, thick hair),  my hair was literally dripping with it.  He used his flat iron that specifically said 450*.  Waited the 24hrs, shampooed, conditioned.....and said a few colorful words and threw the second bottle of treatment in the garbage.  Total waste of time.  Total waste of money.  I thought it was too good to be true.  However, the shampoo and conditioner are awesome.  My hair is softer, less frizzy and not one bit dry, after using the shamp/cond for about 6 weeks.  I had terribly dry hair due to 2 pregnancies in 2 years and hypothyroidism and tried everything out there and this shamp/cond was the only thing that worked.</li>
    <li> Tryed it it was simple to use I liked the out come but my head really sweats a lot which causes my hair puff up and I was not thrilled about how ever I was pleased with the fact that I could use it right after coming out of braids for six months but I had to return to a relaxer</li>
    <li> I APPLIED THIS PRODUCT ON MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S HAIR WHICH HAS SOFT WAVES. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS STEP BY STEP AND I NOW REALIZE THAT THE HAIR GETS VERY STRAIGHT BY FLAT IRONING IT (450 DEGREES)  AND ABSOLUTELY NOT BY THE PRODUCT BECAUSE WHEN SHE WASHED AND CONDITIONED IT AFTER 24 HOURS THE HAIR HAD SOFT WAVES AGAIN. IF THIS GARBAGE DOESNT WORK ON A 2a HAIR TYPE IT  WILL NEVER WORK ON AFRICAN HAIR. MR. TOM REDMOND  JR. IS ON HIS WAY TO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE.  WHAT A SHAME.... SHAME ON HIM.</li>
    <li> I have been chemical free for 2 years, but I needed something that would help maintain my hair. After researching and spending tons of money on different high end conditioners, I came across this product one day in my local drug store. I initial went loooking for the Organx brand, but I read to many reviews where people were questioning the ingredients so I decided to try Renpur. I am overly impressed. My hair looks like I have a relaxer, but minus the thinning, breakage and it has a beautiful shine. I love it! I would highly recommend and this is definitely the product I will be using going forward. Oh and the shampoo and conditioners are great as well. I combed my hair with the conditioner in it and not one strand came out.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product.  After the first application, which I followed directions to a t, It worked ok but not the miracle that I expected.  Also did not last after 1st wash I coud scrunch and have curly hair.  But I tried it again just to see.  Same results.  Now about 3 weeks after the 2nd treatment my a end are so dry and fuzzy for about a whole inch!  I am gonna have to get a major trim. and I am so dissappointed cause my hair is not real long and does not grow fast!  Dont do it!!!</li>
    <li> I guess I was misled by the other reviews. This product does not straighten hair. After the first shampoo, you are right back to the usual condition of your hair. This product will temporarily smoothe your hair (as long as you use a flat iron) and only until the next time you shampoo. I am Caucasian, with blonde hair. The marketing of this product is misleading.</li>
    <li> I actually liked the shampoo and conditioner a lot, but this stuff - not so much. It was alright at first, but it left my hair feeling a little drier than usual and when I straightened my hair with this stuff as the box instructed (with my hair still a little damp) it felt like I was frying my poor hair! Eventually, I began straightening it how I wanted to, by blow drying my hair on a cool setting until it was dry, but even then it left little keratin flakes and even made my hair break off. Maybe it was just me, but I didn&#x27;t like this stuff with my hair.</li>
    <li> I was excited after reading the reviews on Amazon (especially for African-American hair) and decided to purchase the product.  It seemed to work a little.  It straightened my hair slightly.  However, my hair has broken off terribly due to this product. My hair had grown so pretty after wearing wigs and braids for a year.  Now, it&#x27;s broken off a lot.  I think that I am going to try weaves to get it to grow back.  I read that the shampoo and conditioner are good, but I am afraid to use them.  I am afraid that they may break my hair off further.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old guy with thick and somewhat curly hair and was tired of having to straighten it everyday. I tried this stuff a while back without their shampoo and with my old straightener and it didn&#x27;t work. So last month, I bought a new straightener and the shampoo and it worked. I made sure to follow the directions completely. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair completely straight, but it comes pretty close. Sometimes, I&#x27;ll make a few touchups with my straightener every now and then, but other than that I don&#x27;t really have to do anything for about two weeks. It feels good to not worry about rain or sweat ruining my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would make my hair straight but it DIDN&#x27;T!! It only made my hair more light weight and some-what more manegeable. . . . .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what type of hair I may have, but my hair is wavy, thick and coarse, and this product did not work on my hair. I bought it with hopes of getting at least frizz free hair and after reading the positive reviews about this product, I bought the whole thing, shampoo, conditioner, and this treatment, I spent a lot of time blow drying my hair (I have  a LOT of hair) and then flat ironed it, I even bought a new flat iron because the old one I had did not heat up to 450f, and after the 24 hr period I shampooed and voila, same old crappy frizzy but shiny and sort of smooth hair.... meh what did I expect for 6 bucks....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh and ALSO forgot to add that it made my scalp very itchy!!!!</li>
    <li> I searched around for an inexpensive keritan treatment, without harsh chemicals, that I could easily use at home. After doing a lot of research on the internet I purchased this product, together with the shampoo and conditioner. And I have to say that I&#x27;m really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in NYC and have shoulder length, thick, wavy hair that frizzes easily. I used the product as directed, although my flat iron only heats up to 430 degrees. That seemed to be OK. I did the treatment on a Saturday night and the whole process took about 1 3/4 hours. The directions were easy to follow and the treatment smelled great. I used about 1/2 bottle, so I&#x27;ll have enough for a second treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After I finished, I did not use any hairspray or styling cream, because I wanted to see if the product really worked.  I went out to meet a friend at a restaurant. It was a very humid night. Normally my hair would frizz as soon as I went outside, and I would have to pull it back or wear a hat.  But even after walking to the restaurant, my hair still looked great. Its now been two days of hot and humid weather and my hair still looks good. All I have to do is brush it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t washed my hair yet, so I&#x27;m hoping that the treatment will hold up though several washes.  But at least I know I&#x27;ll have good hair for a few days!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair treatment because it was on a super discount at my local store (warning ..?) but for 2 $$ I figured I&#x27;d use it for sure!! My results were ;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could barely brush my hair out after applying the product, as directed. (I used 1/4 .. Maybe 1/3 of bottle on my halfway down my back hair) Lost a lot of hair in that process. Uggh not going so well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put my hair up for the 30 minute recommendation, it&#x27;d halfway dried &amp; was pretty crunchy to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blowdried, brushed, then flat ironed, exactly as directed. My hair was very straight. But in addition it was very crunchy, very sticky, very brittle and very unpleasant to touch. It had shine but not anymore shine then I usually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually reminded me of putting a bunch of gel and mousse in my hair and then blow drying and straightening. it pretty much had the exact effect, in fact I think that&#x27;s pretty much what the stuff is... not really a keratin treatment but just some stuff to goop it up and keep it straight with gel/mousse like product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I found that I&#x27;m better off just putting some high quality oils (ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Pure Kendi Oil Pure Treatment oil, also found in amazon &amp;lt;3) in my hair before I blow dry and straighten it works out 1000 times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Ended up washing it out immediately because I couldn&#x27;t stand the sticky feeling and I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair without them getting stuck. I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> Ok, so it does not give me straight hair for 14 days BUT I now love my curly hair! I think this product is being marketed incorrectly. I use this product about once a month according to directions, and about once a week without using any heat, just as a leave in treatment. So, I say that it&#x27;s marketed incorrectly because, while I definitely have beautiful, straight, silky hair when I use it with the flat iron at about 400 degrees, the benefit I enjoy most are the days after I wash again...beautiful, frizz free curls! I&#x27;ve found that using condition makes my hair frizz, so I shampoo only, then allow my hair to air dry and use a curling iron to shape the curls just a bit in the front around my face. So easy! After 48 years of hating my frizz head, I now love my natural curls! PLUS, I can go straight and sleek anytime I want to and simultaneously treat my hair!!! This is the best hair product I have ever experienced!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews b/c of Amazon Big Brothers.  But, I have to say, (if this gets posted), that this stuff is amazing.  I just used it on my post relaxer 5 month old african american not sure hair type.  Hair is usually fine and fizzy.  OMG!!! I cannot stop touching my hair.  The instructions and directions are very easy, you cannot mess this up.  I just went back online to purchase as much of this stuff as I could afford today!!!  Will be back to stockpile.  I am never relaxing my hair again.  No need, none.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and not with the renpure shampoo, but this is SUPER easy to use.  I am a caucasian with thick, fine, shoulder length, highlighted hair.  After putting in the product and waiting 30 min per the directions, I blow dried my hair which seemed to dry faster than normal, and I can honestly say, my hair was sleeker, smoother and softer.  Even though I didn&#x27;t think I really needed to flat iron, I followed the directions on the box and flat ironed it.  8 hours later, my hair still looks amazing.  The best part is it only took about a silver dollar amount of the product and the product is so inexpensive.  I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil for years and this blew it away!</li>
    <li> While I spend a lot  of money to keep my curly course hair smooth I decided to give this a try. It did not live up to it&#x27;s promise of smoothing frizzy, wavy hair. I have used it twice and did not notice the least bit of change. I am glad it was inexpensive, but I will never purchase this product again. I am very disappointed that they make an untrue claim and should be more honest about what they sell. Very unhappy customer.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work like the real BKTs. Not only that but it left a flaky residue in my hair that I had to  wash out immediately. You pay for what you get and in this case, I didn&#x27;t anything.</li>
    <li> I bought this treatment first, then the following day after using treatment went back to Bed Bath and got the shampoo and conditioner to go with it. I would have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised after the treatment; I followed the quite simple instructions and really liked how the treatment made my frizzy slightly coarse wavy asian hair almost pin straight. I was like, no way this will keep tomorrow. I was even more amazed when i washed my hair the next day with the shampoo and conditioner and just just let it air dry after towel drying, and never had to use my blow dryer nor my flat iron straightener and it stayed fairly straight. Day two though not quite as straight after just air drying. There were some waves but my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy at all. So for the following days forward, I found that slightly air drying, then running the flat iron over my hair a few times at the med to low settings did the trick (hair remaining still slightly damp after, and it&#x27;s one of those wet to straight irons.) Althought eventually in the following days, some slight waves came back especially if I used a scrunchy to tie my hair back for a bit while at work. Over all, now day 14, still quite pleased with the results. I also noticed fewer breakages and less tangling. Note: I wash my hair everyday, and always have. So for a treatment with shampoo and conditioner combo, these 3 are pretty good products (especially for the price!! The shampoo and conditioner were discounted at BB.) Now I wonder if I should stock up since I only have one of each...?</li>
    <li> I have blonde wavy hair and I usually use a hot iron to straighten them. Was impressed by the promise on this product to keep my hair straight up to 14 days after using it. That didn&#x27;t work. I applied product as instruction said. Well, my hair is straight anyway if I use blow drier and flattening iron. My hope was with this treatment is will last up to 14 days. But after the first wash my hair was back to wavy. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this product when I purchased it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair isn&#x27;t super curly...just a little wavy.  The Renpure didn&#x27;t last after one washing and actually seemed to leave my hair a little more frizzy.</li>
    <li> It smells like coconuts. And maybe bananas? In a good way. Won&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it oily. Doesn&#x27;t help with humidity, though. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair straight, but cuts down on straightening time. Pretty good, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It does the job, My hair is coarse 3C/4A so it only last 7-14 days like it says maybe a little longer. I recommend deep conditioning a few days to a week before because, your hair will dry out from all the heat that you need to seal the Keratin.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but wanted to share so people don&#x27;t mAke the same mistake I did. I&#x27;m a single, stay at home mom. Some days I just can&#x27;t get around to doing my hair because it&#x27;s so time consuming. So when I saw this organic product I thought, why not, no chemicals, it&#x27;s organic, if it Doesnt work, at least there&#x27;s no damage. I was wrong. I have very shiny hair, this product made my hair dull and now I have tons and tons of split ends. I don&#x27;t have thick, super curly hair and it still didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a waste of money and a waste of time...something I was hoping to save.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having Keratin treatments in the salon. I&#x27;ve used it as a fix to help maintain the smoothness during hot, humid NYC summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that it didn&#x27;t make my hair as smooth as the treatment in the salon, but I also have to tell you that I used it as part of my morning routine going to work and didn&#x27;t keep it on too long. Nor did I totally concentrate on my flat iron technique. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s come out fantastic. Looks good and kept the hair looking neat and smooth all day while I was sweating and going in/ out of subways and etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their other products are amazing as well. The Argan oil line is my favorite. Its comparable to the Moroccan oil products, but at less than a 1/4 of the cost. The conditioners, blow out cream are favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. Remember, it&#x27;s only $5.99...I should also mention that I have long hair mid down my back and didn&#x27;t even use the whole bottle. I&#x27;m going to add it to my routine.</li>
