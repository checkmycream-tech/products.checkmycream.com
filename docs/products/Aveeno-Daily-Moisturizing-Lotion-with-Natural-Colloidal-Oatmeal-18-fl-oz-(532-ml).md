### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness is excellent.</li>
      <li>Great on the face</li>
      <li>But it does a great job at moisturizing the skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good (fragrant) though.</li>
      <li>Now my skin feel powdery smooth and best of all no cracks!</li>
      <li>good thing to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for itchy skin with the right balance of oils.</li>
      <li>The lotion is just perfect, but despite being odourless it does seem to have a certain chemical like odour which doesn&#x27;t smell to good.</li>
      <li>you want to scent this product, buy some rose oil</li>
      <li>Rose oil helps to balance your emotions&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>Even after using some of the popular medicated ones, no change.</li>
      <li>You can still feel it once it&#x27;s on, but it feels more like a velvety fullness than a liquid or grease.</li>
      <li>I love this nonscented lotion.  </li>
      <li>I was extremely pleased with Aveeno.  </li>
      <li>I use it mostly for hands).</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>Well Packaged, Very Satisfied,  Thanks!</li>
      <li>I also enjoy using the Aveeno Body Wash and Soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>lotion absorbs easily, it is smooth, healing and a creamy comforting addition to your day.</li>
      <li>If you enjoy scented lotions, try the Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works so great on dry hands and feet too..  </li>
      <li>It is just Aveeno lotion, which is nothing special.</li>
      <li>Not only does it do a good job moisturizing, but it also keeps my skin from itching.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m not overly enthusiastic about the scent of this unscented product that is easily remedied by the addition of any essential oil I want to add before slathering this on my skin.</li>
      <li>the city to which I moved has a lot of calcium in its water and I became pregnant.  </li>
      <li>Our pediatrician recommended Aveeno lotion for my son&#x27;s eczema and it helped quickly, so I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>The smell is mild and organic.</li>
      <li>For treating dry skin, you seem to have a choice between products that are effective but feel sticky, greasy, or oily on the skin (e.g., petroleum jelly based formulas) and products that are relatively pleasant to use but essentially ineffective (e.g., Vaseline Intensive Care).</li>
      <li>Very pleasant and subtle.</li>
      <li>It felt great going on and for a few hours.</li>
      <li>but she seems to be an expert in lotions and will only use this kind.  </li>
      <li>In addition to several products I tried, many people recommended sweet almond oil to help my skin and avoid stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>: 3 damaged; all Exp. 2015/7; different of introduction image.</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno products for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Aveeno is not totally ideal, but it&#x27;s by far the best compromise that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>expect to use it for 2 years or more if you are like me only put half nail size every day :)</li>
      <li>not too much oil.</li>
      <li>You know that feeling you get after eating really greasy fried food?</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>The pediatrician says that it even helps sunburns to heal without peeling too much.</li>
      <li>lotion feels buttery and sumptuous going on, but it rubs in without leaving too much of a residue.</li>
      <li>I am constantly amazed by how soft and comfortable my skin is now!</li>
      <li>The main ingredient seems to be Oat Kernel Flour</li>
      <li>and that is the main reason I buy this product.</li>
      <li>Instead of this I highly recommend the Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil instead (ASIN:B0000C0XL8).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Aveeno Oatmeal Products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This is a super, non-perfumy and luxurious-feeling lotion for your maddingly dry and itchy skin.</li>
      <li>When I discussed this with my dermatologist, he recommended I use Aveeno lotion, as it was a good product and, although no direct studies have been done regarding the link between nut allergies and lotions during pregnancy, he was not sure about the absorbtion of the nut oil into my skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not necessary to use very much, so that helps to minimize the sense of having lotion on your skin.</li>
      <li>I actually saw Aveeno products a couple of years ago, but didn&#x27;t pay much attention to them.  </li>
      <li>you will only use a 25% as much as other lotions so the price is justified.</li>
      <li>Finally, a lotion that actually does what it&#x27;s advertised to do -- I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It smells a lot like lanolin (found in fresh unprocessed wool), although the product does not actually contain lanolin.</li>
      <li>and I thought I had tried every product on the market with little success.</li>
      <li>The skin calming and healing qualities of oatmeal are almost immediately apparent.</li>

<li> One year ago, two things changed to really dry out my skin:  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin, so dry it cracked.</li>
<li> it gets dry at the openning, so everyday I&#x27;ll find a little solid lump there, but it can be rubbed out.</li>
<li> It seems to just sink right in and go to work instantly, and it keeps on working hard all day to protect your skin from the drying effects of indoor heat and the cold winter temperatures.</li>
<li> The only thing I can add is it doesn&#x27;t smell like a ridiculous flower garden when she puts it on before bed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d prefer even less of a \\&quot;have</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;and add a few drops.</li>
<li> Within a few days of using this product you will notice a difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I do, and while I&#x27;m not sure if the label indicates that this is not a product for your face and scalp...</li>
<li> It was hard to even wash off.</li>
<li> br /&gt;It was very comforting to my outraged skin.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the bad shopping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this nonscented lotion.  I was having problems with skin irritation on my back and shoulders and one application took care of it.</li>
    <li> I like everything except the fragrance.</li>
    <li> good thing to use. water feel. not too much oil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;problem: &lt;br /&gt;1. it gets dry at the openning, so everyday I&#x27;ll find a little solid lump there, but it can be rubbed out. &lt;br /&gt;2. too big. expect to use it for 2 years or more if you are like me only put half nail size every day :)</li>
    <li> No 24 hour relief as promised</li>
    <li> For treating dry skin, you seem to have a choice between products that are effective but feel sticky, greasy, or oily on the skin (e.g., petroleum jelly based formulas) and products that are relatively pleasant to use but essentially ineffective (e.g., Vaseline Intensive Care). Aveeno is not totally ideal, but it&#x27;s by far the best compromise that I&#x27;ve found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The lotion feels buttery and sumptuous going on, but it rubs in without leaving too much of a residue. It&#x27;s not necessary to use very much, so that helps to minimize the sense of having lotion on your skin. You can still feel it once it&#x27;s on, but it feels more like a velvety fullness than a liquid or grease. I&#x27;d prefer even less of a \\&quot;have some lotion on\\&quot; feeling, though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness is excellent. My experience has been that a daily application at night is sufficient to prevent or cure dryness symptoms (roughness, cracking, flaking - I use it mostly for hands). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best of all, this product has no added perfume. The smell is mild and organic. It smells a lot like lanolin (found in fresh unprocessed wool), although the product does not actually contain lanolin. Very pleasant and subtle.</li>
    <li> My wife is a nurse and she swears by this.  I haven&#x27;t personally used it but she seems to be an expert in lotions and will only use this kind.  The only thing I can add is it doesn&#x27;t smell like a ridiculous flower garden when she puts it on before bed.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with itchy, prickly, winter-dry skin for years and I thought I had tried every product on the market with little success. Our pediatrician recommended Aveeno lotion for my son&#x27;s eczema and it helped quickly, so I decided to try it. I am constantly amazed by how soft and comfortable my skin is now! The bottle says it lasts 24 hrs and it truly does. It even lasts through a shower, but it is not greasy at all. Love, love, love this product. The pediatrician says that it even helps sunburns to heal without peeling too much.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I actually saw Aveeno products a couple of years ago, but didn&#x27;t pay much attention to them.  Ony recently I&#x27;ve been purchasing them and I like them all (the lotion, soap, cream ect..)  I especially like the baby aveeno moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good (fragrant) though.</li>
    <li> you will only use a 25% as much as other lotions so the price is justified. Great on the face</li>

Rose oil helps to balance your emotions&lt;br /&gt;and that in itself will help your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This is a super, non-perfumy and luxurious-feeling lotion for your maddingly dry and itchy skin. It seems to just sink right in and go to work instantly, and it keeps on working hard all day to protect your skin from the drying effects of indoor heat and the cold winter temperatures. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products for my dry skin.  Not only does it do a good job moisturizing, but it also keeps my skin from itching.</li>
    <li> I am sorry I bought such a huge bottle of this thinking it was soothing.  It is just Aveeno lotion, which is nothing special.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno for about two weeks and I definitely notice a difference in the look and feel of my skin. I have very dry skin, so dry it cracked. Even after using some of the popular medicated ones, no change. Now my skin feel powdery smooth and best of all no cracks! Finally, a lotion that actually does what it&#x27;s advertised to do -- I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> One year ago, two things changed to really dry out my skin:  the city to which I moved has a lot of calcium in its water and I became pregnant.  In addition to several products I tried, many people recommended sweet almond oil to help my skin and avoid stretch marks.  When I discussed this with my dermatologist, he recommended I use Aveeno lotion, as it was a good product and, although no direct studies have been done regarding the link between nut allergies and lotions during pregnancy, he was not sure about the absorbtion of the nut oil into my skin.  I was extremely pleased with Aveeno.  My skin was always moist, the lotion went on well and left no greasy residue.  I have no stretch marks.</li>
    <li> The lotion is just perfect, but despite being odourless it does seem to have a certain chemical like odour which doesn&#x27;t smell to good. But it does a great job at moisturizing the skin.</li>
    <li> 2015/2/23 shopped, 2015/3/25 received.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the bad shopping. 5pack: 3 damaged; all Exp. 2015/7; different of introduction image.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works so great on dry hands and feet too..  I like Aveeno for this reason..</li>
    <li> I do, and while I&#x27;m not sure if the label indicates that this is not a product for your face and scalp... it should! It felt great going on and for a few hours. But by late morning and for the whole rest of the day I felt like I was covered in grease. You know that feeling you get after eating really greasy fried food? That&#x27;s the one! It was hard to even wash off. Instead of this I highly recommend the Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil instead (ASIN:B0000C0XL8). You only need a tiny little bit and it works wonders just after shaving my head and face.</li>
    <li> I recently had a severe outbreak of psorisis.  I used this lotion and the oilated oatmeal bath daily. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was very comforting to my outraged skin.  I highly recommend Aveeno Oatmeal Products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I see a friend with problems and I don&#x27;t have time to go make them something, I hurry to the drugstore to pick up one of their products with oatmeal in it.  It&#x27;s perfect for itchy skin with the right balance of oils.</li>
