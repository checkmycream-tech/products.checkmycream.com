      <li>This oil does absorb fairly quickly, which is nice.  </li>

      <li>It is a great product for dry cuticles and it moisturizes extremely well and does a great job.</li>
      <li>This stuff dries out really quickly and doesn&#x27;t even seem like you did anything to your nails.</li>
      <li>It has a nice basic scent.</li>
      <li>As an added bonus, I think it also keeps my manicure fresh and longer-lasting.  </li>
      <li>my nails  and cuticle looking freshly manicured.</li>
      <li>It also soaks in pretty quick where I can go on with my day.</li>
      <li>Price is right.</li>
      <li>If you have super dry cuticles or hands in general, this stuff would probably be great for you.</li>
      <li>And allows me to go a long time between manicures and just maintain my nails on my own.</li>
      <li>Its the only way to keep my nails looking good and my cuticles soft, so that I dont pick them.</li>
      <li>The one that continues to split is much better and hopefully will eventually be the same as the others.  </li>
      <li>It smells really nice, due to the almond oil.</li>
      <li>The oil dries pretty fast</li>
      <li>Now all my nails are hard (all except 1) and have a good length to them.  </li>
      <li>And my cuticles feel very moisturized afterwards.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I really recommend the Solar Oil if are having problems with your nails.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I wish it was available in a larger size though.</li>

      <li>Seriously save yourself money and get a bottle of almond oil, same thing and does just as good of a job!</li>
      <li>This is really nice on my nails brings them back to life if you do dry manucure</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It makes your hands real soft and your cuticles.</li>
      <li>It also helps dry your polish if you lightly brush it over your last coat/top coat.</li>

      <li>I have always had rather soft nails</li>
      <li>This completes my manicure, keeping my cuticles soft and preventing hangnails.</li>
      <li>I use it to keep my hands soft.</li>
      <li>After only a few times of using it my cuticles feel way better</li>
      <li>It really soaks into my cuticles and helps them not to look so dry and mangled.</li>
      <li>Worth the money and less trips to nail salon.</li>
      <li>Just use Jojoba, sweet almond oil and even add some others known for protecting the protein in hair and nails like - raw coconut oil.</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks I&#x27;m seeing real healing of rough raggedy cuticles.</li>
      <li>Just a swipe of the brush around your cuticle when you&#x27;re getting ready to sit still for a little while (reading your Kindle, or going to bed-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product came in a timely matter. It&#x27;s a nice product seems just like one used at the nail salon.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my cuticle every night before bed just to soften up my cuticle a little, I like it I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to what it says. It is a great product for dry cuticles and it moisturizes extremely well and does a great job. Thank you Solar!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used to be a manicurist. This product is a miracle in a bottle for dry cuticles and skin. It also helps dry your polish if you lightly brush it over your last coat/top coat. Nice!!</li>
    <li> I have horrible, dry cuticles! I have been searching for a cuticle oil that doesn&#x27;t make my hands look like I had just eaten a bucket of fried chicken. CND Solar Oil is great! It really soaks into my cuticles and helps them not to look so dry and mangled. It also soaks in pretty quick where I can go on with my day. I usually put this on in the morning and before I go to bed! I love it! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Bottle is very little.  Cheaper to buy this at CVS in a bigger size.  But, that said, I used it after polishing my nails with CND Shellac.  It made the polish peel off.  Need to use one or the other, not both.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good when you use it every night. It makes your hands real soft and your cuticles.</li>
    <li> I have been using Creative Nail Solar Oil Nail &amp; Cuticle Treatment for many years.  I have thick cuticles and dry nails (although they are strong and never break).  I use it every night before going to bed and it really helps the dryness.  As an added bonus, I think it also keeps my manicure fresh and longer-lasting.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> THIS CUTICLE NAIL OIL SMELLS LIKE VANILLA. I REALLY LIKE THE SMELL, AND FOR THE PRICE ON AMAZON, YOU CANT GO WRONG.</li>
    <li> This is a must if you use a UV or LED light for manicures. It moisturizers your nail &amp; cuticle without being overly greasy. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Best cuticle treatment I&#x27;ve used.  I like the brush on application (the others I&#x27;ve used were cremes and squirt bottles).  The brush is my favorite.  The oil dries pretty fast and I haven&#x27;t noticed it staining any clothing. It&#x27;s like what they put on at the salon.</li>
    <li> I like this oil for manicure use, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my nails.  It has a nice basic scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I use and it was received as I expected.  Recommended by my manicurist.  No decision needed to be made on what to buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered 1 bottle to try and see how it worked on my finger nails.  I have always had rather soft nails and if they grew any length, they split or chipped and I would have to cut them back.  I looked on the internet at the nail products and liked what I read about the Solar Oil.  I ordered a bottle to try and really liked it!  Now all my nails are hard (all except 1) and have a good length to them.  The one that continues to split is much better and hopefully will eventually be the same as the others.  It has a little length to it and feels as hard as the others.  Anyway, I really recommend the Solar Oil if are having problems with your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Susie Cue</li>
    <li> Using this oil for a long time-huge help for my cuticles and nails.</li>
    <li> This is a quality cuticle oil and I love it......</li>
    <li> I have used it before, but ran out, and just ordered online recently.  It is wonderful for dry cuticles, fingers, toes around nails, etc.  You can put lotion on these areas, but this lasts longer and works much better.</li>
    <li> You can easily make your own also. Just use Jojoba, sweet almond oil and even add some others known for protecting the protein in hair and nails like - raw coconut oil. If you want to add a little substance just add some shea butter to the mix.</li>
    <li> This oil is extremely good at managing dry, cracked, annoying cuticles.  Better than anything else I have ever found.  It goes a long way, and allows you to have lovelier hands than without it.  With winter coming on I consider it a &amp;#34;must have.&amp;#34; I used to get it at the drug store, but am having trouble finding it now.  Besides shopping online is just easier. The price is quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> Works as designed; very conditioning to the cuticles and skin. Smells really, really good. Price is right. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product has made my nails so much prettier to look at. I am 59 and my hands have been through a lot, but this product smoothed out the rough skin around my nails and they look so much younger.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice, due to the almond oil. And my cuticles feel very moisturized afterwards. Its a tiny bottle though, I will probably need to reorder too soon.</li>
    <li> i do notice a difference and it has only been a few days. i  love the size nice and conviente  purse size. i order two 1 for myslef and another for my mother who always has hers hands in something.so we shall see how good this works.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this product. I use it at least every day, some times twice a day. Easy to apply and absorbs very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this very short - I love this stuff. I use it every day, morning noon and night.  Its the only way to keep my nails looking good and my cuticles soft, so that I dont pick them. And allows me to go a long time between manicures and just maintain my nails on my own. I carry it in my purse and it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> Nice product and it smells great. I use it to keep my hands soft. I like that it isn&#x27;t very greasy and soaks in well leaving my hands feeling great.</li>
    <li> This is such a great cuticle oil! It softens my cuticles perfectly and it doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals or nail polish like a bunch of other cuticle oils do. I have seen a ton more shine and thickness in my nails since I&#x27;ve gotten this, and my nails don&#x27;t tear like they did before when I take my acrylics off. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great cuticle oil without the horrible smell.</li>
    <li> I used this in cosmo school and fell in love with it years ago. Even my husband uses it just to rub into his nails and cuticle.</li>
    <li> My old nail technician used to use Solar Oil on my cuticles and I decided I definitely had to have it again for this dry, cold winter. Just a swipe of the brush around your cuticle when you&#x27;re getting ready to sit still for a little while (reading your Kindle, or going to bed- hands outside the covers for at least 15 minutes) and your cuticles become much softer and nails grow stronger. It&#x27;s really good stuff. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This completes my manicure, keeping my cuticles soft and preventing hangnails. I also like the slight almond oil scent. I wish it was available in a larger size though.</li>
    <li> If you have super dry cuticles or hands in general, this stuff would probably be great for you. I prefer something lighter that absorbs quicker. I have to really work this oil in and around my fingernail; probably for a good 5 minutes. Always good to keep your cuticles healthy though.</li>
    <li> Seriously save yourself money and get a bottle of almond oil, same thing and does just as good of a job!</li>
    <li> I have now used this product for about a week and I already notice a difference in softening of my cuticles. Worth the money and less trips to nail salon.</li>
    <li> This is really nice on my nails brings them back to life if you do dry manucure you really need this.</li>
    <li> After only a few times of using it my cuticles feel way better i always get ridiculous dry skin around my nails so decided buy cuticle oil and I&#x27;m glad i did works great and i love how it&#x27;s a doing brush so you don&#x27;t waste allot of the product it is small like a nail Polish bottle but that doesn&#x27;t bother me convenient size for travel you could say. Shipping came on the day it said and no problems what so ever!</li>
    <li> I needed a new cuticle oil and read great things about this one. I love it and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is definitely hydration for your nails.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my nails  and cuticle looking freshly manicured.</li>
    <li> This oil does absorb fairly quickly, which is nice.  But I am not all that impressed with what it does.  My nails tend to peel back in thin layers and this product has not helped that even though I&#x27;ve used it often during the day for a few weeks!</li>
    <li> It nourishes my cuticles and get rid of all the dry skin. I love it! Thanks for this great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have tried others and nothing compares with Solar Oil. I live in the desert and my cuticles are very dry and thick. Using this every night really makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist, and it works well on my nails. I use it daily and have noticed a difference in my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I apply every night on cuticles then cover with gloves. After 2 weeks I&#x27;m seeing real healing of rough raggedy cuticles.</li>
    <li> I use this several times a day to condition my nails and cuticles while wearing CND Shellac.  If I miss a day, I can expect to see cracks in the polish.  Works great.  Has a nice scent (almond).</li>
    <li> This is a good cuticle oil but I have to apply it so many times and the item was sd. maller than expecte</li>
    <li> Use at least twice everyday. You will understand after a few days. It will keep your manicure lasting longer and your cuticles beautiful.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a lot of hype but I don&#x27;t see it doing anything fantastic for my cuticles. They are still dry and prone to flaking... This stuff dries out really quickly and doesn&#x27;t even seem like you did anything to your nails. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be buying again. I get better moisture from putting bio oil or something on my nails than this stuff! not worth the money IMO</li>
    <li> Thanks from Germany !!!</li>
