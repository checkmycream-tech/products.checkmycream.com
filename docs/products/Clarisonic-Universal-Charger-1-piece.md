    <li> FYI. this does not work for the Clarisonic Mia. Do not buy if that is what you need. Good luck if you are trying to find a replacement. :p I found it easier to buy an entire new Mia then to deal with the Clarisonic customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought this charger to use oversees because it is \\&quot;Universal\\&quot;.  After being plugged to a  220 volts source, it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I bought this charger and it worked well for several weeks and then mysteriously stopped working.  I thought it was a fluke but after reading the other review and seeing that the same thing happened, I am concluding that wherever these chargers come from they are a very poor quality.  They weren&#x27;t cheap either.  Not happy.  Would NOT recommend.  Waste of perfectly good money.</li>
    <li> I bought this relatively expensive item to go w/ my Mia and it doesn&#x27;t work... at all.  Really wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
    <li> This product seriously does not work and even broke my clarisonic mia. My clarisonic &amp;#34;charged&amp;#34; and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
    <li> I lost my charger somehow during a move.  I was very happy to find the charger available as a separate purchase!  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Happy to have found this product online to replace my missing charger.  I was not able to my Clarisonic face cleaner until I got another charger. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good.  Got here on time.  Same as the one I had.  Love the Clarisonic but wish the replacement charger was so expensive.</li>
    <li> Looks great, but it stopped charging after maybe 3 uses. I just use it as a stand now, so at least I found a use for it!</li>
    <li> I lost my charger during a move and I was so afraid buying a new charger would be a major hassle and too expensive, so when I found this product I was so relieved to find it at a reasonable price. The item arrived EARLY with some free samples and works exactly like the one that came with my Clarisonic. Hopefully I won&#x27;t need to, but I would definitely replace my charger again.</li>
    <li> When my charger died I wanted to look for a replacment  this one is great! The only downside is I wish it came in different colors to match the Mia</li>
    <li> Works great! Didnt know how it worked...but it does! ah ah yeppee, its so great i cant stand it. yep</li>
    <li> Recieved product as shown and in a timely manner. It works perfectly with my Claraconic Unit and I am happy to have it.</li>
    <li> My cat decided she needed to chew my original cord in half and I didn&#x27;t use my brush for a few months while looking for a replacement cradle. I finally found this one and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This only works for &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; models, not for any of the Mia models. So it&#x27;s not really universal. I was told no replacements are available for the others.</li>
    <li> This WILL NOT WORK FOR THE MIA 2, and when you contact Clarisonic they tell you that if you didn&#x27;t get the product from them or a dealer it&#x27;s not guaranteed also when I bought this it didn&#x27;t tell you the box says for PLUS PRO and Classic models so it will not work for any model such as the MIA 2 at all</li>
    <li> I moved &amp; lost my ClairSonic Mia charger. This one works like a charm! No problems on the outlet either</li>
    <li> The charger seemed provide a full charge at first, then slowly dwindled over the course of a few weeks. I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the box. It would be going back.</li>
    <li> My cat chewed through the charger for my Clairsonic. There were negative reviews for this charger, but I took a chance on it because it was the only charger that I could find that matched my Clairsonic Pro, purchases about 2 years ago. Unfortunately, it does not charge my unit. Guess I am totally out of luck unless I want to purchase a totally new Clairsonic. Unless anyone out there can point me in another direction? I am returning this charger.</li>
    <li> I have have nothing but problems with this charging cradle.&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through two clarisonics because the charging cradle will not charge the unit correctly and within a week or two, the clarisonics stop working totally.&lt;br /&gt;With luck, i have been able to take them back for a new one.</li>
    <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have thrown away the box. This thing wasn&#x27;t cheap and it doesn&#x27;t work. At all.  Sucks.</li>
