      <li>and I liked it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lather: Works up to a great, rich and creamy lather.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lots of easily whipped up lather and a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Used with a good shave brush, this soap provides a nice, stable lather for a comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Smell: It smells very strong and rugged.</li>
      <li>Honestly my Gillette canned goo works better</li>
      <li>having gotten an appropriate brush for it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;While “Mahogany” is stated in many places, the box is labeled “Mahoney Effect”.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite shaving soaps.</li>
      <li>A lot of my roommates love the scent.</li>
      <li>I wish I had ordered one with a bit more fragrance though.</li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>I love it, though it might be a bit strong for some people.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It performs very well with good cushion though others may be better in terms of slickness.</li>
      <li>My DR Harris experience first with Arlington and now with Marlborough is that it&#x27;s a strong performing soap with a good lather.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing better than a smooth, burn-free shave.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted to try some good soap that was at the high end of what I thought was reasonable price wise.</li>
      <li>but i continue to use it due to the wonderful shave i get with it.</li>
      <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as some had described so</li>
      <li>The product itself is great, BUT plan on spending a solid hour trying to scrape the sticker/label off of the bowl and lid.</li>
      <li>and while I do understand what the people describing, I have come to enjoy both the lather and the scent</li>
      <li>is a hardwood soap bowl designed to fit the company’s product line is embossed with gold lettering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would describe it as more woodsy and masculine, but again, to each his own.</li>
      <li>Overall, a very nice soap.</li>
      <li>so I expect a good 1 year plus use of this tub so for the price it costs less than a dollar a month for one of the worlds classiest and most respected soaps and brands in the shaving world.</li>
      <li>what a super lather.</li>
      <li>I used my trusty Semogue boar and whipped up a amazing lather as I expected as all DR Harris products are top of the line the Ferrari of the shaving soap world.</li>
      <li>Even after scrubbing with four rubbing alcohol swabs, the sticky residue remains on the otherwise nice wooden bowl.</li>
      <li>Once you figure out the proper water/product ratio, it won&#x27;t dry your skin out and the razor glides beautifully across your skin.  </li>
      <li>a very clean soapy citrus scent good nut not great.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap if you want a rich thick lather with ample cushion and great slickness and glide for your shaving experience while your at it pick up the matching aftershave splash the scent</li>
      <li>Takes little to work up a good lather.</li>
      <li>While I love the scent of Arlington, however, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the woodsy/humidor/spice scent of Marlborough.</li>
      <li>I go the more traditional 3-pass route without irritation--this stuff works for me, but YMMV.  </li>
      <li>the scent was of masculine , cedar, fern , lightly floral and woodsy.</li>
      <li>love this soap and will likely never switch.</li>
      <li>I received my double edged razor and was very excited to use it, but the shaving soap took longer to ship, so I was relegated to getting some garbage soap from Walgreens.</li>
      <li>Currently it contains beef tallow, which some shavers consider essential to getting a good lather.</li>
      <li>undertone is not unpleasant adding a very masculine component, I am</li>
      <li>Drawback is the sticky tape on the of the wooden box - it does not wash easily.</li>
      <li>high-quality soap, with a masculine scent that builds a good lather giving ample time to shave without feeling rushed.&lt;br /&gt;This is manufactured by an English company established in 1790 that is widely considered one of the best in the field.&lt;br /&gt;You must use a shaving brush with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is different and hard to describe.  </li>
      <li>So far the product performs as advertised but it is really too soon if it as good staying power as a long lasting shaving soap.</li>
      <li>This is my first old school style soap</li>
      <li>Nice, slick shave.  </li>
      <li>Marlborough sent is mainly cedar scent.</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>/&gt;Longevity: I use it every day and wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasts almost a year for</li>
      <li>is the same but even more prominent and you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you like that woodsy cedar and fern aroma.</li>

    <li> Soap is great. Drawback is the sticky tape on the of the wooden box - it does not wash easily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smell: It smells very strong and rugged. I love it, though it might be a bit strong for some people.&lt;br /&gt;Lather: Works up to a great, rich and creamy lather.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: I use it every day and wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasts almost a year for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this soap and will likely never switch.</li>
    <li> Like the scent, not overpowering like some shave soaps.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, BUT plan on spending a solid hour trying to scrape the sticker/label off of the bowl and lid. Holy cow, that was just ridiculous. Even after scrubbing with four rubbing alcohol swabs, the sticky residue remains on the otherwise nice wooden bowl.</li>
    <li> I started my  DR Harris journey with the Arlington scent and I liked it but it was a very clean soapy citrus scent good nut not great. After reading reviews on a shaving forum I realized that Marlborough was the scent I was after !!!!! It did not disappoint !! I used my trusty Semogue boar and whipped up a amazing lather as I expected as all DR Harris products are top of the line the Ferrari of the shaving soap world. the scent was of masculine , cedar, fern , lightly floral and woodsy. Just what I wanted and my face needed. The soap will last a very long time at least 3 months or longer with daily use and this is if it was my only soap which it is not so I expect a good 1 year plus use of this tub so for the price it costs less than a dollar a month for one of the worlds classiest and most respected soaps and brands in the shaving world. I highly recommend this soap if you want a rich thick lather with ample cushion and great slickness and glide for your shaving experience while your at it pick up the matching aftershave splash the scent is the same but even more prominent and you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you like that woodsy cedar and fern aroma.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product cannot be stated well enough in words. I received my double edged razor and was very excited to use it, but the shaving soap took longer to ship, so I was relegated to getting some garbage soap from Walgreens. That worked well enough to get me through the waiting for this to arrive. The comparison is night and day! From the lather that I work up, to how it makes my face feel and the scent; it is head and shoulder above anything else I have used for shaving. There is no reason to even try anything else once you find a product as great as this. I cant wait to try their other scents!</li>
    <li> Lots of easily whipped up lather and a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> What more can I say? Takes little to work up a good lather. Supports a great close shave and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Im not a huge fan of the scent but i continue to use it due to the wonderful shave i get with it. A lot of my roommates love the scent.</li>
    <li> I like using this and the matching cologne. Very good products from an original. Wish they made a bath soap in the flavor.</li>
    <li> Having purchased this brand of soap for myself and son; I subsequently purchased this for my son-in-law. There&#x27;s nothing better than a smooth, burn-free shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff! Nice rich lather and a beautiful mahogany bowl.  I wish I had ordered one with a bit more fragrance though. This doesn&#x27;t smell anything besides the wooden bowl.</li>
    <li> Great soap! If you haven&#x27;t tried it you should do so! Marlborough sent is mainly cedar scent. Overall, a very nice soap.</li>
    <li> After years using an electric razor, I have returned to wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This time, I am using a badger brush and shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;This high-quality soap, with a masculine scent that builds a good lather giving ample time to shave without feeling rushed.&lt;br /&gt;This is manufactured by an English company established in 1790 that is widely considered one of the best in the field.&lt;br /&gt;You must use a shaving brush with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is different and hard to describe.  The mention of tobacco undertone in the scent is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;This undertone is not unpleasant adding a very masculine component, I am a non-smoker.&lt;br /&gt;The scent will not stay on your skin or interfere with anything you wish to use.&lt;br /&gt;While “Mahogany” is stated in many places, the box is labeled “Mahoney Effect”.&lt;br /&gt;This is a hardwood soap bowl designed to fit the company’s product line is embossed with gold lettering.&lt;br /&gt;I expended some effort to remove the paper label and tape from the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;I still have adhesive in a couple of spots.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the soap and like the scent.</li>
    <li> My DR Harris experience first with Arlington and now with Marlborough is that it&#x27;s a strong performing soap with a good lather. While I love the scent of Arlington, however, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the woodsy/humidor/spice scent of Marlborough. If you like Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s Trafalgar, you&#x27;ll probably like this scent as well. Again, your mileage may vary, it&#x27;s just not a scent for me.</li>
    <li> Used with a good shave brush, this soap provides a nice, stable lather for a comfortable shave.  Once you figure out the proper water/product ratio, it won&#x27;t dry your skin out and the razor glides beautifully across your skin.  I go the more traditional 3-pass route without irritation--this stuff works for me, but YMMV.  The smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as some had described so maybe it was the batch of soap I received...and no, it doesn&#x27;t smell like cigarette smoke.  I would describe it as more woodsy and masculine, but again, to each his own.</li>
    <li> Nice, slick shave.  It makes a great lather.  The scent is subtle enough to allow you to wear a cologne afterwards.  Best shaving soap I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> Honestly my Gillette canned goo works better</li>
    <li> Good quality. five  stars I will order this soap again .</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shaving soaps. It performs very well with good cushion though others may be better in terms of slickness. Currently it contains beef tallow, which some shavers consider essential to getting a good lather.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to try some good soap that was at the high end of what I thought was reasonable price wise. Read some of the review of what it smells like and while I do understand what the people describing, I have come to enjoy both the lather and the scent having gotten an appropriate brush for it.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff</li>
    <li> The best shaving soap I&#x27;ve used. Has a great aroma light however effective.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this soap!!! This is my first old school style soap and I have recently switched from the can crap (gillete/edge) They have so many chemicals in them!!!! My face has had less ingrown hairs also!</li>
    <li> So far the product performs as advertised but it is really too soon if it as good staying power as a long lasting shaving soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is really great. It makes a good lather. I have been using shaving cream and thought I would try something different. If you want to try something really terrific, load your brush up with this soap and then go to your bowl and add a marble size finger tip amount of cream and whip them up together. WOW what a super lather. Give it a try.</li>
