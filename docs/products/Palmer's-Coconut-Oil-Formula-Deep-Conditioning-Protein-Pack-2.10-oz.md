      <li>I first got this on a trip to San Francisco.</li>

      <li>If you do use the neem oil BE SURE to use another oil with it-such as peppermint oil, because the neem is very pungent and the smell is not pleasant, but, the peppermint covers it up.</li>
      <li>I generally tend to use organic cocnout oil more often as a deep conitioner, though, because I can add other things to it-like peppermint oil and neem oil to stimulate the scalp to aid in  hair growth.</li>
      <li>I carefully read labels looking for something sulfate free, when I came open this gem of a protein pack.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and so does my 7 year old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This restored my dry damaged after weave hair. Left my hair thick &amp; soft. Best I&#x27;ve tried. Much cheaper at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It smells good and leaves my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I loved the smell (although my husband did not). I have a problem with my hair being frizzy and this product really helped weigh it down. I would recommend not using it more than twice a week as it can build up.</li>
    <li> I tried this protein pack as part of a hair bootcamp :-) and it was phenomenal! My hair didn&#x27;t feel brittle or anything the scent was pleasant not overpowering and mind you I&#x27;m not a fan of coconut at all but I love this conditioner and will be using it again after my relaxer. My hair responded well and it feels stronger. Love this conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Palmers is the best. There are so many great things to say about this brand and product. I use these as my regular conditioner. I still leave it on my entire shower, but unless your hair is super long, you don&#x27;t need to use the whole pack. Its a deep conditioner technically, but my hair needs the constant moisture. AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Love this product as a deep conditioner, but my other favorites are:   * Organix Argan Oil Deep Conditioner (you can buy the Macadamia Nut Oil and add to any deep conditioner)  * Creme Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment  * Macadamia Nut Oil Deep Conditioner  * Vidal Sassoon Protein Conditioner</li>
    <li> great product. i&#x27;ll use again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so inexpensive that I had low expectations but this stuff is great! It made my hair so soft and shiny and I only left it in for about 5 minutes. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I was told that I needed to use a protein pack on my hair to restore it&#x27;s luster and shine.  This is a great product.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST protein pack deep conditioner that I have ever used. I highly recommend it. I have colored hair &amp; I use this once a week to help make my hair soft &amp; stronger. It makes your hair soft &amp; easy to manage after you use this product. And the coconut smell is absolutly wonderful.</li>
    <li> First, about my hair: Straight but prone to the weird kink here and there, 14\\&quot; to 16\\&quot; long, heavily bleached, (foils) fine texture(but not soft)and lots of it. Super damaged from excessive bleaching, with significant breakage from the ears down. I also live in a dry climate with lots of wind and I run outside, so my hair is exposed to the elements daily. I blow-dry and (used to) flat iron my hair after each shampoo/condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d figured I&#x27;d have to resort to cutting my hair after heavy bleaching finally took it&#x27;s toll and salon protein treatments did nothing. On the advice of a hair-saavy girlfriend, I perused the ethnic hair section @ my local big chain store and found this treatment pack. WOW!!! I use about half this pack after Suave&#x27;s Keratin shampoo and leave on for 10-15 mins prior to rinse. After one use, my hair was markedly softer and much shinier (my husband noticed..that says something) and maintained it&#x27;s softness and manageability till my next shampoo two days later. After a month of use, my breakage and shedding has decreased at least 50%. Great product and the value is amazing.</li>
    <li> I purchased my packs from Target. I have thick, multi-ethnic hair, and this deep conditioner didn&#x27;t do much. The smell is definitely worth noting! I smelled like coconut smoothie all day :) I used one pack over several weeks, and something in this conditioner made my skin break out. This isn&#x27;t the first Palmer&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve been disappointed by, but it will be the last.</li>
    <li> My hair was feeling dry and brittle from beaching it up, so I veered into CVS to see if I could find any reasonably priced deep conditioners/treatments. I carefully read labels looking for something sulfate free, when I came open this gem of a protein pack. Since I&#x27;m already obsessed with coconut oil and I know my hair/body loves everything coconut.. and oily.. I figured this pack would be worth a shot. Boy was I right, I let it sit in my hair for longer then what the directions said.. mostly cause I was doing other things, figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I rinsed with cool water. The scent, and results are great so much so I&#x27;m dying to try Palmers Coconut Oil Shampoo, Conditioner, and Hair Milk now.</li>
    <li> This is a great protein pack. I felt the difference in my hair the first time I used it :) Love this product</li>
    <li> Always great. Fast ship</li>
    <li> So I bleach my strands a LOT, to get the colors I want. Palmer&#x27;s protein along with their olive oil hair spray saves my hair every time. I just  dyed my hair deep blue, and there was a lot of shedding, well after applying this mask the shedding stopped immediately and my roots are stronger as well. I give it five stars!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair so soft and manageable after one use. Finally,  I&#x27;ve used a product that makes a difference right away. It&#x27;s always sold out in my local stores so I had to purchase online.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone. I have low porosity hair and usually protein conditioners leave build up on my hair, but this one doesn&#x27;t. It really nourishes my hair, leaving it feeling very healthy and renewed. I love it!</li>
    <li> Luv this product! My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t keep his nose out of my hair. A Lil pricey tho. I may have to  shop around for better pricing smd cheaper,shipping.</li>
    <li> I have 4C type of hair and this deep conditioner really helps my hair to stay moisturize and manageable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product get such a high review. For me it is a nightmare. My hair did feel soft and smells good after the first usage. However starting the second day, every morning after shower, my hair is tangled together and it is so hard to separate them apart. It feels like they have been glued together with some residue that won&#x27;t go away with shampoo or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;  It has been over two weeks now and my hair still feels like glued together after each wash. I have tried the anti-residue shampoo on my hair and it won&#x27;t help. It totally ruined my hair.</li>
    <li> Give you that flowy, strong as a rope hair. If you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;F&#x27;reals though, if your hair is like straw that donkeys sleep on, get this with the quickness. Via Prime even!</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner. I love coconut and coconut oil and this works very well. I generally tend to use organic cocnout oil more often as a deep conitioner, though, because I can add other things to it-like peppermint oil and neem oil to stimulate the scalp to aid in  hair growth. I know it works because my hair is growing crazy fast. I do this one to two times per week and leave it in overnight. If you do use the neem oil BE SURE to use another oil with it-such as peppermint oil, because the neem is very pungent and the smell is not pleasant, but, the peppermint covers it up.</li>
    <li> I just did my big chop back in Oct. When I was transitioning my hair loved protein. But I used this stuff last night and my hair was not having it! My hair felt very dry, heavy and brittle. My curls were defined but I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt or looked. I guess no more protein for me</li>
    <li> At first I thought this wouldn&#x27;t work,  but I was wrong.  It left my hair so soft and noticeably shiner. Even when I went to detangle my hair I notice less breakage. Great product for the price,  will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, left my hair very shiny and soft. I&#x27;m on a treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis and the medication weakens and dries out my hair. Palmers Coconut Oil Pack made a difference in only 1 application. Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I went on a bleaching excursion a little while back in order to dye my hair fun colors. The ends of my hair ended up crispy, frizzy, and dry. I can immediately tell a difference after using this product. My hair is easier to brush, softer, lays better, abd is just better all around.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had known about this before I had caused so much damage to my hair! I learned that you not only need to deep conditioning moisturizing treatments, but also treatments with protein. If your hair is lacking in protein (which bleach will do to it) it can not effectively hold moisture. This treatment is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little tip, though: buy it somewhere like target. It&#x27;s like $2 there.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and natural and generally healthy but my ends have been splitting recently. With the winter coming, I straighten my hair more often and along with the dropping temps, I was looking for something to protect my hair from the electric heat and cold weather.  This stuff did the trick for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the entire pack and my hair smelled wonderful for two weeks; it had amazing body, felt great and looked super healthy.  I got compliments from strangers in the street everywhere I went (which is especially surprising since I spend most of my time in New York City where people are not always very nice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in a bottle or jar instead of only individual packs.</li>
    <li> I received the coconut oil protein pack as a stocking stuffer a couple years ago and I keep buying it. I have fine hair and one pack lasts me a while just using it weekly. The price is great and I live the smell!</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff every month as part of my hair care supplys. I use one about every week to deep condition my dry hair and I love it! It leaves my hair shiny, smooth and soft and it smells good too! One pack is also sufficient enough for every treatment for my medium thick hair.</li>
    <li> my hair has abused because of constant bleaching and dyeing and is now really brittle, dry and tangles a lot. i tried this products in hopes that it might at least make my hair look presentable. it did not just made my hair look presentable. it made my hair looks as if i haven&#x27;t done any damaged to it. it was even better before i abused my hair.i also love the smell. definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying new deep conditioners on my hair bit this one is defiantly my favorite right now! Leaves your hair hydrated and smelling amazing!!</li>
    <li> I bought this at target for 1.57 and went back to get more after I tried it. It was sold out. I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and milk. I have curly hair and so does my 7 year old. The protein leaves your hair so soft, I mean like silky souft even to wear curly in the summer.</li>
    <li> My daughter has 4C thick/course hair &amp; this product worked very well! Since her hair is so thick I part it into 4 sections, apply this deep conditioner one section at a time, and brush each section with a rubber brush... It was awesome! It detangled &amp; moisturized her hair very well..</li>
    <li> i love this i used it on my hair and it came out so soft i will be useing this again and i told my friends</li>
    <li> Great for moisture. I have a mixture of 3c/4a/4b hair and my hair loves this protein pack. The smell also is great too</li>
    <li> Good for moisturizing treatment. smells awesome. Great product</li>
    <li> the packets suck I should&#x27;ve known but product seems to be great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m between like and love. Now, this product seems to be marketed toward those who have dark, curly hair. I do not. What I do have is multi-process bleached hair and it&#x27;s hard  to keep it hydrated and frizz free. I first got this on a trip to San Francisco. And it was AMAZING. Now that I&#x27;m back home, I got some locally and I&#x27;m still pretty impressed with my &amp;#34;home source&amp;#34; water. I still like it, a lot, but I&#x27;m not quite as entralled with it. I did, however, buy a bunch of packs locally because I had to have them NOW (and they were a whole bunch less cash, too).</li>
    <li> The best deep conditioner on the market!</li>
    <li> One pack goes a long way... My hair is naturally straight and is a bit on the thin side now that I have reached a certain age. I am biracial and use to have thick curly hair.. not sure what happened to that, but oh well. I do not know what drew me to this product but I definitely am stuck on it. I love the smell and the feel of my hair after I&#x27;ve use this protein pack. Moisture is needed for any type of hair due to environmental factors, lack of water intake, sun, and heat damage.. and with age it only gets worst. I try to wash and deep condition my hair and scalp at least 2x a month.. if I hade more time I would do this once per week but that isn&#x27;t possible. Like with anything else you have to be consistent... If your hair is a bit courser definitely wear this protein pack under the dryer for 10minutes... You do your part and this product will do its part! End of Story!!</li>
    <li> I have entrusted Palmer&#x27;s to care for my skin since I was teen; in my 40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m trusting them with my hair. I use the entire skin care line with the exception of the lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This protein packet rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First great thing about it is the price, $1.80 in my area &amp; available at ALL beauty supplies &amp; big name stores in my area. Very available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second great thing, the quality of the product, creamy but not oily, litely scented &amp; easy to apply...there is enough in the packet for one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third great thing, the results.  My hair retained its curl factor without the friz; very soft, shiny &amp; moisturized.  I have used this product for deep conditioning &amp; instant conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product blended with your favorite oil (macadamia, argan, etc.) or alone.</li>
