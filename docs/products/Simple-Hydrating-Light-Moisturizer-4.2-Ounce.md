      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what caused it, so I stopped using everything.</li>

      <li>This simple face moisturizer works great!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try this again in the summer when it might be perfect, but it&#x27;s just not enough for my early-40s skin in sub-zero weather.</li>

      <li>I have had no allergic reaction at all, this is great for sensitive skin types!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A great light moisturizer.  The only thing missing is SPF.</li>
    <li> Product absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling hydrated but not oily or greasy. I like that it is unscented because perfumed cleansers and moisturizers usually give me a headache.</li>
    <li> I like this brand. Keeps my face soft and not feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin that is more on the oily side and I purchased this because I needed a new day time moisturizer that was not greasy. The moisturizer is not greasy at all, but something in the lotion was making me break out after a week of use. I looked up the ingredients on their website and found that mineral oil is listed as an ingredient, but it wasn&#x27;t listed on the box when I purchased it. I also think it is the mineral oil that is irritating my skin, as another reviewers have commented on. I also thought the lotion was not very hydrating. My skin still felt tight after applying so I would have to apply more. I guess I will have to keep searching...</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this! I have the driest skin ever. If I don&#x27;t put this on twice a day, my skin will scale up like a fish. This stuff is my life saver!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem to work perfectly for my skin (leaves my skin a little too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; for the rest of the day), I prefer the Aveeno face moisturizer. However, even with the slight misbalance, this product has find good things for my complexion! Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic, lightweight moisturizer, that does just what you&#x27;d expect: moisturize. It reminds me of one of those old fashioned cold cremes, thinned enough to squeeze out of a bottle. Spreads easily, absorbs quickly. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything. Didn&#x27;t cause me any discomfort or breakouts, but I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not thrilled with the ingredients. While I realize I&#x27;m putting this on my skin, not eating it, petroleum oil isn&#x27;t my first choice for anything. So, while I&#x27;m fine using it, I&#x27;ll probably look for an alternative when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and I&#x27;m middle aged, so getting the right balance of moisture without ending up greasy is sometimes hard.  In the winter I use a heavy cream both day and night, but in the summer I need something lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer is perfect for my skin.  After cleansing, I apply a drop or two all over my face, concentrating on the drier skin around my eyes.  I noticed that my skin felt dewy and moist (but not sticky or oily) after the first time I used it, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I like that the ingredients are natural, and that it&#x27;s unscented and won&#x27;t block my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still need a heavier cream for winter, but I plan to use this all summer long.</li>
    <li> Very great moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and this product has been wonderful. I have used this for a very long time. It is lightweight, does not have a fragrance and the bottle lasts for a pretty long time (I use a bottle within almost 2 months, morning and night application).</li>
    <li> Great for my very sensitive skin and mattifies my skin as well! Absorbs very quickly. Good value product and have bought a few times.</li>
    <li> I have used and liked the Simple Vital Vitamin Day Cream. The Simple Hydrating Moisturizer is terrible. It smells like bug spray. I could not use it and had to wash off the cream.</li>
    <li> Very light moisturizer, not oily at all.  I am now a convert to the&lt;br /&gt;Simple line.</li>
    <li> For a product from \\&quot;sensitive skin experts\\&quot; this stuff sure stings and burns my not-usually-sensitive skin.  It also doesn&#x27;t absorb well, so it tends to just roll up into white chunks on my face as I try to rub it in (and then my husband asked \\&quot;what the hell is all over your face!?).  Won&#x27;t buy anything else from this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and on 3 separate occasions, I have tested Simple moisturizer. Each time I&#x27;ve ended up at the dermatologist for a severe allergic skin breakout. I have severe rashes all over my face. And to think I considered using this before my wedding day! Do NOT buy this stuff. Buy Cereve instead!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face lotion. Doesn&#x27;t clog up pores for acne prone skin, and moisturizes without leaving your face all greasy, but is still heavy enough where it actually moisturizes your face! I switched from neutrogena to this,and haven&#x27;t looked back! I have been using Simple for about a year and a half, and will only buy this!</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin. It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily after use, so it has decreased the amount of breakouts I have. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin that breaks out for any reason. Too much sugar, stress, coffee, dairy, carbs... it just doesn&#x27;t help. Recently I realized that my skin was also reacting to a moisturizer that I was using. When I switched to this moisturizer, my skin was so much happier. Definitely happy with this product. Will continue using!</li>
    <li> Amazing price on a great quality, light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive yet oily skin, and am always on the lookout for moisturizer that will not irritate but is also not too heavy.  My skin is also sensitive to SPFs, and I live in AK, so a daily SPF is not really necessary (especially in the winter).  I picked up some Simple light moisturizer a couple of months ago and so far am pretty happy with it.  In fact, I&#x27;m back to buy another bottle, since I&#x27;m almost out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it moisturizes because I couldn&#x27;t keep it on my face long enough.  It had no odor when I applied it, but 30 minutes later my face smelled like a an old sour dish rag.  Yuck.  I even had my husband sniff my face to verify that it wasn&#x27;t my imagination.  I know that different products/perfumes etc. can smell differently on different people, so it might not stink on you.  Better by a sample size first...</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer after shaving. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and gets absorbed into my skin quickly and lasts a long time. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s positively radiant skin care line but found that the soap was a bit too drying on my skin; and I was none to pleased when they bumped up the price of the moisturizer either. After seeing the tv adverts when I found this at my local grocery store I was super psyched! Right off the bat I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have any SPF in it whatsoever. I brushed my feelings aside and bought it anyway. The first few times I used the product my skin felt fine; but towards the 4th and 5th washing&#x27;s I realized my face would feel warm after I applied this. And a few more uses after that I noticed that with the warmth little red spots would appear and stay at the skins surface for about five to ten minutes; and leave noticeable little bumps after they receded. I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have acne prone skin so I was really surprised (not to mention POed) to wake up with a few zits on my face. Other cons about this product for me were. 1). I find it extremely watery for a moisturizer. And 2). I find that it has a heavy almost waxy/silicon mask like way of sitting on your skin. I can definitely feel it on my face a few hours after the initial application. I don&#x27;t know if this is the \\&quot;12hr moisture\\&quot; they claim on the packaging but it doesn&#x27;t feel nice. I find myself suffering to get through this bottle as quickly as possible (I&#x27;m putting it on my elbows &amp; knees) so I can buy something better (I&#x27;m thinking about switching to Alba Botanica&#x27;s Even Advanced line). SO in short even thought I really really wanted to like this product I will DEFINITELY NOT be repurchasing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d really like to know if this reaction has happened to anybody else?</li>
    <li> So I bought this in a pinch at the store... I love natural products and always wondered about the line... Put on the product it felt a little waxy and non absorbent. It started burning about 5 minutes after. Checked in the mirror face beet red! Had to rinse it off and my face is still burning haha. Not funny :/ oh well I&#x27;ll use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizer.  It&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  I get flaky skin on my forehead and this takes care of that.  Brightens up my skin as well.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was from the Simple brand in the USA.  This product is misleading. It is not the Simple brand - it is a brand from the UK!!  Not cool!!!!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and any moisturizer tends to cause a breakout.  This is lightweight and feels great on my skin.  I like that I can wear it under make up without the heavy feeling or caked on after I apply my foundation.  Highly recommend if you need a nice simple lightweight formula.</li>
    <li> I bought this face lotion about three months ago and i have had a great experience with it. I have fairly dry skin and it gives me just the right amount of moisture for the whole day. I put it on once in the morning and once after i shower at night. I haven&#x27;t broken out from it and it doesnt burn like i&#x27;ve read from some people. All in all i love this stuff</li>
    <li> Just did not work for me</li>
    <li> when I use it on my face, i feel a little ache, i do not know why. but, generally, It is okay.</li>
    <li> This product is good but the Replenishing moisturizer feels more moisturizing to me. I like the Simple line. I just switch between moisturizers depending on how my skin feels that day. I like that they offer different options.</li>
    <li> I first bought this moisturized several years ago while I was on the hunt for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; face products. I came across this as Wal-Mart and was interested in trying it out. It was a good price for the amount and for a natural product. I began using this moisturizer and was pleased with my results. It was very lightweight and, most importantly, it did not cause me to break out. For me, however, I did not feel that it was moisturizing enough for the dry, cold winters here in Utah. Thus, I began the search for a bit heavier moisturizer to use in the winter. For the summer I think it is a great moisturizer because it is not too heavy, nor does it feel greasy. I would recommend buying this product if you are looking for a lightweight moisturizer, rather than a heavier, creamier moisturizer for the dry, cold winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price&lt;br /&gt;2. Natural (or so it says)&lt;br /&gt;3. Very lightweight&lt;br /&gt;4. Non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Was not thick enough of a moisturizer for the dry, cold winter months in Utah</li>
    <li> all there product just waste money i tried them all hope would be sensitive all did break my skin out and burn it to.</li>
    <li> I purchased the moisturizer for my daughter who has used the product in the past and likes it.  She had been unable to purchase it in her area.  She was very glad to get it.  She has multiple allergies and it is one product that doesn&#x27;t produce negative reactions.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Simple products and they are very recommended by me.  I love that they are all natural and I have already seen a difference.  Sits well and is not too thick or clogs pores.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try the Simple line because I have always had sensitive skin. About two days after I tried it, I had a horrible rash all over my face. I suspect it may be due in part to the mineral oil that is used in the moisturizer which has been known to clog pores. I have spent over $50.00 on these products and am thoroughly disgusted about what a waste it was.</li>
    <li> So glad I was able to find this.  I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the only creams that doesn&#x27;t break me out in hives.</li>
    <li> very light and refreshing</li>
    <li> I got this one because I don&#x27;t like the scents in other moisturizers, but after using this one I&#x27;ll put up with it.&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t really make my skin soft, and after about a 4days of using it , I got one nasty rash! My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive at all, so I was really shocked when this happened! I wasn&#x27;t sure what caused it, so I stopped using everything. Then, went back to just using this because my skin was so DRY after having a rash that last a few days, then again after about 3-4days of using this *bam* a rash again. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product, and I&#x27;m frustrated that I spent $8.00 on a product that I can&#x27;t use nor return. Truly not a good one!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that requires me to be very careful about the products I use. My usual summer moisturizer got dropped from the company&#x27;s product line so I figured I&#x27;d give the Simple line a shot since they&#x27;re all about sensitive skin.  I can use this moisturizer for a couple days in a row, then around the 3rd or 4th day the skin over my cheekbones begins to burn upon application.  If I keep going, the burning sensation gets worse every day.  I have not broken out in a rash as some other reviewers have, but this product definitely irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> . I am 44 and seem to have teenage skin... I started using Simple and I am finally getting clearer skin... I have had no allergic reaction at all, this is great for sensitive skin types!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-20s and usually have some blemishes and the occasional breakout. I started using this product twice a day (before bed &amp; in morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing with Neutrogena&#x27;s acne-prone skin face bar, and applying witch hazel, I put on this lotion under my makeup and my skin has never felt cleaner or clearer! Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging my pores or weighing me down. I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to this at all. I wish they made it in a larger bottle. I&#x27;m on a tight budget especially when it comes to beauty supplies... great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Good quality, no smell at all, not fat and oily.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, however, I felt as though it was almost too light. I felt like I had to use a lot to actually feel like my face was getting moisturized. Maybe that&#x27;s just me. The bottle only lasted about two weeks because of this.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier. The best that I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my Elizabeth Arden Matte moisturizer that I am usually able to find at TJ Maxx for $12 and bought this as a substitute. It&#x27;s a great value: 4.2 ounces for less than $10. However, when I apply it to my face, I notice a slight burning feeling and my face has a reddish tint for a while after the initial application. While my face has gotten used to the burining sensation, the redness still appears after each application. I hate to be wasteful, so I&#x27;m trying to use it up (almost done, thank the Lord!), but I will not purchase anything else from this line.</li>
    <li> So nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. Pretty much what it says, its simple. So perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;(I have oily skin that is somehow super dry too)</li>
    <li> My have VERY dry skin in the winter and I hate doling out money just TRYING to find a moisturizer that actually works.  Everything tends to be too thick or too thin.  This was perfect and right in between.  It soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue behind.  When my cheeks are super dry it&#x27;s not quite enough, but in the two months I&#x27;ve been using it I have only had to pull out my heavy duty moisturizer twice (I have been using this in Feb and March, two very dry months).  I would say that&#x27;s pretty good!  This also goes a long ways.  I really only need a tad for my entire face as it spreads really well.  This was my first time trying this brand but I&#x27;m going to go ahead and try their other products as I really like this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting out of the shower before applying a makeup moisturizer. Living in a dry climate it&#x27;s great to layer on a simple hydrater instead of a thick pore clogging application.</li>
    <li> I was invited to try this product for free from BzzAgent and for someone with very sensitive skin I have to say I am very impressed. Most skin care products leave my skin red, dry, and irritated, but this product worked perfectly and caused no irritation. The Radiance Cleansing Wipes and Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer we my favorite, leaving my face feeling refreshed the entire day. I would definitely recommend trying these products!</li>
    <li> Simple markets itself as this super clean, organic stuff without any crap that irritates skin, but that&#x27;s not at all true. The texture of this moisturizer is wonderful, but it contains mineral oil, which is a cheap, harsh ingredient that clogs pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly sensitive and very acne-prone combination skin, and this moisturizer gave me the worst breakout of my life. I stopped using it and no new blemishes formed. I looked up the ingredients later, unfortunately. If your skin is at all sensitive or acne-prone, do yourself a favor and go with Neutrogina or something.</li>
    <li> Switched back to the regular brand after a week and acne cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a little research.  Simple was bought by Unilever.  Brands include: Aviance, Axe/Lynx, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Dove, Flora/Becel, Heartbrand, Hellmann&#x27;s, Knorr, Lipton, Lux/Radox, Omo/Surf, Rexona/Sure, Sunsilk, Toni &amp; Guy, TRESemm&amp;eacute;, VO5 and Wish-Bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other little items I discovered:  Simple does contain parabens which several studies have linked to cancer (especially breast cancer).  Also they now animal test.  Just wanted to put that out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer caused an acne flare up that went away soon after switching back to our normal product.  Poor results and now knowing that the company isn&#x27;t as &#x27;Simple&#x27; as it once was, I will stick with other brands such as Yes to Carrots.</li>
    <li> Simple&#x27;s Hydrating Light Moisturizer is great for those that do not want a moisturizer with heavy scents.  Simple does a great job of satisfying sensitive skin and using non-harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydrating Light Moisturizer formula goes on smooth and does not leave the skin feeling greasy.  It does a good job of setting in, doesn&#x27;t dry too quick, but goes on smoothly.  Keep in mind that this is a \\&quot;light\\&quot; moisturizer and isn&#x27;t necessarily like a lotion.  It is a moisturizer, one that is truly simple, yet nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great addition to a regular skin regime, especially if used a 2-3 times a day, after showing and later in the day/evening.  Overall, a good product that keeps it simple.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free sample of this in the mail through a site called BzzAgent. Before I walk to school I use the  protecting light moisturizer which has SPF 15 sunscreen. It makes my face feel soft and clean without feeling oily and looking shiny. Plus the moisturizer did not leave my hands all sticky which is one of my biggest pet peeves. It smells clean and fresh without being overwhelming and it rubs in easily so there&#x27;s no white spots left behind to worry about.</li>
    <li> I received the simple skincare moisturizer, oil balancing wipes, radiance wipes and eye makeup remover wipes through a bzzagent campaign and I have to admit that I am in LOVE with all of them. I am developing sensitive skin as I get older and many beauty products can irritate my face and neck but simple skincare products don&#x27;t contain alcohols or dyes and they didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! I used the oil balancing wipes the most because I have oily and shiny skin and they worked like a charm. The amount of oil on my face decreased and stayed that way throughout the day! So I would definitely recommend any and all simple skincare products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, light, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause any excess oil or breakouts. She&#x27;s 15 and gets the occasional blemish-otherwise great skin. I don&#x27;t know how it would be with someone who has more problematic breakouts, but this seems light enough so won&#x27;t clog pores. Moisturizes well though, leaves skin feeling hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a very light and non greasy moisturizer.  I liked how this felt on my face, and  I use it daily when I sleep.  I am the kind of guy who does not like anything on his face, so I am picky about moisturizers.  This one felt so light when it goes on that it did not bother me.  I have not had any break outswhile using this, and  have been using it for a few weeks.  It does not contain SPF so it is best used for indoors, or out of the sun.  I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like the Simple line of products and the Simple Hydrating Light Moisture is no exception. It is just as the name implies, very simple without a lot of perfumes and other ingredients. This moisturizer is very light. It is not greasy. This moisturizes is effective enough to keave skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I received this product is part of free trial. Before using this product along with the other components I had dry flaky skin on my face and couldn&#x27;t even wear makeup without it flaking off.  After about a week this has helped with that condition and I can wear makeup again. The thing I like the most is that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m clogging up my skin with a heavy lotion. I recommend this for anyone else who also doesn&#x27;t like the heavy and greasy feel of some of the thicker lotions on your face.</li>
    <li> Very nice works well hydrates nice doesn&#x27;t feel greasy leaves skin feeling smooth love it will but again totally recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be a great moisturizer for sensitive skin with no harsh irritants. Silly me, trusted Simple and didn&#x27;t bother to read the ingredients. I used this for two weeks. It burned my cheeks while applying. My face broke out from all the pore clogging junk in it like mineral oil &amp; dimethicon. My face continued to feel tight and flake, this didn&#x27;t do squat to keep my face moisturized. I felt like it needed to be reapplied after about 15 mins because that was how long my face felt moisturized. I have switched to something more natural.[[ASIN:B003PL2D6A Yes To Daily Balancing Moisturizer, Tomatoes, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This has just enough moisturizer.  I never had dry skin till menopause and this product cleared up my dry skin w/o being heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, \\&quot;simple\\&quot; product, that for me does exactly what it is supposed to and exactly what I want. I don&#x27;t want to have perfumes and dyes and additives absorbing into my skin along with the lotion, and this doesn&#x27;t have all that. It&#x27;s a simple and effective way to eliminate dry skin.</li>
    <li> Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer is almost scent-free and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling greasy despite containing both mineral and borage oils. It does a good job of moisturizing when applied after bathing.  It is non-irritating to my skin but I would prefer fewer chemical ingredients, especially for a facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Simple is the word here.  This is just what it claims to be, a light moisturizer, nothing more and nothing less.  So this could be just right for you if that&#x27;s exactly what you want, a moisturizer rather than conditioner, or whatever.</li>
    <li> The Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer gives my skin just enough moisturizing without clogging my pores or making my face feel too heavy. I like that this moisturizer instantly dissolves into my skin and gives me the light coverage that I need. I love that the Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance which is important to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer is very light which is good but if you need more hydration to your skin than you should wait a few minutes and then add an additional layer. I love that this moisturizer gives me the option of having a light moisturizer or adding more to get some heavier protection and that is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> For a cheaply priced moisturizer, I think Simple is pretty good. It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly and easily. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative effects some other reviewers have reported. I have no issues with this product.</li>
    <li> Finally a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel like grease.  My skin responds well to it as well.  Less tightness and better clarity</li>
    <li> I have been using the Light Moisturizer for about three weeks now. There are several things I really do like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is reasonably priced compared to many moisturizers on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out (I have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use makeup, so I use this straight on my face, and it has been keeping my face moisturized during the harsh weather we have had recently (Will Spring EVER come?)</li>
    <li> Love the Simple products!  The moisturizer is wonderful.  I am an older woman and I just want my face to feel hydrated and soft.  The Simple products do the trick.  And I like the fact that I&#x27;m not using a lot of unwanted and unknown chemicals.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product contains MINERAL OIL and I think even Simple knows not to use this ingredient because I did a quick search on their website and it seems they don&#x27;t carry this moisturizer anymore and the moisturizers on their website that I quickly looked through don&#x27;t have Mineral Oil listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this moisturizer totally burns when I put it on.  I actually don&#x27;t have sensitive skin usually but I just did a peel.  I put on a different moisturizer earlier and it did burn a little due to the peel (because it doesn&#x27;t normal burns at all).  But when I need more moisturizer and the other one was out, I used this Simple one and it really burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended!</li>
    <li> i highly recommend it...makes my skin really soft...the price is right..i also use the rich moisturizer and the face cloths</li>
    <li> I started using this product in the early 90s when I found it at Marks &amp; Spencer in London. I&#x27;m so glad to see it in this country and at a very good price through Amazon. I hope it&#x27;s every bit as good as the British product; I&#x27;m still on my last bottle of made in the UK.</li>
    <li> im tried this moisturizer for the first time, seconds after i applied it. my face was on fire, burning and tingling.. i tried washing this stuff off and my face still is on fire.over 1/2 hour later... this product should be taken off the market.. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.. so much for a product for sensitive skin...  my face is all red and swollen...  please stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my HG face moisturizer. I have no complaints whatsoever. It is light and absorbs very quickly. Though the moisturizer is hydrating, it does not leave my face feeling sticky after applying it. I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin and it does not break me out. If you have sensitive skin and are looking for an effective moisturizer, this may be your solution. The product, however, does have mineral oil-but it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer in Target and really loved it. My skin type is combination to oil, but I guess I don&#x27;t really have a very sensitive skin. My job forces me to face computer from 9am to 9pm, so my face is very easy to get oily, then it breaks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this moisturizer when I was travelling, and used it with Simple Soothing Toner both day and night. I have to say the result is really impressive! They keep my skin soft and clean all day! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of moisturizers, both expansive and cheap, but this one is one of my favorite now!</li>
    <li> Very light; doesn&#x27;t cause face to feel heavy, or break out.</li>
    <li> gentle on sensitive skin, does not cause breakouts, best moisturizer I have found yet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too picky about moisturizers.  I want one that&#x27;s not too heavy and that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  I know that none of them are going to perform a miracle.  I just want one that will keep my skin from becoming dry.  This fits the bill, and it&#x27;s not expensive.  It&#x27;s light, so you really don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ve put it on.  I like that it contains Vitamins B5 and E, although I don&#x27;t know if that really does anything for your complexion.  If you&#x27;re looking for a light-weight, reasonably priced moisturizer, I&#x27;d definitely try this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to try this again in the summer when it might be perfect, but it&#x27;s just not enough for my early-40s skin in sub-zero weather. It IS more moisturizing than I thought it would be based on the consistency. It tends to more liquid/runny than creamy. It also works well under foundation.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it was a good product for sensitive skin types. The first application burned and then I developed a rash all over my face and neck. I&#x27;ve never had such a reaction to a product, even those not directly aimed at sensitive skin. I know all skin types are different, but I am giving this a low rating because it advertised itself as a sensitive skin product, but according to several reviews and my personal experience it failed to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed and had to discontinue the product after only 2 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;There are some harsh chemicals in this product that some people have strong reactions to-just beware!</li>
    <li> This is about the only moisturizer my daughter will use.  She says it&#x27;s not greasy, but does give good moisturization.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It goes on smoothly and easily and absorbs fast!  Keeps your face hydrated thoughout the day and doesn&#x27;t make your skin freak out! :) I have oily skin and it actually helps with the oiliness of my skin type but yet keeps everything balanced throughout the day :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for new moisturizers. I wanted one that did not cause me to break out. I just wanted one that would keep my skin from becoming dry or too oily. This one is awesome and it&#x27;s not expensive.  I did receive it for free from BzzAgent, but after looking at the prices I would definitely purchase more. If you&#x27;re looking for a light-weight, reasonably priced moisturizer, I&#x27;d definitely try this one.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free to try from Bzz agent and I love it! It protected my skin from the sun withough making me break out like other sun screens do. I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Well I had never heard of the product line Simple before but I can tell you that I am highly impressed.  I am a 64 year old lady with dry, sensitive skin.  This product is extremely effective and very gentle at the same time.  Directions are to smooth it gently onto your face and neck, being careful to avoid the eye area.  I have also been using it on my hands at bedtime and it makes my hands so nice and soft.  The fragrance is very light and almost unnoticeable.  It contains Vitamin E, and Pro Vitamin B5.  This lotion/cream is a recommend to buy in my opinion.  The price is right too!</li>
    <li> I like this as it is a  nice light moisturizer and it absorbs fairly quick.  It seems to hydrate nicely and has no smell.  I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me at all.  I have rosacea and am having no problem using the Simple face products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great, no frills moisturizer that works beautifully. I have combo-oily acne prone skin and Simple Hydrating was a nice, gentle moisturizer that kept my skin balanced. I used it morning and night. In the morning, I layer this under a proper sunscreen (EltaMD). It sinks in quickly. If my cheeks are feeling extra dry (in winter), then I layer Hadolabo hylauronic lotion underneath the Simple Hydrating. Works well with other products.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SIMPLY HYDRATING LIGHT MOISTURIZER AND IT IS NOT HEAVY ON MY FACE.  TRIED USING ANOTHER EXPENSIVE MOISTURIZER AND I BROKE OUT ALL OVER MY FACE LIKE A RED BEET.  SIMPLE IS EXACTLY THE MOISTERIZER I NEED</li>
    <li> This is just amazing! I put it on in the morning right when I wake up or right after I shower, I put it on right before I go to sleep, and just to refresh myself I put it on midday. This is amazing for dry skin. I have the driest skin possible. I hate it, it feels like sandpaper on bad days. I tried everything, I tried all the drugstore products and and even high end facial treatments, and yeah my skin would feel better at the time but it always went right back to being dry. Once I started using this along with Simple Kind To Skin Purifying Cleansing Lotion I actually noticed a change that stayed even if I missed a day of lotion. I guarantee you, once you start using Simple for dry skin you&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I really do like this product a lot.  I&#x27;m likely going stop buying [[ASIN:B001FB5IIW Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion, SPF 30, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] which I&#x27;ve used for the past year.  I like that this Simple product makes my skin feel good, does not irritate it, and has virtually no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only hesitation is that this product does not have sun protection  --  which given my very fair skin and rosacea I really need to have.</li>
    <li> Usually use OilofOlay.Decided to try this as it was closeout special at Kroger.Felt great,smooth.Next day I looked like I had a bad sunburn. This is all I could trace it too.Itchy also.Woke up itchy,what the heck,then saw redness.If you have sensitive skin do a test spot.I do not usually have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a free sample and I love it! The Simple protecting moisturizer is great for summer and does not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily. My skin can easily be dried out and sometimes I need a heavy moisturizer, but the Simple brand does a good job of making my skin feel protected and refreshed. I also feel great about using a product that is not full of chemicals and is actually good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I received this amazing product from bzzagent.com for free and I am so thankful because I love it! At first glance, the product packaging was simple and easy on the eye. After using this product for five days straight I fell in love with it. It made my face incredibly smooth after each use and lasted through out the day. A small amount went a long way which is also a great factor to me when buying a product. If I am going to spend money on something I would like it to last as long as possible. With this product, it&#x27;s possible! Also, what better then a moisturizer that protects you from the sun, has no artificial dyes, and no artificial perfumes!&lt;br /&gt;  My skin tends to break out easily from products and I did not experience that with Simple Skin Care Light Moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This UK formula is not the same as the North American formula I buy at the drug store. The UK formula contains methylparaben and propylparaben. If you avoid parabens don&#x27;t buy this. If you don&#x27;t care about parabens in your body care products, the price is great and shipping was surprisingly fast.</li>
    <li> As with most things I&#x27;ve used from Simple I like this lotion.  It is lightweight and absorbs into my skin without leaving any residue or unwanted scent.  I often use this lotion as a quick face cleaner - I just apply and then wipe off with a clean  dry towel before it has a chance to sink in.</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with my free Simple samples. I would highly recommend these products to anyone with dry/sensitive skin, I have both. I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a nice face lotion to use and I&#x27;m allergic to basically everything. This simple face moisturizer works great!! I used it before bed time along with the eye make up remover wipes and the radiance cleansing wipes and I woke up with my face still feeling silky. There is really no smell just a clean fresh smell. I love most about this product it goes on smooth and there is no alcohol. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> During the winter, sometimes my forehead gets dry and sometimes I get dry skin around the outside of my eyes.  The rest of my face is a little oily.  This moisturizer is very light, absorbs quickly and I do not notice any scent at all.  Most lotions are too flowery and femine smelling, but this one is fine for a guy.</li>
    <li> Great product for everyday use.  My CVS now only sells this version with SPF.. Was thrilled to find the regular version on Amazon.  It is a nice light non greasy , non heavy moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like to slather Simple Hydrating Moisturizer on.  It feels so good, wetter than water.  How&#x27;s that for moisturizing?  There&#x27;s a little alcohol in it which gives it a tingle, but it doesn&#x27;t feel drying at all.  In fact, I feel moisturized all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light enough that I didn&#x27;t take notice of it right off.  It&#x27;s just the smell of raw ingredients.  They didn&#x27;t add scent to it, but it could have used some.  Cucumber would have been nice, but even without added scent, this lotion&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Simple Light Moisturizer, Sensitive Skin Experts, Vitamin B5 and Vitamin E, Glycerin and Borage Seed Oil, No Harsh Irritants, No Perfumes, No Dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisteurizer feels good and refreshing on the face.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of it; it rubs in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this moisturizer on my hands, arms, and back, and it feels refreshing.  I&#x27;m sure it would also be good on the legs and feet.  I do love to pamper my legs and feet, as they&#x27;ve been through so much for me (and still going).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this moisturizer. It is scent free, which is nice. It goes on smooth. The problem is I did not feel any hydration from this moisturizer. It made my skin feel tacky, and then a few hours later, very dry. No breakouts or skin issues from using this, but no moisturizing either.</li>
    <li> This product was nice because it left my skin feeling hydrated without the oily residue. smooths into the skin easy. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer is light and silky not heavy and thick.  It lasts all day and helps get rid of dry skin with  added vitamins: Pro-Vitamin B5 and Vitamin E as well as Glycerin and Borage Seed Oil. the Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer is suitable for all skin types, especially sensitive skin. It contains No Dyes, No Artificial Perfumes and No Harsh Irritants that can upset your skin and leave it red and course. I absolutely love this moisturizer and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Well, I decided to keep it.  I have pretty dry skin and I am always saying I need to use some sort of facial lotion.  However, everyone I&#x27;ve tried, I hated.  They are either too greasy feeling or smell too strong.  This is the only one I have used that actually feels like...nothing.  And that is why I like it.  Once it is on and rubbed in you can&#x27;t feel a thing.  There is really no scent at all.  Except for the fact that my face feels softer after applying this stuff I cant&#x27; tell at all that it is on me.  On the downside, I think 6-10 bucks for 4.2 oz of anything let alone a facial lotion is a crime.  So, I likely won&#x27;t be buying this again but for those that don&#x27;t mind the price it is a very nice personal care product.</li>
    <li> Accentuates oily skin. Do not recommend if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product free for being a Buzzagent, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s simple and good for your skin. SPF 15 added into the moisturizer, is a great way to protect your skin from the sun!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and feels smooth and hydrating</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer because it is nice and light .</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer and is effective at keeping dry skin away.  I used to use Oil of Olay and it feels very similar in weight and oiliness to me.  Unlike Oil of Olay, this moisturizer does not have any SPF in it, which I will miss, especially as spring and summer approach.  But Simple does make a light moisturizer with SPF 15 in it, so I may try that next.</li>
    <li> Usually, I use all DHC products for my facial skin regime. Though, these Simple moisturizers are fabulous and much less expensive. I love this moisturizer, I used this on my face, hands and even on my rough feet (yes, it was that moisturizing!). This lotion never broke out my sensitive face and it lasted even though a light wash on my hands. I am definitely going to repurchase this one. It didn&#x27;t have a scent, and it was light, but, very nurishing and made my skin feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> My wife normally uses Clinique dramatically different moisturizer on her face each night before bed. After about a week using the Simple light moisturizer, she said it seems to perform as well as the Clinique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did mention that the first few times she used it that she felt a little tingling in her skin, but not any more. She liked most that it does not have any scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, four stars - nice.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a pure moisturizer with nothing else - no creams, no sunscreen, no fragrance, etc., I would recommend you give this a try.  Our house found it to be a little too thin and not quite moisturizing enough - after a while, it left skin feeling tacky - but your mileage may vary.  Also, we generally prefer moisturizer plus sunscreen, rather than doing both separately.</li>
    <li> Before I received Simple products for free though a campaign I was already on the lookout for a moisturizer that would work with my sensitive skin. I had seen Simple at Target, but I wasn&#x27;t informed enough about the company to make the plunge of buying it. I had quickly Googled Simple, as I was curious to see if Simple lived up to it&#x27;s tag line &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin Experts.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I was throughly impressed upon receiving and trying Simple products. The Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer is in a league of it&#x27;s own - the vitamins infused in this moisturizer have helped my sensitive skin flourish over the past week. I also enjoy the added bonus of the moisturizer containing SPF 15. I&#x27;m pale and prone to burning quite easily, so the SPF is a big plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple products are simply amazing, and I cannot wait to try other products from the Simple line. This sensitive skinned gal is thrilled with Simple!</li>
    <li> This little bottle of hydrating moisturizer is indeed simple. It is very light and does well for an everyday, all day kind of mosturizer but not something for dry cracked hands. Not much fragrance which is good especially for us men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent, simple everyday moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with the \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; line of skin products! I really like this hydrating moisturizer with its vitamins and nutrients such as glycerin and borage seed oil. The lotion contains no perfume, no dyes and no harsh ingredients so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin. My skin tends to be dry and I don&#x27;t have problems that require special products, but this light moisturizer is also advertised as being noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic if that is an issue for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unscented moisturizer has only one drawback that may prove to be a deal-breaker with me -- no SPF sunscreen properties. If that is not important to you, then I think you will really like this product. I typically use [[ASIN:B000052YQ2 Olay Complete All Day Moisture Lotion, Sensitive Skin, SPF15, 4 Ounce]] and I must say that it is a difficult choice to chose between the two -- my old favorite and my new love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars</li>
    <li> Thinking about setting this up as a subscribe and save. I really enjoy this product. I tend to use a moisturizer after shaving and I have found Simple lotion to be my favorite. My skin is fairly sensitive especially after shaving and I have found that if I use a dab of this moisturizer, I never break out anymore. After using the entire bottle , I switched to a cheaper supermarket variety lotion to see if it would have the same effect and it was not nearly as gentle on my face.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars will buy again.</li>
    <li> I usually put lotion on my feet at night to help with my rls. I love getting lotion for free since I use so much of it. This lotion is gonna be one that I buy again. It was amazing at keeping my feet moist and hydrated all night. So much so that I could still feel it the next morning!</li>
