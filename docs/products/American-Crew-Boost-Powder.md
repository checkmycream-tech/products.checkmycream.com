### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, this is a great way to style your hair without having a crusty gel look to it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works great.  </li>
      <li>I apply this then Aveda&#x27;s Control Paste for a great hold and matte look.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, my hair is medium length on top and this stuff gives my great volume</li>
      <li>and I recommend a good pomade to help hold up</li>
      <li>Follow the direction, crew has a good vid showing you how to apply it.</li>
      <li>Good product</li>
      <li>This is really good if you have the spiky/messy look.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or anything which is nice</li>
      <li>And I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it even worked.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment great product!</li>
      <li>Use your hands to style or use another product for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but glad I did.  </li>
      <li>The American Crew Boost Powder does an absolutely excellent job of thickening and styling hair.  </li>
      <li>I love that it provides a well groomed appearance and yet it still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works OK.  </li>
      <li>I have medium length hair on top that I comb to the side and use the product for maximum volumnization.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Should have more.</li>
      <li>Great product, really works well.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a year or more</li>
      <li>I used it in conjunction with American Crew Fiber (which is awesome BTW) and without, and I can tell no difference.</li>
      <li>It is a magical antigravity fairy dust that changes people&#x27;s lives, for sure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s probably better stuff on the market, but if you do sport the spiked-choppy hair look, this stuff is pretty good.</li>
      <li>The powder should lightly land on top of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
      <li>Cool stuff!</li>
      <li>It is easy on the hair with and washes out without any effort.</li>
      <li>When you find these things on Amazon and other sites, it is called diversion, in the best of cases - that is where they get their hands on product really cheap and set it aside for a couple of years until the SKU expires, then resell it.</li>
      <li>Gives a fine- and invisible- grit to your hair, giving volume/styling control without any spray or gel.</li>
      <li>Sort of like fine clay grit that disappears into the roots and when used with forming creme adds ALOT of lift and texture.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it and it is a strange experience to apply the stuff, but it works great.</li>
      <li>But as of now, the first day I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s great, and anybody with fine, flat hair should try it out.</li>
      <li>If provides volume and a great foundation to your hair to really fluff it up when needed.  </li>
      <li>As in, I&#x27;ll style my hair for some volume with some cream or wax, it looks good in the mirror, then over the next hour</li>
      <li>wiht a true matte finish.  </li>
      <li>So I use it only on the weekends when I want my hair to look really good.</li>
      <li>The product is actually really good for short - i.e.- hair sized to be spikes.</li>
      <li>Works great with extreme hold.</li>
      <li>The boost powder is great because it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that wet look yet adds volume and body to the hair!</li>
      <li>but apparently my hands are too warm as it seemed to melt immediately.  </li>
      <li>I normally use this with the American Crew Fiber to get a great low-shine, bed-head look.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good stuff overall,</li>
      <li>Make sure your hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with sprinkling it directly on my head and then working it through with my hands.  </li>
      <li>Nice product for short hair</li>
      <li>but this is just the right amount of control without looking like</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s working for me right now.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that I use this product in conjunction with other styling products for better hold</li>
      <li>The hold is surprisingly strong and lasts all day with a super low shine finish.</li>
      <li>This does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
      <li>There are better products by American crew.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly as described: it gives my hair volume and makes it look thicker, just like they said.</li>
      <li>It may be tempting to save a couple of bucks online, but when you buy it from a place that sells this stuff legally, if you don&#x27;t like it, you can return it!</li>
      <li>I intend to switch to something of higher quality once my pomade runs out.  </li>
      <li>But if it does work when using a larger amount of product, you better plan on buying about 6 containers a month...</li>
      <li>This does a good job at keeping it up for a few hours before I have to run my hand through my hair to keep it up.</li>
      <li>It adds a ton of body and stays pretty much where I put it.</li>
      <li>thing you have to know about professional products like American Crew, Paul Mitchell and many more is that it is only guaranteed when sold by an AUTHORIZED retailer.</li>
      <li>a quick professional opinion, take it as you will.</li>
      <li>but has little amount, I hope to continue enjoying this product is a good product for my hair but has little</li>
      <li>actually too much makes you look like you stuck your finger in a light socket).</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use much, though, for the effect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It tends to come out really fast</li>
      <li>It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much (and</li>
      <li>It works really well at adding volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>It gives so much volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>The product is great but the containers are different from what you normally get and there is less in them.  </li>
      <li>Really like this light, dry hold.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, blonde hair that likes to lay flat.</li>
      <li>Most hair products do not work for me because they weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>I get decent lift</li>
      <li>I love this product but it will only work properly as directed.</li>
      <li>Highly reccomended.  </li>
      <li>I use this product everyday and I love it.</li>
      <li>It felt a little odd (my hair felt almost tangled) but looked great, so I bought some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing, just a little bit of this and american crew&#x27;s molding clay helped me style my hair the way ive always wanted it, a messy/spiky side parted look.</li>
      <li>I expected more from American Crew.  </li>
      <li>There are other products out there that provide more, HOWEVER, not all of these powders are created equal.  </li>
      <li>The Boost powder adds a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; spicky, messy texture that no other product has been able to do for me.  </li>
      <li>It works for my hair, which is a little fine.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised.  </li>
      <li>Finally, there are times when it is straight up counterfeit.</li>
      <li>The description says, &amp;#34;Retains natural moisture and softens hair.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Also, if you do have a real one of these, it does come out fast - put tape over half the holes horizontally or sprinkle it in your hand, then your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>I have really fine hair that tends to lay a little flat.</li>
      <li>My stylist sprinkled it in her hands first and then applied it to my dry hair; I tried the same</li>
      <li>It was gross and kind of weird.</li>
      <li>First, as others have said, there is way too little powder in each container especially considering the price of this stuff.  </li>

<li> (right now I&#x27;m using a very small amount of Axe pomade each day).  </li>
<li> cannot reiterate enough, your hair MUST be dry prior to application.</li>
<li> But for medium to long hair, this product leaves white residue.</li>
<li> Some reviews have said that it doesn&#x27;t last a long time for me one can lasts about 3 months.</li>
<li> it is how long it will last.</li>
<li> I purchased a less expensive powder from another manufacturer that provided more powder</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great with extreme hold. I would recommend sprinkling it on your hands and working it in. As some powder can get in your eyes by accident and stings.</li>
    <li> The boost powder is great because it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that wet look yet adds volume and body to the hair!</li>
    <li> It works for my hair, which is a little fine. Plus you can combine this with other products like the clay. Follow the direction, crew has a good vid showing you how to apply it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It gives so much volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair.  The Boost powder adds a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; spicky, messy texture that no other product has been able to do for me.  If you wear your hair \\&quot;chunky and messy\\&quot; this is for you.  Sort of like fine clay grit that disappears into the roots and when used with forming creme adds ALOT of lift and texture.  Cool stuff!</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVES THE PRODUCT .THANKS E.P.</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair that tends to lay a little flat. This does exactly what I want it to do. I blow dry my hair and then sprinkle this stuff on my roots and mess up my hair. It adds a ton of body and stays pretty much where I put it.</li>
    <li> Great product, really works well.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it will only work properly as directed. This is a product that must be applied to BONE DRY hair. If there is any moisture, forget it. The hold is surprisingly strong and lasts all day with a super low shine finish. I love that it provides a well groomed appearance and yet it still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot reiterate enough, your hair MUST be dry prior to application.</li>
    <li> This is a joke.  Product arrived half spilled in packaging.  Very very little product to begin with...maybe enough for 3-4 days?  I was really surprised.  I expected more from American Crew.  I returned this product.</li>
    <li> Product is as promised, gives a matte finish and volume to the hair.  It is easy on the hair with and washes out without any effort.</li>
    <li> The powder will not come out.  The case is not made like the ones I buy at salons.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my thinning hair, only made it look thinner and greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described: it gives my hair volume and makes it look thicker, just like they said. You don&#x27;t need much (and actually too much makes you look like you stuck your finger in a light socket). Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is really good if you have the spiky/messy look.  Pretty good stuff overall, but I do have one or two complaints.  First, as others have said, there is way too little powder in each container especially considering the price of this stuff.  Should be at least double the amount.  Second, I do feel like this product fries your hair.  After using it for a couple days, my hair feels brittle and very dry.  That feeling seems to go away after a couple washings, so maybe it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s probably better stuff on the market, but if you do sport the spiked-choppy hair look, this stuff is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year or more this last batch the packaging changed, the holes are larger so product is wasted when using it, the consistency of the power is different, courser and does not work as well as the many other containers I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, blonde hair that likes to lay flat. Most hair products do not work for me because they weigh my hair down. As in, I&#x27;ll style my hair for some volume with some cream or wax, it looks good in the mirror, then over the next hour or so my hair gradually flattens down from the weight of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Crew brands, specifically Fiber and now this Boost Powder, are the only products that have given my hair volume and style that doesn&#x27;t weigh down throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know how this Boost Powder stuff works, but it does. You shake some into your hand (it has the consistency of baby powder) and rub it through dry hair, and the hair &amp;#34;poofs&amp;#34; up with volume. I used a little bit of American Crew Forming Cream to style afterward, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only question I have about it is how long it will last. It comes in a small jar, like half the size that the other AC brands come in. I didn&#x27;t need to use much, though, for the effect. I&#x27;ll update later if I find that the product doesn&#x27;t last long enough to justify the price. But as of now, the first day I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s great, and anybody with fine, flat hair should try it out.</li>
    <li> This product does lend a wanted boost to my hair, making it appear fuller!  I&#x27;m not above using smoke and mirrors!</li>
    <li> Really like this light, dry hold. Lots of body and hair doesn&#x27;t clump together.</li>
    <li> The amount of powder that actually comes in the container is a bit ridiculous. It&#x27;s as if someone crushed up a baby aspirin. So it was gone in several days. And I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it even worked. I used it in conjunction with American Crew Fiber (which is awesome BTW) and without, and I can tell no difference. However, due to the extremely small amount of powder in the container, I was being a bit conservative on the amount I used, so that could have been the reason. But if it does work when using a larger amount of product, you better plan on buying about 6 containers a month...</li>
    <li> Nice product for short hair</li>
    <li> Kind of a weird feel and hard to mold hair after applied... There are better products by American crew.</li>
    <li> Not the correct product.  Different packaging and it was not the same.  I had to buy the correct product at a local store</li>
    <li> Good product but has little amount, I hope to continue enjoying this product is a good product for my hair but has little</li>
    <li> It works really well at adding volume to your hair. I have Asian hair which is thick and stubborn and tends to lie down when long. This does a good job at keeping it up for a few hours before I have to run my hand through my hair to keep it up. It&#x27;s not sticky or anything which is nice and I recommend a good pomade to help hold up hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tends to come out really fast so I end up covering some of the holes with my finger to control the flow.</li>
    <li> It seemed a little clumpy from this vendor. Not many options out there though - why is this stuff so hard to find?? I apply this then Aveda&#x27;s Control Paste for a great hold and matte look.</li>
    <li> Fast shiping on time well buy soon but litter small would like it to big but not only 0.3oz well thank</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday and I love it. Some reviews have said that it doesn&#x27;t last a long time for me one can lasts about 3 months. I have medium length hair on top that I comb to the side and use the product for maximum volumnization. You don&#x27;t need to pour a bunch of the powder all over your hair. I recommend pouring a very small amount of powder into your hands then sprinkle over your hair then comb.</li>
    <li> My son loves this product for keeping his hair in place.  He wears a &amp;#34;blended short cut style and the boost powder helps him keep the style in place without looking stiff and gelled.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money.  It literally lasted me 2 and half weeks.  Such a low quantity of powder.  I feel like I might call to receive a refund.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;m not a hair product type of guy but this is just the right amount of control without looking like i just stepped off the set of Grease!</li>
    <li> The American Crew Boost Powder does an absolutely excellent job of thickening and styling hair.  If provides volume and a great foundation to your hair to really fluff it up when needed.  The only complaint I have is the extremely small size and amount of powder provided.  There are other products out there that provide more, HOWEVER, not all of these powders are created equal.  I purchased a less expensive powder from another manufacturer that provided more powder but it unfortunately lacks in it&#x27;s ability.  I would definitely recommend the American Crew Boost Powder for it&#x27;s quality and ability to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment great product!</li>
    <li> The product is great but the containers are different from what you normally get and there is less in them.  The container says .35oz but both jars lasted less than half the time of the .3oz jars I get from the hairdressers.</li>
    <li> Very little quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have more. Holds the hair and supply volume as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Instead of buying a $40 bottle of dry hairspray to get the matte look, my stylist recommended this.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it and it is a strange experience to apply the stuff, but it works great.</li>
    <li> It gives me sexytime hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is a great way to style your hair without having a crusty gel look to it. Matte Finish.</li>
    <li> I am a barber who sells an unbelievable amount of this stuff in the shop. It is a magical antigravity fairy dust that changes people&#x27;s lives, for sure. Below I wanted to address some of the other reviewers&#x27; concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing you have to know about professional products like American Crew, Paul Mitchell and many more is that it is only guaranteed when sold by an AUTHORIZED retailer. When you find these things on Amazon and other sites, it is called diversion, in the best of cases - that is where they get their hands on product really cheap and set it aside for a couple of years until the SKU expires, then resell it. Unfortunately, it is usually stored improperly and that destroys the consistency - in this case, a powder stored improperly does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every jar I have sold has had the same amount in it - if there is less, these online retailers are probably repackaging it, spreading it out between empty ones. Finally, there are times when it is straight up counterfeit. It may be tempting to save a couple of bucks online, but when you buy it from a place that sells this stuff legally, if you don&#x27;t like it, you can return it! Also, if you do have a real one of these, it does come out fast - put tape over half the holes horizontally or sprinkle it in your hand, then your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick professional opinion, take it as you will.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, my hair is medium length on top and this stuff gives my great volume wiht a true matte finish.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works great.  Highly reccomended.  The only issue I have with it is you can&#x27;t use it everyday, it doesn&#x27;t wash out unless you use a clarifier.  So I use it only on the weekends when I want my hair to look really good.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the claims this product makes are untrue. I have found it absolutely useless for styling my hair. A very expensive mistake :(</li>
    <li> This stuff will not wash out of your hair after time. It was gross and kind of weird.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing, just a little bit of this and american crew&#x27;s molding clay helped me style my hair the way ive always wanted it, a messy/spiky side parted look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying out different hair products to see what works and doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s instructions on how to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure your hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Start by slightly shaking the unopened can a few times.&lt;br /&gt;3. Open the can and put it over the areas you want to apply.&lt;br /&gt;4. Begin to tap the side of the can.  The powder should lightly land on top of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. Use a brush with your other hand to help the powder to land where you want it to.&lt;br /&gt;6. Use your hands to style or use another product for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I normally use this with the American Crew Fiber to get a great low-shine, bed-head look.  It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;- This powder could be very helpful for those with thin hair.  I would recommend using with the American Crew Boost Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The description says, &amp;#34;Retains natural moisture and softens hair.&amp;#34;  In my experience, this is false.  Using the powder alone, it actually dries out my hair almost like bristles on a broom stick (exaggerating).  It makes it tough to put my fingers through my hair. Just a little false advertising, but nothing to really complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product to whoever needs an extremely matte way to thicken your hair.</li>
    <li> The product is actually really good for short - i.e.- hair sized to be spikes. But for medium to long hair, this product leaves white residue. People have pointed out white dots on my hair several time after I had used the product.</li>
    <li> Works OK.  A little hard to handle</li>
    <li> Never tried a product like this before but glad I did.  It arrived sooner than I expected and had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Gives a fine- and invisible- grit to your hair, giving volume/styling control without any spray or gel.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this one my hair after my last cut to add some volume &amp; texture to my thinning &amp; receding hairline.  It felt a little odd (my hair felt almost tangled) but looked great, so I bought some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a powder that seems to melt when it reaches body temperature.  My stylist sprinkled it in her hands first and then applied it to my dry hair; I tried the same but apparently my hands are too warm as it seemed to melt immediately.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with sprinkling it directly on my head and then working it through with my hands.  This method is awkward and seems wasteful but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s working for me right now.  I get decent lift and I think it helps fill in some of the sparser areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that I use this product in conjunction with other styling products for better hold (right now I&#x27;m using a very small amount of Axe pomade each day).  I intend to switch to something of higher quality once my pomade runs out.  It remains to be seen whether I will need to continue using the Boost Power once I make the switch; until then it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
