    <li> Love this set - the glitter really makes a statement.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Great Buyer to work with.</li>
    <li> TO SUPPORT BREAST CANCER AWARENESS, THERE WAS NO QUESTION AT ALL AT PURCHASING THIS POLISH!!! LOOKS GREAT ON!!!  SO GLAD I WAS ABLE TO GET ONE!!</li>
    <li> OPI has done it again. Love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite! Quick shipping and OPI has always been a good quality polish!</li>
    <li> The solid pink is quite streaky, and nearly impossible to level. But, the topcoat is worth it!</li>
    <li> OPI is always my go to for nail polish. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used period. I have a job that requires a lot of hand washing. I have small kids which requires a lot of hand washing. So, when I say this polish lasts....it lasts. I always apply opi natural nail base coat before the color and top it off with a layer of Opi top coat. The colors in this set look exactly like the photo. I used the glitter over the Mod About You (pale pink) on my toe nails. It was cute. What I didn&#x27;t expect was to absolutely love the small file that came with this set. I have used it way more than I expected to. It&#x27;s a great little nail file. I highly recommend OPI.</li>
    <li> Nice pink color and topper.</li>
    <li> It made a very nice gift. Love the colors</li>
    <li> Looks great when you put it on.  Within a day or two it starts chipping.</li>
    <li> Love these polishes! They look great together!</li>
    <li> Such a pretty pink and the glitter is beautiful, After I bought this I found several more at TJ Maxx, for $9 for gifts for friends.</li>
    <li> Although it said Pink of Hearts on the box. The polish was another color. It was not returnable.  Bummer!!!</li>
    <li> my daughter is going through chemo right now for breast cancer and I ordered these for her - I was very disappointed when I got an email saying my order was cancelled due to being out of stock</li>
    <li> I really love this. I used my Orly Bonder then the Mod about you and used The Power of Pink on all nails. This looks great. I also wanted to try OPI and this was a great pair. I also bought their Shatter line.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this</li>
    <li> Did not like how the polish chipped easily but love supporting breast cancer month.</li>
    <li> Love these colors!!!! Received item fast!!!#</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great nail polish combo. Super girl equals me!&lt;br /&gt;I love nail polish and this is defintly a must have!</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. My girls loved the colors and it was perfect for the month of October. It shipped in a timely fashion and I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I received a lot of compliments with these polishes. One coat of The Power of Pink (glitter polish) over one coat of Mod About You (light pink) does the trick and is easily removed by soaking cotton pads (that have been cut in fourths) in nail polish remover, then after placing one soaked triangle over each nail, wrapping each nail in tin foil. Keep wrapped for about five minutes. I do one hand at a time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife after she could not find in stores...cheaper on Amazon anyways.  She seems to like it.  I don&#x27;t really care for the the confetti color, but its on her nails not mine  :-)</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the coverage. Great OPI polish special edition. The nail file is gorgeous, too.</li>
