<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product arrived on the scheduled day and I am very happy with the result.</li>
    <li> It is a good conditioner and gives great highlights to hair.  I have dark brown hair and some gray and the gray hairs really pick up the auburn, looking as if I went to the salon for professional highlights.  I have been using henna for a long time and before it would give me highlights visible in the light only, without changing my hair color.  But, the previous product, Hennalucent was very simple to use.  They need to revise the instructions, as I think it doesn&#x27;t have to be so complicated or time consumming.  I simplified the method and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Great value, easy to use.</li>
    <li> With most henna products I am able to interchange regular hair dye with henna dye. Not with this product! I tried to do highlights over this product and my hair turned green. Use something else.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ... makes my hair shine ... easy to use ... looks natural ... says it doesn&#x27;t cover gray, but it does enough to appear to be highlights ... you should try it !!!</li>
    <li> I love the cruelty free aspect.  I tried on a sample strand and noticed no change in color - possible because my hair may be a little dark to notice a change.  I loved the alfalfa odor and it wasn&#x27;t hard to use.  Will try again when I have more grey.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this kit in over five years. I forgot how long it takes. This can be an all day project! Between mixing to the right consistence, letting it sit for 2+ hours, putting it on, waiting, and spending an hour getting the mud out of your hair... it&#x27;s a while. But I love the company and love the (almost fool-proof) kit. I did do a strand test before hand. My strand test turned an ashy green. I thought it may have been my shampoo or something but low and behold it&#x27;s my water! We have enough rust in our water that my hair acted as a metal bowl. So unfortunately I can&#x27;t use the other two kits I bought until I move but, that is in no way the manufacturer&#x27;s fault. I have previously had a lot of successful results with Light Mountain and will go back to them one rust free day.  I highly recommend this for anyone without nightmarish well-water.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Easy to use and nondamaging to my hair.  Wished I would have known about it a long time ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, beats putting chemicals on your scalp, and having them absorbed into your system....</li>
    <li> Works great...just follow the instructions!  I read reviews before purchase and was concerned about it being powdery.  Really, you just need to use some judgment.  Depending on humidity and the product, as this is a plant powder, you may need to add more water.  You want a paste that will easily rub onto your hair and stay in place.  I am giving it four stars because it is a long process to prepare and you need to have a chunk of time set aside to use it.  That is a small price to pay though for non-toxic hair color.</li>
    <li> Lived it, specially since its organic</li>
    <li> I colored my hair with Mountain Light henna in the color of auburn. My hair color (naturally and before dying) is between a light and medium brown with blonde highlights. My hair was not previously dyed either. The henna made my hair very soft and a week later my hair is still very soft. The only thing that I was unaware of is that the indigo that is mixed in the auburn henna turned my hair way darker than it was before. It&#x27;s kind of a dark brown color with red highlights. I would say the dark brown is more noticeable than the red. If you&#x27;re looking for more red I would probably try one of the red shades, which I think I&#x27;ll try next time. I do like the product but the shade I chose just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I got this henna because I have auburn hair already, it&#x27;s dark auburn underneath and light-med brown on top. I&#x27;ve never colored my hair before, and I thought this would even out my hair color, but instead it turned ALL of my hair DARK BROWN!!!! The golden brown highlights stayed the same color but slightly darker, and the red in my hair just became less red. The color auburn is reddish brown, so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with that. So ultimately, my hair is less red than it was before and all it did was darken everything. I wish I could get my money back. I didn&#x27;t pay to keep my same hair color or I would have purchased neutral henna or amla powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used the Auburn shade Light Mountain henna kit and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  My hair used to be the color of a new penny, but since stray white hairs have been making an unwelcome invasion on my head, I&#x27;ve been using various hair dyes and was none too thrilled with the process or the outcome.  It&#x27;s VERY hard to find commercial hair dyes in a natural shade of red and they all seem to wash out quickly, leaving those ugly white hairs staring me in the face.  Plus, the noxious chemical odor and the burning sensation on my scalp left me feeling as though this couldn&#x27;t be a very healthy way to color hair.    So, I decided to give henna a try and spoke with some nice ladies at the local whole foods store who recommended this product to me.  It was somewhat time-consuming and a bit messy, but vanity know no bounds for time or mess!  I am SO happy with the result!  It&#x27;s like turning the clock back and looking at my hair from 25 years ago!  My hair color is identical to my natural color, complete with it&#x27;s blondish highlights and darker auburn low-lights and it has great shine and body!  I don&#x27;t know how long it will stay in my hair before washing out, but I will be back to buy more!  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found in a long time![[ASIN:B001ET7N6A Light Mountain Natural Hair Color &amp; Conditioner, Auburn, 4 oz (113 g) (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> medium length hair and get enough for two sessions in one box.  love it!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It does not smell the best, but it colors exactly like it is supposed to. It has been just over 4 weeks since my first application and I am just now showing subtle signs that I need to reapply. I could not be happier with this product!</li>
    <li> Great price, great product. Very natural.</li>
    <li> I am a natural redhead whose color started to go a bit blah when I hit my mid-20s. Light Mountain henna is fabulous. I have used this product for 8 years and will continue to use it as long as they make it. Always consistent, always beautiful, auburn results. It takes my light blond-brown hair with hints of red and leaves me with multi-toned auburn red hair like I had as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the company is being disingenuous when they say the color will wash out in 4-6 weeks... Beware. Anyone who has used Henna knows that it is permanent and binds with the hair shaft in a way that cannot be undone. Even if you want to! It fades over time, and I&#x27;ve seen some people say that they have been able to intentionally fade it faster with various concoctions of yogurt/bleach/vinegar/etc. but I have not tried those myself. It is definitely not a temporary hair color. Start small and be willing to live with it until it grows out. I also think the directions are a little odd. I used Light Mountain first after using regular BAC henna, so I have always followed the same procedure and it works the same for me here. I mix with hot water in a glass bowl with a lid, leave it to sit on a heating pad for 2-3 hours to achieve dye release, then apply to clean wet hair (I do my roots only now to avoid the artificial superhero-red shade you get if you continue to henna over previous henna applications by doing your whole head every time). I sit with the henna in my wet hair for about 30 minutes under a showercap while using the heating pad to evenly warm it at a medium or higher setting. After that, I rinse out, wait to fully shampoo-wash until 12 hours or more have passed, and then I have lovely auburn red hair like when I was a child. I do this once every 4-6 weeks to get the roots and it is an easy and effective routine.</li>
    <li> Once you do this once and get used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal at all to mix or apply. I don&#x27;t even use a towel on my shoulders anymore. The color is gorgeous, it makes my hair shiny and feel thicker, and I love that it&#x27;s not only not toxic, but it&#x27;s healthy for hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Light Mountain hair color for over 20 years. Smells like dirt while you&#x27;re using it however the color looks so natural. Real highlights. Colors gray too!</li>
    <li> My order arrived in a timely manner, 4 days. This is a wonderful product since its a stain and not a dye. And the price is affordable unlike the health food stores. Great Product</li>
    <li> This henna works well and is priced well, too.  I love that it is organic and chemical free, too!  Great price!</li>
    <li> Best natural hair coloring around.....love the color....it&#x27;s long lasting, strengthens my baby fine hair, and leaves it silky soft.  Get lots of compliments on the color!!</li>
    <li> I have only a few grays that I don&#x27;t particularly appreciate but I also refuse to use toxic hair color to cover them.  I decided to give this product a go and I am SO glad I did!  My hair is naturally a very dark brown with some lighter brown sections and is very dense, curly, medium-long, and tends toward dry, requiring copious amounts of conditioner normally.  One package of this single-digit price (gasp) product was more than enough to cover my entire head thoroughly.  It was EXTREMELY messy, crumbling off my hair as I was applying it.  It was EXTREMELY difficult to rinse out, the grainy glop clinging to my head with tenacity.  I took the advice from the insert and used a conditioning rinse to aid in removing the remnants from my strands and scalp, which instantly helped though I am STILL seeing grainy bits on my neck and shoulders long after the rinse.  After all this hassle, I was totally bowled over by the final result: a rich, gorgeous copper wash that adds amazing dimension to my otherwise-dull hair color, along with incredible shine, gray coverage, and over-the-top softness.  I did not use the product made specifically for gray hair; the regular variety did the trick.  I did follow the directions with regard to letting the mixture cure for an hour in the bowl, and I left it on my hair for a full hour as well.  Do set aside plenty of time before embarking on the application process; doing it correctly is worth the investment.  I will definitely be reapplying Light Mountain Auburn before it wears off to ensure that I can keep my new and improved head of hair!  I am loving this!</li>
    <li> I love this henna, but it is red. I think next time I am going to mix it with dark brown. Love using henna on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my hair for years and would use nothing else.  I&#x27;m 76, have dark brown, fine hair with lots of natural wave and about 10% grey.. The grey is colored back almost the strawberry blond/red I was as a youth, while the dark brown gets a little of the red hue I use to have.  My hair is shiny and smooth.  Hint:  To get the grainy henna out use baking soda when you rinse.  Make sure to use heat to help the henna work.  God bless!</li>
    <li> I  now love henna. , Smells like herbs,  brilliant color, soft shiny hair, no sting, no burning scalp, no chemical smell..  I&#x27;ll never go back to chemical hair color again.</li>
    <li> love it! This is exactly what I ordered and i will order more when needed! thank you</li>
    <li> I always like using this product! Its always my number 1 hair dye!</li>
    <li> I was quite timid about using henna. Horror stories of my teens came to mind with friends having bright orange hair. I am a natural redhead but with age (nearly 70) my colour has faded so much and the inevitable white hair is taking over bit by bit. I did as much research as I could on the internet about henna and the products available and finally chose this on because of the reviews. I decided one morning that this was going to be the day but I chickened out decided to do a henna gloss first. Henna glosd is a much less colourful result as it a small amount of henna powder is mixed with conditioner (ratio of 1:3 or 1:4) However after spending the whole morning on this enterprise it did nothing, my hair remained just the same. However this was far from upsetting as it gave me courage. If I wasn&#x27;t bright orange then perhaps this was not going to turn out to be a nightmare after all.&lt;br /&gt;So the next morning I determined I would get it done. I followed the instructions with few exceptions, I had no distilled water and I added cinnamon to hide the cut grass smell. The thing about trying the gloss first is that I made all the mistakes possible with that first try. I made SUCH a mess.&lt;br /&gt;This time I had already learned to make the paste more like mashed potato and boy did that make a difference. No drips, no mess, easy to apply. I waited 1 hour and rinsed and rinsed. I did not like the dry feel of my hair so I applied a little conditioner and rinsed again.&lt;br /&gt;In trepidation I turned to the mirror and oh boy was I surprised. My hair has turned out wonderfully. The beautiful auburn of my youth. No bright orangy bits. I only wish I could post a pic, it is so so natural.&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I go I receive lovely comments about how healthy my hair looks and how glossy it is, not everyone realised I had coloured my hair (goodness knows why) but it just shows how natural the colour turns out.&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about using henna then please try this product first as I am sure you will be as pleased I am.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend who doesn&#x27;t have an Amazon account.  This color is sure pretty on her, and so easy she tells me.</li>
    <li> Love it. I don&#x27;t color my hair with any thing but Light Mountain henna.</li>
    <li> I love this product, much easier to use then I had expected.  And best of all, it blends well, looks natural!</li>
    <li> I have severe reactions to hair dye (swelling, nausea, blistering scalp, weeping ears, etc.) and went through every &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and allergen free product I could find. I even consulted salons for advice with no success. I&#x27;ve had success with only two products and this was one of them. The results were shiny and have lasted. The process is long and a little messy, but worth it for me to not suffer for my vanity.</li>
    <li> So I had some grey hairs that I just wasn&#x27;t emotionally prepared for yet and I decided they had to go. I don&#x27;t girl well so I was looking for a simple product that was all natural. This was easy to use, true to the color and I am super happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 20 years. I started with pure red, and now use auburn. I have a sauna available, so I spend 45 minutes with that heat once I&#x27;ve applied it. I love the mix of colors and highlights that happen naturally, especially now that I have some gray. Swimming in a lake in the summer strips the henna more quickly. Otherwise it has been very wonderful. I have very fine almost waist length hair, and the coating also makes it much thicker. I&#x27;ve never done a strand test but always been happy. I reapply about every 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> A little messy to use, but beautiful results!  I&#x27;ve colored my hair with other products that bleach and then add color, the typical hair dyes, and this is lasting longer.  Those reds tend to fade, but the Light Mountain natural color is still bright and beautiful.  Also, one box makes a lot of hair color, so if you have fine, thin, or short hair, you could probably get one box to stretch through two or three uses quite easily.  All it all, great product!!</li>
    <li> I used this for the 1st time last Tuesday. The Auburn Shade. I had about 4 inches of natural dark brown hair and 6 inches of blond colored ends. I didn&#x27;t mind the process, or the clean up. I didn&#x27;t however end up with auburn hair. I got a coppery orange. I&#x27;m going to do it again this coming Tuesday, I hope it darkens up. I don&#x27;t really want dark hair, but my scalp can&#x27;t handle any more bleach. I don&#x27;t want brown, I want reddish brown. I probably should have waited until my hair was grown out fully. I don&#x27;t really want to get a haircut. And I&#x27;m very impatient. LOL</li>
    <li> Wasted 4 hours and made a gritty mess to find my lighter brown hair color essentially unchanged! Followed directions as specified...very diappointed...</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to love this product because I hate to put all these chemicals on my hair that other products have in them but I tried it three different times, even adding paprika and cumin to help with the color, and I could barely even tell that I had ever used it.  It was also very messy to use but I could have handled that if the coloring would have worked.</li>
    <li> First time using,  I should have left on longer. I forgot how messy henna is. Want to see how my grey holds up next time  and leave full four hours.</li>
    <li> I have used Light Mountain henna for hair before, and this is my first time using the Auburn henna.  It&#x27;s very nice.  Great color.  I received the product on time, and the packaging was in perfect condition.  I ordered 6 packs (3 each of auburn and red henna).  I rely on Light Mountain henna hair care products for purity and freshness.  I also appreciate the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; which contains a pair of gloves and a cap to use for applications.  They include a generous amount of henna in each package.  I have shoulder length hair, thick hair, and I only use about 1/2 to 2/3 of the package.  Great product, great company.</li>
    <li> Overall, I liked this product (I purchased the Auburn color) and will probably purchase again, but there were some aspects that were not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. I like the customization options.  Want your hair a little lighter? Add some lemon juice.  Want a little more brown?  Add some coffee. There are specific ideas in the included instructions that make it easy to decide what to add and how much.&lt;br /&gt;2. This was not nearly as messy (for me) as other reviews led me to believe it would be. I think this is because I did NOT make this product as thin as the instructions indicated.  I used about 10 oz of boiling water, instead of the at least 12 recommended.  I added a few ounces, stirred it in, and so on until the consistency was like slightly lumpy pudding.  This worked for me.  I had zero mess to clean up and made no effort to splash proof my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;3. I like the color this left on my hair.  I have very dark brown hair and this left a subtle red tint to it. This was my desired outcome.  I did not want an extreme change.  If you have very dark hair and want an extreme change, henna may not be the answer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell!  Oh, it doesn&#x27;t smell so bad, not like sewage or body odor or something, but it isn&#x27;t entirely pleasant either, and it is so pervasive and lingering!  It has been about 2 weeks since I used this product and I still catch a whiff of it every now and then, but I only wash it about twice a week.  In any case, it smells a little like matcha green tea (not sweetened or americanized-very green and somewhat pungent)+a field of hay.  It is a very earthy scent.  I added some Cinnamon, which helped a tiny bit, I think, but it is still pretty overwhelming.  The first 24 hours that you cannot wash it are really intense!&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes a long time.  The included instructions recommend 45 minutes to 4 hours on your hair.  That is after waiting 1 to 3 hours for the nasty goop you have made to set!  I lasted 3 hours.  Obviously you probably don&#x27;t want to go grocery shopping like that, but I got a fair amount of housework done so it wasn&#x27;t a complete bust.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is somewhat hard to rinse out.  I have a detachable sprayer in my shower and spent about 10 minutes with my head upside down watching bits of henna-mud slide down the drain.  Once the majority was rinsed off I used conditioner to co-wash and make sure any lingering bits of henna were down the drain.  You cannot wash your hair for the first 24 hours.  This was not a problem for me as my hair and scalp are quite dry, but it did smell pretty crazy so I wanted to wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some application tips&lt;br /&gt;1.  Do mix this a little thicker than recommended.  Much easier to control that way.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use a plastic disposable fork for mixing.  Much easier clean up this way, and you can break up the bigger lumps pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use better plastic gloves than the ones that come in the box if you have them available.  I got a hole in one of my gloves and didn&#x27;t notice until I was done dying.  It left a very subtle orange stripe in an unnoticeable spot, but that was sheer luck.  Be more careful than I was.&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you want more dramatic results than I got, you may have to leave on a lot longer than manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations.  If you are not as impatient as I am, you should do a strand test to know for sure how long you want to leave it on.  Unfortunately that is going to take all dang day cause you will have to mix up a tiny portion of henna and let it set from 1 to 3 hours, than treat a strand of hair for half a century.  Do whatever makes you comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Make sure you have a plan for entertaining yourself for the day, because this is not a quick process.  House work, spa day, movie marathon, whatever, just make sure you are occupied.  The smell is going to drive you crazy enough, you don&#x27;t want to add boredom to the mix!</li>
    <li> I love this henna! It&#x27;s the first to give me the color I was looking for plus my hair has stopped feeling damaged and dry since I switched! I took advice from others and I add spices to help the smell, I personally don&#x27;t like the henna smell, sometimes I add mint also but I would suggest to purée the mint because if left chunky it will fall out during application. Also I use one tablespoon of coconut oil instead of two tablespoons of olive oil. I think it has a lot more effect on my hair :)</li>
    <li> Although I am not crazy about having to apply henna, I did love the slight color and texture that this product gave my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a henna product since I am allergic to all other hair dyes. The color and condition it gives my hair is wonderful. Once you get past how messy it is to apply (which is typical of any henna I&#x27;m told) it is definitely worth it. No reaction to chemicals and great looking hair!  The price is very reasonable too.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!! I am so happy with this stuff. It&#x27;s a little messy but no more than any other box dye. It smells a bit odd but WAY better than the chemical crap. If you care about what goes in/on your body and possible threats to your health, BUY it.</li>
    <li> Definitely a subtle color - I have medium dark brown/reddish hair.  It added some nice reddish highlights - I thought it might be a little more red but maybe next time I&#x27;ll keep it on a little longer.  Fairly easy to mix and apply (henna is always a little messy but this wasn&#x27;t too bad).  I like that it came with the plastic cap and gloves so I didn&#x27;t have to find some to use.  Left my hair shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive:&lt;br /&gt;It is natural and that it looks natural. I get so many compliments on my hair color. My natural hair color is that weird in-between dirty blond and light brown color (that you can&#x27;t really describe as blond or brown). The Light Mountain Auburn product coats my hair to make it a nice auburn color that is subtle indoors and is vibrant in sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, it does fade but only a little. It&#x27;s been about 5 months since I have reapplied (because I am lazy) and other than the obvious root problem, my hair is still auburn in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a mess. I have seen videos of people making it look easy and not so messy. I am not that talented. I sit in the bathtub (probably not the best for the pipes) while my husband applies it. A second person is super handy in order to cover it fully because, again, I am not talented nor coordinated.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a long process to mix it, let it sit, prep hair (I apply it to wet hair), apply to hair, let it soak it, and washing it out.&lt;br /&gt;-It smells. My husband says it smells like alfalfa. (I don&#x27;t know what alfalfa smells like but I&#x27;ll take his word for it.) The smell lingers for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end the negative is worth it, when I gather up the energy to color my hair that is.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully!  I get many compliments on my hair color!  I have used it once a month for over 1 year.  Color doesn&#x27;t fade and I use regular shampoo.  I had to use expensive &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; shampoo on my hair to keep it from fading before I switched to henna.</li>
    <li> I used Light Mountain naturals \\&quot;red\\&quot; for awhile and liked it (it would start off fairly shocking but after a few days turn into a very nice color), but graduated from college and was ready to \\&quot;tame it down\\&quot; a bit for the adult world. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the auburn and contrary to the instructions I did not do the strand test. In hindsight, I probably should have as I would have left the dye on for longer. I have light brown hair and while it tinted my hair, didn&#x27;t make a HUGE difference. So I would recommend the strand test because you can definitely vary the leave-in time depending on how obvious you want the color to be. The henna dye process does take a bit more time (it&#x27;s a good hour commitment of time, minimum) than regular dye but SO WORTH IT (besides, it&#x27;s always a good excuse to sit down with a book or take a long bath and pamper yourself a bit :).  If you read at all about the chemicals in regular hair dye you will never go back - so many nasty things!!! Your hair will smell a bit like alfalfa (for those who don&#x27;t know what that smells like - think earthy/plant smell) for the first day until you shampoo but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a BAD smell and not overpowering. Besides, you can always spritz some essential oils through a spray bottle with some water if it really bothers you that much :) Another great perk to this product is that it fades out gradually so you don&#x27;t get those really obvious lines that make your roots stand out. I am 24 and already starting to grey and this product seems to cover it up just fine :)</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, thanks</li>
    <li> This has been my brand of choice for the last 15 or so years.  One of the reasons for selecting this is that they don&#x27;t add metal salts to the formula like some other brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin, and commercial hair coloring has burned my skin in past.  Henna doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to using henna, don&#x27;t believe what some people claim about how it &#x27;washes out gradually&#x27; so that grey roots won&#x27;t be noticeable.  This is not true of any product, you will see grey roots if you have them, and have to color accordingly.  It IS true that the brightness of red henna fades gradually with successive washing, and does not look strange in doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair used to be Auburn -- red/blond, so perhaps that is why my hair takes the red color so well.  I haven&#x27;t used the grey hair treatment prior to using this henna, and I will admit that it turns out pretty bright flame-red when it&#x27;s freshly colored.  I tried mixing it with Red Zinger Tea to pick up the red color one time, but didn&#x27;t really notice that it made much difference.</li>
    <li> I was a little suspect once I mixed this up. Green glop. How this made my hair mahogany, I don&#x27;t know. But it did. Shiny, good smelling, no chemicals! Exactly what I wanted. I was so afraid I would wind up like Ronald McDonald, but its a nice 100 percent natural look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing the same review for both the auburn and red colors because I got both and mixed them half and half. I have fairly thick, waist-length hair that is (naturally) about 30% grey and has been color treated with commercial/chemical (store bought) hair color for years. First, this covered the grey beautifully (actually better than several of the store brands I&#x27;ve used). It is messy, but, really, no messier than any other color at home product (in my opinion -but I tend to make a mess regardless). I did not experience any problems whatsoever rinsing this out, no grains or clumps, but I stirred the heck out of this when I mixed it. I saw someone say they made it the consistency of mashed potatoes and that helped them, I made it a bit thinner than than yogurt (it mentions yogurt consistency in the instructions) so that I could use a squirt bottle with it. There was MORE than enough in one packet to do my hair. I SOPPED my hair and still had some left over. I probably could have used half as  much and I have a lot of hair! The smell isn&#x27;t bad - if you don&#x27;t like the smell, add cinnamon. The package comes with a cap, gloves and very complete/detailed instructions. And the price is amazing compared to what I&#x27;ve spent for one box of hair color at walmart just to get home and find out I should have gotten two to adequately color my hair! I&#x27;m now a loyal fan and this will be my hair color from now on.</li>
    <li> I mix the red and auburn together and get compliments everywhere I go. I started using this henna after I had an allergy to hair dye, this might take longer and be a little messy, but it is so worth knowing it is healthy and natural. I add coconut milk sometimes when mixing and it seems to soften and add shine. Cinnamon helps with the smell and some dabs of olive oil help if you do not have the coconut milk.</li>
    <li> I started doing henna last year.  My hair is so much healthier, and shiny.  I swear I think it is thicker as well.  I am glad I no longer put harsh chemicals on my hair.  I mix Auburn with Red, and I love it!!  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because application is a true pain in the ___.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I do it I learn an easier way to apply this!! At this point I barely make a mess in the bathroom as I apply it (I have a completely white bathroom at home).  Some of my tips:&lt;br /&gt;-I bought a plastic egg whisk.  This made a HUGE difference!! why?  a) When it mixes fast and quickly it doesn&#x27;t form the little tiny balls that are the ones that fall all over the floor and sink area.  and b) it mixes much faster than before.  The mixing part went down from 20 minutes to roughly 10.&lt;br /&gt;-I still cover the sink area and immediate floor area with Saran Wrap, but now I am using Glad Press and Seal.  It works better but may leave a bit of gluish residue on certain surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;-I add allspice, yhoghur and an egg.  I think the egg helps to keep the blob together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered henna dye from here a few times, and before that I got it from Sprout/Whole Foods. This is my favorite brand, and it&#x27;s cheaper here than most places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Mountain gives my hair a nice natural red/brown color. I do it every few months--it&#x27;s a process to prep the dye, and it&#x27;s like coating your hair in mud, but it&#x27;s so much more affordable than going to a colorist and the results look a lot more natural. Plus I find it makes my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not impressed the outcome...</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and appears to be same product I&#x27;ve ordered in past.</li>
    <li> If you never done henna before, this product is a great start. They have a range of colors to choose from and they are very clear on what you need to do before using.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first product and it was really nice. The price was great and so were the results. I have since changed brands that I can&#x27;t order on amazon, but I still highly respect this brand due to its instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Avoid unnamed henna brands - Some henna can have PPD, which is nasty if you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid washing your hair everyday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a wood brush (bamboo is okay) with wooden bristles so that the wood adsorbs the oils in your hair and distributes them from the root down&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Do not mix with metal and use distilled water. Metal and tap water can cause a reaction with henna and might turn your hair green. Glass is safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switch to a better shampoo&amp;conditioner. Herbal shampoos are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you go! I have been using henna for three years now, I will never go back!</li>
