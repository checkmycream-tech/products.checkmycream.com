<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Having used other sulphate free shampoos I decided to try this one as it has added benefit of argan oil which everyone seems to be raving about. BUT after a few months of use I have found my very fine natural hair is even finer and it looks like I am losing my hair! I use it on my daughters curly natural hair too and this also appears thinner. As this is the only product I have changed in our hair regime I suspect it is damaging our hair. I am also very shocked to hear that sodium hydroxide is in the list of ingredients. Normally I read all the ingredients to make sure it is as safe as can be but I overlooked this with crème of nature. This is sulphate free but definitely not natural enough for me. Will be ditching this and returning to my old shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am of mixed ethnicitys. My roots are super kinky waves sorta, and since i used to relax my hair, my ends are usually just frizzy and sort-of straight. Before, i was using Dollar Store shampoo and conditioner. Once i switched to this conditioner, i stopped losing hair.. my hair felt softer and more managable. The crazy thing is, this shampoo feels more like a conditioner. The conditioner has a weird consistancy, but i like the pair. I also pair that with the detangling spray, and the argan oil creme (: My hair is so much healthier and grows alot quicker.</li>
    <li> OMG. This is it. I use this shampoo yesterday and I can&#x27;t believe how great my hair was. My hair felt like it was washed at the salon. My hair was soft, shiny, super moisturized, detangled. I only use this shampoo once and I am planning on throwing out the rest of my shampoo and only use creme of nature argan oil shampoo.     I have relaxed 4b hair that is bras strap length/mid back. Before I could never ever comb my hair right after using a shampoo not even with prepooing. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurethyl sulfate and I am super happy about that. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t sudd a lot, but it gets your hair super clean and moisturized at the same time. My hair actually felt silky while using this shampoo. What shampoo does that to black hair except creme of nature argan oil shampoo? I used the old creme of nature formula back in 1999 and it reminds me of it alot. I think this shampoo helps with breakage because when I was washing it my hair breakage cut down to about 98%. Before I would loose a ton of hair while washing/detangling my hair. I am so in love with this shampoo. I was soooooo excited.     This shampoo has sodium hydroxide (found in lye relaxer) as one of its ingredients towards the bottom. From research the sodium  hydroxide works as a binder for fatty acids in the ingredient. Basically it is a binder and it is in small amount so for you natural ladies out there, there is no need to worry about straigthening your hair .    Pros  Moisturizing, silky detangled hair, soft, shiny hair, $4.99    Cons  Not big enough bottle.     Try this shampoo you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah Creme of nature argan oil shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo literally makes my hair feel like i just got it done at a salon,my hair is soft while and after washing it out.  with working other shampoos threw my hair it always created a lot of knots it my hair with creme of nature shampoo my hands ran effortlessly threw my hair while washing.I have relaxed 4a/4b hair and for a shampoo to work and moisturize my hair so well even with new growth is such a plus.  I will NEVER use another shampoo other than this one (unless creme of nature can top there own product) :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the real deal, I love it. It gives amazing slip making you feel like you just conditioned. I have relaxed 4b hair, definitely a staple. Im in loveeeeee.</li>
    <li> Left my tangled hair moist and manageable. I was seriously considering getting a major haircut and had become somewhat discouraged because my hair was feeling like straw (I think I was just coated with too many products). I chose this because of Cream of Nature&#x27;s reputation of leaving my hair manageable in the past. This one is definitely a winner. It cleaned and moisturized my hair without stripping it of all its oils.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU makers of the new Argan line!!! This totally felt like the creame of nature from my childhood! The newer formula of 3yrs past caused breakage and extreme dryness but this...this elixer of healthy hair is AMAZING. I can now return to my lifelong shampoo with ease and absolutely no worries!! :o)</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review for a product. Usually I am too lazy but today I washed my hair n I&#x27;m speechless I almost felt like I did not need to moisturize after using this .at first I notice that I had to keep using more product but it does lather. Next time I wash with this I will be section the hair and do one part at a time. As soon as I rinse the shampoo out of my hair it felt super soft. I am so happy n I am even considering transitioning to natural because of how it shaped my roots to curls that badly need a relaxer. I would recommend for transitioners and stretchers.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I love Creme of Nature and I love Argan Oil. One would think that the combination of both would be spectacular. It was so far from spectacular that you cannot imagine. My hair was stripped and felt crunchy. It felt like straw. I had to run to find my Aubrey White Camellia conditioner to deep condition my hair for 35-45 minutes before my hair felt good again.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name, if you love Creme of Nature stick with the original; this is not even close.  Why ruin a good thing. Ugh!!!</li>
    <li> I am recently transitioning to natural hair.  I have used Wen with no complaints.  The CON argon oil shampoo makes my hair look and feel amazing.  I have very thick course hair.  This shampoo tames my hair while adding so much volume.  Yes, the smell could stand some improvement.  However, the product works really well for course, dry, brittle hair, and transitioning locks.</li>
    <li> I think this product is amazing!!! I currently have the Keratin smoothing treatment on my hair so I was searching high and low for a good sulfate-free shampoo and came across CON&#x27;s product in my local BSS. I used it for the first time last night along with the conditioner and the foaming wrap lotion. The shampoo detangled my hair so easily! My hair is incredibly soft with a natural sheen and the perfect amount of body. I am truly impressed!!! Ladies you should definitely give this product line a try!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing shampoo. I have 3b relaxed hair and i am shocked to find a shampoo that makes my hair detangle while washing. You can use as much of it as you want, lather it up and it never strips the hair. I was never really into sulfate free shampoos but now I am a believer! Definately a staple for winter. I bought from my beauty supply store and then stocked up from another website, but wanted to review the product publicly.</li>
    <li> See the review of creme of nature intense conditioner. All that i will say about the shampoo is that for my hair it is ideal, as well as the fact that the ingredients are very effective. I love the way my hair feels once ive washed, rinsed, and repeated. Some shampoos you have to use the conditioner wether leave in or rinse out. Creme of nature shampoo gives me the option to go about my day without necessarily having to use both. Which equals quality ingredients that are beneficial for my grade of hair.</li>
    <li> I was a devoted customer of Revlon&#x27;s Creme of Nature Detangling Shampoo for over 20 years. I have very long, thick, easily tangled, curly hair. CON was the ONLY shampoo I found that allowed me to detangle in the shower. I needed it. Bonus, it was one of the few sudsy shampoos on the market that DID NOT contain sodium lauryl sulfate. So imagine my horror when last year I bounced into the store to find that my CON in the beige bottle not there, and, according to the somnolent cashier, was no longer sold. Sure, some people have real problems, but for me, that was a crisis. Other shampoos just don&#x27;t allow me to detangle. So I urged Sleepy to please find out what had happened to my shampoo. In a fit of industry, she shuffled into the back, then returned with, \\&quot;She said they&#x27;re coming out with a new shampoo; something with Argan Oil. It won&#x27;t have sodium lauryl whoozit.\\&quot;   So I wait, using dime sized dollops of my last CON bottle, trying not to finish it.   Finally, I&#x27;m able to order it from Amazon (cue celestial chorus); I run to the shower. Oh, did I mention that it costs twice as much for less?   First impression, the fragrance (odor) is overpowering, and it smells like a men&#x27;s product (think Axe for Men). Second, not as much lather; I needed much more product to produce the creamy detangling effect. Third, the color of the product is just strange--orange shampoo is oddly disconcerting. I let my hair air dry as per usual. CON left it silky, this Argan Oil shampoo left it a bit dull and not silky at all.   I&#x27;m truly disappointed. I&#x27;ve now bought at least a dozen cheap or expensive sulfate-free shampoos, including the obscenely expensive ones at Whole Foods. All of them leave me with a head full of straw.   I am very disappointed in Creme of Nature/Revlon. They had a great product and scrapped it for profit?</li>
    <li> I have always loved creme of nature products. I like the addition of the argan oil. Great for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Relatively quick delivery. Product is very good for me.hair feels very clean and light afterwards and combined with the Leave in conditioner it gives me hydrated manageable hair.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;ve heard a lot of a good things about sulfate-free shampoos, I was a little apprehensive trying this one. I&#x27;ve tried a cleansing shampoo before (WEN) and my hair never felt truly clean, and it created a lot of build up that I did not like at all. This product is different, thank goodness. It cleanses my scalp and hair without stripping it AND provides and incredible amount of moisture. I was shocked by how soft and silky my hair was after just one use. My hair is so silky (with plenty of slip) that I feel as though I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner (I do though). After using this product for a couple weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any build up whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a shampoo I will purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> This is a gentle shampoo, one of the best I&#x27;ve tried!  My coily/curly hair HATES shampoos, as they dry it out and leave it frizzy.  I mainly wash my hair with conditioner, but I do clarify on occasion.    I was a bit wary of trying \\&quot;beauty supply store\\&quot; products, but I was pleased with this product.  It is by no means all-natural, but it WORKS.     If your hair has a lot of oil or gel on it, you will not get much lather at all.  That is not a bad thing.  Just rinse, and lather again. The shampoo has very foamy lather.  When I rinse this shampoo out of my hair, my curls are still defined, and I feel like I could skip conditioner!  The smell--is a bit medicinal, but not unbearable.  At $4-$5 for 12oz, this sulfate-free shampoo is very economical! Cleanses well without stripping!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! If you are looking for squeaky clean, do not look to this. It mildly cleanses hair and does not strip my strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best deal I have seen for this is on Sally&#x27;s Beauty.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed (3c/4a) hair and I&#x27;m currently transitioning to natural hair. This stuff is like liquid gold! When I use it I feel like I don&#x27;t need a conditioner for how soft and manageable my hair is (but I still condition!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo was great, but stay away from that conditioner, it is some how not as moisturizing as the shampoo.</li>
    <li> NICE STUFF...DOESNT BURN MY EYE...LOVELY</li>
    <li> Gave me the results I was looking for , reasonably priced ! I highly suggest it for dry, over processed hair.</li>
    <li> Creme of Nature Moisture Shampoo worked REALLY great on my hair, I was literally impressed. My hair is relaxed.  It was SO smooth and detangled after I finished, that I didnt even need a conditioner.  It makes you WANT to wash your hair MORE just to experience the silkiness and cleaness that is leaves your hair.  I am 42 years old and have used all products from cheap to expensive across the board and this works in my opinion, greater than some high end shampoos. A selling point of this shampoo is that its sulfate-free.  Most of the sulfate-free shampoos that I have used don&#x27;t lather very well, which makes me feel like I&#x27;m not getting it clean or using enough, I didn&#x27;t use that much of it either to get the lathering effect.&lt;br /&gt;Economically priced item too, especially locally.</li>
    <li> I found that this shampoo is very moisturizing, with a good lather. I was skeptical when I couldnt tell a difference in my hair until I rinsed it out. Good for detangling in the shower. The only thing that I do not like is the scent, wish it smelled like their Intensive moisturizing treatment.</li>
    <li> I have superlong straight color treated Caucasian hair. I don&#x27;t blowdry it (Florida heat) or heat style it a lot. But still, my hair looks dry and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was on sale BOGOF at Walgreens, but I ended up getting it half off due to the fact that this was the LAST one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong like baby powder and sweet musk. You either like it or you don&#x27;t, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I didn&#x27;t use conditioner and the brush glided through my hair and when it dried it was soft and silky. Im now hooked on sulfate free shampoo!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth the extra $$$ you spend. Seriously, you wont need as many deep conditioning treatments and stuff when you buy it.</li>
    <li> The title speaks for itself...If you can find the old version, you will find in this shampoo. Its better than the other Cream of Nature shampoos. Its so good, you won&#x27;t want to condition your hair afterwards. The Argan oil gives it an added boost. Its one of the first ingredients in the shampoo. Definitely worth every dollar and some. I have tried numerous of shampoos. I am glad to return back to Creme of Nature.</li>
    <li> good shampoo which is light on hair but still does the job.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman who has natural hair!!  I was looking for a great sulfate free shampoo and this shampoo is it!  It leaves my hair super soft, clean and moisturized.  I have the argan oil conditioner as well and that is a great conditioner!  So ladies if you are natural or not please get you some Creme of Nature Argan Oil Shampoo you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of shampoos but this stuff is great. My daughter and I have 4c hair but since she&#x27;s two I&#x27;ve been trying more expensive children&#x27;s products thinking it will be gentle &amp; good enough for both of our hair. Well i was wrong &amp; the last shampoo I brought stripped her hair so bad &amp; it felt hard. This stuff is gentle to use on children&#x27;s hair too and it leaves your hair soft, shiny, &amp; detangled</li>
    <li> all these years i have been using the wrong stuff until a coworker stated that her brillow pad hair became baby soft and manageable.her boyfriend used it and called her up and asked where did she get it.so i finally tried it and for the first time in life,hardly no kinks while i was blow drying my hair! o my god, hardly no hair from the blow dryer comb attachment!i am throwing out or giving away my old shampoos.i have natural nice grade hair and i havent had a perm since the 1980&#x27;s.man i use to hate washing my hair.now i am so looking forward to washing my hair again.i have been thinkin about the shampoo results all day and i wanna scream for not using this shampoo sooner!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Creme of Nature Moisture and Shine Shampoo, Conditioner, Oil Moisturizer and Oil Sheen.  This product worked for me!! From the shampoo all the way to the oil sheen which I used to touch up my hair this morning. My hair felt like silk!!! My hair was soft, shiny and had lots of body. I&#x27;m a believer and will definetly be purchasing these items and more from the line.</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of CON Argan Oil hair products. I am transitioning from relaxed to natural. I flat iron once a week, and wrap at night. My transitioned hair still looks relaxed but its softer, healthier and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been natural for almost ten years. I have been through the ringer using all kinds of shampoo. Plus I&#x27;m a product junkie at times.  My latest shampoo for the last 2-3 years has been the expensive NIOXIN. In between I try things here and there but that has been my staple. For the past 6 months I have been wearing a sewn in so shampoo hasn&#x27;t been that important to me(don&#x27;t judge me. So I&#x27;ve been really really bad, using VO5 or whatever I can find to wash quick and braid it back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo I ran out of cheap shampoo and went to the hair store to grab something. I ran into this only because it was $5 bucks and said SULFATE FREE. I thought to myself, if your going cheap again...why not try to be semi good and get this. Low and behold this just might replace my expensive brands. I washed my hair and it felt so soft and easy to mange! Any girl with 4a/b hair, natural and has been braided up for a month and half knows the struggle! Well ladies this was great! I almost felt like I could  de tangle with a shampoo?! I was shocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m literally blown away by this shampoo. So much I am going to get the conditioner for my next wash. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product that moisturizes the hair also.  Hair feels silky after shampooing afterwards.  Hair is soft also.</li>
    <li> This product is the bomb. I got a sample of this and couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of suds for just a nickle size amount and how cleansing it is.  The scent is fabulous too.  For African American naturals, you can detangle your hair and it rinses out easily.  This is my HG shampoo now.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderfully and the best detangling shampoo on the market.</li>
    <li> This a great product for women of color with Kinky Hair; it leaves the hair moisturized, soft and manageable, and with lots of shine.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately Creme of Nature has decided to reformulate this product since it first came out. The product now contains silicones and a harsher detergent. The shampoo is also slimy upon lathering, presumably due to the addition of cones. Why change a good thing? I was so disappointed, and now I&#x27;m stuck with two bottles I will never use. Amazon should really update the ingredients list on this product to reflect the change!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used creme of nature before, was actually extremely loyal to it.  For ridiculously cheap, that shampoo (white w/red cap?) had rivaled ANY &amp; I mean any shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;d ever tried (and believe me..I&#x27;m a product junky). Then the company discontinued it and I was so disappointed. Since I&#x27;ve been using other more expensive sulfate free shampoos &amp; honestly just haven&#x27;t been happy with them or my hair. I was just getting ready to try WEN when I saw that Creme of Nature \\&quot;reinvented\\&quot; a sulfate free shampoo w/ Argan oil &amp; for the money decided to try it.  Needless to say i&#x27;m in love..AGAIN. It is as amazing as the original I used to use. I have naturally curly hair, that i have in the past chemically straightened, and curretly color, and flat iron. I&#x27;ve shampooed once &amp; had an appt at the salon &amp; my hairdresser told me she&#x27;d never felt my hair as soft &amp; that was before she new I had switched shampoos! If you have oily hair/combo hair, rinse well &amp; maybe skip the conditioner. Thank you Creme of Nature :)</li>
    <li> I have a head of healthy hair and I am the ultimate product junkie as I am dead-set on keeping my hair healthy, strong, soft and moisturized.  I relax my hair 3 times a year and it is fine textured- about mid-back length.  I must say that I absolutely love this shampoo!  I agree with others that the smell isn&#x27;t great; but it left my hair soft, detangled and manageable right out of the shower.  Could have likely gone without conditioning.  I am not quite sure that this shampoo is as good as my go-to (Kera Care Hydrating Detangling Shampoo); but it does cost more than 50% less than the other; so I will be using this every other shampoo at the very least.  As an aside, I also tried the companion CON argan oil conditioner and did not like it at all.  It didn&#x27;t moisturize for me and left my hair tangled (should have just stuck with the shampoo).</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. You honestly don&#x27;t need conditioner after using it, however, I still do to get that extra softness. I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> Hey Ladies!!!!!!! this product is FABULOUS!!!!!  I tossed out all of my other products this is IT!!! That&#x27;s all I can say. I&#x27;m natural and my hair is silkier than ever !!!</li>
    <li> I love this sulfate-free shampoo! My hair is detangled, smooth, and soft BEFORE applying conditioner. Since this is sulfate free...do not use if you have alot of build up for gel and hair sprays. I use natural oils and water based moisuturizes so this gets the job done!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair more manageable, moisturized and soft after using.  I tried using Wen shampoo and my hair was still dry and not very manageable after using. This shampoo is way cheaper than Wen and works much better for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent item! Hard to find, but I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase! Go ahead and click buy, your body will thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for curly, dry, frizzy, untamed hair. I have gone through shampoo after shampoo trying to find one that leaves my hair feeling soft instead of dry and cracky. I researched about sufltate free shampoos and tried this one and it worked amazingly well, better than expected. It leaves the hair feeling soft and silky, hydrates and adds softness to my curls. I tried it on my toddlers hair and it worked great on them too. I&#x27;ve been telling all my curly haired friends about this shampoo and they all are desperate to try it. It seems its not easy to find products to tame dry, curly hair even though there are tons of products claiming to do all that. This one is true to its claim!</li>
    <li> Bye bye Dark and Lovely. See ya Optimum Care. Adios Organix.  I&#x27;m throwing them out and moved on to this amazing line of products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relaxed 4b hair that is always dry and breaking no matter how much I moisturize or oil. Maybe it was the sulfates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished flat ironing my hair after using the shampoo, conditioner, leave in strengthener, and oil treatment for Creme of Nature.I didn&#x27;t use the oil moisturizer because i heard off things post flat iron, so I stuck to my Silk Elements Megasilk Protection Spray. After rinsing the shampoo, I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my hair felt. Clean, smooth, soft AND detangled! I could actually run a comb through it without having to mess with the knots. When I blow dried it, my hair didn&#x27;t feel the least bit dried out(normally a problem), and it didn&#x27;t take forever to dry like usual. My chronic dry problem spots were cured too. Even flat ironing was enjoyable. I&#x27;m 9 weeks post relaxer and my hair looks like I stepped out of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks gorgeous, soft and shiny.  It feels healthy, smooth, supple, and moisturized. I am definitely a fan. I decided to try it out because it was BOGO free at Walgreen&#x27;s, and while I had to drive 25 minutes to another to get the conditioner, I would drive out there again to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well for something with no sulfates&lt;br /&gt;Detangles&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels great post-poo, pre dish&lt;br /&gt;Noticed a heck of a lot less breakage&lt;br /&gt;Soft, supple, shiny&lt;br /&gt;Post blow dry frizzies are no where to be found&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily&lt;br /&gt;Has body and bounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None really. I just hope I can find it when I go back to school!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best, but I love it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have to condition afterwards because my hair is so thick a d I just don&#x27;t get enough moisture from it. However, this shampoo does leave the hair soft and it feels very good when in use. I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out either. I wasn&#x27;t washing my hair because of all of the sulfates in shampoos, but I was excited to find this shampoo and I will most likely stick with this shampoo until I find something better.</li>
    <li> I used this both when I was transitioning from relaxed hair and now that I am a natural curly girl. I have hair in the 3b-4a multi-textured ranges. When I had transitioning hair, it did not even occur to me to use this as advertised - for detangling. but now that I am fully natural, wow! what a difference. This product cleanses my scalp very well. All this time, I though i had flakes in my hair because I could not remove build-up adequately. So I used clarifying shampoo at every chance I took. Now that I have switched to non-sulfate shampoo, the flakes are a thing of the past! My scalp rarely itches, and my hair feels incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you really can detangle with this. I apply to my scalp in sections a couple of washes and then apply a tiny amount of the length of each section. After a minute, under a bit of running water, you can go ahead and detangle with your comb (I use my fingers). No breakage and hardly any &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; hair. Incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found my staple shampoo. Absolutely great price, tolerable smell and good quantity of product. Hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> It detangels the hair and make it soft for easy management. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a cross between regular shampoo and the &#x27;wen&#x27; type shampoos.  For those who have not tried the latter type of shampoo,  they do not lather and are applied more like conditioner than anything else.  The shampoos that I have tried of this type although they are obviously less damaging to your hair, and they do not make your hair tangled because there is no chemical that tangles, have not resulted in my hair being shinier or softer.  This Cream of Nature Moisture and Shine shampoo did leave my here softer and shinier. It lathers like regular shampoo,  but works almost as a de-tangler.  The only negative for me is that I felt that my hair needed washing sooner than the usual 3-4 days.  The second time I used it I did not put any conditioner near the scalp and I like that result better. I will try the conditioner made by the same company. I recommend the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been reading about the damage that using products that contain sulfates do to your hair.  My hair is shiny, healthy and doesn&#x27;t feel like straw.  It&#x27;s also very straight when I blow dry it, I&#x27;ve noticed the difference.  Cuts down the time it takes to blow dry.  I highly recommend. My hair is relaxed and I don&#x27;t use a strong relaxer.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and moisturizing feeling of the shampoo itself.  And it does not leave my hair dry like other reviews say it does theirs.  But it isn&#x27;t great texture in my hair after my hair dries.  I wanted it to be something to buy again, but prob not.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best shampoo ever!!! If you are looking for a really good moisturizing shampoo (and one that&#x27;s also sulfate free),then you&#x27;ve found it.  This shampoo is sooooo moisturizing, yet it cleans your hair thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve used many moisturizing shampoos, and this one is the absolute best.</li>
    <li> Helped me rid my scalp of flakes that i have had for a long time. Hair is smooth and healthy. Leaves hair feeling very moisturized. I no longer even use a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one other sulfate free shampoo besides this one and so far I&#x27;m not impressed at all by comparison. Hair still feels slightly greasy after it drys and I never feel like it was fully shampooed. Going to continue searching for a better sulfate free shampoo because this one doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
    <li> I love your shampoo!!! Amazing!! It detangles my hair beautifully. However, I would love to see your company make a moisturizer and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t contain silicones perhaps modified silicones. I used to use V05 moisture milk line and that detangled my just like your shampoo. I definitely think that you should create a line towards the curly girl method.</li>
    <li> I do not know how to explain, but it makes my hair &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;. Also, my scalp has a dandruff-like residue, no matter how long I try to rinse. Not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample with the leave-in conditioner, regular conditioner, and another product. This was my least favorite, but my husband uses it and says it&#x27;s his favorite.</li>
    <li> This reminded me almost of Loreal Cleansing Conditioner. Washing hair with this is lovely.  The shampoo glides right over hair and does not feel like it is stripping and damaging it.  Seems to prevent friction when washing.  I have a lot of products (secret product junkie) so it took me a while to get to this one.  I kept putting it off thinking it would not be anything great, or would be too heavy.  This is sold in the ethnic hair section and I wondered if it would be wrong for my fine non ethnic hair..I was wrong.  If you are looking for a shampoo that will feel smooth and creamy when washing this is the one.  It did not dry my hair at at all.  I have bleached, dry parched hair and this worked wonderfully for it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this shampoo provides slip without silicones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised by this shampoo I must say...looking for the matching conditioner now.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of..this is the only shampoo I would ever be able to actually skip conditioner with.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free but I felt it cleansed well.  Did not leave hair lank or greasy.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and initially I was pleasantly surprised. This shampoo smells good- the scent isn&#x27;t irritating at all. When I applied it my hair felt so much softer and was easy to detangle. I have natural hair that could be classified as 4c/4b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it in conjunction with the Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment (as per the instructions), however, was a disappointment. As soon as I applied it to my hair it felt static-y and rough and was a pain to comb through. I thought it was a problem with the conditioner so on subsequent use of this shampoo I tried using another conditioner (one which has always worked well with my hair) in the place of the Creme of Nature conditioner. However this yielded the same result. The shampoo is okay but for some reason it makes my hair feel static-y afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that this shampoo is extremely troublesome to wash out of my hair! I&#x27;ve had to spend more time getting soapy residue out of my hair than I usually do with other shampoos. Additionally, after about two uses I&#x27;ve noticed that while using this shampoo it leaves my skin feeling slightly irritated. The irritation only lasts for a few minutes after I wash it out. Still, considering that it takes a long time to wash out, this isn&#x27;t pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has benefits but because of these issues I won&#x27;t be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Lathers extremely well&lt;br /&gt;Good slip&lt;br /&gt;Good consistency - not too thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with conditioners&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to wash out of my hair&lt;br /&gt;Causes skin irritation</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans and detangles; leaving your hair feeling and smelling amazing. I will definitely purchase this product again. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been shifting into using sulfate free shampoos (i.e. Wen or Hair One) which for the most part has been going quite well. However, I felt that my hair had some residual build-up stemming from this switch. This shampoo produces a copious amount of suds and my hair no longer felt weighed down after I used it. It left my hair feeling light and conditioned (I could easily run my comb through my hair after just one wash)!</li>
    <li> Good product. make my hair so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo in my life that has left my hair as moisturized as conditioner. When I was a little girl, I used the old CON shampoo, and after many years I&#x27;ve returned. If you have coarse, damaged, dry, thick 3C hair, this is it! Lifetime staple!!!!!!</li>
    <li> First of all I DID NOT spend $10 on this product, i bought from my local beauty supply store for $4.99!!&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I do not know why I did not purchase earlier, when I was searching for a shampoo, I couldnt find a shampoo that agreed with my hair, I was using Herbal Essences but I think they changed their ingredients because it does nothing for my hair now, I used the Shea Moisture shampoo, and I felt it did not clean my hair well, felt more like a cowash. So I decided to try this. This did NOT make my hair fall out at ALL! Usually, when people wash their hair some hair falls out, I have to wash my hair in sections because my hair is super thick, and it detangled my hair very well. I will be using this from now on, I cannot tell if it made my hair shiny because i put oils in my hair that make it shiny anyways.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that responds to oil very well.  I was using some cheap Neutrogena stuff for a while (for budgetary reasons) and thought I&#x27;d give my hair a treat.  I have always wanted to use Moroccan oil &amp; thought I might get lucky &amp; find my brand on the first try.  No such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is unhappy, my hair&#x27;s appearance is unhappy, which makes me unhappy.  The texture is strange, somehow dry as straw, tangled, while also being greasy &amp; weighed down.  The hunt continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On second try, I added two more stars.  So, it sat in my closet for months.  And then when my hair needed a break from my shampoo routine, I tried it and my hair responded a lot better!  I moved to a hotter, drier climate, maybe it&#x27;s better in this part of the world.  I won&#x27;t be getting another bottle, but it&#x27;s better than I originally thought.</li>
    <li> i bought this shampoo because i have terrible tangles &amp; knots. the first time i used it ,it was a miracle, but i don&#x27;t know what i did, because that was the only time the tangles came out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell!!!  I used it today for the first time abr it definitely made my hair more manageable and it detangled it pretty fast.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo my hair was so freaking soft and moisturized. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Never have I used a shampoo alone that actually did this to my hair. When I was rinsing the shampoo out my hair it instently felt softer .so soft that I actually thought it was shampoo still in my hair. I kept rinseing and rinsing. Its like a conditioner!! Best shampoo I ever bought. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> This was the first sulfate free shampoo I used when I started transitioning bc I was familiar with the brand. But I did not like this shampoo at all. It left my hair feeling really greasy and weighed down. I also don&#x27;t like the smell, but I think it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like the smell of argan oil, so if you don&#x27;t mind it, it prob won&#x27;t bother you. Either way, I couldn&#x27;t even finish the one bottle I bought. I gave it to my bf. lol</li>
    <li> I have a whole lot of fine hair that was flyaway and unmanageable. Ive used this shampoo for a week now and I love it! My hair has more body, holds a style, dries faster and seems overall healthier. Cant wait to see what another week does! Im recommending this to all my friends with fine hair.</li>
    <li> A lot of people try different shampoos..I have yet to stray. It is so weird. I started and never left. That should say enough..</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from Cream of nature as I&#x27;ve been a fan of their products for ages. I tried this product line and was highly disappointed. This shampoo does what it is supposed to, clean hair. Following up with the deep conditioner they have is a no go for me.  My hair texture is 4a, cottony and this does my hair no justice. This shampoo is sulfate free yes but it doesn&#x27;t do much to hydrate and my not leave my hair totally stripped. I&#x27;ve sense stopped buying this line of products, though my mom whose got 3B/C hair texture that is relaxed this works wonderfully on her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a lot of mixed reviews, it works for some where as for others like myself, waste of cash. Fortunately my mother can use thsi line so it isn&#x27;t a total waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This was by far the worst shampoo I have ever used.  After using it, my hair, which is not chemically treated, had a brittle and dry feeling.  I even gave it to a friend to use after warning her of the effect it had on my hair.  She too used it and also was not pleased with the texture of her hair.  I have used several sulfate-free shampoos, and I have never had any major complaints.  Perhaps it is the Argan oil that is causing problems with the shampoo.  I&#x27;m not sure, but I will not use this product again!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was transitioning to natural hair. It worked pretty good for the first few months, but now, it is not even soapy anymore.  I am definitely going to look for another sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!! I used to use the old school green bottle Creme of Nature shampoo, and I thought that was decent, but this new argan oil shampoo is on a whole &#x27;nother level.  I have natural 3c/4a hair and I bought this because it is sulfate-free.  This shampoo is so so moisturizing, it lathers,and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stripped.  In fact it&#x27;s the complete opposite.  After rinsing out the shampoo, my hair feels so soft,and moisturized and this is before I use any kind of conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used it 4 times already and each time I&#x27;m in awe of how great my hair feels.  I have a co-worker who has relaxed hair and she loves it as well.</li>
    <li> This sulfate free shampoo from Creme of Nature is very awesome! It cleans my hair without stripping its natural oils.  Other shampoos have left my hair feeling dry and I had to go overboard with conditioners.  This product left my hair clean, moisturized, and strong! I am in love! :D</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have relaxed hair that I often wear curly because it stops me from having to put heat to it.  The heat is hard on my hair making it brittle and weak. I am a bad sleeper so tying my hair up or sleeping with rollers is not a good option for me.  Like I mentioned earlier my hair is curly and it tangles very easily.  I prefer to use a detangling shampoo because they are more moisturizing and help with tangle problems. I also suffer from itchy flaky dry scalp.  I give my self hot oil treatments when I shampoo to help with the dry scalp problem.  The moisturizing shampoos seem to help me with that also.  I have always used Creme of Nature products so when I saw this new sulfate free formula,  I gave it a try. (Everyone swears that they are healthier for your hair.)  What I saw when I shampooed was amazing!  I use a lot of leave in conditioners like Elasta Mango butter leave in  to help moisturize  and smooth my sleeked back ponytail.  I usually use them daily to smooth my hair and control frizz.  I knew I needed to wash my hair but, I did not realize I had a lot of build up on my hair.  This shampoo got my hair and scalp really clean but it never  felt tight, stiff, or dried out. It just felt clean, soft, and fresh.  My hair was soft  before I applied  the Argan oil conditioner by Creme of Nature.  The conditioner worked  just fine, but the shampoo was outstanding! I air dried my hair and it was smooth with very little frizz.  The curls were soft and smooth.  The only negative thing was that this is a small bottle of shampoo.  I wish it came in a larger bottle.  If you have relaxed hair or curly hair I think you will like this shampoo.  I will definitely be using this shampoo again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Creme of Nature Shampoo. I am happy they came up with a sulfate free product that contains argan oil. This shampoo smells wonderful! I also enjoyed the little sample of Argan Oil they included with the shampoo. I am happy with this product. I will continue to use it and another shampoo I came across....I will be alternating between this one and the other shampoo I bought.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product due to the reviews it received. I totally agree it is a wonderful product and leaves your hair hydrated and soft. I have purchased the conditioners as well and love the whole product line. I highly recommend especially for women of color. Great product.</li>
    <li> I used this product on myself before using it on my daughter for whom I had originally bought this shampoo. It is not much of a detangler by itself ( I suppose the conditioner is needed); and the smell is a little irksome. Overall, won&#x27;t be my first choice next time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that was SLS free, made my hair stronger, and made my hair shinier.  After washing my hair with this for several days, I noticed my hair is softer and shiner.  In addition less hairs fall out in the morning when I put hair cream on it.  There is a whole debate on whether sulfates actually contribute to hair loss for men, and I honestly don&#x27;t know the answer.  While I do not have any hairloss my hair was falling out much more before I began using using sls free shampoo.  So my advice to men is eat a healthy diet and try sls free shampoo to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> I ve used this shampoo now for three times and I love it. I love that is cheap ( I paid around 5 bucks), and sulfate free. I think will be definitely be in my rotation of products</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product especially since it was sulfate free</li>
    <li> Meh....didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
    <li> This has a wierd smell and doesn&#x27;t actually clean my hair</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it on my sisterlocks and it adds pretty good moisture to my hair. Only thing is that since my hair is so long (middle of my back), I have to use a lot of it and it doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but I do like it.</li>
    <li> Several of my natural and relaxed friends raved about this shampoo. I was very skeptical about it working on my hair because the old CON shampoo use to make my loose natural hair very hard and straw like. I have locs now and was looking for a spray in leave-in conditioner to use daily on my locs.  While at the beauty supply store the sales clerk recommended that I try the CON argan oil leave-in conditioner. Since it was only $5 I decided to try it. It worked very well and made my locs soft. It also gave them a nice sheen and didn&#x27;t cause build up. Since the leave-in worked so well I decided to take a chance and try the shampoo.  While shampooing my hair I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product. I didn&#x27;t experience any of the good things that everyone raved about experiences while washing their hair with the shampoo. However, after shampooing my locs felt really soft and were very well moisturized. My locs were so well moisturized that I didn&#x27;t even need to apply oil to them after washing. The shampoo also made my locs very shinny. After washing my hair I applied the leave-in conditioner, although I really didn&#x27;t need to. I have to admit that I am very impressed with how soft and moisturized this shampoo made my hair. I can&#x27;t stop touching my locs because I can&#x27;t believe they are so soft and the shine is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how shinny my locs look. I highly recommend this shampoo for locs wearers! It works well and hasn&#x27;t caused any build up at all. CON moisture &amp; shine shampoo with argan oil and the leave-in conditioner are now my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo along with the Intensive Conditioning Treatment, the Leave-In Conditioner, and the oil itself (all by Creme of Nature). I like all of these products, but you have to use a lot of this shampoo in order for it to lather and I don&#x27;t like that. I normally (with other shampoos) use about the size of a quarter in the center of my palm, and it lathers fine, but not with this. I have found that I have to apply more, and more, and more before even the slightest bit of lather shows up, and my hair is not thick. Other than that, it smells good, and I feel as though my hair grows faster, and is healthier since I started using this line of products. The oil provides amazing results, and I would recommend it. Also, the leave-in conditioner is very light, and not at all sticky. It does not leave a film on the hair, but gives it a very shiny, healthy appearance.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo! It&#x27;s the BEST shampoo ever! I used to be a huge fan of the old Cr&amp;egrave;me of Nature with the green label and I was totally devastated when it got discontinued. It was the only shampoo that made my hair soft, silky, moisturized and completely detangled immediately after washing. This new argan oil shampoo does the exact same thing. No other shampoo does that, not even the high end expensive salon brands. I attribute my hair growth to this shampoo because it cuts down hair breakage by about 99% while washing. Like another reviewer mentioned, I too used to lose a ton of hair when washing. I dreaded hair wash days and now with this Cr&amp;egrave;me of Nature moisture and shine shampoo I lose very, very little to NO HAIR when I wash it. You can even get away with not using conditioner with this shampoo because it&#x27;s that great. As long as the company makes this shampoo I will NEVER buy another shampoo for as long as I live. I am soooo happy I tried it and I highly recommend you try it too!</li>
    <li> I have used many many shampoos and conditioners but cream of nature has always been my staple.  It detangles my 4b /4c curly hair the best.  I am currently 7 months into my transitioning journey and was determined to find a system  That both detangles and moisturizers my hair...well I have arrived.  All of the sulfate free shampoos I have used in the past have been extremely drying and seem to pull all the moisture out of my hair leaving a tangled mess with lots of hair lost in the combout process...not this one!  I was tangle free after shampoo rinse..I could tell.  I then used the conditioner..which I was a little afraid to use based on the reviews....but my hair loved this.  I no longer need to go to the beauty shop during my transitioning phase...this is very exciting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did do a preapplication of safflower oil before washing my hair today so maybe this helped but these three help to give me the moisture my hair needs and loves.  Try this and try safflower oil from your local grocer.  It won&#x27;t weigh your hair down..ads luster and leaves your hair with the lasting moisture and manageability it needs.  A small amount added to your ends will keep them in good health and keep that frizz away....totally inexpensive....all three...enjoy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product I was really excited to give it a try... and now I&#x27;m horribly disappointed. I had been using the L&#x27;Oreal line of sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners but decided to mix it up and try something new with this Creme of Nature Argan Oil shampoo and the conditioner that goes along with it. Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great... and leave my normally soft, tangle-free hair a straw-like, knotted mess. I used this shampoo and the conditioner four times before I gave up. I even tried using this shampoo with my L&#x27;Oreal leave in conditioner to see if maybe just the conditioner was the problem, but my hair was still straw. I have never had a shampoo do this to my hair! Absolutely horrible. I have straight and thick hair and this product just ruins it. One wash with my L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme and my hair looks and feels better already, although I can tell it&#x27;s going to take a while for my hair to recover from whatever this shampoo did to it. Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> My hair is natural so I was looking for a natural shampoo beside my mud wash. Let me just say I had a lot of product build up after having my hair in kinky twist for 8-weeks. This shampoo is GREAT! My hair felt soft not hay like. It smells good to!</li>
    <li> I have 5 daughters and myself.. 6 women with thick curly hair in one house so you can imagine I have bought and tried everything. This shampoo is like a miracle on dry, damaged hair, even weaved hair. It gently cleans and softens hair and smells wonderful. My hair is light and airy for days after washing, no fuzziness. Followed up with the intensive conditioner, your hair will feel and behave like silk. No tangles, damage-repair, thirst quencher for your hair. A must buy...I buy nothing else!!!</li>
    <li> Okay.  I have fine long hair.  I have LOTS of hair, but it&#x27;s extremely fine.  This shampoo, when I used it by itself, made me look like I&#x27;d been mucking about in a rain forest for a month without washing my hair....it made it greasy, in other words.  Horribly so.  But since I paid money for it, I thought I&#x27;d try a little trick.  I buy Renpure Originals Argan Oil Shampoo from my local supermarket.  It&#x27;s not too expensive and it does a fairly decent job with my hair.  So I was in the shower, and I put about 1 tablespoon of Renpure in my hand, and added this Crème of Nature to it...about 1/2 teaspoon right on top.  Just to try it.  Well, let me tell you, I put NOTHING else on my hair, no gel, no mousse, no spray, nothing.  After I dried it, I used my hair wand.  My hair has NEVER looked better in my life.  This may not work for everyone with fine hair, but this absolutely works for me.  I will be pairing these two shampoos together forever now.  My hair is full, thick, shiny and feels glorious.  It held the curls from my hair wand without any spray...it just looks natural!!  I&#x27;ve always had mousy-looking brown hair.  The last few days it has been beautiful.  I kid you not.  I actually had two people at work compliment me in the last two days.  I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with this product.  Maybe not the product by itself, but Repure doesn&#x27;t do this by itself either.  Mixing these two created a cocktail that I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with :)</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo through Amazon on October 2013.&lt;br /&gt;After getting it and trying it I began to see this thick yellow crust forming on my scalp. This problem caused by the shampoo (I never have problems trying different shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;I contacted amazon and they said I should contact the seller directly. I did, (CBS express is the name of the seller) and they responded that since the product was used and they don&#x27;t manufacture it, they would not return my money.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to see if a shampoo is good is to try it. It was missing less than an ounce of it.&lt;br /&gt;For me it is unexcusable. As a seller they have to respond to your clients and backup what you are selling.</li>
    <li> but i hated this. i have fine, wavy hair. like another reviewer says, it makes my hair feel strange and stiff. i feel like i can&#x27;t rinse it all the way out. i also didn&#x27;t realize until i bought it that it has two different parabens in it. my bf loves it (thick curly hair), but he usually uses dollar store shampoo so that&#x27;s not saying much.</li>
    <li> I found out that the ingredients in this product are not safe.  If you visit the [...] website, you can use their database to find out what the ingredients in your products mean or if they are carcinogenic or affect your hormones. Don&#x27;t use this product and send it back of you have it.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything for my fine hair. I have mixed it with other shampoos to diminish the oil factor which is a pain in the neck. I would not recommend this to people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for the first time today. I have caucasian curly hair that is relaxed and colored. I started noticing split ends and dryness about 4 months ago. I have tried several high-end shampoos, conditioners, deep conditioners, oil treatments, etc. with mixed results. This product was much more reasonably priced. My first impression was that I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Yuck! Also, because it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t lather like other shampoos. But I got past those issues and, when I rinsed the shampoo, it left a soft coating on my hair. I followed with the intensive conditioning treatment, which I used like a regular conditioner. I left it in for a few minutes and rinsed it out. (I have to say this smelled even worse than the shampoo! Gross!) I must say that I do notice a difference in the texture of my hair. When I dried it there was much less breakage and no frizz. I think this is a very good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but I&#x27;m not sure I can get past the smell. I just find it extremely unpleasant. I&#x27;d like to try the argan oil treatment, but I&#x27;m a little afraid that it might smell even worse than the shampoo and conditioner. Overall, I think this is a good product that does what it claims to do. If you can get past the smell, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results. I would have given it a higher rating if it smelled better.</li>
    <li> most hair products flake in my hair. This one does not.  I have dry, course hair and this is the first product that actually cleans and softens leaving my hair very manageable.  If I could afford a case at a time I would buy it. My friend washes her whole body with it and says it is fabulous as a body wash. This product deserves 50 stars!</li>
    <li> The smell is a tad funky but wow. It hydrated my dry thick wavy mop well. Made it soft and silky. Only thing is my hair is way too thick and I suspect it may thicken it even more. But if you want thicker hair maybe not an issue for you.</li>
    <li> After seeing all of the wonderful reviews, I just knew this shampoo would be even better than the last Cr&amp;egrave;me of Nature shampoo, especially with the addition of argan oil. Needless to say I was very excited to use it. Unfortunately my excitement ended in utter disappointment. I used this product once and then tossed it in the trash. I&#x27;m not sure why they changed the Cr&amp;egrave;me of Nature shampoo&#x27;s formula, but they need to change it back. The first thing that threw me off was the scent. It smelled like silicone-not a pleasant scent for a shampoo. I washed my hair with it, rinsed, and repeated, then dried it off and voila... my hair was like straw. The other Cr&amp;egrave;me of Nature formula used to leave my hair soft and manageable. Sorry, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo to anyone.</li>
    <li> Leave hair so soft and clean that conditioner isn&#x27;t needed. Works great in softening tight curls but still need conditioner if hair is really curly.</li>
    <li> I wish the price hadn&#x27;t gone up, it was only $6 per bottle when I first got it. You can find it for $5 at other sites online. I seriously love this shampoo. It lathers nice and leaves my hair soft. Strong enough to get it clean but mild enough to use daily. I really have nothing more I could as from a shampoo. Maybe it could smell better?</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft. I really like it. I guess I have been missing out by using other shampoos with sulfa products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing and definitely worth all the hype. I only relax my hair 2 times a year so detangling has always been a problem but this shampoo makes everything so much easier and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry after i use it</li>
    <li> I read all reviews and decided to buy this shampoo. The best thing about it is smell. But after using it for month I didn&#x27;t see much difference between now and what I had before!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! Every time I wash my hair, it leaves my hair very light and moisturized. I challenged myself to use this product every day for 4 days and it actually did not dry out my hair. In fact, my hair felt much healthier. I could run my fingers through my hair and just feel how soft and smooth it had become. Although this product has a great affect on my hair (fine hair-3b), it really did not have a soothing smell. It&#x27;s somewhat sharp. Therefore I just put the Super Gro with Vitamin E and contains coconut oil after i wash my hair; which i get from Walmart but you can probably get at any drugstore.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that has more volume than I want and this product helps tame my hair! I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner with how much this moisturizes my hair! Love this product.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and also makes the scalp feel refreshed but used for a month and did not see substantial difference in my hair as I did using Shea Moisture products :(</li>
    <li> Finally, I found the right shampoo for my hair!!!! My hair is permanently straightened but I also have an oily scalp. I tried to look for something that can reduce oil but also treat my hair. I&#x27;ve researched about so many shampoos and this seemed to have the best costumer reviews and also the most natural without chemicals or silicones. I&#x27;ve been using this for months but only recently I started to like it! The reason is I&#x27;ve been using this product wrong for a long time. Instead of completely rinsing off the shampoo, I let some stay because I liked the smooth, silky feeling. I realized that made my scalp oily and also damaged it a lot. After properly rinsing off the shampoo, I fell in love with it! My hair is smooth and undamaged, so easy and quick to dry with a dryer. I still have oily scalp but it doesn&#x27;t get noticeably oily until 24 hours later, so I am very happy with that. I HIGHLY recommend this product. My skin is also acne-prone but argan oil does not cause acne like some shampoo do, but remember to wash your face because any shampoo can still clog your pores. I really like this shampoo and I&#x27;m thinking of getting the conditioner version too :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because it featured on a famous magazine as the best shampoo. It not only didnt do anything for my wavy thick hair. IT left my hair suuuper dry- crunchy-breaky feeling it felt horrible i tried with another products And IT didnt go any better, i&#x27;ll throw this away with the leave in conditioner</li>
    <li> I hate the feeling on my hair after I used this shampoo ..it feels dry ..and I don&#x27;t like the smell hate ..DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and I love it! I am african american with relaxed hair. I flat iron my hair several times a week for that flowing bouncy hair look. This shampoo makes my hair so soft and manageable even before I use my conditioner. It moisturizes my hair so well and helps me to cut down on adding oil when blow drying and flat ironing. It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite a while now, and I got to say it is the  best hair care product I have ever used. I have relaxed hair and it makes it feel like butter! I use this product with its partner conditioner and it is the best thing ever. I love the fact that it contains no sulfate and leaves my hair feeling soft. I really recommend this product to anyone who wants soft hair!</li>
