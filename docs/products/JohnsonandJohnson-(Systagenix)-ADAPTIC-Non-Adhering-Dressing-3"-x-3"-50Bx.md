      <li>It keeps your wounds healing properly and have just the right amount of fabric to allow your skin to breathe and also is flexible while also being able to stay where it needs to.</li>
      <li>I never dress a wound without first covering it with Adaptic.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all it took to keep the wound from healing in the first place.</li>
      <li>I know I need to buy more in different sizes</li>
      <li>Exactly what my doctor used on my wound care.  </li>
      <li>I used to have a doctor apply a much better version of the same thing and theirs fell off the second the wrap was no longer touching it.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what my doctor had in his office.</li>
      <li>I will not be using this product in the future as it stuck to the wound and caused me more pain than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>pretty much goof-proof..</li>
      <li>easy to open apply remove</li>

      <li>was amazed at the fast delivery.</li>
      <li>A sterile environment is an absolute necessity.</li>
      <li>I have incredibility sensitive skin and react badly to most dressings and adhesives but this works very well, as does the similar [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Allow moist sterile environment which allows wounds to stay clean and heal from the inside out  without sticking to the open wound.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Best price but too bad</li>
      <li>Generally, an adaptic is used as a primary dressing to reduce adherence to the wound bed (especially after application of ointments/gels).</li>
      <li>The skin on my shins heals, but takes longer than normal.</li>
      <li>When I change the dressings normal gauze rips the scab off.</li>
      <li>Early delivery!</li>
      <li>Healing time seems to be shortened and removing the bandages is nearly painless!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, wound problems.</li>
      <li>Exceptional production, healing aid for difficult wounds.</li>
      <li>Not only does it keep the would from sticking to the bandages, but it clears old tissue away from the new healing area.  </li>
      <li>Recently started using as a contact layer on a Pt with a large, difficult, facial funagting wound after trying numerous \\&quot;contact layer\\&quot; brands, without good results.</li>
      <li>Just be careful disinfecting scissors and using a pair only for first aid purposes.  </li>
      <li>Wound doctors i&#x27;ve experienced seem to be sadists, using an obsolete, painful &amp;#34;wet to dry dressing&amp;#34;.  </li>

    <li> This is an excellent product compared to Curid, provided by the doctor.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Adaptic!  If you are in a family that commonly experiences cuts and abrasions, this stuff is perfect!  Just cut to size and put over the wound before applying gauze or bandage.  Healing time seems to be shortened and removing the bandages is nearly painless!</li>
    <li> Use this product when healing a wound; it works better than cloth dressings, and wound heals faster!</li>
    <li> Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This product could not be found at the pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and is the product the wound care clinic advised us to get.</li>
    <li> Good stuff !  Others have said that they&#x27;ve had these stick to the wound, but I use these on almost a daily basis and have never experienced that problem.  Maybe I&#x27;ve just had better luck than others,, but I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and xould not find locally in our small town.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I was recommended these by my surgeon after having a breast reconstruction surgery.  They are the perfect size, very comfortable and love the way they feel. It keeps your wounds healing properly and have just the right amount of fabric to allow your skin to breathe and also is flexible while also being able to stay where it needs to. I will always have a stock of these in hand at my house!  They are hard to find in stores, and the ease of online ordering and speed of delivery was perfect. I have nothing bad to say at all, except now I know I need to buy more in different sizes</li>
    <li> Best price but too bad I had to buy more than I needed</li>
    <li> these dressing will not stick to the skin..My mother is 97 and she has thin skin so  I keep these dressing on hand when she falls or tears her skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years on severe, slow-healing, lower leg open wounds.  I use gauze over it and nothing else to allow some air to the wound because these wounds drain quite a bit.  Also, I have poor lower-leg circulation, so I try to keep the leg elevated.  Swelling is bad for healing I learned at the wound clinic.  I highly recommend Adaptic dressings.  Amazon&#x27;s price is good, too. I cut the dressing to the size I need, close the package, and put it in a zip lock bag.  Just be careful disinfecting scissors and using a pair only for first aid purposes.  A sterile environment is an absolute necessity.</li>
    <li> A family member recently had to undergo a partial amputation and had a somewhat \\&quot;open\\&quot; wound while going through the healing process.  Our surgeon recommended using adaptic bandages so they wouldn&#x27;t stick and cause pain during bandage changes.  When we couldn&#x27;t find them locally, we found them through this Amazon vendor.  The bandages arrived quickly and just as described.  Even though I changed the order before shipping, everything went very smoothly.</li>
    <li> it work very good for me</li>
    <li> These are really super non-stick bandages.  I use them under a gauze pad to keep the gauze from adhering to the wound and pulling the healing skin away when it is removed.</li>
    <li> My wound care provider uses these as mesh barrier layer on my hard to heal skin ulcers and I have been very pleased with how well they protect my wound without causing skin irritation. I have incredibility sensitive skin and react badly to most dressings and adhesives but this works very well, as does the similar [[ASIN:B000ITGJ9E Mepitel. Quantity: Box of 10, Size: 3\\&quot; x 4\\&quot; (7.5 x 10cm)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have made a significant difference in my wound care treatment, and I am thankful that my insurance covers them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what my doctor had in his office. I couldn&#x27;t find the product in any of our local pharmacies or Walgreens stores so I had to purchase it online. Product works as described and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> If you have a deep wound to heal, using Adaptic is a MUST.  Not only does it keep the would from sticking to the bandages, but it clears old tissue away from the new healing area.  My doctor recommended these several years ago and my husband and I have kept them on hand every since.  One day our grandson burned his leg on the motorcycle and I bandaged it with an Adaptic pad and gauze and gave extras to take home.  My grandson could not believe how fast his leg healed.  A fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have sensitive skin, wound problems. I never dress a wound without first covering it with Adaptic.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a caregiver for my elderly grandparents (both over age 90), and I&#x27;ve found that these are an excellent companion to the regimen we previously had for wound care.  As with all elderly patients, my grandparents&#x27; skin is tissue thin, and with skin tears, even the non-stick pads can dry up and stick after a few days.  Using these dressings before applying the non-stick pads allows the wound to begin healing without any pooling, and the non-stick pads won&#x27;t dry out and stick to their wounds during changing.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> It was just what I was looking for. My mother has open wounds on her leg. If I put just gauze the gauze would stick to her open wound and peel skin off. But with this it helped her heal and no sticking of the gauze. The price was great too.</li>
    <li> These pads are a good size and are also easy to cut if a smaller size is needed.  They stay on the skin and always come off easily.</li>
    <li> It did adhere to the wound, ever so slightly. That&#x27;s all it took to keep the wound from healing in the first place. I will not be using this product in the future as it stuck to the wound and caused me more pain than I thought it would. If it was truly non-adhering, it would have fallen off the second the wrap came off. I used to have a doctor apply a much better version of the same thing and theirs fell off the second the wrap was no longer touching it.</li>
    <li> They are as described and arrives as promised.</li>
    <li> Being diabetic I tend to bleed then not heal immediately, and I am allergic to most adhering bandages. I use adaptic dressing w/gauze squares, then use tube dressing on my arms &amp; legs. No stick on my wounds, no rash from bandages.</li>
    <li> When in Baltimore recovering from surgery with a severe open leg wound the doctors ordered Adaptic under dressing.  I remembered  the healing speed and wound comfort was amazing so when  we were trying once again to heal severe leg wounds I search for them and found and ordered.  I found similar but prefer only Johnson &amp; Johnson!</li>
    <li> does not stick!  easy to open apply remove</li>
    <li> It was exacty what I ordered.  Pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to find in the stores. It was recommended by my surgeon to keep the incision areas on my foot from getting too dried out. They are individually wrapped and are easy to use. They did the job needed. The compnay got them to me very quickly which was even nicer.</li>
    <li> They are perfect for my particular problem.  Work Great!</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding these in a pharmacy in my area and only one medical supply house had them in stock. Too expensive there so I looked to the internet.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Early delivery! Kudos!</li>
    <li> THERE TODAY!! DR. GAVE HER A COUPLE OF THESE AND SHE LIKED SO WE HAVE NOW!! FAST-FAST-SERVICE A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I bought this dressing after foot surgery so I could change my bandages myself between doctor&#x27;s visits.  Before I had Adaptic, I had to worry about the gauze sticking to the surgery site.  That&#x27;s tragic when an incision is fresh, painful,  and has stitches.  After I bought Adaptic, dressing changes were really easy.  This product really doesn&#x27;t stick to the wound.  This is a must-have.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> These wound dressings are excellent for tending to wounds that cannot have anything stick to them . . . they work well and assist in healing injuries. I recommend them to care-givers for seniors.  They work well for deep gashes or deep scrapes that need several weeks to heal.</li>
    <li> Non stick Adaptic works fine  used under a  gauze dressing , saves wrecking the skin and tissue, thank you, MB</li>
    <li> Easy to apply to or to remove from  a wound. pretty much goof-proof.. When removing it from a wound, it doesn&#x27;t peel off the thin layer of granulation tisue.</li>
    <li> Adaptic is the most wonderful bandage ever.  It does not stick to the wound, stays in place and has a healing power all its own.  You can cut it to any size or shape.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for wound care.</li>
    <li> It stuck to my wounds.  Very  messy.  Not good for lower extremities.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for a shin laceration.</li>
    <li> Exceptional production, healing aid for difficult wounds. Allow moist sterile environment which allows wounds to stay clean and heal from the inside out  without sticking to the open wound.</li>
    <li> I love adaptic dressings. Use them regularly, for all different types of wounds. Recently started using as a contact layer on a Pt with a large, difficult, facial funagting wound after trying numerous \\&quot;contact layer\\&quot; brands, without good results. Generally, an adaptic is used as a primary dressing to reduce adherence to the wound bed (especially after application of ointments/gels). It&#x27;s definitely one of my top 3 all time favorite products to use in wound care. The price is very reasonable, which also makes it one of my favorites!!!</li>
    <li> What can you say about a bandage.  I needed it and found it on Amazon.... the story of my life!</li>
    <li> Perfect protection between hubby&#x27;s wound and the gauze pad. It does indeed prevent sticking, keeps the wound care creams/gels in place, and stop them from soaking through into the nonstick gauze pad (which, although nonstick, will stick to wounds, just not as much as regular gauze).</li>
    <li> Had a few open sours on my legs, and was being treated at a wound care center, needed these but they cost a lot at the Drug Store.  Save money at AMAZON as I need to buy several packs before I was healded.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my wounds to start healing, this allows excess fluid to drain not letting the protective gauze to stick.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my doctor used on my wound care.  Took a lot longer to receive in mail than expected, especially for a medical related product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It seems to be the only one that I am not allergic too.  My wound specialist only uses it on me.  I have chronic slow healing wounds.  I am not diabetic.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> If you have stasis dermetitus this wound dressing is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I have this non curable disease of the skin. From time to time,&lt;br /&gt;I get water blisters in the affected area, when these blisters break&lt;br /&gt;and transform into sores; I use these dressings to get myself&lt;br /&gt;healed up.  I just have not found anything that does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I whole-heartedly recommend these dressings.  Get healed now, get&lt;br /&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson ADAPTIC non-adherring dressings!</li>
    <li> Wound doctors i&#x27;ve experienced seem to be sadists, using an obsolete, painful &amp;#34;wet to dry dressing&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve not found anu evidence that this pain serves any purpose.  Use adaptic with an antibiotic ointment and the wound will heal fster and with LOTS less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl</li>
    <li> Works well and many at a good price.</li>
    <li> The skin on my shins heals, but takes longer than normal. When I change the dressings normal gauze rips the scab off. This product allows me to change the dressing, apply antibiotic and put a clean dressing on without disturbing the surface of the wound. Great!</li>
    <li> GREAT product. keeps the ban age from sticking to the wound and really speeds up healing on my husband&#x27;s many sores --he&#x27;s diabetic.</li>
    <li> My husband has ongoing wound issues and these work better than Kendall or Telfa as the wound can breathe while it heals</li>
    <li> great price for a great item</li>
    <li> Yes excellent product.  Protects seals  and cures  when used properly.</li>
