    <li> Good. Arrived promptly</li>
    <li> This is a tough product to review, because the results are so subtle. I first found this product at Sephora over a year ago and purchased it there, but have been purchasing through Amazon ever since due to the lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to tell exactly how effective these are until I run out. I have been using them for about 15 months now. Midway through that time period, I stopped using them because I wasn&#x27;t sure that they were producing any results. About a month later, I noticed my hair and nails becoming more brittle, so I started taking them again. I don&#x27;t buy many products or supplements so these seem a little pricey, but I justify them by breaking the cost out on a per day basis. Then it doesn&#x27;t seem so bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a much more visible difference in my nails than in my hair. My nails used to peel and break fairly frequently. Now, those instances are very rare. I don&#x27;t even paint them much anymore because they look so healthy and shiny on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase and take these until I can no longer justify it financially.</li>
    <li> These pills are amazing. Hair grows faster and healthier fast!! Love them</li>
    <li> How did this happen? I&#x27;m getting older and with menopause comes thinning hair. YIKES!!! But with these smile nets my hair seems stronger and silkier</li>
    <li> This pack really works if you are diligent and use them twice a day.  I take one in the morning and one in the evening.  It does take time to see the difference, but after nearly a year, my nails and especially my hair show a visible and tactile improvement.  The other brand I suggest was developed by Dr Frank Lipman. Both brands are expensive, but if you shop Amazon you&#x27;ll probably snag the best prices out there.</li>
    <li> Not only does this work well on getting my nails to grow, but this packaging type are a great deal!</li>
    <li> Within 2 months of taking these vitamins my hair was growing back.  Have been using these vitamins for two years with great success.  Recently, I switched to an over-the-counter brand and within a month I was again losing my hair.  I have restarted the Phytophanere! Duh!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for stopping hair loss and also helped it get stronger. My nails stopped splitting too.</li>
    <li> I;have been taking this pills for a month no progress.My hair still falling out a lot this ,i will try another 4 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pills for about 9 months.  My hair is much stronger &amp; fuller.  My stylist noticed new hair growth.  I recommend this suppliment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandy</li>
    <li> I cut my hair shoulder length ( biggest mistake of my life) and my hair would not grow for two years maybe an inch but that&#x27;s it. My friend told me about these pills and I bought them at sephora for $50 just for one bottle. I ended up going through 3 bottles and my hair grew soooo much! My nails stopped chipping so easily too. These really do work. If your Like me and need to have long hair then you need these pills. I&#x27;m still taking them and I love them! I&#x27;ve also tried biotin since it was cheaper but they didn&#x27;t work for me. I started buying them on amazon since they&#x27;re half the price</li>
    <li> help me with the alopecia problem.</li>
    <li> This product is excelent but I don&#x27;t have time to  see The results! The treatment during  some months and I&#x27;m waiting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin for about 8 years, it&#x27;s helped my hair and nails a lot&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I no longer can find it on amazon :(</li>
    <li> It took a while to see results but I did see them, Be patient.</li>
    <li> Began seeing improvement in a week.  I have used this product for many years--just forgot to reorder last time and amount of hair loss I experienced reminded me to buy again immediately.</li>
    <li> These supplements will provide the boost your dull hair and brittle nails may need in times of stress.</li>
    <li> I just started this product about 2 weeks ago. I cannot give an accurate review until a full month of use. However, i must state i am pleased with the supply and the shipping. I was recommended to purchase this product through a coworker. She has experienced great results; retained luster, growth, and aiding to psoriasis. I will try to remember to repost my personal experience. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple hair vitamins and I have yet to notice a difference with any.</li>
    <li> For Hair Growth:&lt;br /&gt;PHYTO PHYTOPHANÈRE Hair and Nails Dietary.  (I take this for 4 months then switch to Viviscal)&lt;br /&gt;Viviscal Professional (I take this for 4 months and then switch back to phytophanere)&lt;br /&gt;Reserveage Vegetarian Capsules, Collagen Booster. (I continually take)&lt;br /&gt;I can really say this has worked for me for hair growth by taking these supplement. My hair is thicker and longer.  New hair growth is coming out. My little bald spot which was huge to me is starting to fill in!  I only wish I would of thought of taking a photo of the darn thing to show proof to everyone! I am on medications and I am very nervous person who was stressed out to the max!  I just want to help other people with the same problem!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed hair growth after 4 months.  I didn’t want to pay attention or look or worry until then.  I grabbed my hair with my hand from the top of head and kind of softly yanked at it.  To my surprise, I felt my hair was fuller. I could see new hair growth on the sides and in the front on top.  I turned around and positioned the mirrors to look at my bald spot, it was difficult to truly see.  The area surrounding the spot looked thicker.  This was the 4th month mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an article, a lady would use both Phyto and Viviscal switching them every couple of months.  I decided to follow her regimen since August 2014.  Now it is June 2015.  I finally recommended this routine to my family members this past week b/c I didn’t want them to spend the $ if it didn’t work.  Especially since 1. has alopecia: sister-in-law and 2. genetics/hereditary: uncle &amp; aunt who are my family.  3. my uncle’s wife.&lt;br /&gt;I will be following their progress with PHYTO first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I took:&lt;br /&gt;Phytocyane Revitalizing Serum for Hair Loss&lt;br /&gt;but I had a hard time cracking the glass vials.  I am most certain it would have helped even more though twice I cut myself on them and bled profusely from my thumb.  I whole heartedly believe in thePHYTO products for hair growth!  If you know how to break the vials properly w/out cutting my thumbs, please send me notice.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to see results, but I thing it is a very good product for the hair, I´m taking it because I was very stressed and loosing lots of hair.</li>
    <li> SO FAR SO GOOD. TAKING 2@ DAY. DONT TASTE BAD OR REPEAT ON YOU. SMELL LIKE CHOCOLATE. I HAVE NAILS, HOPE ITS WORKING FOR HAIR TOO</li>
    <li> This takes several months to take effect, but it really does work.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to speed up hair growth - it has been 3 months and I have not seen any noticeable results.  But, it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting anything (except maybe my wallet)</li>
