    <li> The Biotone Dual-Purpose Massage Creme is the absolute best on the market.  Also, the company that sold it, Institute for Therapeutic Massage, and it&#x27;s director from Massage Education Source, is tops in customer service.  You will NOT be disappointed by their products, knowledge or service.  If you are a professional or just love the great health benefits of massage these are your products and people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently a massage therapy student and received a sample of this from school.  I&#x27;m hooked.  This is my go-to creme when I give massages during my clinical internship.  I hardly use massage oils anymore.  Texture is very light and you don&#x27;t even need to apply a whole lot.  Great with drag and gliding.  I highly recommend this creme.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on a suggestion from a massage therapist.  It is great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy but it lasts forever.  Pleasantly surprised by the product.</li>
    <li> I love Biotone Massage Cream because it is so very creamy and smooth.  I have used many Massage creams but Biotone is the one that is the most moisturizing.  Biotone Massage Cream allow me to massage my aching joints without reapplying, because with one application the more I massage the more it continue to moisture without getting dry and most of all it is not greases.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotone Duel purpose cream for more than a decade. This lotion is by far my favorite product for massage. I have been a professional therapist for 23 years and this is the only product I use for giving massages.</li>
    <li> I love this creme! It makes me feel silky, smooth, and hydrated. A little goes a long way, which makes it very economical.</li>
    <li> My massage therapist introduced me to this cream. After it melts into a liquid on your skin, it is very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;We love it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent massage cream. It goes on easy and facilitates a good even massage stroke. The fragrance is mild and just about right.</li>
    <li> BioTone is the best massage cream. I love this product and so do my clients and will use no other.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist for over 20 yrs and have used different products but the dual purpose creme is my favorite. It has herbs that help with tight muscles and it gives a nice glide.  My clients loved it too.</li>
    <li> Tub was cracked. Container had been opened. Massage cream had leaked inside of box. I did not get my moneys worth. I will not be buying anything else from this seller.</li>
    <li> as a massage therapist this is my crème of choice has good texture &amp; flows easily on the client not greasy</li>
    <li> Easy to use and only requires a very small amount. No overbearing smell and not sticky. My clients love the way it makes their skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is the best !  Is very comfortable on the skin not sticky or oily!  Highly recommend this product and is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My massage therapist used this product on me to relieve some soreness in my muscles from physical activity, and most importantly the skin condition on my torso.  The arnica and ivy mix in this massage creme really did wonders calming my specific aches from physical exercise, and my skin inflammation caused by an auto immune disorder.  I use it every night on my torso.</li>
    <li> Awesome creme . Works wonders after surgery!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on schedule</li>
    <li> Great lotion that I can&#x27;t find locally. I&#x27;ll have to see if I like the larger size. Like the arnica in it.</li>
    <li> This massage creme is fabulous.  It has a long &amp;#34;work time&amp;#34;, is not greasy, and just an overall great creme.  It was recommended to me by my massage therapist and so thankful she did.  Definitely worth the price - you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or leave your skin feeling all greased up. It helps to really get into the sore muscles without using a lot of pressure because your fingers just slide over the skin. On a side note: due to headache allergies,  I am unable to be around many aromas. This product has a nice subtle smell.</li>
    <li> tis is a great size to use at home for personal use I only have a few clients on the side so it will last a long time I use this at work and I will never change cream I have tried a few but this cream is the best by far.</li>

    <li> This product is awesome!  I had a total knee replacement and my physical therapist used this creme for my deep tissue massage.  I felt so good after my PT that I decided to see if I could purchase it for myself.  I use this cream on my scar and knee every day at least 20 or more times a day.
