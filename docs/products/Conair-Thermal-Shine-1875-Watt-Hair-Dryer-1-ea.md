      <li>It dries my hair fairly quickly (I have naturally curly, mid-length hair), the heat settings IMO are perfect and not &amp;</li>
      <li>I love this blow dryer and that it came with three attachments (I don&#x27;t know which I like best), that it is light weight, has a sufficient length cord, dries my hair quickly, isn&#x27;t overly loud, and most of all that I can SEE that my hair is in better condition.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this blow dryer.  Hair so much easier to manage with this dryer than my old that just got &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have no problems with this dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for myself.  It is a great blow dryer for the price.  Love the different attachments .  Also, cool setting is nice because I dont have to hold the button down.</li>
    <li> So after my beloved blowdryer of 9 years took a dump, I was forced to try a new blowdryer. I was less then thrilled about this because in the past 9 years, I had tried using a few blowdryers and all of them were returned the following day after using. I have very thick, somewhat wavey hair and nothing besides my aged blowdryer had seemed to dry my hair in a decent amount of time. After my old faithful started burning my hands, I had no choice but to venture out and find something new. I bought this conair blowdryer last night and honestly, I wasnt looking forward to drying my hair this morning but let me tell you... I am SOOOO happy about purchasing this dryer. I used the \\&quot;straightner\\&quot; attachment this morning and it works wonders! Although it didnt leave it straighter iron straight, it left it smooth enough to not need the straightner, not to mention it dried my hair in record time and the different heat settings are awesome! I paid $19.00 for it at Walmart and this was such a bargain purchase. Im VERY happy with my hairs texture after using this and im excited to try the other attachments.</li>
    <li> I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use.  From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak.  After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.    Do not buy this model.</li>
    <li> Works great and is not too heavy. I like all the setting choices that all me not to fry my hair when it is cut short.</li>
    <li> Works just fine.  I wish I had ordered a \\&quot;cord-keeper\\&quot; blow dryer, but that&#x27;s my fault.    In terms of the color, it is white and black and not silver.  At least mine was.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Light and powerful. It is like the proffesional dryers used at beauty hair saloons.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer with perfect accessories! I love the different heat settings available, too! The new straightening attachment is okay, not the greatest, but it still works! I love the diffuser the most. I have a ton of volume, plus, my natural curls turn out even better than by letting them just air dry! Very good purchase!</li>
    <li> Nothing to get excited about. It works well and I like the cool temperature setting.  The cord is much shorter than the hair dryer I had to replace.</li>
    <li> works great,  I love it... the buttons are a bet hard at times , mostly bc my old hands dont work as well as, they used to... but I would recommend and buy again.  great price, and quality.... does a great job</li>
    <li> My old conair just pooped out on my and I loved it! So I took to amazon and researched all the conairs I could find and this one was the best I felt like, and I was right! My hair is thick, frizzy and kinky and this one dried it super fast and also made it feel soft afterward. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my mom and some friends (:</li>
    <li> My wife as been very happy with the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 1875 Shine Styler hair dryer because my 17 year old Conair 1600 started to throw blue sparks when I changed the settings. I really like the controls on the 1875 because they are comfortable while gripping the hair dryer and they are easy to use. I held a lot of hair dryers in stores and found this one to be light weight and comfortable to hold. The price was right too. $19.99. I&#x27;m a guy who just needs a hair dyer to dry my hair every once in a while. My hair is only a few inches long. The 1875 Watt Thermal Shine Styler does the job.</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful hairdryer!  I didn&#x27;t realize how wimpy my old one was until I used this ConAir one. I have only used the flat attachment. It works very good for flat straight hair.</li>
    <li> My 10 year-old Conair just died so I bought this model.  So far it has been perfect.  The airflow is great.  I love the temperature settings with the cool shot.  I mainly use the straightening attachment which is perfect.  This works just as well as the $150 ones at the salon.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the ceramic disk/ion feature, that it would actually reduce the static electricity, fly-aways &amp; frizzies and make my hair shinier and more manageable.  How could a thing that blows air do all that?   I knew I needed to look for something new though because after using my old blow dryer, my medium thick, wavy, frizzy fly-away hair was not presenting itself in a pretty way but just looking worse and worse.  Any grade of shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to make a big difference overall.    It got to be where I just dreaded the task of doing my hair.    After using this Conair dryer one time, my crown of glory was good enough to go as-is if I didn&#x27;t have time to use the flat iron.  This is a 100% improvement over my old-no-special-features blow dryer which has been retired to probably dry pets and mittens and boots or whatever.  Now after using this Conair almost daily for about a month, I wish I had learned about the technology way sooner and saved myself a lot of angst over how to tame my hair.   I love this blow dryer and that it came with three attachments (I don&#x27;t know which I like best), that it is light weight, has a sufficient length cord, dries my hair quickly, isn&#x27;t overly loud, and most of all that I can SEE that my hair is in better condition.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Would recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I had same product before they changed the switches.  New switches are hard to adjust.  Other than that, it dries well.</li>
    <li> Works well. I have thin hair and it dries it quickly but I have body!</li>
    <li> I grew up using a crappy blowdryer that my mom originally bought for our cat. I have straight hair so I never really blowdry except when I need to tie my hair up in a neat bun (for work). I bought this on sale for $10 at Target and it exceeded my expectations! It&#x27;s really powerful and exactly like the ones in 5-star hotels. I love that it has cold, warm and hot settings. It came with that round attachment which I&#x27;ve never used. The little booklet in the box shows a hair straightening attachment which was not included in mine. I don&#x27;t really need it so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I highly recommend this product. It is a little big but not heavy.</li>
    <li> Works ok but larger than expected. Blower is not very powerful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ConAir Infiniti Pro for over 10 years, still works perfectly fine. Recently, I decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom, and bought Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler. This new unit died on Day 1, I returned it and bought a new Conair Infiniti Pro again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of the saying: \\&quot;Buy expensive, cry once. Buy cheap, cry every day\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this so far.  It&#x27;s very light, and I love that it has three heat (one being no heat) settings and two speed settings, which is more than most dryers have.  The airflow is pretty strong on the high setting.  The setting labels are already wearing off though, after only a few months of regular use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing a non-professional hair dryer, but due to financial issues at the time, I had to opt for a non-professional hair dryer. I have to say I made an excellent choice! I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this hairdryer by Conair. It dries my hair fairly quickly (I have naturally curly, mid-length hair), the heat settings IMO are perfect and not &amp;#34;too hot&amp;#34; like some other inexpensive brands so I don&#x27;t need to worry about burning my hair, and I love the &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34; feature to lock in my style. The ionic conditioning really does work! My curly, hard to manage hair feels extremely silky after drying with this hairdryer. I do use the concentrator attachment during my blow-out and it works really well. I used to have to use my straightener after drying my hair...but since using this dryer I only need to use it to touch up, which is wonderful! This dryer also comes with a diffuser attachment. It is lightweight and easy to handle, and I find that the cord length is perfect. Overall I gave a 5 star rating...performance is excellent and works beyond my expectations. Also brownie points for the purple color!!!! Purchased here on Amazon for $19.00 and it is well worth the money and more!</li>
    <li> the item was black and white rather than black and silver. otherwise it works and includes all the attachments. nothing else I can think of...</li>
    <li> Awesome in perfect condition the box was a little beat up but the product is fantastic</li>
    <li> I bought one of these several years ago and it still held up.  I purchased this second one to keep in our vacation home.  Unlike other hair dryers, this one has a little door to the filter which allows you to easily open it, giving easy access to the filter so that you can clean it.  Door easily opens and closes shut.  The one I have is white and black, but I like the idea of having a purple one too.</li>
    <li> the blow dryer delivered to me was white and black...it was not the silver/black that I ordered but it does dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I have always had excellent luck with Conair hair dryers.  My previous one lasted over five years!  I have been using this one for a week so far and I love it.  It is lightweight and dries your hair quickly (without making you feel like you are going through a wind tunnel).  It is a little smaller than my old dryer, so it would also be useful for travel.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t use it. couldn&#x27;t sell it. wattage not compatible for use here</li>
    <li> works great and dries hair fast.  only complaint is the cord is not long enough for me to plug in my cabinet</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair and drying my hair is a chore to say the least. When my old Revlon dryer finally hit the crapper, I bought this at my local CVS. This dryer works like a charm and dries my hair lightning quick. The attachments works well and I love how you don&#x27;t have to hold down a button to get cool air. I just wish it had a longer cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you&#x27;re thinking of getting this, buy it on here! CVS and the other drugstores overcharge; I paid almost $40 for this at CVS. That&#x27;s the only thing I regret about the purchase, hehe!</li>
    <li> Good but this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t have the same power as my old one!!</li>
    <li> Work wonderful for the price</li>
    <li> This is a great, lightweight hair dryer. I have very thick Hirt hair and this dryer dries it quickly and nicely.</li>
    <li> I dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long. This little beauty does its job, and does it well. There are plenty of settings and options to choose from, depending on what you want and what is best for your hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been several months now, and I still use this product almost every day, and it still works great. This is easily the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased - strong, fast, and definitely good quality!</li>
    <li> The Conair 1875 hairdryer is an excellent hair dryer in my experience. I like that it has three heat settings, hot, medium, and cool, as well as a high and low setting. It also has a cool shot feature when you want to define a curl. I’ve had mine for over a year now and finally bought another one for when company comes. Everyone remarks about how nice a hair dryer it is. The controls are in a helpful place, easily accessible but not too easy to push accidentally. I’d like to add that it’s a relatively quiet hairdryer too. It’s also easy to pop the back piece off to clean the lint off the mesh and keep the hairdryer in good working order! Is a plus that I particularly like the pretty shade of purple! It’s a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these selling for a lot more so I ordered on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice dryer, dries hair quickly. Different heat settings and the cool shot button works, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High or low blow speeds. It&#x27;s a good blow dryer. Easy to clean, too, which is important.</li>
    <li> Best dryer I have had</li>
    <li> Worked fantastic and dried my hair so fast and nice but one day less than a year later it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer. It&#x27;s a little heavier than my old hair dryer but it has more features that I really like. I have very short hair that dries quickly and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in drying time. I really like that it truly has several drying options. The heat and the blower volume are truly separate so you can use cool, warm or hot heat with low or high blower volumes. And I love the cool temperature option! My head sweats a lot and it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to blast my head with a cool high volume blast of air. It&#x27;s really cool, not cold, but not warm either.</li>
    <li> I have always used Conair hair dryers but I am not fond of this one at all. Sub-par for their usual quality.</li>
    <li> Dryer works great and is light to handle.</li>
    <li> Can dry and style my coarse hair quickly especially with the special straightener attachment without too much fuss and effort</li>
    <li> This is a great little dryer.  I love that its not too big or heavy.  It is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> There is not much I require of a hair dryer, just one that dries hair quickly and has options for heat and airflow level.  I&#x27;m not sure the high priced hairdryers actually perform any better than this one which costs less than $20.  Great buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice blow dryer.  Comes with a comb too, which is what i needed.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement dryer.  This does the job. It&#x27;s super light, and cute looking.  At first I didn&#x27;t think I would like it because it seemed really lacking in power.  However, it dries hair EXTREMELY quickly, so the lack of power isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> Product is not the color described. Supposed to be black and white but is actually purple. Not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> This item is hard to hold, and the writing that says what each button is wears off...I mean TOTALLY off</li>
    <li> This dryer no longer includes the straightener attachment as pictured and referred to by previous customers.  It is also black and white.  I got one that had item number 121PR, returned it, and got the same thing with the item number 121PX.  Be aware this item is not as shown.  I did not try it because it was wrong.</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought one for a gift and one for myself! Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t get to hot, and lightweight!</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair 1875 for the easily cleanable screen, but it hasn&#x27;t caught lint in the 6+ months I&#x27;ve owned it.  While I never use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; speed setting, I often switch from hot to warm to cool.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. I bought it as a replacement after my second Revlon dryer bit the dust. I use it on the Low/Warm setting and it&#x27;s just perfect for my hair type (thin/damaged hair), not too hot, but not too cold. Dries my hair super fast too, literally under 5 minutes and done. My other 2 hair dryers hardly put out any heat on the medium settings and took forever to dry my hair. Very happy with this since again, my hair is already damaged from heat.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the comb attachment it came with too. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this before. After your hair is dry/almost dry, if you put the dryer on the low/hot with the attachment on, it really helps with straightening your hair and pretty much eliminates the need for a flat iron, another huge plus. It comes with a concentrator attachment too, but I don&#x27;t use that.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very lightweight, quiet,  the cord is short so you&#x27;re not tripping all over it, but there&#x27;s still enough length to work with without pulling it out of the wall.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great little hair dryer over all for a small price.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before buying this hair dryer and all the reviews are accurate. This blow dryer dries my hair in a little amount of time and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair brittle and dry. Love the purple color too. I tried using the attachment that is shown in the picture, but I prefer using it without the attachment. I haven&#x27;t tried the other hair lifter attachment yet. Overall, I like it and it&#x27;s better than the previous dryer I had.</li>
    <li> I ordered this back in 2011 and well just now getting around to reviewing it. Well it&#x27;s still working to this day without any problems in these past years. Now the one I receive was white but I just wanted a good hair dryer and this is definitely one. It gets the job done and usually I don&#x27;t even have to put it on the highest heat.</li>
    <li> I have a previous conair blow dryer and it works great. it has so much power. The only reason why I purchased a second one is because I wanted a concentrator nozzle which mine did not have and i never found one wide enough to fit my dryer. So that is why I gave it a low rating.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair very fast, light and easy to maneuver</li>
    <li> This is much lighter than the older model I had and love the different speeds and power.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer makes my hair look fabulous! I didn&#x27;t think that it would make much difference, but it did!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the one I&#x27;m keeping after returning two others to Walmart.  It has three heat settings, and the hot is actually hot.  It&#x27;s lighter than other dryers too.  It&#x27;s my favorite because it&#x27;s significantly quieter than the others I tried.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is quieter than most and works great. I owned three, but that was the problem. I purchased it three times because I loved it so much. However, each hairdryer lasted less than a year, and I used it probably four times per week. I was very disappointed in what seemed to be a great hairdryer of poor quality in that was unable to last. Sad to have to switch to something more reliable!</li>
    <li> Light weight, relatively quiet, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for something that had some heat options and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;It actually dries my super thick long hair quicker than my last one.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an average blow dryer I use it every day and haven&#x27;t had any issues, if you&#x27;re looking for a simple everyday blow dryer this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Seems to work okay. I haven&#x27;t really had the chance to try it out yet. I pulled it out of the box and tested it, so for now its okay. The hair dryer and attachments are much smaller than I imagined. Its a normal size hair dryer, however I&#x27;m used to a much bigger one by Revlon. Hopefully this one matches up well to the standards of the Revlon products. I figured I couldn&#x27;t beat the price....</li>
    <li> My Conair dryer died after 20 years of faithful service. After much thought, I bought this as a replacement. I am very happy with the way it works. I have thick, wavy hair and this tames it beautifully and dries my hair completely in no time at all. Love the purple color too.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after some research. It is extremely light, not very noisy, and the buttons are in the right place. The cord is a little short (about 62 inches) but for a tiny New York bathroom with an electrical outlet at a waist level it is actually perfect. However, I can see how it can be trouble if your electrical outlets are low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell if the ionic feature does what is supposed to do because I had not owned a hair dryer before this one for a long time so I can&#x27;t compare. I have very thick just-below-the-shoulders hair and it takes me about 5 minutes to dry it. It still gets static in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the simple white and black color. To me it looks much better than the silver finish on higher-end driers because they still look like plastic and fake and this one is not pretending to be what it is not. The painted text to identify on/off and temperature settings wore off in two days but the settings are intuitive and so you don&#x27;t really need the text once you saw what is where. I&#x27;ve had it for just under a year and it is working just fine. All in all great purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a purple fanatic for all things PURPLE. More important, it was delivered in great time, it works wonderfully and the price was very reasonable. I was surprised at how relatively quiet it is.</li>
    <li> Never could use it because it came broken.  Looked like a very cheaply made hair dryer.  It also was an already opened package.</li>
    <li> This little dryer is light weight but carries a big punch when you want hot air, warm air, or cool air.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These are our second set of the hairdryers. Used in an athletic club with over 50 women using the changing area each day.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a week straight, so far I love it. However after I am done using it has a weird smell. Other than the smell I would give this product a 5 star!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery and reasonable price! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I got this as a Festivus gift for my wonderful and beautiful fiancee (we will be married on Pi day). It heats up pretty quick, came with the focuser and a diffuser. The back simply pops off for easy cleaning. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad dryer at all.  It comes with diffuser and concentrator, both of which work well.  It has a good range of temps/speed, plus a cool shot button.  It dries quickly without crisping my hair.  I had to ping it, however,  because the print (that designates hi, low, etc) next to the speed and temp controls wore off within days.  I tried re-writing them in with a sharpie but no luck.  I just found this annoying -- got smudgy fingers plus if I put this aside for any amount of time I have to \\&quot;re-learn\\&quot; what&#x27;s what.  I&#x27;ve had every kind of hair appliance over the years and never had this problem before.  Too bad, because otherwise this is a terrific little dryer.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter - Works great  and she likes it.</li>
    <li> good, seems underpowered</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer for the price! It&#x27;s not too loud, fairly lightweight, ergonomic, great colors, and my favorite part of all-- the attachments actually stay on. I had another Conair that I loved, except that the &amp;#34;concentrator&amp;#34; attachment would regularly fall off while I was drying my hair, and then it was burning hot, so I couldn&#x27;t put it back on until after I was already finished drying. This one stays on and rotates securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t pretend I notice a difference in my hair texture. It&#x27;s always frizzy, especially in summer, and this didn&#x27;t seem to cure that... but it works as well as my much more expensive hairdryers (I bought a professional one from a salon years ago) at a fraction of the price. The filter is also easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t get gunked up easily.</li>
    <li> I love Conair now and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll buy. I&#x27;m a guy with regular hair... don&#x27;t need anything special for styling, so my review is based on my needs.  It blows the right amount of air unlike others that hardly blow enough.  It&#x27;s not so hot to burn unlike others that really burn at times.  It&#x27;s not a noisy beast that hurts my ears.  The ionizing takes away the static buildup/charge.  The controls are about right.  Unit is comfortable.  The prior Conairs I&#x27;ve had have lasted me many years.  Best of all is the removable screen which can be easily cleaned when the unit builds up lint.  I really hated having to take a tweezers and pluck lint out of my hairdryer screens prior to this one.  The only nit picks I can identify with these are that the paint will chip off the plastic and the blue button that disables the heating element is a bit recessed in the handle, so doesn&#x27;t click on/off as well as it should.  Overall an excellent product though and I bought another for my guest bathroom and as a backup.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s functional for a 20 dollar item.&lt;br /&gt;one complaint though is the burnt smell it gives off; it makes the product seem really flimsy and cheap and uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Third time is a charm!  I was looking to replace my hair dryer and the last two I tried were so loud.  This one is great! Yay!</li>
    <li> Very noisy, I wonder if it was a Returned Item, doesn&#x27;t sound like a new unit or Conair is really making junk now.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this, I wasn&#x27;t feeling too confident about what to expect. But it turns out, the hairdryer is perfect. Yes, the motor is a little less vigorous then other hairdryers I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;m okay with that. In fact, it may be a little easier to control because of it. I dry my hair on medium heat so that&#x27;s perfect. And ladies, I read an article that says you should purchase a new hairdryer once a YEAR because all dryers tend to overheat and burn our hair. So for your $22 or whatever you spend, don&#x27;t expect them to last for 5+ years because it isn&#x27;t going to happen- not with any brand.</li>
    <li> Very low power. I bought for travel and the highest power is lower than my home dryer at low speed. Not worth it, get something else.</li>
    <li> Great just not happy how it cools down when I have it on for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. I had bought one before this and the comb attachment wouldn&#x27;t work. This one is amazing. Conair is high quality and&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
    <li> I have purchased this dryer twice and I love it, BUT each time it broke within months.  I purchased it in June, it just broke today (October 9th) and I don&#x27;t even use it every week.  I can&#x27;t bare to contribute to the landfills so quickly anymore.  I guess I am going to have to find another hair dryer model.</li>
    <li> My old hairdryer bit the dust, and after reading a few reviews, I decided to go with this hairdryer. It&#x27;s lightweight, which is great since I have long, thick hair and it takes a while to dry. I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment, and I found I didn&#x27;t need to use my straightener. As for the flyaways and frizzy hair - I do have flyaways and I&#x27;ve become so accustomed to them that I haven&#x27;t really noticed whether the dryer has made a difference. When I used the brush attachment I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t as frizzy, but sometimes nothing can help on those humid days.. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> It does a fine enough job. I bought this as a back up dryer for home when I started keeping my main air dryer in my gym bag.  It doesn&#x27;t dry as nicely as the other dryer which is a Conair 1875 Watt dryer as well but a different model, but it does the trick.  The body feel like cheap plastic and I&#x27;m not entirely sure that it wouldn&#x27;t crack if it slipped off the bathroom counter.  For the price it will do.</li>
