      <li>It has a pleasant odor, not too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>It was pleasant and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>

      <li>It kind of leaves my face sticky most of the time, not horribly sticky</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and not oily.</li>
      <li>I had one day of what appeared to be a very light peeling but for the most part there has been none.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a serum.</li>
      <li>more even.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ordered for my wife, fast shipping, great price, she likes it.</li>
      <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the product more for hyperpigmentation-</li>
      <li>My arms, hands and elbows feel smoother and have a better texture.</li>
      <li>It feels nice and smooth going on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I think my spots are lightening not quite sure.</li>
      <li>I used it for more than 2 months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order the day time version of this and see if it lightens the spots more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using this unless I find a better gel.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many products, Clinique, Olay, Estee Lauder, Sheiseido, Neutrogena, mostly from the US</li>
      <li>its worked like a magic ...90% of my spot are faded now....</li>
      <li>While I did not want to have to go spend more money, I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this to hopefully see better results.</li>
      <li>If I notice results after more use I will post an update:)</li>
      <li>It also seems to be more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>oh one more thing</li>
      <li>Really works great with the Renew Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>and always if you can, make a dermatologist appointment and ask a lot of questions of your conditions to get the right answers and treatment and a lot of things they are able to do at a fair price it wont cost and arm and leg</li>
      <li>then your new beautiful skin will come in and yea</li>
      <li>and I know I will be able to find and purchase it easily.  </li>
      <li>so any blemish can be seen clear on my face, acne or just a scab that&#x27;s healing it works great for those.</li>
      <li>The smell was light and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>but that was too much of a hassle, so I decided to tell all you good folks on Amazon about it instead.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>Although this is an acid peel it is very mild.</li>
      <li>Many of the great skin care systems have multiple steps (i.e. Proactiv).</li>
      <li>I have brown skin tone and that gets lighter during the winter but during the summer when I tan easily this peel helps even my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I had some very mild peeling.</li>
      <li>was easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>This product is not at all too strong and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I strongly suggest you invest in both products.</li>
      <li>their are so many regimens to do from so many price ranges and maybe even ask if this product is right for you</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that it would do a real good job of removing dark spots that I got when I went through menopause.</li>
      <li>We better use it quickly as potency doesn&#x27;t drop from 100% to 0% on the 36tth month but drops off gradually.</li>
      <li>The spots have lightened tremendously!</li>
      <li>(I certainly would&#x27;ve liked to cover up my flaws) than me being comfortable showing off my face.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, I also didn&#x27;t experience sensitivity with it, and my skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>When I wake up, my skin feels smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Additionally, this product is affordable and readily available</li>
      <li>but it is actually gentle on my skin and smells really nice.</li>
      <li>Great product overall though.</li>
      <li>After about two applications (two days time), the skin there was smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
      <li>shipping and the packing kept it secure.</li>
      <li>skin seems more even and calm.</li>
      <li>I received this product free of charge from BzzAgent****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it leaves your skin feeling fresh and cool.</li>
      <li>has faded significantly since using this product</li>
      <li>well success!</li>
      <li>/&gt;AND if you have scars you want to significantly lighten (3+ shades), invest in a tube of Merderma.</li>
      <li>I first started using the Dark Spot Peel and was not than impressed</li>
      <li>this is better cause it goes on your whole face.</li>
      <li>is a product that is marketed as a gentle leave-on peel that reveals brighter, smoother, more even-toned skin and minimizes the look of spots, imperfections, and post-acne marks.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and so age spots are especially noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It has a mild peeling effect and it didn&#x27;t burn nor irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for about 6 months and the results are amazing nearly all of my freckles have faded and most are completely gone!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is strong enough to do that, but any improvement is better than none.</li>
      <li>It is very smooth, watery texture and clear consistency.</li>
      <li>skins feels fresh</li>
      <li>It makes your skin more sensitive to the sun</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
      <li>The gel quickly absorbed into my skin upon application.  </li>
      <li>On the rare occasions I have fallen asleep with it on</li>
      <li>I apply it right after a wash my face and allow it to soak in for about 10 to 15 minutes before I apply my moisturizer</li>
      <li>but I noticed after just 2 weeks my scars were noticeably faded and by 4 weeks I still had half the bottle left which is great!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it would do a real good job of removing dark spots that I got when I went through menopause. It really doesn&#x27;t do much. The amount of the ingredient that causes the peel is so low that there is no visable change in  your skin. I see no difference. Buy something else.</li>
    <li> In the last 8 months I&#x27;ve been experiencing hormonal acne due to coming off birth control and experimenting with natural supplements. I was getting huge pimples that would leave behind sometimes red but mostly dark scars. On the box it says it takes 4 weeks but I noticed after just 2 weeks my scars were noticeably faded and by 4 weeks I still had half the bottle left which is great! I love the smell and it leaves your skin feeling fresh and cool. A couple things I would recommend are 1. don&#x27;t apply too much, a little goes a long way 2. Wait for it to dry on your face before you get into bed and lie your face on your pillow. The first couple of nights I used it I went to bed before it dried completely and I noticed a couple of small breakouts the next morning.</li>
    <li> It takes some time, but I believe it is fading dark spots slowly. It is very gentle. I will keep using it for another month.</li>
    <li> This is one product that I will buy again. I have always been a swimmer and sunscreens just don&#x27;t last. I had a little sun damage on my face; the keyword is &amp;#34;had&amp;#34;! My skin never looked so good!!! All the sun damage, the little spotting, is gone!</li>
    <li> Helped to prevent new spots from appearing, however I&#x27;m not sure if it has really helped my dark spots.</li>
    <li> The package of Garnier skin renew dark spot peel we received on June 17, 2015, was manufactured in July 2013 and expires after 36 months. We better use it quickly as potency doesn&#x27;t drop from 100% to 0% on the 36tth month but drops off gradually.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t fade dark spots</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face, fore arms, hands and elbows every night for 2 weeks. I follow it with the ultra miracle lift cream and the ultra miracle eye cream. My face looks younger and brighter while the dark spots are fading fast. My arms, hands and elbows feel smoother and have a better texture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now. I have noticed my dark spots fade significantly and I&#x27;ve had almost no ingrown hairs since using this product.</li>
    <li> It looks like the overnight peel is noticeably changing my skin. I have received compliments. It has helped treat my severe dark spots and scars from acne. I only recommend the overnight peel WITH the Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector. It seems to work better with the other products in the line. After a while, it seemed like my skin started to become irritated at some times during use, and stopped responding as well. you may need to take a break after about 8 weeks just to let your skin relax. Over-all the products starts off strong and then becomes weak. you will immediately notice a difference, and then it will trickle off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in November,  and at first I was a bit skeptical being that I have dark marks on my face and have tried other products to correct this but was never successful.  Well I felt it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. well the first day I used it it made my skin on my face feel really soft I kid you not! This product is not at all too strong and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week I did notice my main problem area on my face started to appear lighter and smoother. I am going to continue using this product because I do think it will eventually correct my uneven skin tone on my face.  I would recommend this to anyone who may have the same skin problem as myself if not wanting to go through the pain of a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the dark spot corrector lotion. I have been using this product for about two months. My skin has been less oily, and old acne scars are fading. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I spent my younger years baking in the sun and now I am paying the price for it.  I have fair skin and so age spots are especially noticeable.  I was happy to have discovered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  While my age spots have not completely disappeared, they are noticeably lighter.  Only surgery will completely remove age spots and I&#x27;m not quite ready to take that step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It feels nice and smooth going on my skin.  I was concerned that this peel would be too drying for my skin.  It isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No scent. I have been disappointed with other company&#x27;s products because they have a heavy and annoying scent.  Not so this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Only a small amount is needed for your entire face so a bottle will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have some age spots you want to lighten, you might just like this product.</li>
    <li> This always gives my skin nice and healthy glow!</li>
    <li> this works wonders for my skin at first I really didn&#x27;t see the difference in my dark spots in my back has faded significantly since using this product</li>
    <li> This my first time trying this product. After having recently suffered from cystic acne I needed something to take away the one million dark spots on my face, I was surprised to see in one application my skin looked brighter like it was scrubbed. At first I thought the product would be harsh and smelly but it is actually gentle on my skin and smells really nice. Will extend this review after one (1) month of constant usage......so far on day two, I&#x27;m in love......</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t expect miracles anymore, but given time this does seem to be lightening dark spots, and scars, better than other products of the same type. Am happy with this product, and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I swear by this product. I love it so much I was compelled to post up an entire video for it on Youtube, but that was too much of a hassle, so I decided to tell all you good folks on Amazon about it instead. I have to say I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost the last two years, I got around August of 2013. I think people give up on products such as these too soon because they&#x27;re not getting results as quickly as they&#x27;d like. I had other issues to tackle besides the dark spots on my face that my acne would leave behind. My skin was very dry and the areas under my eyes were especially rough to the touch, they didn&#x27;t even feel like skin anymore. I put this product all over my face in the beginning, including those under eye areas. After about two applications (two days time), the skin there was smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I decided to stay with this product just for that reason alone. About 2 months in I saw a difference with my dark spots and my skin didn&#x27;t feel nearly as coarse and dry.  My skin has had a drastic change over the months. I never wore makeup, even when my skin was at its worst, this was more for the fact that I didn&#x27;t know how to do makeup (I certainly would&#x27;ve liked to cover up my flaws) than me being comfortable showing off my face. However, I&#x27;ve come to have confidence in my face&#x27;s appearance after using this product; now I don&#x27;t even want the makeup. My skin certainly isn&#x27;t flawless but it&#x27;s pretty close if I do say so myself. There&#x27;s a clear difference in my skin then and now, before I had to apply the peel all over my face, and now I only apply it to new problem areas, because all the others have been taken care of. Not sure if this is important but know that I am a Black (West Indian) female.  The product itself doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, maybe a faint citrus one if anything. It spreads easily, it&#x27;s clear. It kind of leaves my face sticky most of the time, not horribly sticky but if you put your hands to your face or layon your pillow you can feel the slight tackiness. It doesn&#x27;t bother me all that much though. I want to note that over the two years I used this, I didn&#x27;t use it routinely, I would go on and off a week or just whenever I felt I should use it and I still got results. I still have half a bottle left.  I picked up the dark spot correcter that works with it a month or two ago to deal with the dark areas under my eye (the peel only reduced their appearance about 60%) and that certainly got them to diminish even more.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately didnt work for me, however i only perservered for two weeks as it caused me to breakout.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife, fast shipping, great price, she likes it.</li>
    <li> I developed dark spot on my face for a year now and looks disgusting ...i do get pimples if i use any kind of cream/serums ...my sister suggested me this one and tried...its worked like a magic ...90% of my spot are faded now....skins feels fresh n clear...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand why some ppl say this works, I saw other beauty reviews on this product, most ppl say it doesn&#x27;t work. I used for 4 months now, see absolutely zero difference</li>
    <li> Have used this for about 10 days now and might be seeing some differences. However I&#x27;m wary of being too lightened out. Currently using it with the dark spot corrector. Guess they work better together though the peel seems more effective. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Pleasant texture. I observed some positive effects on my skin tone. However, it did render my skin a little bit dryer.</li>
    <li> im stil fairly young and also didn&#x27;t have severe skin conditions but ive had a lot of skin damage done with years of tanning and being unprotected by the uvs and also im just getting out of the teenage acne stage and I had very minor breakouts sometimes it was imposible to have a clear face but never more than 4 pimples and blackheads everywhere! I have a couple acne scars for improper caring habits...(leave it alone lol) but using this stuff and also the little masks not sure what the exact name was but its Garnier and its for dark spots and acne scars so all in all I think this was a good product for me. the only bad thing is its very small and sometimes needs a few pumps just to get it all over the face .I just think this product varies from your skin damage and how severe your conditions are. If you feel like trying it I say your pros are its lightweight easy to apply and could possibly benefit you, the cons are it might not work for you. and always if you can, make a dermatologist appointment and ask a lot of questions of your conditions to get the right answers and treatment and a lot of things they are able to do at a fair price it wont cost and arm and leg their are so many regimens to do from so many price ranges and maybe even ask if this product is right for you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days and already see a difference. Not just me but my husband notices the difference as well. A must buy!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6 months and the results are amazing nearly all of my freckles have faded and most are completely gone!  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Used every day (multiple times/day) for 2 months in conjunction with their Dark Spot Corrector (tube), no change at all.  Disappointing waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I have thirty years of brown spots on my face and have been using this for the last two weeks.  I have noticed some spots are gone and other have started to fade.  I have not had any redness or any other side effects.</li>
    <li> I can only say it was OK I guess.  Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me after one use.  Package arrived on time and in good condition, so complaints on that end.  I will keep using until gone and see how i like it.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a thing to improve the dark spots on this 65 year old face or hands. Disappointed in this Garnier product.</li>
    <li> so far I have not seen any difference on my skin, the directions are confusing, it said it&#x27;s best to use with the cream, I bought them both, but not sure how to apply this in the evenings. with cream? or without cream, which one goes on first??</li>
    <li> Helps a lot for my dark spot.</li>
    <li> I am using it now  for a month.  No changes yet.  I am afraid it will do nothing for my dark spots but will keep on trying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week. I&#x27;m already seeing a subtle change in my \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; and I&#x27;m now using it on the backs of my hands. I am very fair and I have a lot of sun damage on my face, neck and back of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very cool and refreshing and it smells great. Although this is an acid peel it is very mild. I can see myself using this all the time. I like it so much, I&#x27;m ordering the companion products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking photos so I can compare the changes. I&#x27;ll let y&#x27;all know how it turns out.</li>
    <li> First for those that thinks this is like one of those thick face peels there dries and comes off like a mask it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s very thin and supposed to be put on at night. I personally toss and turn in my sleep so I put it on after work hours before bed and relax with it on my face. On the rare occasions I have fallen asleep with it on it doesn&#x27;t get on the pillow cases just flakes off. I wash it off when I wake up but my skin feels soft and dark marks are visibly lighter. I&#x27;m black so any blemish can be seen clear on my face, acne or just a scab that&#x27;s healing it works great for those. I recommend after it&#x27;s fully headed to apply to the area to even out your skin tone again. Really works great with the Renew Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and the packing kept it secure.</li>
    <li> I do see the effect ive been using it or 1 week so maybe i should wait and see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sont see any diff in the morning so i dont know what this does</li>
    <li> I like the way it works overnight.  My skin is looking real good. I will continue using this to hopefully see better results.</li>
    <li> I used and finished the entire bottle and saw ZERO difference in the dime sized dark spot on my cheek.</li>
    <li> Well I wanted too try something different it ok it did help me with the dark ring I had around my wrist</li>
    <li> Tried this and is on my second bottle now.  It has a mild peeling effect and it didn&#x27;t burn nor irritate my skin. One drop is plenty and I used it on my face and neck after washing my face.  I let it sit for a minute at least before I apply my night serum and night moisturizer.  It has a pleasant odor, not too strong for me.  I have brown skin tone and that gets lighter during the winter but during the summer when I tan easily this peel helps even my skin tone.  I have freckles on my cheek bone area and upper forehead and they are a bit lighter but this peel won&#x27;t get rid of all your dark spots.  It makes your skin more sensitive to the sun so make sure your day moisturizer has sunscreen, at least spf 30, or you&#x27;ll just get more sunburn using peeling gels.  The price is good, much cheaper than other peel gels from department stores.  I have tried so many products, Clinique, Olay, Estee Lauder, Sheiseido, Neutrogena, mostly from the US but this gel works the same for me and it is cheaper.  I&#x27;ll keep using this unless I find a better gel.  I suggest you also exfoliate at least twice a week to help with skin renewal, this fruit based peel helps but exfoliation is a must.</li>
    <li> Helped a little bit, but not that empressive.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff in conjunction with the dark spot corrector every night for months. I never saw any real improvement. The dark spot corrector will slightly lighten the skin color but if you have a dark spot it also lightens around the spot so you end up with a lighter spot with lighter surrounding skin as well. It wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to me, I have an appointment to have my spots lasered.</li>
    <li> Item is very good i a noticed a different in my skin after a few days. Will continue to use great item.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a good product to add to your night routine. I haven&#x27;t used it as consistently as I should have, but I still saw results. It helped fade some dark marks on my forehead from me picking at pimples, in about 3 weeks. I would probably have faster results but I didn&#x27;t use it every night so that kind of messed it up. Great product overall though. It&#x27;s very light and not oily. I also haven&#x27;t had any problems with it breaking me out.</li>
    <li> I used this with all 3 of the products that go with it.  Never saw a difference in my skin.  In fact I found my skin to become more oily than usual.  I am going back to Olay ProX</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! The price is awesome! I tried another expensive brand and it works like this... this is better cause it goes on your whole face. I noticed a difference the next morning. After one week my face glows. it doesn&#x27;t prevent acne but it does makes those spots diminish. I was even able to go bare faced to work one day. I also use with the spot treatment. I&#x27;ve recommended this to my bff.</li>
    <li> this product made my face brakeout, there was no change in my dark spot just waste of money. do not buy this product does not work.</li>
    <li> She posted a negative review about this product saying it made her \\&quot;break out\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had experience with this kinda stuff and this is one of the first peels to hit the supermarkets let me tell you it&#x27;s not causing you to break out its actually making your face get rid of all that gunk and trapped dirt and oil that you don&#x27;t see or feel its just getting rid of it then your new beautiful skin will come in and yea your spots may become darker but that&#x27;s because the peel is drying them so they can flake off or come off when you exfoliate it just takes time and patience the packet says 4 weeks only after then can you come on amazon a write your negative or in my case positive review, I like this stuff it&#x27;s well worth the price and I have awesome skin cause of it ima guy and girls are asking me what I use haa \\&quot;soap, moisturizer and this stuff at night (when it says so, follow all directions as directed) and take a break from this stuff\\&quot; remember patience is key to better skin I recommend to all guys and you girls out there this stuff is awesome oh one more thing SPF add that to your skin regime</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month or so. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin at all. Wasted money</li>
    <li> If you are religious about your skin care, then you may get different results from me. I used it a couple times and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. On the bright side, I also didn&#x27;t experience sensitivity with it, and my skin is sensitive. If I notice results after more use I will post an update:)</li>
    <li> This promises you will see a change within a week or so.  I used it every day for over a month and actually saw the dark spot get worse instead of better.  Would not suggest this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Have used for 2 months and haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in my dark spots. Some of the redness has diminished.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great for those that need an extra boost to get rid of dull skin on ththe cheeks. Fast shipment too!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff really works. Thank you</li>
    <li> The label said I should see change in 4-5weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen any yet. I&#x27;m still waiting to see any change</li>
    <li> I bought the product more for hyperpigmentation- little red spots left after pimples. I do not have any brown spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is not your typical lotion. It is very \\&quot;liquid-y\\&quot; and a bit sticky. It reminds me of the texture of Aloe Vera. It remains tacky on your skin for a few minutes. I wait until it dries then apply a moisturizer. I had a slight stinging upon application however I just got done washing my face real well. I have not had any stinging since. A little goes along way with this. I am only applying it to the sides of my face and problem areas as it is a bit drying and I don&#x27;t want the rest of my face to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week results? My skin feels smoother and a little of the red marks from old pimples are not as bright. They are not gone but I realize I have not given the four weeks this product needs. You need to use it in conjunction with a moisturizer as you will feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder why they call it a \\&quot;peel\\&quot;- I think that is a bit misleading. It in no way acts like a professional peel and if you expect that you won&#x27;t be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** 2 Week results. I had some very mild peeling. If I didn&#x27;t look close I would have missed it. NO breakouts at all. In fact my skin looks clearer. I put it on regularly. In the morning and at night. If I am going without make up and staying indoors I will apply some during the day too. I have noticed a difference. I wake up and my face just looks \\&quot;Calm\\&quot; more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** 3 Week result. My dark spots (Hyperpigmentation) are much lighter. (Not totally gone) My skin feels very dry though. In fact even my lips are peeling. It is a little too much dry for me so I am only going to apply it once a day now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems more even and calm. The effects are very subtle. I had one day of what appeared to be a very light peeling but for the most part there has been none. But, my skin does seem to be a little more even. I especially notice it when I wake up.I will continue to use the product since I have two bottles. Then I may stop to see if there is a noticeable reaction when I stop. LIke I said previously, I don&#x27;t think this will remove dark spots completely but it does work to some degree on smoothing out skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 45, a non-smoker, and I use a lot of sunscreen. I have had to use less foundation with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a slow process, I would be very leery of any claims that spots have gone away within days. I am not paid to do this nor am I in any way affiliated with any company.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks, before bedtime. It is very smooth, watery texture and clear consistency. It smells nice and fresh. It is a little bit sticky first, but it absorbs and dries fast. I have mixed combination skin and in the winter months my skin is dry. After I apply this peel, I do not have to put additional moisturizer, which is good. When I wake up, my skin feels smooth and hydrated. However, I am not seeing any improvement on my sun (dark) spots. Maybe I will see some results after 4 weeks, and if I will I am going to update this review.</li>
    <li> It is working on me. By the time a finish the bottle, I hope my face will be free of dark spots.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes that old acne marks would fade, and my skin would brighten... well success! After once month, my acne marks are much lighter! The only downside was my skin becoming increasingly dry- but after I achieved my desired results, I quit using it, and my skin went back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone wanting the results of a professional in-office peel, because it would be unrealistic... but if you need a subtle fix- buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND if you have scars you want to significantly lighten (3+ shades), invest in a tube of Merderma. This product just doesn&#x27;t do what Mederma does for deep scarring.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about two weeks. I think my spots are lightening not quite sure. I have to wait a little longer to find out i guess</li>
    <li> it does not work for me so that is why a 1 star rating for this case. I feel bad to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This product was terrible! It made my skin break out even worse! Very disappointed in the results didn&#x27;t even use half the bottle.</li>
    <li> I like this it really faded my dark marks drastically. It does take the whole bottle before i seen results but when i did well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I have average skin with a few pimple scars some more prominent than others. I wanted to diminish these scars so I looked into this product. I started with the overnight peel for a month and saw no real results. I applied only it after each face wash in the evening. The smell is nice and not overpowering, my face did yearn for some moisturizer but I did not apply any. I have also just recently started using the moisturizer in the morning hoping that combining the two dark spot correcting products would help the dark spots to no avail. These do not do what they say they will do, at least to the untrained naked eye.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I used it for more than 2 months. No visible results.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The product does what is says. My skin the next day was so much brighter and weeks later some spots were completely gone!</li>
    <li> Skin is slightly brighter. Applies nicely. Neutral scent. Doesn&#x27;t seem to remove dark spots but the overall quality of my skin is slightly improved. I would suggest a product with a higher glycolic acid content.</li>
    <li> jury still out on this stuff.  takes 4 weeks to tell if it works or not.  I am unsure if any result yet - make take the entire bottle to reap results.  but at this price you cant wrong to try</li>
    <li> A youtuber reviewed this product - she was African American - my skin complexion and raved about it, so I decided to try it! First off, as an African American, I would have NEVER thought to use Garnier products... Not saying that I only use products for African Americans, but I always thought Garnier products were expensive and maybe wasn&#x27;t for my skin tone.. Well I was WRONG! I have dark spots on my lower chin/jawline from my hair or the products that I use in my hair. Anytime I wear my hair down, I break out and I HATE that!!! Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this every night before bed for the past month and I can see a huge difference!! The spots have lightened tremendously! They are not gone and I don&#x27;t think this product is strong enough to do that, but any improvement is better than none. I&#x27;m going to order the day time version of this and see if it lightens the spots more. I will review that product once I know either way.</li>
    <li> been using this for a month!!!!!  sucks sucks sucks!!!! does NOT work!!!!!!</li>
    <li> **** I received this product free of charge from BzzAgent****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GARNIER SKIN RENEW DARK SPOT PEEL is a product that is marketed as a gentle leave-on peel that reveals brighter, smoother, more even-toned skin and minimizes the look of spots, imperfections, and post-acne marks.  It contains Glycolic Vitamin C to exfoliate and minimize dullness and discolorations.  The product itself should feel silky and should leave skin feeling hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium complexion and my skin is on the dry side.  I have a few discolorations from scars and the sun, but generally have clear bright skin.  The overall tone is a little uneven in places.&lt;br /&gt;GARNIER SKIN RENEW DARK SPOT PEEL was easy to apply.  An added bonus was that I did not have to wait and then wash it off or neutralize it.  I really like that it is a leave-on product.  The texture is a thin gel.  It reminds me of aloe vera in pure form.  The smell was light and refreshing.  The gel quickly absorbed into my skin upon application.  There was a slight tackiness initially, but it dissipated after a few minutes.  I was worried that it would be drying since a major component in this product is alcohol, but I have yet to experience any dryness associated with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleasantly surprised by the results.  I was using a product from another line that is almost three times the cost of GARNIER SKIN RENEW DARK SPOT PEEL.  While I did not see my skin get dramatically brighter, I had been expecting to see my skin get duller as a result of discontinuing the more expensive product.  I am thinking about switching products and will decide when I have completed the entire bottle.  My skin has been soft, comfortable, and luminous.  It also seems to be more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would definitely recommend GARNIER SKIN RENEW DARK SPOT PEEL.  It was pleasant and easy to use.  It absorbed quickly and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the hassle of neutralizing, like with some other peels.  I feel it has delivered results.  My skin is bright and glowing and unevenness I have is decreasing.  Additionally, this product is affordable and readily available and I know I will be able to find and purchase it easily.  My only caveat is that I use a regiment of other skin care products and cannot definitively attribute all of the benefits I have been experiencing solely to this product, however, from what I have seen so far, it is definitely worth continuing.</li>
    <li> Have not seen results yet.</li>
    <li> I have only tried this product for two days, but the results are better than I expected. I have combination skin and while I break out on my chin and neck, I have dry flaky skin on my cheeks. It&#x27;s a constant battle to keep the oil at bay and prevent acne. Naturally, all the acne leaves many dark spots behind (and it doesn&#x27;t help that I tend to mess with the zits when they pop up). Usually I wash my face before bed and HAVE to put on moisturizer too, otherwise my skin gets too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past two days I have washed my face, then skiped the moisturizer and used this peel alone. It provides enough moisture for the skin to look smooth and supple. Moreover, I noticed that my dark spots are fading fast. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after a week or month of use. The only thing is that in the morning I still have to wash my face with plain water to get rid of any excess oil before my make-up goes on, but I usually have to do it anyways. Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased by this product. No breakouts and the dark spots are disappearing fast. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough, even after such short time.</li>
    <li> this product is not effeciency at all</li>
    <li> i think this is like a skin dye of some type&lt;br /&gt;the overflow on the outside of my bottle is brownish</li>
    <li> I first started using the Dark Spot Peel and was not than impressed but once I started using it with [[ASIN:B0057RIM5G Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector Skin Renew, 1.7 Ounce]] I noticed a big difference. On the back of the bottle it says \\&quot;for persistent dark spots, follow with...\\&quot; so the answer was there all along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you think about it it makes sense. Many of the great skin care systems have multiple steps (i.e. Proactiv). While I did not want to have to go spend more money, I am glad I did. The peel seems to remove the old/dead skin and the corrector encourages new cell growth - new cells replace the dark spot cells. If you want fast (3 to 4 week results) I strongly suggest you invest in both products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this peel for about a month now, and can really see a difference in my dark spots. I used to go to the tanning beds and had dark spots on my cheeks from the UV exposure. This product has really helped in lightening them. I use it at night. I apply it right after a wash my face and allow it to soak in for about 10 to 15 minutes before I apply my moisturizer (it gives serums times to work). When I look in the mirror in the morning, my skin is glowing and looks well-rested and refreshed. My dark spots are continuing to fade and hopefully with continued use, they will no longer be noticeable. I do want to note that this product isn&#x27;t an actual &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;. Nothing peels off at all. It&#x27;s more of a serum. I&#x27;m not sure why they included &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; in the name.</li>
    <li> I have noticed improvement in the dark spots on my face; use the moisturizer with it, and the color and softness of my skin is improving.</li>
</ol>
