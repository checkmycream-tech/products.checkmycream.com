<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live (or travel) without makeup remover towelettes. I used to wash my face (with cleanser) but never seemed able to do so well without getting water on my hair. Towelettes remove that issue altogether - and they work.</li>
    <li> As good as always. Neutrogena makeup remover (blue package) is the best makeup remover towelettes I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Makes cleanup a breeze</li>
    <li> These remover wipes are amazing!  They smell so nice and leave my skin soft and clean!  I used a store brand for years to remove makeup after work to go to the gym, but I would much rather pay an extra dollar or two for the luxury of these wipes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t think of any other beauty products I&#x27;m allergic to; so, I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive skin. Yet, these burned so bad the skin under my eyes still hurts 3 days later. Don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin at all. I&#x27;m going to try the simple brand and see if that&#x27;s better since they&#x27;re supposed to be relatively chemical free.</li>
    <li> this towelettes are so easy to use, leave no residue, remove all sorts of makeup. now i cannot live without them.</li>
    <li> The towlette works well to remove makeup. I wish each one was individually wrapped, though, so it would be easier to travel with them.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and I absolutely love the monthly shipping.  I dont have to worry about running out at home now and you cant be the cost.</li>
    <li> i received it quickly. I often pass on mascara because it&#x27;s so hard to remove. With this specific towelette (not the one in the yellow package because that one doesn&#x27;t remove mascara), it makes it easy to remove mascara &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of mascara and a lot of times it&#x27;s difficult to remove, the Neutrogena towelettes are great, I still have to use a cleanser afterwards, but they remove 90% of my makeup</li>
    <li> Great for taking all that makeup off!</li>
    <li> This one keeps me from having acne because I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face at night. Sometimes, I forget to wash my face after a night out and that isn&#x27;t good for my skin so I bought this. It really wipes the makeup away. A must-have for busy and free woman like me.</li>
    <li> Gets all my makeup off along with oil that sits on face all day.  Not watery, just the right amount of moisture in each wipe and very soft.</li>
    <li> I received items on today for 3 pack from Amazon , for All is perfect . I fell assured to do order by Amamzon . Thanks a lot .</li>
    <li> They work.. But very expensive.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is gentle and easy.  I like that is is moist to begin with and you don&#x27;t have to put in in water before use.</li>
    <li> Love these. Great for make-up removal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these towelettes for years - either Neutrogena or Almay and was disappointed as the priced slowly crept up by several dollars per pack that lasts less than a month when I wear make-up every day. I was very happy to discover that Amazon offers these on Subscribe and Save - no more running out, and a cost savings! I also like that I don&#x27;t have to purchase a new plastic container each time as my drugstore never sells the refill packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that these take off all my make-up, even waterproof mascara and all-day lipstick. I have excessively oily skin, so I just use these as a pre-cleanser and then go through my normal cleansing and toning program. I find if I don&#x27;t wash my face afterwards, these alone do an insufficient job at removing enough of the oil and make-up to prevent acne. These do leave a film on my face, but I wash it off. Sometimes I will go several hours between taking off my make-up and washing my face. These only sting my eyes when I don&#x27;t have my contacts in strangely. No issues when I&#x27;m wearing contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my oily skin, I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t break out as much because I remove my make-up first before I wash my face, so I&#x27;m thankful that Amazon offers these handy little wipes at a great price!</li>
    <li> These are easy and get ALL the makeup and anything else off your face. If you&#x27;re tired and don&#x27;t want or have the energy to take your makeup off grab these or have them by your bed, I think it&#x27;s better for your skin because with washing your face sometimes makeup gets left behind.  I have these on subcribe and save and I save a lot of money by doing that.</li>
    <li> I never thought I needed a separate makeup remover from my face-soap, however since I&#x27;ve started to use these every evening before I was my face they have been doing wonders for my skin. I highly recommend them from here because of the great price. Skip the \\&quot;3-pack\\&quot; if you have Prime and just order 3 of the single packs, since the 3-pack is not prime (and shipping for it costs way more) but the singles are prime and shipping is therefore cheaper. I would recommend rinsing or washing your face after using these, even if you&#x27;re just using them alone because they leave soap behind on your face. I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a con, since the soap they use is so gentle and has done so much good stuff for my skin. You could probably go without rinsing afterwards in a pinch, but for every-day definitely rinse.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing if you need your makeup off cause your in a rush or just don&#x27;t like to waste time this is for you.</li>
    <li> These have really improved my skin&#x27;s quality!  I bought these because, out of sheer exhaustion, I skipped washing my face a few nights in a row - and it made me break out.  I thought these were bad ecology-wise (it&#x27;s minimal packaging - but still - using a wipe when I should just use soap &amp; water?!)  Anyway, my vanity got the better of me - because my exhaustion problem wasn&#x27;t going away (small children at home)..  and what surprised me was it wasn&#x27;t just as good as soap &amp; water - it was better! (by soap, I mean liquid facial cleansing lotion)  I really feel like my skin quality has improved, and now I&#x27;m hooked! :)</li>
    <li> I discovered these years ago and was thrilled to find them on Amazon Auto-Fill.  No more looking for a deal in the store.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have sensitive eyes and these wipes have never been a problem for me</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite facial wipes. Gets all the make up off easily and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or grimy.</li>
    <li> The Best makeup remover I tried. Mascara came right off, without any difficulty. Soft towelettes.  Leaves skin feeling refreshed. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best make up removal product I have ever used and they are super convenient. I wear waterproof mascara and never have a problem removing it. Also, I find the pads very refreshing and have a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product from the store, and it cleansed my eye-makeup and mascara and foundation effectively.  So I checked out Amazon and found exactly the same product.  I ordered and am still using it, satisfied with what it does, and I plan to re-order as soon as I am running low.      I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but as long as it does the job I bought it for, I&#x27;ll keep ordering same.  If I find something else that does the same job at a cheaper rate, that would be the time to change product.  Meanwhile, this is fine.</li>
    <li> I feel that there&#x27;re far better towelettes out there.  It doesn&#x27;t do a good job as I expected.  I would say it&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a pack of 25 of these and they do remove makeup extremely well. As other reviewers have said, the towelettes are super soft, plushy, and have a very mildly scented soapy-like cleanser in them. The pack they come in has a little lift-up tab that sticks closed again, and even when it gets left open a bit the towels seem to keep their moisture just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried removing makeup with facial scrubs, foaming cleansers, and soap and water, and the Neutrogena towels wipe all of it off in one pass - eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, everything. I just toss the towel in the garbage and don&#x27;t have to worry about staining washcloths or towels with leftover mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some mixed reviews about whether the towels leave a \\&quot;residue\\&quot; or not. I can see why the company says they do not leave any residue - it&#x27;s not exactly the same kind of feel as other cleansers or soaps leave. However, I rinse and rub my face with cool water after using them, because they DO leave a slippery feel behind. My skin is very oily as it is, and after using these the oil seems to come back in force within an hour or two, requiring one more rinse. (It may just be my skin type, though.) These towels do leave a very refreshed, clean feel afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, combining the complete removal of makeup with a cool rinse afterward gives me the best outcome compared to any other product I&#x27;ve tried, so I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> These makeup remover towelettes caused my face to badly break out. After I started using them, the bottom half of my face became red and irritated. A few days later, I woke up with four pimples on my face. I&#x27;ve never before had so many pimples on my face at the same time. These towelettes are obviously not for people with sensitive skin. I want my money back!!</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena products for many years and this has to be my favorite.  It makes cleansing my face at night so much easier!  And I love having it for traveling.  Whether your complexion is dry or oily, you will find this product wonderful to use.</li>
    <li> Great Item! Daughter age 19 purchased for herself. Works very well as described on site.</li>
    <li> I only use these to wash my face. Non drying, easily removes all make up. I love how my face feels after cleansing.</li>
    <li> These do remove my makeup better than the store brand kind I have been using, BUT the package says it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and it clearly does. Kinda greasy feeling, and the smell of them stays. Also they did irritate my eyes a bit. I will probably try another brand again next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who DESPISES washing their face every night (especially with a full face of makeup on!). It takes up so much time at the end of the night (when I&#x27;m usually exhausted) and on top of that, I end up getting all of my watery-washed-off-makeup all over the sink! Sometimes I just sleep with makeup on because I just am too tired to wash my face. These wipes have been great because they&#x27;re SO easy to use, and they leave no messes! I&#x27;m really enjoying quickly wiping my face and jumping into bed. If I&#x27;m not too tired at night, I&#x27;ll use these, then wash my face with my Neutrogena Acne Face Wash for a better cleanse...  These wipes don&#x27;t leave my skin dry at all. HOWEVER, one tiny complaint: not all of my mascara comes off. I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara either, I use Lash Blast the orange one... I do use quite a bit of mascara though, and most of it comes off anyway so I don&#x27;t mind at all! Overall, I&#x27;m really liking these and will repurchase!</li>
    <li> This perfect for lazy skin care.  I like to use it at night as a watch TV from my bed.  It is very effective with little effort.</li>
    <li> I usually try to stick to my full skincare routine, but sometimes I am just really really tired and go to bed with makeup on (bad, I know). However, these are good substitute for those days you don&#x27;t want or have the time for 3+ steps. Takes my makeup off quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these everyday in place of a good cleaner, but they do the trick if you are in a hurry.</li>
    <li> This is the best and easiest way to remove makeup quickly and thoroughly.They are great for traveling! I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These Neutrogena face wipes are pretty good. They remove all make up - including mascara and liner! They are nice and moist and do refresh your face. However they do leave a bit of a residue behind so rinsing off your face is a must. The main issue I had with them is the smell. I can&#x27;t really describe it but it bothers me quite a bit. I think after using up the pack I have gotten used to it a bit, but I don&#x27;t really think I&#x27;ll repurchase (unless I can&#x27;t find other wipes that remove make up as well).</li>
    <li> I have been using this makeup remover for at least two years.  It is very effective and well worth the money. No problem with skin reactions from it.   The seller shipped the item quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover I ever had. I been using other makeup removers, and it really hurts my eyes, but this one, it&#x27;s like, so smooth, soft and remover my makeups without hurting my eyes^_^!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. I have been using it for a couple of months now, and I love the way it makes my skin feel. It does a good job at removing all my make-up, even the harder to get eyeliner and mascara.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so even though this does a great job at cleaning off all my eye makeup, the skin around my eyes sting afterwards.</li>
    <li> I would still recommend using eye-make up remover (I like Lancome)before you use the Neutrogena cleansing towelettes. For sensitive areas like your eyes, these need too much force to take off the make up. I don&#x27;t want any wrinkles!  It&#x27;s an extra step but soak your cotton pads (love mine from the body shop) with lots of eye makeup remover and press it lightly on your eyes. It takes about 20 seconds :)  These clean really well, leaves my face feeling clean and fresh (of course you still need to wash your face afterwords). They are so cheap since I go through about one bag a month. Great value for beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> excellent, bought more. removes waterproof mascara and eyeliner without making a mess all over my face . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> For me this is the best product ever in the market. It does remove it all, no matter if water proof or not, and you don´t have to scratch your skin for it to work.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell whether the first one I used cleaned very well, but I never like anything with perfume.  I was amazed that something that would be used as a cleaner would have a strong smell.  I&#x27;ll probably give the rest of the order away.</li>
    <li> These make-up remover wipes are perfect.  They remove every trace of makeup from your skin and leave your skin silky soft and comfortable!  I can&#x27;t recommend them enough.  Of course, they are gentle and good for your skin, they are from Neutrogena.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> These towelettes are perfect for all my face cleaning needs. They do a great job removing make-up, better than liquid for removing mascara- and I really enjoy the convenience they provide when traveling or camping. Would recommend them to all and will definately purchase them again!</li>
    <li> I have very oily, acne-prone, moderately sensitive skin and have to be careful about anything I put on my face. That said, I&#x27;ve been using these wipes to remove my makeup every night for years because they don&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts- ever. I only need 1 wipe to get every trace of makeup off my skin (and I wear a LOT of makeup) and lightly condition my skin without leaving a film or residue. I usually wash my face afterwards with a cleanser just to deep clean my pores, but when I&#x27;m too tired, I just use this wipe and go to bed and wash my face the next morning. Nothing removes makeup and grime as well as this baby- I hope this never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> Very effective in wiping away all my makeup, including the hard to reach areas. It completely removes my mascara and waterproof mascara as well. It doesn&#x27;t sting and is moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the store... I was amazed at how easy it takes my makeup off. Then it left my skin feeling great! I will always buy these from Amazon.com in the future.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave skin too oily; only need one towel for both eyes. Gentle on the eyes, but takes a lot of rubbing to get eye makeup off.</li>
    <li> So I am one of those women who love to fall asleep with my make-up on. My skin hate me for this. I tried these as a quick and easy solution for this. I wear a full face of make-up to work everyday along with waterproof mascara. This is the only cleansing wipe I have found that will take off waterproof mascara, gel blusher, and 18 hour lipstick with one wipe.     I use one side of the wipe for the face and flip is over to take off my eye make-up. After that I rinse my face with cool water and pat dry. You don&#x27;t have to do this, it is my personal preference though.</li>
    <li> These truly work. With a few passes over your face and your eyes, you remove all of your makeup. It quickly and easily removed MAC foundation, blush, eye shadow and mascara. It leaves your face feeling fresh but there is a bit of a scent to it so if you do not like scents items, this one does a fresh aroma to it that shouldn&#x27;t bother most but I feel should be mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this, not the starter pack that includes a case. I honestly didn&#x27;t even know this was a refill until I received it. Either way, I think the packaging is just fine on its own and it fits easily into my bathroom cabinet so I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara I used was not waterproof, so I cannot speak to whether it works well for that but it definitely works with a standard MAC mascara. Very pleased. I typically wear makeup very infrequently but when I use these, they do not dry out my face. Not certain what would happen if you used daily.</li>
    <li> This is a very soft wipe and it does get everything off but it left my skin feeling greasy.  I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees white tea wipes.  This is good, however, for the eye area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at all the positive reviews. I have tried other makeup remover wipes and none work properly. I had high hopes for these but am disappointed. The package says they&#x27;ll take off waterproof mascara, but they can&#x27;t even remove my regular non-waterproof Cover Girl mascara. Soap and water is much quicker. Maybe other folks are really rubbing hard, but if I wiped any harder, my lashes would start breaking off. If anyone can suggest something better, please do! Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years and absolutely love them. They remove my makeup including mascara with minimal effort and they don&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin.</li>
    <li> These are the absolute greatest.  Not only do they cover a large area on your face, they really get my makeup off.  I tend to go heavier on the weekends and 1 towelette still does it for me.</li>
    <li> I only wear eye makeup so this review is regarding just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear eye primer (basically paint) and then shimmer that stays even when you rub your fingers on it.  I use heavy duty mascara that I usually have to pick off and then wash off...and still have raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used my first cloth and it was painless and everything came off.  The eyeshadow took a couple swipes and the mascara only took about a minute.  I think that this is def worth the price.  I will have to check back within the next month and update this.  I bought these to take to the gym.  I go right after work so I wanted something that would be fast, easy, and portable.  These are the wipes for me.  I only bought the refills, but I think that I will just keep them in a plastic bag...less storage that way I guess.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes!! They work great for getting all the makeup off your face with only one wipe. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face that burns your eyes when you shower like some others do. Love these!</li>
    <li> I recently saw the commercial for this product on TV a couple weeks ago and just now ordered a pack for myself. The thing that I love the most about it is that there is no liquid! I love the towelette concept. I&#x27;ve used other makeup remover products in the past (mostly for waterproof makeup) that made my skin feel so greasy and gross afterward. And these previous products took way too long for me to take off my makeup. So when I tried Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes I was pleasantly surprised.    Pros: So convenient!! The towelettes stay moist and it isn&#x27;t messy like other liquid makeup removers. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or slick afterward, which was a great feeling. It was so easy to remove my make up, only takes about two wipes and about 99% of your make up is gone, even waterproof :) Also, the makeup residue doesn&#x27;t smear, the towelette catches all of the make up that was just wiped up so it doesn&#x27;t get smeared all around your eyes. It&#x27;s great. I would recommend anyone this product.    Cons: You do have to scrub a tiny bit for hard to wipe places such as the base of the eyelashes and eyeliner on the bottom of the eyelid. Which is understandable because those are hard to get places on the first couple of swipes. But this is not a problem of all because the ease of removing the make up in every other place is great. The only other con of this product is that when you are trying to remove eyeliner on the bottom eyelid, it does burn your eye if it does make contact with your eye. It&#x27;s not a very intense burn, like soap, but it does sting for about 30 seconds or so. But you barely realize or feel it.     Great, great, great product!!!</li>
    <li> Shhhh...I use these for a quick clean up after working out at the gym. They get all the sweat and grime off my face and neck, and I also wipe my shoulders and arms, all with one piece, so I don&#x27;t have to splash water all over myself. A few wipes and I&#x27;m on my way. Plus, they&#x27;re easy to carry in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> These makeup remover towelettes are fantastic!  They take off everything very easily without the need to rub excessively.  The scent is light and nice and the texture is really soft.  First, I use these towelettes to remove my makeup. Next I oil cleanse with Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Then I use my DermaNew Wand to cleanse my skin with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser.  I do all of these steps to ensure that ALL of my makeup is gone.  My skin is oily/acne-prone and any reside left on my skin will break me out, so I like to be safe.    The Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes do an excellent job removing all the makeup on the surface of my skin.  The other steps help to clean deep down.    For $4 you really cannot go wrong!</li>
    <li> Best make up removing wipes</li>
    <li> I prefer the towelettes that have to be moistened in the sink since they feel like they clean my skin better, but when I&#x27;m exhausted and don&#x27;t want to get up to wash my face, these moist towelettes definitely do their job well getting almost all of your makeup off (It takes a lot of effort to get eye makeup off with these though) and they&#x27;re extremely soft. They leave your face feeling smooth afterward, but it feels like there&#x27;s a thin layer it leaves on my skin which makes me breakout if I haven&#x27;t used them in a while. The towelettes feel a little dry, as if you had left the lid off, drying the moisture out of them but that&#x27;s just how they come as soon as you peel back the seal so it takes a little longer to wash your face with them then some other brands, but overall for a moist towelette these are my favorites, they do their job very well. Another plus is that the little baggies they come in are resealable which keeps them fresh longer!</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it removes make-up effectively. Most days, I only use one cloth. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> wonderful - I cannot say enough good things about these wipes - they really work!</li>
    <li> Definitely removes makeup well and didn&#x27;t leave a oily or thick residue on face after drying, just felt clean.  I used these on my daughters face after dance and on mine before bed when in a hurry to sleep so they are definitely gentle enough for both our skin.  It also has a nice light fragrance to it that smelled clean.  I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> These things work great, they don&#x27;t keep anything on your skin that will bother you and they remove makeup quickly and easily.  well worth the price too!</li>
    <li> My mother taught me that I should never go to bed without washing my face, but she didn&#x27;t tell me what to after a long night out when simply making it to bed is an accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter these babies.  I keep them in my nightstand and when I&#x27;m too tired to do my normal ritual, these work just fine.  One cloth is moist enough to remove all my face and eye makeup and have enough clean cloth left for an extra swipe over my face.  They prevent breakouts and leave my skin soft, which is pretty much all I could ever ask for in a makeup removing cloth.</li>
    <li> great way to remove makeup. makes it so much easier especially at the end of the day when you are tired</li>
    <li> Good to remove makeup. These are handy to use, but I don&#x27;t use them around my eyes. I believe they would stretch the tissue around that delicate area.</li>
    <li> this product arrived promptly. it&#x27;s actually very wet lol and stings (not stings like oww it hurts, stings like tingly) the areas around the eyes for a few minutes, but it gets everything off. i had to wipe a few times to get lash adhesive off but it is the best make up remover i&#x27;ve used, i would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Neutrogena towelettes states that it takes off hard to remove make-up...although it does take off most of it i wouldn&#x27;t say it takes it all off. Its not a harsh product which is nice but i wouldn&#x27;t rely on these to clean all make up off.</li>
    <li> So I recently purchased this item and it was shipped off early. I was suppose to get it around the 30th but I got it a day early. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It&#x27;s very easy to take off your makeup. I&#x27;m glad I bought this :)</li>
    <li> I love these make up removers. I&#x27;ve used them for years and they really get the makeup off. EVEN MASCARA!!! And I love that I could buy four of these for the price of two at the local pharmacy. GREAT BARGAIN! I will definitely buy them only from Amazon now.</li>
    <li> These work great and they remove waterproof mascara and do not leave any oily residue.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> My favorite make-up remover :)</li>
    <li> Until I found these about a year ago I had removed my makeup with cleansing cream and MANY tissues for decades (I had a friend once comment that I should buy stock in the paper companies!) Always a messy job but one which I had to do since I believe in complete nightly makeup removal in order to keep skin as healthy and beautiful as possible.  I hesitated on getting these the first time, thinking that the cost was a bit high for \\&quot;convenience\\&quot;.  After the first use I realized that these towelettes are not just very convenient but an absolute necessity if you want almost complete makeup removal that won&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave a basket full of dirty, cleansing cream filled tissues. They are very efficient in removing both facial and eye makeup, including mascara. I usually follow up their use by washing my face with the clear Neutrogena bar since I don&#x27;t think any towelette will completely remove all makeup, and finish off my face washing both morning and night with the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream. It was never my intention to purchase primarily Neutrogena products but this is certainly the way it&#x27;s turned out in terms of my skin: the products are good and at a good price.  Additionally, you can \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; to items you use on a regular basis on amazon....I do so with these towelettes and cannot get a better price anywhere.  I should mention that if you have oily skin I think Neutrogena also makes a makeup removing towelette that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
    <li> things things are magical</li>
    <li> I love these wipes! I have tried quite a few other brands and I always come back to these. They don&#x27;t smell horrendous or irritate my skin and best of all, I don&#x27;t have to fight to get my makeup off. Plus, they&#x27;re a great price.</li>
    <li> Mostrly because they are gentle, remove mascara easily, and one wipe is enough for my whole face. Soft, plushy, thick wipes dont tear/shred or let the makeup bleed thru to the other side, so you can really use both sides to full effect. Do not dry the face out at all.</li>
    <li> These towelettes are great for everyday use and traveling.  They clear makeup and everyday dirt. They also leave the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Product performs as advertised. Removes even waterproof make-up and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this if you are looking for a fast, effective, facial cleaner that works as good or better than advertised and fits in your purse!</li>
    <li> These towels do what they are supposed to do. They cleanse and remove makeup.  If you are looking for something that meets expectations that this is the product for you. However, look elsewhere if you are looking for something that makes you go \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;! Because this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe using this twice had such an effect on my skin. It made what were fine lines look like creases. The visible outer layer of skin looked moisturized, yet creases appeared. I was confused. I am now wondering what I can do with the 24 wipes I have left. I&#x27;m not even sure they are fit for wiping my dogs bum. I don&#x27;t suppose he minds wrinkles there, but I have to wonder if the product may cause issues on a delicate area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anybody else noticed this effect?</li>
    <li> These are very handy, and seem to take off the majority of my makeup, but not all.  If you have normal to oily skin they are probably great.  My skin is more on the dry side, and I found that after I used these for a few days my skin became even more dry and it began to sting when I used them.  Now I keep them for airplane travel or camping, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them on a daily basis with dry skin.</li>
    <li> These wipes are great for stubborn makeup, and they&#x27;re thick, soft, and moist. The problem is that when I take off my mascara, the liquids get into my eyes more easily than other remover wipes and it stings a bit. It also leaves a kind of greasy/lotiony residue on my face, which I didn&#x27;t like. But still, if I&#x27;m one of the few who has this problem then by all means, buy it.</li>
    <li> i keep this in my purse incase i stay out late and have to sleep over at a friend&#x27;s house (once they didn&#x27;t even have bar soap for me to wash my face with... ) and it does the trick.     the only two things is that i do tend to use a lot of these, so i run out between paychecks of two weeks and if i dont rinse my face the juice in the wipes really burns my eyes (i sleep on my face)</li>
    <li> This is one of the better makeup remover towelettes I&#x27;ve tried.  It gets my make-up off easily with the exception of my waterproof mascara.  I also wear a gel eyeliner and it takes it off after several wipes which is better than most other towelettes.  Overall, I recommend it but my husband isn&#x27;t a fan of the smell.  I don&#x27;t mind but when I use this at night and go to bed, he comments every time that it smells.</li>
    <li> I have used several cleaning clothes before with mainly poor results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the product was overly scented, irritated my skin, or the towelette was rough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mixed results with Neutrogena in the past but took a chance on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell is light but not overpowering and dissipates from skin quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. the towelette is soft, does not break apart or leave lint even when using with more of a heavy scrubbing motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. the cleansers do not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very please with this product and happy I took the risk with it.  However as anyone who has sensitive skin knows what works for one person may or may not work for another.</li>
    <li> I love these little guys! The cloths are so soft and smooth, and always get off all my makeup. They don&#x27;t leave a greasy-like residue like the night ones in the purple packaging. The only downside is that the seal doesn&#x27;t stick throughout use of the whole package. However, they seem not to dry out, anyway. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been buying it for years now. I decided to buy it on Amazon with the subscribe and save and I am now saving money on them and they show up right to my door!</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is awesome. It takes EVERYTHING off...I love it. It is so expensive in the grocery store, but here, super cheap. It lasts for about a month, if you wear makeup about 5 times a week.</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive when it comes to makeup remover, especially my eyelids and the skin around my eyes.  This is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t irriate my skin or burn my eyes and I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds.  It removes all kinds of makeup, even waterproof and leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of wipes in hopes of finding something a little less expensive that works as well. Let me tell you, these wipes are worth the cost! The off brand wipes I have used in the past have been scratchy, and do not do the job near as well as the Neutrogena ones do! I will definitely be sticking with  Neutrogena from here on out!</li>
    <li> It burns while while wiping. at first it did not burn but I continue using it, and it doses burn.</li>
    <li> these are tested on animals!  that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use water proof mascara and these wipes remove all make up. They arent too greasy, arent fragranced. Great item!</li>
    <li> Even with the toughest mascara, these wipes worked well under my eyes without causing discomfort you often get.  They have a nice moisturizer and I think are a good value for the money.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use the Neutrogena Makeup Remover towelettes a LOT, and I love them.  They are great for those nights that a normal cleansing routine either isn&#x27;t possible, or that I&#x27;m just too tired to complete.  These wipes remove every bit of makeup easily, including waterproof mascara!  They&#x27;re very refreshing even when you&#x27;ve not worn any makeup, but want to cleanse your face of sweat, dirt, etc at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use for them is when my tween daughter and her friends do \\&quot;makeovers\\&quot;; the wipes are very gentle and clean off all the many layers of makeup that the Future Models of America tend to apply.  I can then send everyone to their respective homes without cringing.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these towelettes for their economic value (one towelette goes a long way!), their thorough cleansing, and for their gentleness on my and my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t written a review. This is my must have. Anywhere I go, I take this. One towelette is enough to get all of my make-up off. And I use heavy concealers, and foundation, and ton loads of eye-shadows and mascara. I don&#x27;t even use a face wash or any other thing. I sometimes rinse with water, and apply a moisturizer before sleep. My skin is so soft and clean. If you apply makeup, you need this.</li>
    <li> Best make-up remove towelettes. Glides off make up sooo easy and nicely!</li>
    <li> Like all Neutrogena products, these wipes are high quality and easy  to use.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite make up removers! I always leave them next to my sink for a night out to make sure it removes all the make up. One flaw to this product, the resealable top doesn&#x27;t last and the wipes get dry.</li>
    <li> This product is incredibly effective in removing makeup without damaging the skin. I had bought these to clean my face, but hadn&#x27;t really tested their strength as makeup removers or their gentleness on the skin until halloween a couple of years ago when I decided to dress as a witch. I couldn&#x27;t find halloween makeup anymore (I decided what to be at the last minute, and there aren&#x27;t very many costume makeup places where I live anyway), so I decided to mix green food coloring with foundation. Let me tell you, it&#x27;s the best makeup I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s a PAIN to get off! I tried several different creams on different spots of my face before I tried these (I live in Mexico, so I didn&#x27;t want to run out), but in the end I found that NOTHING took off the concoction except for these! And they not only removed the makeup, but they also left my skin feeling baby smooth and hydrated. I wouldn&#x27;t trade these for the world!</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. With any other makeup remover pads, I have to use at least two or three to get all of my eye makeup off. However, the size of these makes it really easy to get everything off my face using less than one towelette, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy residue. My face just feels clean and fresh after I use them.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with these makeup removing wipes. It&#x27;s very cheap yet very effective. Less effort on my end especially when removing stubborn mascara and dark eyeshadow and liner. I use it every day and sometimes, I don&#x27;t even wash my face anymore afterwards because it cleanses good too.</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on its good reviews but didn&#x27;t find it removes make-up very efficiently. I use non-watertight mascara but it still requires a lot of rubbing to get rid of the last trace of mascara. Especially in the sensitive eye region, I didn&#x27;t want to rub to strongly (ruining the hard work of the age and wrinkle defying creme). On a plus side, it does not irritate the eyes.</li>
    <li> Left my eyelids dry and peeling; no amount of moisturizer could help. I have combination skin and this was just too harsh around my eye area. I switched to the hydrating Neutrogena wipes and voila, no more dry eyelids.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo36STCBVNO798S]]DISCLAIMER: I did not buy this off of Amazon. The reason I&#x27;m reviewing this is because I like Amazon not just for buying products but for the reviews. Before I make a purchase I like to look at what people think, not just go head and make a purchase. I look at several sites, but I like Amazon the most because I feel people are little more educated in their reviews, and if other people do the same things as I do, then this hopefully will help.</li>
    <li> If the price stays low enough, these are worth getting again.</li>
    <li> They work great soo yeah</li>
    <li> I love every Neutrogena product.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many cleansing cloths, and nothing works as good as these.&lt;br /&gt;I have a Rosacea and my skin is extremely sensitive. These towelettes calm my face, doesn&#x27;t irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect not only as a make up remover. I use them as refreshing wipes as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna keep buying them. Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> awesome for a clean feel and removes most of the make up.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes. They easily take of my makeup and leave my skin feeling fresh and clean. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It removes make up well enough and it has this refreshing feeling - I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it a tingle but something a little softer than that, along the same lines. My problem with this, especially because I use it for my eye makeup, is that the cloth is kind of rough - that would be nice if it were marketed as an exfoliating cloth but it&#x27;s marketed as \\&quot;Ultra-soft Cloths\\&quot; which they are not.      Shipping: it shipped really fast (ordered it on a sat and arrived on monday when it should have arrived on wed.).</li>
    <li> Love these wipes. They get all my makeup off with one wipe and I love how moisturizing they are. especially great for the winter time.</li>
    <li> These work well for removing make-up.</li>
    <li> Sleeping in makeup is a no-no; so I bought these for those really late nights. When I&#x27;m about to drop and need a quick makup remover and this does it. Not quite as good as washing your face but still better than sleeping in makeup.</li>
    <li> These things work really well. On the package, it says that it will take off waterproof mascara and it does and it does really well. I can go from face full of makeup to no makeup at all in less than two minutes. They are convenient enough that I can bring them everywhere with me. I really love them and they smell nice :)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I hate this product. I thought that this wipe wasn&#x27;t going to have a smell, WRONG! After I cleanse my face, that smell stayed on my face for hours.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best, gentlest eye make up remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Been using these pads for years now and won&#x27;t try another now.  Also love the smell, a very clean scent.  I do not know if they sell scent-free version.</li>
    <li> This is the only makeup removed stuff I&#x27;ve been using for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Other products have burned my skin and face off and or have broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;But not this stuff! It&#x27;s gentle and collects all the gunk beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommended after using this product to rinse your face with cool water then waiting 5minutes and then continue your facial regimen  to avoid any possible irritation.</li>
    <li> After a long, tiring day at work- these things do wonders to remove smudged makeup and grim from the day. They smell fantastic and are so refreshing- you feel squeaky clean! I wear contacts and since these aren&#x27;t oil based they don&#x27;t mess up my contacts and make them funky.   I just wish the wipes were a tad smaller, I actually rip the sheets in 1/3rds to prevent waste. Gotta love the price too!</li>
    <li> the Towelette is very rough........makes my skin uncomfortable, I dont even what to finish the whole pack. I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> I have used this item for years.  Just as good as any dept store cosmetic line.  Pricing is excellent. I give these as stocking stuffers for my 2 adult girls.  They love the product also.</li>
    <li> just what i need. it removes all makeup just like it says</li>
    <li> Removes makeup pretty well but they seem to irritate my skin.  First time I used them I thought I had sunburn without going outside and then I realized it was this product.  Won&#x27;t get these again. I use a lot of Neutrogena products and are usually very happy with them.</li>
    <li> remove almost all the makeups. mild and almost no smells. love it.</li>
    <li> My wife (of course) found out about this product and this is her second order for this product. She has always found Neutrogena products to perform above and beyond her expectations and they have not let her (Us) down. WE use their Rainbath Soap for&lt;br /&gt;years. Great in the shower.</li>
    <li> These are great, I only wish they were half the size.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I will cut them in half and get 50 instead of 25.</li>
    <li> Just like love at first sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily and it is very gently on my skin and tough on the make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t have to rinse or use any other facial wash if I am in a rush or lazy at 3 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a couple minutes to get all the layers off and sweet dreams!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These wipes remove all makeup, even my favorite waterproof eyeliner (which is a pain to remove). I recommend them to everyone looking to get rid of all traces of makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying nearly every kind of makeup remover pad and wipe I can get my hands on. These were my latest purchase, and I think they&#x27;re my favorite yet. They&#x27;re lightly-fragranced but they don&#x27;t cause any eye irritation (this is a problem I&#x27;ve been having with other products). They&#x27;re quite soft, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, perhaps most importantly, they&#x27;re effective. They remove waterproof mascara better than the other makeup remover pads and wipes I&#x27;ve tried. They also take away eyeliner, eyeshadow, and lip stain with ease. They&#x27;re large enough to use on your whole face although I prefer to remove foundation with cleanser, and you can use both sides (i.e., if you don&#x27;t want to touch your mouth and eyes with the same side of the cloth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely glad I tried these!</li>
    <li> I like to keep these beside my bed for lazy nights and to bring with me on flights.  They are handy, but I don&#x27;t find they take off as much makeup as other cleansing products.  They also dry out quickly once you open a packet, so it can be a good idea to switch them into a ziplock bag.  They are the best I have found in cleansing towelettes.</li>
    <li> We continue to go through these in our house and buy more.  Good price and great product that we recommend...</li>
    <li> I LOVE these makeup wipes. To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t care less about taking amazing care of my skin and having this long ritual every night with $100 creams and moisturizers and masks. This and a little drugstore moisturizer is all I need at night, and most nights I don&#x27;t even moisturize. All I care about is waking up with a clean slate to put makeup on and these get the job done where taking makeup off is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are absolutely amazing. Neutrogena really does mean it when they say that it takes off even waterproof mascara- because that&#x27;s what I wear absolutely every time I put on makeup (my lashes are stubborn and don&#x27;t like to hold curl). A couple wipes across my face and a little extra work on my eyes and I am makeup-free within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested these to see if they really do take off everything and they really do. After I take off my makeup I just like to refresh my face with a little water and when I wipe the water off with a WHITE towel, there is NO makeup left. I&#x27;m so happy with these wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Take EVERYTHING off&lt;br /&gt;-Very moist - STORE UPSIDE DOWN so the ones at the top don&#x27;t dry out&lt;br /&gt;-Last 30 days (well duh)&lt;br /&gt;-Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Nice smell, not overpowering at all&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t sting when it gets in your eyes- (unlike the night calming version of these!! watch out for those)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-NOTHING, and after purchasing these more than 20 times, I still haven&#x27;t found any problems. Though as always I&#x27;ll edit my review if I find something wrong with the product after I write this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Neutrogena products. I have been using them for the last 15 years and was excited when they came out with make up wipes, it makes it easy to remove all off my make-up especially stubborn (MAC) eye makeup even when wearing contacts. I don&#x27;t worry about the cleanser affecting my eyes or my contacts. I use both the regular blue packs and the night calming depending on the time of year. Bought a bunch for summer travel abroad, which made packing easier and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about 3oz product limits and having a liquid bottle cleanser and cotton remover pads.</li>
    <li> Always a good product!</li>
    <li> These face wipes work well for getting off makeup and dirt.  Some brands cause my skin to break out but these do not.  Very mild fragrance and your face feels refreshed.</li>
    <li> The best mackeup remover ever that&#x27;s my second time order it , and let me tell you I love it , it removed everything and it keep your skin moisture and clean, love , love , love it</li>
    <li> I have a oily face in general but I have to wash after clearing my makeup when I use this cause it leaves an oily residue on my face that wont go away.</li>
    <li> This product deserves ten stars</li>
    <li> The pack can sometimes not seal all the way so make sure it is closed or else they will try out. Very comfortable on the skin. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love these makeup removing clothes.  It makes my nighttime routine much easier and it makes my face feel clean before I go to bed.  Im not a huge fan of the smell especially since I smell it all night long but I think Im getting used to it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have this product it&#x27;s worth to have this,it&#x27;s taking less time for my makeup to remove.</li>
    <li> I was worried that these would sting my eyes, but the remove eye makeup completely without any discomfort.  One wipe will take off quite a bit of eye makeup completely.  I never travel without these.</li>
    <li> Been using these for over five years.  Product is the best would highly recommend.  Very easy to use and store.</li>
    <li> Favorite makeup remover ever!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would remove my makeup easily at the end of my long and tired day. This failed at removing makeup even when I scrub hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is it makes my face feel fresh and smell nice.</li>
    <li> i like this makeup remover. My only problem with it, is that it feels rough against my skin.</li>
    <li> The equate brand from walmart are 10 fold better than these. Cheaper, thicker, wetter and actually work better. Save your money ppl.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It takes off mascara and liner with ease.  My face feels clean and fresh afterward.  There is almost no scent and no greasy feeling.  I just buy the refills and skip getting the plastic case.</li>
    <li> These work great - they are quick to use and are effective in getting make up off (and are also great for a quick wash of the face post sunscreen, etc). I found they left my skin feeling on the dry side, though, so be sure to have some moisturizer handy for after. Still, when you&#x27;re in a rush and want a quick clean, these are a great option. They also work great at removing eye make up, giving a little more precision than just general soap and water kind of stuff.</li>
    <li> I keep these with me at work and use them when I work long shifts.  Really love how clean they leave my skin, but also moisturized.  Very mild scent which is great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Cleaned my face my normal way and then used these towelettes. Was surprised how much dirt was still on my face.  I will never go back to soap and water cleansing again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing makeup and a lot cheaper than buying in the store. I ordered enough to always have one in my makeup in case of a quick trip. Can&#x27;t be without them,.</li>
    <li> I have tried other make up removers and they just don&#x27;t compare to these. I have been using these for over a year and I will continue to use them. They don&#x27;t require too much force to remove the make up and most of it will come off with one cloth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....they not only get rid of all my make-up at the end of the day, but moisturize my skin as well and smell good too. I have issues with rosacea on my cheeks and these don&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing tough makeup.  Much easier than dirtying a rag every night to wash off the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package is resealable, so the wipes don&#x27;t dry out.  Easy to use package, easy to use product.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena makes a VERY good makeup removing wipe!  I NEED these things!  I use them every day.  I usually only have eye makeup on (but a lot) and some blush, but even if I have on a full face-full of makeup, I can usually get it all off with just one wipe.  I have never found a wipe that gets makeup off the first time, and neither does this.  But it does work with no irritation to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered that if I store them with the opening on the bottom, it seals in the moisture and they don&#x27;t dry out.  If they do dry out, I just add some water, and they are good to go.  I recommend these.</li>
    <li> These are so much easier than washing your face the old fashioned way. This is the only face product I use now, and somewhat surprisingly my face has never been clearer!</li>
    <li> I used this before bed when I&#x27;m in a hurry to sleep.  The wipes aren&#x27;t that big and you have to keep going over the same spot to get it done. Doesn&#x27;t small too bad though, like some.  I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
    <li> Good price. You can use save and subscribe option too.&lt;br /&gt;And it hasn&#x27;t caused any allergies or skin troubles. So pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> I first bought these in 2014 and I still think they&#x27;re really great. Thick, but not too thick, hardly any fragrance, and everything came off easily. My face didn&#x27;t feel sticky, greasy, or tight afterwards either. It actually made cleaning my face and removing make up ridiculously simple.</li>
    <li> This definitely removes makeup, even stubborn mascara. So it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Try it!</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite makeup remove. they are oily so they work great and remove make up easily and efficiently. i only need one to take off makeup from my whole face including eyes.</li>
    <li> Best towelettes I&#x27;ve ever tried. It does a great job at removing all of my makeup. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
    <li> These wipes are great! I use them almost every day because they work so well. They are really soft, which makes it much easier to get off all of your eye makeup and they don&#x27;t dry out your skin at all. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick makeup remover these are what you need to get!</li>
    <li> Removes my mascara (non-waterproof loreal) with no problems! Even though these wipes leave a little bit of an oily residue, it seems to clean my face without causing breakouts. I just wipe my face afterwards with a towel and my skin feels moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package kind of sucks because the sticker loses its stick after a few uses, but wipes never seem to dry out... Not sure how they managed that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cleansing cloths for 5-6 years. I have very dry skin, and this brand gets every bit of makeup off, including mascara, and leaves my face feeling both clean and moisturized. I do follow up with my cream (probably can&#x27;t identify the brand in this review), but anyone with less dry skin would feel sufficiently moisturized without the cream. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very soft and moist. The makeup comes off in seconds. I normally don&#x27;t use makeup remover wipes but washing my face after each time made it very dry and irritated. The wipes work a lot better than your regular facial wash and water. Very quick and efficient and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Makeup remover cleansing towelettes for a long time. They easily remove heavy&lt;br /&gt;mascara leaving your face feeling clean.</li>
    <li> It is actually cheaper and faster to get this at Target. If I could subscribe and save with this I would.</li>
    <li> These wipes will remove ANYTHING you put on your face.  I need to wear costume makeup, Ben Nye clown white all over my face, and other costume makeup around my eyes.  These things will take off ANYTHING without having to scrub harshly.&lt;br /&gt;The flip side is, they leave such a nasty residue on my face I absolutely have to wash my face again to get it feeling clean and fresh.  It&#x27;s a very oily residue on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Also, that oily residue really irritates my eyes if any gets in, which is inevitable when removing eye makeup, so I don&#x27;t use these for my daily makeup removal.  I use the Simple wipes for daily use, and these Neutrogena wipes for the heavy performance/costume makeup.</li>
    <li> These little toweletts are wonderful. They leave my skin feeling soft, smooth and refreshed![[ASIN:B0010XUU9M Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes, Refill Pack, 25 Count]]</li>
    <li> The cloth is quite soft and it cleans really well. However, I still purchased other products to get rid of mascara because generally towelettes just don&#x27;t get between my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup removers ever :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell good and they work on practically everything with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is an unsung hero of make up removers.  Yes, it feels like it deposits a bunch of moisture onto your face, but it removes ALL mascara and ALL eye make up...unlike other cleansers.  Also, it moisturizes.  I have Rosacea AND very sensitive skin and I feel like this product makes my skin healthier (and I&#x27;m not being paid to write that).  I sometimes use it at night before bed even if I&#x27;m not wearing make up - just to get the moisture and clean skin.  I wait for it to dry to use other products for my night time routine.</li>
    <li> these are thin and they make me breakout.  I&#x27;ve had better luck buying the CVS brand that matches the Cold Cream brand.  The wipes are much thicker and remove ALL make up completely.  I still wash my face after using them to ensure I don&#x27;t break out, but I&#x27;ve never tried not washing my face after using the CVS brands.  These just are not thick enough to remove ALL make up and are no replacement for actually washing my face.</li>
    <li> I like these wipes. They make cleaning the face so easy, specially at the end of the day when I can hardly wait to get to bed. They remove all make up completely very easily. I do wash my face with a mild facial soap, as a final touch to clean my face thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I really like these makeup towelettes. Really gets all the makeup off and believe me, I&#x27;ve used a ton of eye makeup recently. Concealer and foundation take some time but not as long as other makeup remover brands! I also love the smell - very fresh. Recommend to anyone wanting to take off their makeup at night before cleaning their faces (makes it a LOT easier too).</li>
    <li> I have used these for years now and love them! They remove my makeup quickly, even my waterproof mascara! They do not make your face feel greasy at all! You simply wipe your face and eyes a few times, toss it in the trash, and voila! You are now ready for bed! love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the commercials. I thought a towelette would be easier than using several cotton balls. I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!! I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well. After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin). It works great and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
    <li> I adore this product so much! I am a mix combination skin, I get HIGHLY oily throughout the day but I also have dry skin if I do not moisturize daily, if not twice daily. Whenever I try to use other products to take off makeup it gives me bad blemishes all over,  but this one actually smoothes and betters my skin. It is softer in the morning. I use this to take off my make and then use cetaphil and my skin looks great! Also, remember to hydrate, that has a HUGE effect on how your skin looks. BUY THIS ladies and gents, it is non irritating and you can get it at a GREAT price at Costco. Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I used to damage all my washcloths until I found this product.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and so simple!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other types of makeup remover wipes and they either didn&#x27;t get all the makeup off or made my sensitive skin itchy and red.  Granted, I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I still love these for when I&#x27;m too tired to do my nightly skin routine and can just wipe and go.  They&#x27;re also really good for travel, just put a few in a ziploc bag and they&#x27;ll stay fresh.</li>
    <li> Luv it! Best wipe ever!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes.  They will remove everything!!! Now I use a face cloth with a make up remover wash first, then I follow up with these wipes for a complete cleaning of eye make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The softness of the wipes allows me to make a few rubs over my eye lids to get that eyeliner off the top of my lip at the base of my lashes.  I actually use the same cloth 2 maybe 3 times before tossing it. Wipes are thick, soft and great for sensitive skin like mine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I suggest storing this packet in a ziplock baggie (if you don&#x27;t have the hard box) as after enough open and closes it does loose it&#x27;s sticky.  I store it with the sticky side down to seal in the moisture.</li>
    <li> Favorite face wipes ever. These are definitely gentle on the skin if you have sensitive skin and it removes the makeup very well. The cloths are soft and strong.  Of course if you are too rough can poke a finger through it, but I love them.  They are not too wet or dry, they are just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different makeup removers, and these towelettes are definitely my favorite.  If I&#x27;m really tired, I know I won&#x27;t bother with cleansers that I have to rinse off with water (splashing water on my face makes me wide awake), but I never have an excuse not to take off my makeup with these.  Just a few quick swipes, and your makeup is off.  No water needed. I think the size and thickness of the cloths makes them better than other towelettes.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin, and can barely wear make up, let alone use many products on my face for cleaning.  I bought these because the makeup I can wear, I can&#x27;t wear overnight or my skin will break out in an awful rash.  So I brought them home and used them.  They cleared my makeup right off, super easily.  My skin felt a little tingly, so I was worried they&#x27;d make me break out but they didn&#x27;t.  They do leave a little residue, but for me, it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  Almost like I&#x27;d just applied lotion to my skin.   I like the smell, too.  Would buy them again (and will) in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> this works great for removing eyemake up and leaves your skin feeling smooth.its gentle and does not irritate skin. scent is mild. it says you dont have to rinse, but i always do. i would recommend. i bought a cheaper costco brand which does not work as well.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time, whether it&#x27;s first thing in the morning (when my eye make-up is smeared across my face) or just to clean up accidental smudges of mascara.  Most of the EFFECTIVE eye make-up removers are oily -- this is not.  It&#x27;s gentle, non-greasy, and feels so clean.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite wipes, and Amazon sells them for less than my local drugstore. It&#x27;s a perfect item to keep on auto-order. Thank you Amazon, for making my life a bit easier, and helping keep my skin clean... AND I get to avoid another errand!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a couple years now and I will never buy another makeup remover as long as these are sold. They aren&#x27;t oily nor greasy. They remove water proof mascara and they actually help moisturize my face. The price is incredible compared to other make up removers/face wash. Definitely recommend to anybody!</li>
    <li> This product is great for travel. I mostly use it when I need a quick and easy face wash.Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and clean make-up off quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few different brands of makeup removing pads but the greatest this about these are that they are so big you can basically clean your entire face at one time.  They make things so much easier at the end of a long day and you just want to get in bed.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  I no longer dread removing my makeup!  I even use these before I take my nighttime shower to make sure my skin is really clean before bed.  I open the cloth and refold into quarters, start with my forehead and work my way down, turning the cloth around and refolding as I go, saving the eye area for last.  They don&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but occasionally I do get a little in my eye and it just feels slightly oily. No burning!  I sometimes wear bright eyeshadows that can stain but this product takes care of that without rubbing my skin off in the process.  I get it using the subscribe and save feature, so it ships to me automatically every month so I don&#x27;t run out. I love not having to add it to my shopping list. Very easy!  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought a huge box of these at Costco last month, thinking they&#x27;d be good for travel or for those nights I just don&#x27;t feel like doing the whole face wash routine.  Turns out, there are a whole lots of nights I don&#x27;t want to do the entire skin care bit.  These things are wonderful, and my skin looks amazing!  My pores are invisible, my skin feels hydrated even without moisturizing, and I&#x27;m loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may replace my current products.</li>
    <li> Easy, effective and fast clean, skin feels refresh and breathable. Sometimes feels to need 2 towelettes for heavy eye makeup. A must buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased these pads @ Costco (yes too many) after seeing the commercial &amp; always being reasonably satisfied w Neutrogena products. Well there&#x27;s a first for everything, and this was it. I had to struggle to remove the waterproof mascara they claimed they would. After pink lids &amp; a bottle of baby oil the job was done, but not with this product.Shame on the well known star that endorses this poduct, its obvious shes never tried it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, with rosacea along with some acne related to the rosacea.  I have been looking for a great product like this that won&#x27;t irritate my skin when I take my makeup off or cause me further breakouts.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I love these so much, on a recent trip I forgot my travel ones and purchased another package in the store.  I won&#x27;t go without them to take my makeup off!</li>
    <li> I purchased these makeup removing towelettes to have on hand while on vacation. With space being at a premium in my suitcase, I didn&#x27;t want to have to haul anything extra or unnecessary. These were extremely convenient to have. I also like to use them at the end of busy days when I don&#x27;t feel like going through my whole skin care regimen. They have a fantastic rose smell to them, too. Overall, I definitely recommend these to a friend and will likely buy them again.</li>
    <li> These wipes work great for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These are great and leaves your face moisturized after.</li>
    <li> I got this item yesterday morning, and was anxious to try it after my day ended. Once home from work and ready to relax, I used the towelettes to start removing my make up. It quickly, it one pass removed most of it. I mainly wear a bit of eye shadow, line, and a fair amount of mascara. The mascara and liner is always my hardest thing to get off, leaving me looking like a racion. But this product EASILY got it all off. The reason for 4 stars is it did leave an oily residue for a bit. My skin has absorbed most of it, but I&#x27;m not sure if i like that feeling. Overall, great product. I would buy this again. Saves lots of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 years and love it. Works on waterproof mascara, sometimes it does need pressure on eyes product and hurt my eyes a little bit, but it just like 10 seconds. Will recommend this one. Also easy to throw it in luggage when i have to travel</li>
    <li> I used to use MAC&#x27;s makeup removal facial wipes, but wanted to give this a try because I wanted a cheaper alternative and this one had good reviews. I&#x27;m half way through 1 package, and I break out more than usual. I think these wipes are oil based and I&#x27;m oily around T-zone to begin with, so I don&#x27;t feel clean after each use, and feel that there&#x27;s oil residual on my skin afterwards. I&#x27;m going back to the more expensive option that actually works for my skin.</li>
    <li> I picked up a trial size package of these out of curiosity because I was tired of trying to scrub makeup off of my face with water and a washcloth in the evening when I couldn&#x27;t wash my face properly. They just work. It takes off waterproof mascara, etc. completely, the towelettes are not abrasive and irritating, and it leaves my skin feeling soft without feeling oily or causing breakouts. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Package was opened when I received</li>
    <li> So convenient.  They are always moist, not dried out, no matter what time of year. They do get off the mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m officially addicted to this product.  I already use a great face wash (philosophy purity) that does an amazing job taking off my make up.  I honestly only purchased these because I was going on vacation and wanted to take a make up remover with me.  I had no idea they would be so large.  They&#x27;re like the size of a wash cloth.  They work so well and do not irritate my eyes at all.  I hate make up removers because they leave my skin feeling sticky...not these.  They are not sticky feeling at all.  My face actually feels clean afterwards and I love them!!!!  I will definitely buy these again and I&#x27;m still amazed at how well they work without burning my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for removing eye makeup. It did cause the TSA to examine my bag, though, because they said these packs have enough water to look like liquids.  Still, I would use it again for travel.</li>
    <li> These work so great. They really do remove all your makeup, leaving you with a nice, clean, and refreshed face. They are not drying at all. The wipes don&#x27;t remove oil, so sometimes my face is a little oily afterwards. Great for when traveling. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I just received these wipes in the refill pack option a few days ago and have used them in the evenings since then. I really like Neutrogena products, I have used their eye makeup remover for quite a few years and it works amazingly.  Admittedly I do wear quite a lot of makeup so overall I was satisfied with the power of these wipes, they just don&#x27;t get absolutely ALL the makeup off my face. Also the remover on the wipes leaves a sort of film on the face so I recommend washing after using a wipe. I think compared to using nothing they are worth the buy--great price through Amazon too!</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin feels so much better after using this makeup remover. I would highly recommend it to people who have sensitive and dry skin like me.</li>
    <li> These babies are awesome. They don&#x27;t burn my eyes and they take off everything! I love the smell, too. Its like a clean, lotion smell. I still put on moisturizer after using these, but its nice that if I forget, my face doesn&#x27;t feel 3 sizes to small.</li>
    <li> Nothing beat this - takes off my eye makeup without me having to scrub. I&#x27;ve been using this same product for over a year and have yet to find anything better.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these. Takes off everything even the glue from wearing false lashes! Makes my skin feel very soft and smooth afterwards. I will definitely always, always buy these!!</li>
    <li> These are excellent make up remover wipes. Works especially good at getting mascara and eye liner off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do my own waxing at home and these are really good for removin excess wax off hands and face. Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> excelente producto. remueve el maquillaje y aparte de esto hidrata muy bien la piel al momento. lo recomiendo excelente producto.</li>
    <li> BEST makeup remover! It&#x27;s amazing how well it wipes off ALL makeup (besides eyelash glue... cause its glue) and still remains gentle. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn your face and with ease takes off eye shadow, blush, brow powder, etc etc. After a few simple wipes most of your makeup is gone. The cloth itself is nice and thick too so it won&#x27;t tear and you can get a lot off with one use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different eye makeup removers and this one by far is my favorite. Super easy and portable especially for traveling.</li>
    <li> Washing my face and removing make-up daily is important for me as it keeps my pours clear.  If I don&#x27;t do it every night my face break out in blemishes and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two favorite facial cleaners: Neutrogena Makeup (they come pre-moistened) for when I am traveling on somewhere on the go without easy access to water and Olay 2-in-1 Normal Daily Facial Cloths when I can wet them (these come dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTROGENA Makeup towelettes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like:&lt;br /&gt;  * Nice size, big enough to wash the entire face, and use a corner&lt;br /&gt;  for removing mascara&lt;br /&gt;  * I like how they leave my face soft and feeling clean without&lt;br /&gt;  any greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;  * They alcohol and paraben free so safe for eye makeup removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;  * I would have preferred if they scent free. They have a lavendar center which is not unpleasant,&lt;br /&gt;  but I would have preferred  unscented.&lt;br /&gt;  * Resealing mechanism does not always close well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLAY facial cloths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like:&lt;br /&gt;  * Cloths exfoliate and clean the face, very effective clearing pours. I love how my skin feels after using them.&lt;br /&gt;  * They are dry so no need to worry about the sealing mechanism and keeping them moist&lt;br /&gt;  * More cost effective than the wet towelettes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;  * Not the best option when need on the go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I finish with my face, I also use the wipes on my neck.  Nice to keep it clean and  exfoliate as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of these products has a place in my cleaning routine. I recommend them both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> These soft, pre-moistened face cloths are by far the best of all the products I&#x27;ve tried.  I ordered the unscented (blue packs) and they clean thoroughly without excessive tightness or drying, even removing mascara.  This is the only product that does not burn or sting my eyes or leave me with blurred vision.  I use these cloths at night, and have for several years.  If you&#x27;re like me and have trouble remembering to wash your face every night, using the Neutrogena pre-moistened cloths will definitely help.  The cloths stay moist for nearly a month in the refill pack, but if you have the plastic Neutrogena container, that works too. These do not come with the container, so you would need to buy it separately.  I leave them in the refill pack. The Amazon pricing paired with auto-delivery and free shipping makes these cloths a great bargain too!</li>
    <li> I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s face wipes.  They are perfect for taking to the gym and for removing make up before bed.  These wipes are really handy and takes off the make up very easily.</li>
    <li> I love this item. I&#x27;ve bought it more then once because it works so well. Takes my makeup right off extremely quick...even heavy caked on mascara. I am a customer of this product for life.</li>
    <li> For the purpose of full disclosure, I originally purchased these only to clean my makeup brushes while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to clean my makeup brushes that apply liquid-like makeup after each use because brushes with dried up makeup from a previous application simply do not apply makeup well!  I usually use a cotton ball with rubbing-alcohol, but I didn&#x27;t have room in my quart-size TSA bag for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These did a really good job of removing the makeup from my foundation and gel eyeliner brushes! I was very pleased with their performance and they don&#x27;t have to go into my TSA bag - I can put them in the suitcase and go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try them out on my face and did feel that sort of \\&quot;filmy\\&quot; sensation that others here have mentioned, but you should always properly wash your face even if you use a makeup remover, so it didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you currently use these and are looking for a new use, these are great for in-between brush cleanings to keep your brushes applying great while you are traveling :)</li>
    <li> I have tried other facial towelette cleansers and none compare to this. Your makeup comes off in one wipe no need to rub hard. And it&#x27;s gentle on my skin. No irritation.</li>
    <li> I rated this product with 5 stars because it removes all of my makeup without burning my eyes, and without leaving my skin oily.</li>
    <li> This removes makeup WONDERFULLY. Even waterproof mascara, heavy eyeliner, the works. This is my favorite makeup remover.</li>
    <li> These remove all make-up, even waterproof mascara.  However, they irritate my eyes a little bit (though this goes away).</li>
    <li> I tried these and found them to work well at removing makeup but they left my skin feeling a bit &#x27;slimy&#x27; for lack of a better work.  I just think there may be too much moisturizing in the product for me.  I let my son use them as he doesn&#x27;t like to take the time to wash his face properly and he really likes them, so it&#x27;s probably me.  I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Oil Free cleansing wipes and liked them much better for my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Love these - its great to get an easy refill on amazon for my original kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also love the product - don&#x27;t need to rinse after and easy for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great, easy portable make-up. face cleansing cloths.</li>
    <li> I wanted a quick alternative for when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face at night, but these are just not worth it.  The smell is unpleasant and they leave a strange filmy residue.  They do remove my make-up well, so I&#x27;ll give them that.</li>
    <li> I love these cleansing towels.  They will get off makeup even the 24 hr. kind in a flash.  They are a little pricey.</li>
    <li> These wipes really DO get all of my makeup off.  They work great for eye makeup, which is the whole purpose of my purchasing these. I use one before I get in the shower for 2 reasons. 1.) They burn my eyes and irritate the skin around them.&lt;br /&gt;2.) I dislike the residue these wipes leave on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;They really do work well... I just feel the need to still shower and wash my face after I use these. I&#x27;m trying a different brand once these are gone</li>
    <li> These makeup remover cleansing towels are the greatest.  They get every bit of makeup off and your skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes live up to their name.  They are easy to use, have a very clean, mild ad pleasant fragrance and do take off even stubborn mascara.</li>
    <li> I use these towelettes every night and I like them very well. I have tried others and find several acceptable brands. However, I order the Neutrogena with the subscribe and save feature on Amazon so I will always have a supply and they come at a cost savings which I appreciate. While they come each month as a refill pack, I keep them in the plastic case to help maintain moistness. However, when I travel I just pull out the refill pack and have never had a problem with them drying out.</li>
    <li> I love everything about these towelettes! They remove all my makeup, even mascara. They smell awesome. They leave your face feeling clean and moisturized. It only takes one to do the job everytime. They are soft and sturdy at the same time.</li>
    <li> This brand for towelettes has been the best for me. My skin is left clean, and not greasy. Other brands have given my skin a burning sensation, whereas with Neutrogena my skin gets some rest. I greatly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are the only face wipes I can use without it drying out, breaking out, or making my face greasy. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 7 years.</li>
    <li> Pleased with all purchases</li>
    <li> these works well to remove makeup, they don&#x27;t seem to leave my face sticky.. they are quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Usually I love neutrogena products but I HATED these makeup remover wipes. I hate how they smell and I dont like the way they make my skin feel. My face will be all sticky feeling and greasy looking. Will not buy ever again</li>
    <li> This removes makeup fast and easy leaving skin in better condition than before. Smells great and not oily or medicinal</li>
    <li> I have been using these makeup wipes for a long time. They are in a small, easily portable packet, and do a great job of removing makeup. The price on Amazon is lower than most stores, so it makes for a great place to get it. If you are looking for a good makeup wipe, try these out, I think you will like them.</li>
    <li> I like these but I find they are too big. I cut them into 4 squares and they&#x27;re perfect. Unless you use full face makeup, using a whole towelette is a waste. Using 1/4 of it at a time helps a lot.</li>
    <li> love these. they work very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a necessity for anyone who wears make up .  I have it auto shipped monthly its alway on time.</li>
    <li> I bought something that was a lower cost and threw those out.  If you are using this around your eyes, buy this.</li>
    <li> Always been skeptical about these make up &amp;#34;remover&amp;#34; cloths.  So I bought four different brands.  It&#x27;s shocking how well this works if you don&#x27;t want to go through the full wash, cleanse, tone, and moisturize ritual at night. Soft and gentle on the skin...light delicate scent... Of the four brands I like this the best.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face red and feeling like I&#x27;ve exfoilated and I have super sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t broken out.</li>
    <li> These towelettes deliver what they promise. They completely remove all makeup (including waterproof mascara and eyeliner) while leaving your face clean, soft, and refreshed. I&#x27;ve tried just about every other brand of pre-moistened towelette on the market and these are the best by far. They are great for traveling and for removing heavy duty, long wear eye makeup before it permanently marks your towels. Be sure to close the flap tightly after removing a towelette....the packs do tend to dry out. Check out the big box store that starts with a \\&quot;C\\&quot; and ends with an \\&quot;O\\&quot; for very good deals on this product.</li>
    <li> These are a good value and they arrived promptly and they remove makeup as expected. I really need to order a batch with the hard plastic container. After a few uses, the top on the refill package doesn&#x27;t stay closed well. My fault.</li>
    <li> Really DOES remove all makeup - I use these even at home (even though they&#x27;re good for travel) becuase they get all the eye makeup off, including waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does take the makeup right off your face. However as others mentioned, it does leave a thickish film on your face. I&#x27;ve been using the product for only a few days and have noticed tiny pimples that I have in regions where I NEVER break out usually. I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s just a common breakout or if these wipes caused it.</li>
    <li> My lazy, I don&#x27;t feel like Clarisonic-ing my face, go to.  Works great for even the caked on make up!</li>
    <li> I love these cleansing towelettes! They really work and they don&#x27;t dry my skin out. They just leave your face feeling clean. I&#x27;ve tried similar products from Burt&#x27;s Bees and Mary Kay and have always come back to the Neutrogena brand. They are simply the best!</li>
    <li> In previous years I haven&#x27;t had any issue with these wipes but in the past year they have the skin around my eye and eyelid to burn and become red, dry, and flaky. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider my skin to be that sensitive! Does effectively remove make up, however, much better suited for just the face.</li>
    <li> Never again will I come home late at night and dread taking off makeup before I can fall into bed. These things make quick work of even the most stubbornly waterproof mascaras and eyeliners. In less than a minute, I can have all that makeup off that took me 20 minutes to put on.</li>
    <li> I use these as soon as I get home from work. I wish I did not need to wear makeup because I don&#x27;t like how it feels on my skin. These towelettes make removing my makeup a breeze and they smell nice!</li>
    <li> excelent product, wipes away every trace of make up, it does really feel clean and soft, i definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge makeup/beauty/skincare fan and have tried products from dozens of different brands. Before these wipes, I had used MAC and Estee Lauder makeup cleansing towelettes. I loved them both, but saw these Neutrogena ones for a great price here on Amazon so picked up a pack. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from these wipes, as I use a pretty heavy-duty longwear foundation (Double Wear by Estee Lauder) but surprisingly they did take off a decent amount of my face makeup. I believe that removing your makeup and actually washing your face are two separate steps. So even though it didn&#x27;t take off 100% of my foundation I was okay with that as I always follow up by washing my face with a cleanser. My face didn&#x27;t feel overly clean after using them, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to. I think that will have a lot to do with the kind of makeup you use.  The pack says that these wipes can even remove \\&quot;waterproof mascara\\&quot; but to be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these towelettes on your eyes at all. I hardly have sensitive eyes, but these burned so much that my eyes were watering for quite some time after. I ended up using a standard dual-action eyemakeup remover on a cotton pad instead of these on my eyes. Ouch. :(  The wipes were neither over-saturated nor overly dry. The pack has a resealable sticker that has held up so far and keeps the wipes moist.  I rated them 3/5 because though they&#x27;re not perfect, at the sale price I paid for them I was satisfied. :)</li>
    <li> well the cleansing towlettes aren&#x27;t helpful if they are a bit dried out.  my guess is the pack i got was old.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and would recommend it to others. It is nice and convent to take on trips and especially on camping trips.</li>
    <li> When I was having skin breakouts as a mature woman, I was advised by a cosmetic saleswoman to use a make-up remover in addition to my nightly soap and water cleansing routine.  I chose this brand because I could not find the one advertised by Jennifer Garner.  I use this brand and enjoy the convenience of disposable sheets and the smooth feel of my skin. I follow make- up removal with soap and water followed by a moisturizer.  No more breakouts.</li>
    <li> I bought these at a chain and needed others.  The ones from Amazon are the same and work great.  I am allergic to all the other make up removers I&#x27;ve tried.  I was concerned that these would be different from the towelettes that I purchased previously, but they are identical.  They remove mascara and eye shadow, which is my main concern.  You can use them to remain base as well, but a wash cloth and soap and water work just as well.</li>
    <li> Medium thickness towelette works great. My wife and my daughter says they feel non-irritating, actually soothing (especially if you refrigerate them prior to use) and have a calming scent about them.&lt;br /&gt;Try them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is by far my favorite makeup remover. It is perfect for after school/cheer. I bring this to ecveryone of my cheer competitions if we stay overnight. It is perfrct for traveling. I just carry around the wipes in the orginal package. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these!!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena makes really good products. The cleansing towelettes are very convenient to carry and use. They take off all the makeup and great for traveling or lazy nights!</li>
    <li> The towelettes is thick and really moist. It removes all my makeup easily, even the difficult to clean places, lyk my eye lashes and lids, the wipes cleans it all off, leaving my skin moist and very hydrated, it also has a nyc scent. I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy another when this one finishes</li>
    <li> i have tried many makeup remover cleaners and the Neutrogena cleansing towelettes are by far the best I have used.  They are great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product for years now and itdelivers finely its promise and my skin feels like fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It removes makeup very well.  It has a resealable seal to keep towelettes from drying out.</li>
    <li> my delicate skin.  The eye pads don&#x27;t work nearly as good as these do.  I just tried the eye pads and will now only use these for face and eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter loves these.  They remove both mascara and face makeup and she says they don&#x27;t burn her eyes.</li>
    <li> they work so well... I almost never use anything else to wipe my makeup off anymore. they feel so soft on my face.</li>
    <li> I just bought these towelette makeup remover wipes and am blown away at how good they work. I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t affect me at all. They smell pretty good too.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have sensitive and oily skin so I can only use oil free products. I thought these were oil free but they&#x27;re obviously not. I ended up getting the oil-free grapefruit makeup wipes of the same brand.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to so no complaints. Got it for a good price and it effectively removes all my make-up. Gentle on skin</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you would want from make up remover wipes - removes make up. It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or make it feel raw, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Pretty good makeup remover wipes but I feel like it leaves a slight film. I personally prefer the equate brand from wal-mart.</li>
    <li> OMG just love it!!!!! This is the best I can find so far!!!! Very mild and leaves a clean feeling to your skin, I sometimes just use this to wipe off the makeup and go to bed directly and it is completely okay!!!!! I would recommend this to everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome for on the go or when your lazy and dont want to wash your face. Takes everything off!</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time, and I was really impressed! It took all of my makeup off quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have to scrub my face!</li>
    <li> No-mess cleanup that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  This is probably the most convenient way to take off your makeup.</li>
    <li> The best makeup remover and cleanser towels EVER!!!! No sense in spending $20 for name brand (MAC or NARS) when you can get these!</li>
    <li> I use these all the time. They remove all make-up. The price on this site is better than at most stores (as long as you fold it into an order that gives you free shipping). I&#x27;ve tried several other brands--none remove make-up as well as these.</li>
    <li> Of you wear a lot of eye makeup, these are large and heavy duty compared to the others.  I use them for heavy makeup events!</li>
    <li> I love these!  They are so gentle and quickly remove every particle of make-up including eyeliner, mascara and all-day lipstick.  There is very little scent outside of a clean smell.  Great for travel, keeping in  your bedside table and everyday  use.  Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes, they make it very easy to get all your make up off very quickly.  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> CAUSED LOTS OF ACNE!!!! worse product ever.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of make up remover wipes and this is the very very best!!</li>
    <li> I use one of these every night to remove my eye makeup.  I have had no problems with them what so ever.  I plan to keep buying them.</li>
    <li> Great! Works well, not oily, and cloth strong enough to hold up to scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and takes off all my make up so easily</li>
    <li> Works well to remove face makeup!</li>
    <li> A few years ago, was introduced to this product by my Daughter. At first it was a bit pricey, but versus using baby oil, it is a pretty fantastic product. Was able to find this product on Amazon.Com for a more than competitive price point! Baby oil is fantastic at removing all make-up, including eye make-up; but it leaves a filmy residue upon your eye. And that is the beauty of Neutrogena Makeup Remover towelettes: No filmy eye residue! Since Amazon.Com has been selling this product have been able to afford it versus baby oil! The Seller&#x27;s price point was as said before competitive; and the delivery time was equally good. Would recommend this product and the Seller for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I will not order again. I have a feeling it might be one of the things causing me to break out. It&#x27;s not moisturized enough to easily remove makeup, at least mine was not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for two years and they are the best! The cloths are silky soft and have the perfect amount of remover so that you can wipe gently and not have to rub excessively to get off your mascara.  They don&#x27;t leave your face oily OR feeling dried out.  I&#x27;ve tried other cloths and they are usually too rough or not moist enough.  Most bottled removers I&#x27;ve tried feel oily for me.  For me, these are the perfect solution!</li>
    <li> These wipes work great for removal of eye makeup.  It&#x27;s very good for sensitive skin and easy on the eyes.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I thouhgt I would try these out.  I was recomended them and I can say. Then felt good on My skin and not drying out.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel so soft after taking make up off. I wear colorstay makeup and these makeup removing wipes work fantastic, they leave my skin feeling clean and soft, they even remove the mascara! These truly are great makeup removing wipes!</li>
    <li> These are my wife&#x27;s favorite make-up remover.  One wipe seems to do the job and does it well. She always keeps a good stock of these wipes and the best price she recevied was from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many make up removers in the past, but this is by far the most convenient and best product I have ever used. I felt they did a fantastic job. They are not drying, and I don&#x27;t really feel the need to rinse afterwards. My skin has improved after just a week (which isn&#x27;t a surprise because I am terrible about taking my make up off before bed). The convenience of them is probably their best feature - it&#x27;s quick and easy to wipe it all off before bed. They are not harsh on the eyes either. The material is also super strong, I tried to tear one in half, and it just stretched to about double it&#x27;s size. There is just enough remover to handle my entire face, with some moisture left over in the towelette after wards. I will definitely be ordering these again!</li>
    <li> My favorite make up remover, these are especially useful for travel. They&#x27;re great at removing w en glittery eyeshadow, as well as lip stains. I have very sensitive skin and no problems using these. I&#x27;ve used them for over 4 years, and there still my favorite!</li>
    <li> I like these, but they require you to rub pretty hard on the mascara to get it removed. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very nice and leaves you feeling clean and not greasy. I&#x27;d recommend using baby oil on your eye makeup first and then following it up with these wipes.</li>
    <li> I would not want to be without these Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes. They get all my makeup off, even water proof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;And I Thank Amazon.com for getting them to me as quickly as they do.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m allergic to lots of different scents/products, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me and works great! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> super awesome i love these super durable thick makeup wipes i put tons of makeup and it simply wipes it off love it a 10</li>
    <li> I am a believer in Neutrogena. I use these towelettes and their face scrub- two of my favorite face cleaning products on the market. These are quick and convenient- very handy to take with you on vacation, especially if you&#x27;re flying! I can use them with ease even on my thick, heavy mascara! Comes off like a charm. If you use it too much and have dry skin, you will be a little irritated though. It does contain some drying agents so be aware and prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have that problem, toner is a great way to combat it. Not alcohol based toner though!! That will dry you out worse. I&#x27;ve found my best results to be with a scented rose petal toner that contains aloe vera -[[ASIN:B00BHRC7R4 Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner with Aloe Vera + FREE Retinol Cream]]. Aloe vera &#x3D; moisture &#x3D; no dry skin. Plus it not only does using toner help with removing make up, it actually clears beneath the surface too!!</li>
    <li> Product removes makeup and daily grime from my hideous face. Look had I been born  w beauty I wouldnt use makeup but I gotta come to terms: not all of us are models. Some of us are part dog faced and must use makeup for our own halfway human sake...and for facing mankind. Thanks to this product...I can let my face air out when I&#x27;m home. Clean happy dog face here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying, I LOVE MAKEUP and I&#x27;m not afraid to wear it. I&#x27;m also extremely LAZY when it comes to doing any kind of touching-up or fussing with my face throughout my work day so, I&#x27;ve had to evolve my arsenal over the years: Waterproof EVERYTHING, Industrial-strength primers, and lip-STAIN (not lipstick). This of course, means It&#x27;s also not unusual that even after I&#x27;m done washing, rinsing, and using a make-up \\&quot;remover\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been known to still look like Bette Davis after a 3-day drinking bender (LOL). Really, God Bless Cosmetic companies for finally getting it right, but that stuff truly NEVER comes off of your eyelashes! Well, that is not until I found these little miracle wipes-in-a-bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wearing a few \\&quot;coats\\&quot; you&#x27;ll be better off holding the wipe on your closed eye for a second or two, and letting it soften up the gunk...then just gently sweep back and forth until you feel it&#x27;s gone. The repeat on the other eye. Use the remainder for your lips, and face. OR do the lips &amp; face first and vice versa. Voila, you&#x27;re done! We&#x27;ve even used these for Halloween make-up and they do a perfect job EVERY TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms--here&#x27;s another TIP (especially if you have teenage girls in the house...): You know how there&#x27;s always a rogue pencil shaving or black smear on the bathroom floor...or the seats in the car...or the kitchen table (for God&#x27;s sake)? THESE WILL KILL THAT SCHMEAR IMMEDIATELY and leave not a trace of it. Broken eyeshadow falls on the floor and brown glittery powder residue is all over the sink and counter (this has happened to me recently-even water and Fantastik couldn&#x27;t clean it)? Grab one of these and you&#x27;re all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I wouldn&#x27;t lie...these things are awesome. THE ONE DRAWBACK IS---THEY STINK. After you use it on your face, you&#x27;re going to want to rinse with water and moisturize. For ME personally, the \\&quot;grapefruit\\&quot; and \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; ones made my eyes sting. And this is the BEST PRICE BY FAR I&#x27;ve seen anywhere ($4.49). Get these.where ($4.49). Get these.</li>
    <li> Okay so it does a beautiful job of removing makeup- even my waterproof mascara and eye liner. However, I HATE the smell and my face doesn&#x27;t feel all that clean when I&#x27;m done- it almost feels like a film is left on my face. I use them then rinse my face off with water and dry with a towel. I think in the future I will just stick with eye makeup remover and a cotton square and regular face wash for the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> These clean so well and truly get all the makeup off. It&#x27;s great for traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t actually use the case (these are refills), so I just use to sticky resealable part to close it up which still works. After a while it does lose it&#x27;s adhesiveness and the tab rips a bit, but I know that using it that way is not the intended use, so I can&#x27;t really complain too much there.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-40s and I have never removed my make-up at the end of the day before. Weird to some I know, but I have been blessed with really good skin and didn&#x27;t ever feel I needed to. Well, last year I started getting adult acne once or twice a month so I decided to up my lacking skin care routine. I have a high sink in my bathroom and I hated getting my sleeves wet every night and getting out cleanser and stuff. So these little towelettes have been excellent. Very convienent, very moist. As one other person said, if you keep them in their plastic container, you can get two nights out of them, there is that much cleanser on them. I use one side and put it back in the container, then use the other side the next night, then throw away. But, even with the good amount of cleanser, it doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue on my skin. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are onlly average as towelettes but the real negative is that they don&#x27;t have a proper closure as so many of the other brands have.</li>
    <li> I use make up every day in the day time. I sometime sleep with the makeup before because removing was a pain. Not any more with the wipes. I am doing it every day now</li>
    <li> These are great. They get rid of make up very easily and aren&#x27;t hard on my skin. I would recommend these to anyone who needs to find a simple make up remover!</li>
    <li> I got the package and it was ripped open and they used tape to close it up, the towelettes were already dry...I want a refund , that is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Cleans your makeup off as if you never had any on smells amazing ! I will continue to order these</li>
    <li> Really removes all ur make up 😍</li>
    <li> these towelettes are nice and large but not enough &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; to take off all of my makeup and they have a strange odor to them, not stinky but strange.  I can&#x27;t explain it.</li>
    <li> Get home from the club and got black eye makeup on?  These work great!  Also, I have sensitive skin and have had no problems using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried these wipes. I had stopped wearing mascara because I hated having to wash it off. I am older and have a lot less lashes then I used to. So I hated to wear it and lose lashes when washing it off. Wiping it off with baby oil was messy and left my face oily. My eyes would be irritated . I am very happy I tried these.</li>
    <li> These wipes completely remove makeup, including waterproof, do not sting your eyes, and have a pleasant but not overpowering smell.  Description states they are a refill, but I just use them straight out of their package.  They retain their moisture in the package.  All in all, a great remover!</li>
    <li> These are excellent wipes that I&#x27;ve integrated as part of my nightly routine. First thing I do is use these to wipe off all my makeup. These are really good at removing EVERYTHING...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, it&#x27;s a little more difficult with eye makeup. To be specific, mascara and eyeliner and anything that is more diffcult in general to take off. So it&#x27;s a little harsh for that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise, great product and sooo much cheaper to buy online here than in the stores, I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
    <li> all was great, product worked as expected and required. Price was good, planning on refilling when run out of pro</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena Makeup Remover Towelettes for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;These Towelettes easily remove even tough eye makeup! Great product&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This have a fresh scent and remove makeup very well but not the best of the wipes I&#x27;ve tried (that would be Aveeno Ultra Calming Makeup Removing Wipes). I wipe my face to remove makeup, then rinse them in water and wipe again because otherwise my face tingles a little too much to be comfortable. They haven&#x27;t caused breakouts or anything.</li>
    <li> Good if you keep it sealed tight unless they will dry out. I need about 3 wipes for my eyes and face to be completely off. For some reason my eyes water after using</li>
    <li> These wipes work great to remove my waterproof mascara, will order again.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great for standard makeup (foundation, blush, eyeshadow, brow pencil).  However, it will not remove waterproof make up such as eyeliner and mascara.  I even tried rubbing a bit harder with no luck.  So it&#x27;s a great cleanser for everything but waterproof makeups.</li>
    <li> I love these!  It&#x27;s the easiest way to remove makeup and not leave an oily coating on your eyeballs where you have to wait 20 minutes to see clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the OIL that they sell for eye makeup removal is insanity! I get that it works - as in, it does remove the eye makeup... But, so do these!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you don&#x27;t need to get cotton balls/circles/etc... to apply them to - *they&#x27;re ready to go as they are*, and they DON&#x27;T burn your eyes (like some generic versions do) nor do they get in there and make your vision blurry by coating your irises with oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended! Best option for removing ALL makeup - including waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> So, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in ages, but 2 days after I used this, I broke out so badly I was convincing I was having a reaction. Cyst sized boils on my forhead and cheeks and chin. I never break out on my forehead and now I have marks! This thing sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used to use the acne-cleanser/makeup remover and that was gentle and awesome. THIS SUCKS!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is of a much larger size than most of the beauty cleansing clothes that I have tried. Many of them are so small that you must use several of them in the place of maybe one or two of these. I happen to love using a cloth as opposed to always using a facial foaming cleanser. I used to rotate every other night between foaming facial cleansers and plain baby wipes to remove makeup nightly, simply because, I have very sensitive skin and many of the face washes tend to really inflame my skin. I never have that problem when I use this product. If I clean my makeup off with this, I can then use a cleanser every night and I am not sure if it is because these clothes are hydrating or what, but when I use these first and then wash my face with a foaming cleanser ( I like the Grapefruit foaming face wash, it smells very good to me) I have absolutely no problem with the irritation I used to have to fight with all the time. I could go on but I won&#x27;t, in my opinion I love these cleansing clothes because they are hydrating and they do still clean your face extremely well.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product for traveling or when you just don&#x27;t have the energy to wash your face after a long day at work. Takes everything off easily and leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve used so far. I&#x27;v used Koh Gen Do and Shiseido but this gets rid of my eyemakeup  the best. At four dollars, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The flowery smell is a bit overwhelming, and it makes my face feel a bit oily afterwards even after washing it off with water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Gets rid of eyemakeup quite easily and is a no-nonsense makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all this for just four dollars... SO WORTH IT :) will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Does a nice job removing liquid eyeliner and mascara. Your have to rub a bit to get all of the eye make-up off. Great for travel!</li>
    <li> I have been using these towelettes for years, but the most recent batch I ordered from amazon smell horrible. HORRIBLE. Like -- I kid you not -- FISH. And I am not a big fan o&#x27; fish, so, you know, that sucks. Also, I&#x27;m 1) lazy about returning things (you&#x27;re welcome, amazon) and 2) kinda frugal soooo... in spite of the fishiness, I&#x27;ve been using them to take off my make-up and then rinsing my face with water afterward to take the smell away. Which sort of defeats the purpose, really. So... anyway -- they do work, but the smell, at least in this batch: Yuck-o.</li>
    <li> I bought these in the travel size and my eyes hurt under neath so bad from wiping my makeup off. They literally burn.</li>
    <li> If I didn&#x27;t have these I wouldn&#x27;t wash my face. A necessity for me. Face feels really clean and non oily after using. Takes off long wear makeup also.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t worth the price! I found a pack of different makeup wipes at TJ Maxx from another brand for about $4 for 70 towelettes, and they work much better!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> they clean your make up off well, there is no need to rinse took all my make up off, i love it</li>
    <li> I LOVE these towelettes!!! :) I use the night calming ones even during the day. It took me forever to find something that didnt make my skin break out and burn because of my rosacea :/ But these are perfect :) They keep my skin hydrated by causing more oils to produce on their own (not good for someone with already oily skin I guess) and it contains no alcohol which is exactly what I need :) Theyre trully great :) OH! plus they really do their job! Most towelettes make you have to scrub but all I have to do with these is one single wipe and 90% of the makeup is gone! Which is esp. impressive to me since I sometimes wear some extensive eye makeup haha :)&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to try some more of their products! Im hoping and guessing that they work just as well! :)</li>
    <li> There is a filmy/oily feeling that they leave on your face, but I think it goes away once it dries and it does remove the makeup nicely. It does have a scent, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove product easily. However, slight perfume smell.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for removing makeup, does not need comments. I always have in my bathroom. I am not without. I love</li>
    <li> No matter how much makeup I use, I can have a clean face in no time with these towelettes.  No matter how late it is or how tired I am at night, it takes very little effort to remove my makeup.  The towelettes clean every bit of makeup off my face and leaves my skin soft and moist.  It doses not leave my skin dry or tight.  With the subscribe and save, I&#x27;m sure never to run out.</li>
    <li> Being a man, I don&#x27;t get a chance to use these, sadly.  Unless i wear makeup, but i don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m not that metro just yet.&lt;br /&gt;The women in my household use this and claim they are quick, convenient, and handy.  In fact, these get used even when no makeup is applied just to get that clean/fresh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;For waterproof mascara, its a bit hard to take out so you may need to also use a makeup remover along with this product.  For that extra fresh feel, wash your face even after using this.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> While the wipes do remove all makeup it leaves a greasy film.  I generally have to wash my face after I use a wipe as the skin around my eyes become sensitive and swollen.  My eye lids become too greasy to accept eye liner without sweating and loosing the line within a couple of hours when I use a wipe and wash afterward.  To give you an idea of the film of \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot;, if I wipe off the bathroom counter to pick up makeup that has spilled, it leaves a visible greasy film on the counter.  I remove my eye makeup in the morning before I put my on my eye makeup.  Perhaps if I removed my makeup the night before perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t interact the way it does.</li>
    <li> i have purchased many different brands of  face wipes because I&#x27;m frequently too lazy to get up in the evening to wash my face. Especially if I didn&#x27;t wear any make up that day.  I keep these in a drawer next to the couch in my TV room and use them instead. They work well, and  clean the skin without leaving it dry. Presto! No guilt!</li>
    <li> I love how clean my skin feels after wiping it with these towelettes! It takes my waterproof makeup right off and leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist but not oily. Such a convenient product to have.</li>
    <li> I love using these, when my makeup wont come off in the shower or if I&#x27;m in a hurry.. or just traveling these are my favorite. Plus they dont count as a liquid container during travel!</li>
    <li> I like how Neutrogena Towelettes feel on my face, and their pleasant aroma.  I haven&#x27;t  used soap on my face since a pretty high school classmate said she didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m still not as pretty as Sue, but I&#x27;ll bet my skin is!  Neutrogena Towelettes sure help.  They make my skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Neutrogena. I use many different products of theirs include these wipes.  These are the only makeup remover wipes that I have found that do NOT burn my eyes!  I use them primarily to remove my eye liner.  These wipes work very well.  They are nice and soft on my face, remove the makeup, and don&#x27;t burn my eyes.  I have tried other wipes and have been left disappointed.  There is no heavy residue left after using the wipes.  My face feels fairly clean. The product is ophthalmologist tested, dermatologist tested, allergy tested, and alcohol free.  I would suggest at least trying them out once.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of makeup removers, but these remain my favorites.  They get the makeup off, they&#x27;re not greasy, and they don&#x27;t dry out in the package... the last towelette is as moist as the first towelette.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Every night, I scrub my face with Cetaphil, and then use these to remove anything the face wash missed.  They work beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used them I just pretty much opened one towlette in both of my hands and rubbed my face in it.  I quickly learned that these, for some reason, really hurt the skin under my eyes (which is wear I need to use them the most due to running mascara from the face wash).  It&#x27;s kind of a stingy, scratchy feeling.  I adapted by taking only the corner of a sheet and running that smoothly under my eyes.  Works like a charm, but still stings a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is true for everyone or just people with sensitive under-eye skin, but all in all, I do recommend this product.  It gets all of my makeup off, and leaves my skin nice and ready for my toner.</li>
    <li> This definitely is a must have even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup that often. Clean any makeup in a few minutes. I can tell there is no harmful ingredients used in this product cause my eyes are very sensitive but feels nothing but fresh after everytime I use it. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I love these make up remover towelettes.  They are soft, remove all of my make up and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  Quick shipping and delivery.</li>
    <li> I like the Neutrogena brand and have used them before for many other products, but for some reason my eyes and this particular product didn&#x27;t like each other. After using them my eyes and eyelids would slightly burn and became irritated. I tried them based on the good reviews by many others, but they just aren&#x27;t for me. Like the simple design of the packaging, but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be using these again and will be looking for something a little more sensitive for my eyes.</li>
    <li> purchased again for the wife and she is very pleased and quite satisfied with the quality and price of this product</li>
    <li> These facial wipes are amazing. They do remove all makeup just like they say. Even waterproof mascara!! It takes a few extra wipes but it comes off completely. I can&#x27;t imagine not having these. I love how easy they are to use and how great they work!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried these before but they worked really well.  My mascara came off easily without rubbing my eyes and pulling out my lashes.  I will definitely get these again.</li>
    <li> This works like a charm to get make up off! I would order again! I love this product! Yes I do!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes!! It removes all of my makeup and leaves my skin moisturized and soft. I also made the mistake a left the opener open and the wipes dried out. I just put a little water on it and it worked the same!! Love it</li>
    <li> These are slightly damp so I add a small amount of water to them. This makes them more like a wet washcloth with no abrasive feel. I&#x27;m happy about them thoroughly removing my water-proof mascara. I think they&#x27;re the perfect choice when you&#x27;re too tired to remove your makeup before bed, which, for me, is most of the time!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say these are a great value, but the product is good. I can do just as well buying makeup remover wipes at the grocery store, though.  Without the box that these usually come in, this product dries up very quickly, so if you don&#x27;t plan on using these daily, they will probably dry out before you can use them all.</li>
    <li> Removes mascara and eyeliner so fast. I am but impressed. I might get Prime just to get these for a lower price!!!</li>
    <li> It takes off the makeup, but noylt my eyeliner. You.can take makeup off with a wet (warm water) wash cloth as well. Eyeliner is what&#x27;s tough getting off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before - they&#x27;re great. They work and are non-irritating. Convenient also.</li>
    <li> These makeup remover cloths work very well in removing eye makeup. Very gentle on the eyes and large enough to use one cloth on both eyes. As far as the rest of the face, this product does not seem to be non comedegenic which means it is not oil free. At least it doesnt say anywhere on the product that it is. For me, it causes my face to break out and leaves a bit of a greasy residue on my skin. I think the oil is necessary to remove waterproof eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I travel for my job on the plane, in a car, and on a motorcycle.  These are excellent for whipping through TSA security no problem, cleaning makeup off, giving your face that long needed refreshing cleanse after a long day of travel, work, what ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them.  Great product.  Just make sure you have a plastic bag with so that they stay good and sealed - ya don&#x27;t want them to dry out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m horrible at washing my face at night, this makes it so easy and there is a nice light scent. This does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> The worst makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever had. These burn my face and eyes and I do NOT have sensitive skin. The chemicals used in this remover are over the top and highly unnecessary. I will never purchase this again. Take heed.</li>
    <li> Causes dermatitis. Both my daughter and myself neither of us prone to breakouts. Got rash from these wipes.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  Moisturizers as it cleans, removes absolutely everything with one cloth, no perfumes...just the perfect cleansing wipe ever created by woman!</li>
    <li> I bought two packs of these and end up giving one of them to a friend.  They kind of hurt my skin.  It would sometimes sting my undereyes. I also don&#x27;t wear that much makeup but i would have to rub and rub to get my makeup off, causing irritation.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> Okay, so let me start by saying that I have tried them all! I started with Neutrogena years ago and kept switching to see if any other products were better. They are not better! This is the only makeup remover that not only removes makeup, but dirt, and oil, and DOESN&#x27;T make me break out! It is good for my sensitive skin and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt; - Packaging - GREAT and easy acess&lt;br /&gt; - They don&#x27;t dry out because the packaing is so great&lt;br /&gt; - Okay for my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt; - One package lasts me about a month.&lt;br /&gt; - they have a case that you can buy to keep them fresh that I have had for 3 years now. So worth your $5.&lt;br /&gt; - Removes general Makeup&lt;br /&gt; - Removes Mascara and eye makeup (NO JOKE!) I can&#x27;t get that elsewhere&lt;br /&gt; - Removes dirt and oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything on the market. Wipes, pads, gels, zappers, creams, lotions, soap, beauty bars, face washes, face foams, etc. Nothing works like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t steer away, just use this one.</li>
    <li> This erases my makeup effectively and, most importantly, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I try to take off my mascara and eyeliner. I still recommend using a facial cleanser afterwards, because some of the soapy residue can be sticky on your skin from the towlettes. However, this is a great makeup remover that I&#x27;ll continue to use for years to come.</li>
    <li> I wear thick liquid eyeliner most days and so I struggle with makeup removal. I can pretty much remove all of my makeup with one towelette. I cannot give it a full 5 stars because it won&#x27;t easily remove all mascara or liner close to my eye. It deserves a 4 because it does better than generic brands I feel. When I have a sink available I will use liquid baby soap and water for my eyes and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> great for taking off makesup and cleansing. i use it with an exfoliator on the side. not harsh and smooth.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is a good brand and this product does a good job! So easy to use and to keep handy.</li>
    <li> I love these cleansing towelettes. I buy them every month. I feel like they get rid of everything, including eye makeup!</li>
    <li> This wipe removes almost all traces of dirt and makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t really work on waterproof mascara very well, despite its claims, so when I use mascara I use an oil based remover and these wipes do completely remove the oily residue.  My skin is sensitive and the wipes cause no reaction at all.  If I run the water in the sink at night, it wakes my hubby up, so I use these wipes instead.  Afterwards, I use Burt&#x27;s Bees rosewater toner to completely remove whatever the wipe didn&#x27;t get.  I then apply my skin treatments.  This routine has worked really well.  I am one of those people who hates the nightly face-washing routine and using these wipes is so much better than sleeping with my makeup on. (Yes, I know, BAD!)  The fragrance is pleasing and not over the top and the wipes are just wet enough to work well without dripping.  They are a great invention!</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover there is.  Sometimes I forget to put on lotion afterwards!</li>
</ol>
