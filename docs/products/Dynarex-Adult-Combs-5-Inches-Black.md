      <li>These made great gifts to hand out at an overseas mission -- very light and compact and useful.</li>
      <li>Like everyone says, these combs are great and very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>so many combs.</li>
      <li>Like many men, I tend to lose combs, or my wife steals them, and I end up buying more.</li>
      <li>This is way better then buying a 3 pak for 1.70.</li>
      <li>The teeth are about an eighth inch shorter than most 5&amp;#34; combs.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I did not realize there were so many combs.  </li>
      <li>OK for a barber to give as gifts to his clients</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are perfect size for back pocket</li>
      <li>The teeth want to ride on top.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had to replace so many.</li>
      <li>I love her and her huge heart and help out with my own donations when I am able.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Way, way too many combs.</li>
      <li>Cheap but sturdy!</li>
      <li>Not so much MY IDEA of amusing!</li>
      <li>Pretty flexible and not sturdy, but I got these for handouts for my business, good for emergency carrys.</li>
      <li>They work fine for the hair on top of my head, but tend to not penetrate the beard hair.  </li>
      <li>Eventually, the day comes when I clean the couch, and end up with about a dozen more than I need, for about a month...</li>
      <li>They are completely fine for my purposes.</li>
      <li>Consider donating to your own local shelters, I am sure they would appreciate them!</li>
      <li>With good bargains like this, I am able to pack more boxes with the limited funds I have to spend.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it is Halloween, so</li>
      <li>I was nervous they would be cheap or flimsy but not at all...</li>
      <li>They seem finely spaced (in a good way), but are VERY short.</li>
      <li>I could use a few more, but otherwise great purchase.</li>
      <li>Good enough to make kazoo s for my church camp.</li>
      <li>It was more of a funny gift, but it ended up being super useful.</li>
      <li>The combs came quickly.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for AND delivered super fast!!!</li>
      <li>I needed a large number of combs and this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Not cheapos, like I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Totally sturdy - and worth the purchase, if you have a need to buy 240 combs.</li>
      <li>These combs are good, definitely not more than that, but this lifetime supply is such an amazing value</li>
      <li>New clean combs</li>
      <li>Delivered exactly as ordered.</li>
      <li>I got a whole lot of combs!  </li>
      <li>first thing I did with this comb was to bend it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet, and I may never do so, as I may be bald before I get through the first dozen.  </li>
      <li>Now I really don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore!</li>
      <li>These just bend and are easy to bend back.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not the strongest, but they&#x27;re strong enough.  </li>
      <li>Comes in a large box with packs of 12.</li>
      <li>High quality and perfectly consistent.</li>
      <li>and we all have a primary comb, a backup comb, and numerous backup-backup combs.</li>
      <li>these combs are very flimsy  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>They are small enough to feel comfortble in your pocket and do a great job on your hair.</li>
      <li>As she was once homeless herself, so I think she has a better understanding of how much these basic necessities that most of us take for granted truly mean.</li>
      <li>Great product for donation, or if you loose a lot of combs, only comment is that they could be made slightly longer or another size offered.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>The half side of the comb that has the fine teeth, has the teeth so close together, the hair will not go through them.</li>
      <li>I would not feel comfortable as it would probably press my hair down or bareley brush the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Back when I first bought these, the listing said something like Dynarex Adult Combs, 5 inches, 20 x Box\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Should I live that much longer and finally run of combs</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Delivered exactly as ordered. High quality and perfectly consistent.</li>
    <li> Good enough to make kazoo s for my church camp.</li>
    <li> A lot of combs for a little money. I bought them to use in a school play so the kids wouldn&#x27;t have to share combs, and the quantity and price were both perfect. They are small combs, but just what we needed for our purposes.</li>
    <li> I think my husband will no longer be searching (or feel as if he is losing) so many combs.</li>
    <li> This was the funniest gift that me and my girls have sent my son so far. He is always losing combs. :)</li>
    <li> Good quality for the money.</li>
    <li> WOW is the perfect word...I was nervous they would be cheap or flimsy but not at all...&lt;br /&gt;GREAT QUALITY EXCELLENT PRICE!!! Exactly what I was looking for AND delivered super fast!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great price for the quality.</li>
    <li> as described. typical 5 inch black comb. arrived in two days.</li>
    <li> From all the great reviews, I was looking forward to receiving these combs. What a disappointment. I know they are inexpensive, but what&#x27;s up with all these great reviews. I find these combs almost worthless. The half side of the comb that has the fine teeth, has the teeth so close together, the hair will not go through them. As for the other side, it&#x27;s better, but the comb is so thin that is folds as you are passing it through your hair. Maybe I got a bad batch ( lot # 29531). Yes they are unbreakable. See attached photo for teeth spacing and thickness.</li>
    <li> Like everyone says, these combs are great and very cost effective.  My husband is always losing his combs when they fall out of his pocket. Now he will never have to feel bad about it.</li>
    <li> Way, way too many combs. This is the community comb box for my home and we all have a primary comb, a backup comb, and numerous backup-backup combs. This is not a sarcastic review...we all have a lot of combs now.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for Operation Christmas Child and am very happy with the purchase.  The size and quality are both really nice.</li>
    <li> I am always losing combs, as I like to carry one in my trousers pocket. Replacing them has cost me a lot over the years. These combs are good, definitely not more than that, but this lifetime supply is such an amazing value it&#x27;s hard to beat. They are not brittle plastic, but bendable, so the tines don&#x27;t break. They are a little smaller than I am used to, and also a little thinner, but they so their job well. I recommend them to someone who is always losing combs or to organizations that have to give out hundreds of combs! For comb connoisseurs I suggest something else.</li>
    <li> My son has lost so many combs, so this seemed the perfect gag gift for Christmas. I told him, if he takes care of them, these could conceivably last his entire life, and his children, and grandchildren&#x27;s lives, too!</li>
    <li> My husband wanted combs for his beard because he kept losing them. I bought him 240, and they were perfect. They are exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect for service project</li>
    <li> Pretty flexible and not sturdy, but I got these for handouts for my business, good for emergency carrys.</li>
    <li> Best Buy. New clean combs</li>
    <li> Cheap but sturdy! I got tired of losing my combs. Now I really don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore!</li>
    <li> Back when I first bought these, the listing said something like Dynarex Adult Combs, 5 inches, 20 x Box\\&quot;.  I wasn;t paying attention, and thought I was buying a box of 20.  Surprise!  20 Boxes!  Needless to say, that was way more than I needed.  Fortunately, it is Halloween, so every kid that comes to my door gets a handful of candy and a comb. NOTE- this is Kelley, I did NOT buy combs and stupidly order this many. This is my husband&#x27;s idea of amusing. Not so much MY IDEA of amusing!</li>
    <li> So many combs! You get a lot for a good price!</li>
    <li> The brush is closer to 4.75 inches for those who are about exactness. My issue was the comb teeth. They seem finely spaced (in a good way), but are VERY short. I have thick hair, but am used to using thin combs, however with this brush I would not feel comfortable as it would probably press my hair down or bareley brush the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pics I show how short this comb is compared  to a generic cheapo store comb Ive had for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;I still think these combs seem like good quality for the price, but just not for me. I have contacted the seller for a return.</li>
    <li> I did not realize there were so many combs.  I do 100 homeless bags for my church every 2 months and I have enough combs for 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great for science projects!</li>
    <li> I needed a large number of combs and this fit the bill. They are very basic black combs, but to someone they will really mean something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cousin helps run a charity in her hometown where she fills donated backpacks with all of these donated items and they are then distributed to the homeless in her area. She does teen bags as well as adult bags, but they all need combs. As she was once homeless herself, so I think she has a better understanding of how much these basic necessities that most of us take for granted truly mean. I love her and her huge heart and help out with my own donations when I am able. With 240 combs, I hope she was able to give out every one! Consider donating to your own local shelters, I am sure they would appreciate them!</li>
    <li> Used them for hotel bags for wedding guests.  It is nice to have for your purse for a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; at the wedding or in case you forgot yours!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not the strongest, but they&#x27;re strong enough.  Hand them out to your friends and still never have to buy combs again.</li>
    <li> The combs came quickly. They are pretty small but will work for my purpose.</li>
    <li> Thought the combs would be bigger</li>
    <li> Lots of combs for the price. Seem strong enough to go through my thin hair. Have even combed my dog with one.</li>
    <li> these combs are very flimsy  but it was for donating to children who didn&#x27;t have a comb etc  so it worked for what I bought it for</li>
    <li> Great product for donation, or if you loose a lot of combs, only comment is that they could be made slightly longer or another size offered.</li>
    <li> A comb is a comb. Why spend extra for brand name?</li>
    <li> Wow! More combs than I ever anticipating getting!</li>
    <li> Great for Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes.</li>
    <li> These made great gifts to hand out at an overseas mission -- very light and compact and useful. Everyone loved them -- men, women, and children.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful find for me and I am quite pleased with the quality.  I pack shoeboxes for Samaritan&#x27;s Purse Operation Christmas Child and at least one of these will be going in every box.  With good bargains like this, I am able to pack more boxes with the limited funds I have to spend.</li>
    <li> small combs. not what I expected. OK for a barber to give as gifts to his clients&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Siemiatkoski</li>
    <li> A** A++ seller. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Plenty of combs to last forever. Comes in a large box with packs of 12. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the gift bags we give out at church for our needy families.</li>
    <li> Now, I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left. But what little hair I do I have, I expect to do as it&#x27;s told. Like many men, I tend to lose combs, or my wife steals them, and I end up buying more. Eventually, the day comes when I clean the couch, and end up with about a dozen more than I need, for about a month... Anyway, I bought these so I will never have to look for or buy combs again, but I did have concerns bout the quality. Once they arrived, my concerns are alienated. These are not the hardest, nor the softest combs that I have bought. They are completely fine for my purposes. The are the same size that I usually use (just small enough to fit in a back pocket). By the way, yes, it is actually 240 combs. I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet, and I may never do so, as I may be bald before I get through the first dozen.  When the box showed up, I told my wife that they were less than $1 each, and she looked at me with a very cold stare...</li>
    <li> Wonderful for Operation Christmas Child .</li>
    <li> I use this for Operation Christmas Child shoe box gifts and it is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> They are very good! They are small enough to feel comfortble in your pocket and do a great job on your hair.Sure good not have to pay two bucks for a comb four or five times a year. I will not need to buy another for years to come!</li>
    <li> Small. Made mistake of not seeing the &amp;#34;5 inches&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s really short.</li>
    <li> Great buy!!&lt;br /&gt;Can&lt;br /&gt;t find unbreakable combs anymore.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect size for back pocket and they don&#x27;t break ACE brand combs you buy in stores!&lt;br /&gt;This many combs for this price is a steal!!!!</li>
    <li> I got a whole lot of combs!  They don&#x27;t always have the leftovers from the molding process trimmed.  They work fine for the hair on top of my head, but tend to not penetrate the beard hair.  The teeth want to ride on top.  I keep my combs in my back pocket.  So-called &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; combs shatter like glass in my pocket.  These just bend and are easy to bend back.  The teeth are about an eighth inch shorter than most 5&amp;#34; combs.  Teeth are about 3/4&amp;#34; in the center and 7/8&amp;#34; on the ends.  So instead of 5x1&amp;#34;  it&#x27;s 5x7/8&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Ok. Lots of combs that will last for years.</li>
    <li> Combs are small but do the job. This is way better then buying a 3 pak for 1.70. Thats dumb. Now i have enough combs for life</li>
    <li> Perfect for our school picture day!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why some would give this come less stars because they don&#x27;t know what 5 inches is. Its a good comb and a great quantity for the price. These are like the combs my dad used to use. You would see them in a big jar at the barber for $0.10each. (except those may have said &amp;#34;Taiwan&amp;#34; on them instead of &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did with this comb was to bend it. It curved without breaking. I actually had to try to fold it flat, 180 degree, before it snapped. A tough comb.&lt;br /&gt;Fits down inside the back pocket. Not much taller than a bi-fold wallet.</li>
    <li> bought these for operation Christmas Chld so was very pleased with price.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO MAKE BATH/GROOMING CARE PACKS :) THRILLED</li>
    <li> These were purchased to give away with other toiletries along with the food at a food pantry I volunteer at. I have also brought a few boxes to the men&#x27;s homeless shelter.  The combs are lightweight but are eagerly received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say these are good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes.  I think they are great quality for about 5 cents each!  I kept one for myself!  I love them.</li>
    <li> Bought these for our Cub Scouts to put inside socks for the homeless. They were the perfect size and great price for the quantity.</li>
    <li> Ordered a box which should have been 240 count, I got twenty (20) combs.  The Dollar Store would have been a better deal, at least you get two (2) combs this size for one dollar.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> If you want to buy combs for all your family and to last for generations, these are the combs for you. Average quality plastic but not too stiff (this is what I was looking for) and not easily breakable.</li>
    <li> nice for the cleaning packets</li>
    <li> these are just barely 5 inches long and none to big in width or thickness...you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Perfect for an ongoing mission project.</li>
    <li> Not cheapos, like I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Totally sturdy - and worth the purchase, if you have a need to buy 240 combs.</li>
    <li> Realistically, no one person needs 240 combs, but I ordered this by mistake.  I put a bunch in my gift bags for the extended family last Christmas, but I still have a bunch.  For the price, though, I kept them, and when I misplace one I just throw another one from the stash into my gym bag, or travel bag, or whatever.  I&#x27;ll never need to buy another comb again, for the rest of my natural life.</li>
    <li> I could use a few more, but otherwise great purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled!!  A necessary item if your a cosmetologist!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic buy, a good product, the seller even delivered quicker than estimated</li>
    <li> I was pleased that these are not paper thin or the type of plastic that does not hold its shape.  They are not as solid as the fancier/more expensive types, but they are good value.</li>
    <li> Small, weak &amp; thin. Not good at all.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe ... 240 combs for less than $10. Good quality combs, too: compact pocket size, with well-spaced teeth, and nicely flexible, not brittle. For years I had been frustrated by my proclivity for losing or misplacing combs and often couldn&#x27;t find one when I needed a comb to put in my pocket. Not anymore! Now, if I were to lose 10 combs a year, I have enough to last another 24 years. Happily, my current rate for losing them seems to be only about three a year, enough to last me another 80 years. Should I live that much longer and finally run of combs, I doubt I&#x27;ll have enough hair left to need one. Either that, or I&#x27;ll be too feeble to lift a comb to my head.</li>
    <li> They were just as advertised.  Good quality and durable, meaning they won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my bf because he&#x27;s always stealing y combs and I&#x27;ve had to replace so many. It was more of a funny gift, but it ended up being super useful. The only downside is that you won&#x27;t get the long combs as shown in the photo. The ones I got were the tiny pocket size combs in a square box, nut that rectangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I gotten the long combs I would have given this a 5</li>
