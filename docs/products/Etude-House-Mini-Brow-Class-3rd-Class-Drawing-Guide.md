<li> cause it sucks to hold it down.</li>
<li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my eyebrows being uneven!</li>
<li> so they weren&#x27;t as thick.</li>
<li> Hate it...</li>

    <li> Cheap and poorly made and impossible to use unless you have a very large face.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that there are three different types of brow shapes that you can choose from! It&#x27;s really convenient, especially if you want to try on different looks for the brows...sometimes you might want them to come off as softer, edgier or natural! The shipping also arrived before the expected date! I was really pleased with the outcome of this product.</li>
    <li> ok so i bought these to play makeup with my granddaughter. at her age all makeup is fun.  however as a real tool, these are very useful to draw a line and see what you like ... before you pluck.</li>
    <li> The item looks just like the picture and its soft material so its easy to use. It makes my eyebrow look good and i can shape different styles.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good tool that we can use it as an outline to draw a perfect eyebrow.</li>
    <li> This is not what I requested.  I requested for brand Etude House, but I received some brand called Fangzhi.</li>
    <li> After using it, my brows are too short to be looked. But the shapes are good.&lt;br /&gt;My face is not big, it is just very wired with drawing using this brow class</li>
    <li> the shapes are ideal for the &amp;#34;korean look&amp;#34;. very easy to use and washable so if you draw on the templates, you can wash them.</li>

    <li> Shapes doesn&#x27;t match with my face, I think is not really ergonomic and instructions are not clear, come in in asian language. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wish it was adhesive cause it sucks to hold it down. Also, if it came in sets of two that would have been perfect.</li>

    <li> I have a difficult time trying to fill in my brows and give them a good shape.  These are great and easy to use.  I get a really nice finished look that is polished.  There are three shapes to choose from which is nice.  This was written by Nicks wife.</li>
    <li> These were the perfect length for the shape of my brows.  I&#x27;m still needing brow guides that will have the thinner shaped styles.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love to use these stencils with an eye brow powder.  Works beautifully.</li>
    <li> It hard to use but the shape is awesome</li>
    <li> Hate it...thats all i have to say</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I like that they are flexible and firm to the curves of my browbone.  The only thing is I wish there were more size options. A little large for my face but I could still quickly use them to shade in my brows. I just didn&#x27;t fill in completely so they weren&#x27;t as thick.</li>
    <li> Wife says these eyebrow liner aids are not worth the trouble.  The problem gets to be holding them in place and fitting them to the contour of the eyebrow.  This is a dud which took a couple of weeks to arrive</li>
    <li> A+++great item and love it!</li>
    <li> Love it ! I have been to sephora and tried the anastasia  eyebrow stencils and all the other stencils I could find  and they were all to big for my face, but these stencils fit my eyebrow and face perfect love them and the packaging is super adorable !</li>
    <li> I was able to trace my eyebrows using the stencils and then I was able to shape them with tweezers in the exact shape! Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my eyebrows being uneven!</li>
    <li> Everything arrived on time but not from Etude house. It is from an unknown brand but it looks and works just as well. Otherwise everything OK.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to keep in place and do the brow at the same time and the shapes are very similar . In addition it took a long time to get it.</li>
