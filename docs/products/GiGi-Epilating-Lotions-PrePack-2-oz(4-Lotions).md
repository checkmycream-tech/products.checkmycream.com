    <li> Worked very well. It was a great addition to the wax I bought.</li>
    <li> Very small in size, didn&#x27;t like the products. The lotion doesn&#x27;t take the wax off. Not worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I wish i would have bought 1 larger bottle of the WAX removing lotion instead of all the mini lotions.</li>
    <li> I liked everything, but the wax off since I had a hard time getting the wax off (I had better luck with olive oil) other than that it was awesome. The pre hon was especially useful!</li>
    <li> All the creams you should use when you are waxing. They work great and very reasonably priced..Just shouldn&#x27;t pass them up if you get the machine.</li>
    <li> This is definately something you&#x27;ll want to invest in if you start waxing. Especially with hard wax cuz it is very painful!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive these! not only do they smell great but they really work! I used them to wax my eyebrows and after I used the cooling gel it immediately worked. I bought this because I wanted to know which I would really use the most and I might end up buying all of them in the larger sizes!</li>
