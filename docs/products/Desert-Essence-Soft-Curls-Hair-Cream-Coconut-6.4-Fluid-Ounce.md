      <li>What more could I ask? &#x3D;-)</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>WHAT I LOVE:</li>
      <li>Its ok</li>
      <li>I also love the corresponding shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is the most helpful creme I&#x27;ve found for fly aways so far.</li>
      <li>One thing I require of these products is that after using it, I am able to smoothly run my fingers through my hair, as opposed to &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; products that seem to make my hair feel more coated and sticky.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of it and the texture is smooth.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and looking great.  </li>
      <li>but it does smell nice and does help my curls (which are more like waves really)</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and to wash off hands</li>
      <li>Packaging was very adequate.  </li>
      <li>I have fine curls and although it did curl my hair</li>
      <li>I have fine hair..</li>
      <li>smells so good and made wifes hair soft and bouncy!</li>
      <li>Excellent, it moisturizes and adds shine using just a little amount.</li>
      <li>This DE cream is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I also like that it&#x27;s silicone free, so it doesn&#x27;t give my hair that &amp;#34;fake shine&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It is cheap though.  </li>
      <li>Overall its a pretty good product and worth a try for the ingredients alone (Really good ingredients) XDXD</li>
      <li>I actually do go to the curly style, but I am imagining it will work very nicely with that style, as well.</li>
      <li>It works great whether you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower, or you&#x27;re re-applying to dry hair to style.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only tried it for the blow-dry/ flat-iron style, and wow, it&#x27;s great!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my curls nice and soft .</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only good thing about this cream.</li>
      <li>Leaves me with nice soft curls.</li>
      <li>Manageability is greatly improved for me to the point that I do not have to style with a dryer or any other heated appliance.</li>
      <li>My scalp irritation is greatly reduced compared to other styling products.  </li>
      <li>Most important it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>I even love it more than the ever popular (and way more expensive)</li>
      <li>Love the scent and it makes my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>Love this cream -- it leaves my hair really soft with no frizz!  </li>
      <li>HIGH RECOMMENDATION!!!</li>
      <li>I have noticed it works best on damp hair then blow-dried with a diffuser or left to dry in a protective hairstyle.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, I&#x27;ve only used it like 3 or four times since I got it.</li>
      <li>leaves my curls soft and shiny :)</li>
      <li>So far I am in love with this hair cream.</li>
      <li>HOW I USE:  My hair can absorb and respond well to quite a bit of this cream but as another reviewer suggested, play with it to find the right amount to apply to your hair.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t hope for anything better, especially at this price!</li>
      <li>I first learned about the product @</li>
      <li>Sure, if you put too much of this stuff in your hair, it might make it feel a bit gummy, but once you fiddle with it and figure out how much your hair likes, it gives you soft, defined curls with shine and volume.</li>
      <li>It smells heavenly - a very soft, clean coconut scent.</li>
      <li>I dollop it in one palm and run my other palm under warm water before rubbing them together and applying.</li>
      <li>It dries soft and smooth and washes out easily the next day.</li>
      <li>It keeps my curls from frizzing and makes then super soft.  </li>
      <li>I really like this stuff</li>
      <li>II have very curly hair and have tried lots of leave in curl managers and conditioners.</li>
      <li>It really softens my hair.</li>
      <li>but didn&#x27;t really curl up the type 4c portion of my hair, maybe it could for type 4 a or b.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really makes my curls POP, and elongates them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have wavy thick hair. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was necessarily helping define my natural curls.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT BUT GO EASY IT IS A HEAVY CREAM AND CAN WEIGH DOWN THE CURLS.</li>
    <li> II have very curly hair and have tried lots of leave in curl managers and conditioners. One thing I require of these products is that after using it, I am able to smoothly run my fingers through my hair, as opposed to &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; products that seem to make my hair feel more coated and sticky.  A good one to try if you can relate to what I am trying to describe is MorrocanOil Curl Defining Cream. I was hoping to find a less expensive option than that one, but this one will not cut it.</li>
    <li> I first learned about the product @ a recent &amp;#34;Green&amp;#34; Environmental  Exhibit, @Ft. Mason, San Francisco. I decided to order it, &amp; I LOVE the product! I use it everyday on my hair to make it look radiant.  The scent is also very pleasant.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It keeps my curls from frizzing and makes then super soft.  It also has a very pleasant  soft coconut smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  You also can&#x27;t tell you put anything in your hair. no residue no weight... nothing.  love it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  It smells nice and helps define my kinky curly hair.  I also like how it has coconut oil in it, which means it protects my dry coils from split ends.  My only complaint is I wish the bottle was bigger.  As I grow my hair out, I know I will require more product per wash.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Since I have curly hair I have always been on the hunt for product that will work best. Most of the time I move on to a new product before the last is completely gone. This is one of those products I keep coming back to. Also, I noticed my scalp got super dry when I stopped using it to try something else. And, as another reviewer mentioned, I recently tried Deva Styling Creme and ... meh. This stuff beats it. Moisturizing, frizz-taming, non-crunchy, perfect feel.</li>
    <li> Nice and lightweight not to mention the smell is heavenly..... Provides little to no hold tho so lost a star for that..... Although my curly hair isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to hold anyway!</li>
    <li> It leaves my curls nice and soft . They look great . I also use the Desert Essence shampoo and conditioner . My hair smells great . It&#x27;s a tropical paradise in my hair</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it makes my hair very soft. Love dessert essence products. Highly recommend this product for those with dryer hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted to this stuff. My days of frizzy, unhealthy, nestbox of hair are over. It will turn your hair into a dreamland of soft shiny curls.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance but it made my hair feel a little sticky.</li>
    <li> LOVE the way it makes may hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> I used this a couple times. I love the smell of it and the texture is smooth. I have wavy/curly hair and this product give my curls a weird texture. It feels really dry and frizzes on the ends.</li>
    <li> Love this cream -- it leaves my hair really soft with no frizz!  My hair is very fine and can be curly in some places and wavy in others, mixed in with some straight pieces (another reviewer had similar hair).  This cream does help even that out.  I use a glycerine-based shampoo from Bubble &amp; Bee Organics and an apple cider vinegar rinse in place of conditioner.  This has helped with the frizz but humid days still just bring it on.  This DE cream is fantastic.  I have tried other salon curl creams but this one beats all.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I am trying to let my hair go curly.  It&#x27;s naturally curly, but I blow-dry and flat-iron it.  I&#x27;ve only tried it for the blow-dry/ flat-iron style, and wow, it&#x27;s great!  Smooths the hair, acts as a nice flat-iron product, and smells great.  Will update when (if?) I actually do go to the curly style, but I am imagining it will work very nicely with that style, as well.</li>
    <li> Instant curls!  My hair is normally wavy and can get unruly.  But with this stuff, I just put a dab through my damp hair, scrunch it up and go.  Leaves me with nice soft curls.</li>
    <li> I have thin fragile dry hair that usually appears to be a mess of inconsistent waves, few curls, and some straight.  My scalp is dry and allergy-prone. WHAT I LOVE: Manageability is greatly improved for me to the point that I do not have to style with a dryer or any other heated appliance. My waves/curls are enhanced into a cohesive pattern that look like an actual style.  My scalp irritation is greatly reduced compared to other styling products.  HOW I USE:  My hair can absorb and respond well to quite a bit of this cream but as another reviewer suggested, play with it to find the right amount to apply to your hair. It is thick and my hair is thin so to help distribute it more evenly I dollop it in one palm and run my other palm under warm water before rubbing them together and applying. Any remaining in my hands is a treat for my elbows.  I also love the corresponding shampoo. Lastly, I love that the current price on Amazon is about a buck and a half less than my local &amp;#34;natural foods&amp;#34; store.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, I&#x27;ve only used it like 3 or four times since I got it. I got this on a whim, and do think it&#x27;s helps curls out. I just got done with my relaxer, so my curls aren&#x27;t like they use to, but this product definitely helps when I put it on.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, and has a good texture. However, my hair is really think and curly so I have to use a lot of it. I am not going to use it for a while and come back to it to see what happens.</li>
    <li> smells great, works on my hair</li>
    <li> 1. The smell is like  piña colada.&lt;br /&gt;2. Thick and rich.&lt;br /&gt;3. Its ok but didn&#x27;t really curl up the type 4c portion of my hair, maybe it could for type 4 a or b.&lt;br /&gt;4. Overall its a pretty good product and worth a try for the ingredients alone (Really good ingredients) XDXD</li>
    <li> Smells like a suntan lotion going to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of coconut or anykind.&lt;br /&gt;Does work well through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle was little smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t define my curls well, I still have a lot of flyaways.  It is cheap though.  i will not buy it again but if you&#x27;re on a budget it&#x27;s ok.  Personally I think it works as well as just applying conditioner like a curl cream, which is much cheaper.  So even if you&#x27;re on a budget there are cheaper options.</li>
    <li> I have big, curly hair that tends to get frizzy and pouffy if I use the wrong product. Lightweight and actually leaves my curls soft. This is the most helpful creme I&#x27;ve found for fly aways so far. Plus, it smells great. I couldn&#x27;t hope for anything better, especially at this price!</li>
    <li> Excellent, it moisturizes and adds shine using just a little amount. The smell is not my favourite, but when your hair is dry the odor disappears.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and looking great.  Like beachy waves.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that crunchy look and feel that so many gels, mousses, and sprays tend to.</li>
    <li> works well on my hair</li>
    <li> smells so good and made wifes hair soft and bouncy!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a leave-in conditioner that follows the &amp;#34;Curly Girl Method&amp;#34; meaning it is silicone free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very very small for the price. But, I have hair halfway down my back and only use a dime-size amount so I think it will last months before I run out. I also do not apply this anywhere near my scalp because it (and other leave-in conditioners) will make my hair look greasy. However, if you&#x27;re using the correct amount and application, it shouldn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it really hydrates my hair anymore than my usual conditioner that I wash out but it does smell nice and does help my curls (which are more like waves really) have better form.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. I cannot say it gives the curl part.. cause I mix a lot of stuff in my hair.. but I will say this. My hair has never felt or looked or smelled better. It really softens my hair. I have fine hair.. but with a touch of curl.. but.. again, I mix it up in the morning.. You oughta see me.. and.. I use VASELINE to undry my ends! It works.. but.. this stuff.. GET IT!!! HIGH RECOMMENDATION!!!</li>
    <li> Much better for my daughter&#x27;s tight curls, but not so good for my thick and bushy head of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a less chemically based hair product for my hair for the longest time. I really did love TIGI&#x27;s catwalk curls rock curl amplifier, but it is very chemical based and expensive. This new product works just as well, isn&#x27;t so synthetic, costs less and smells better.</li>
    <li> I give this curl cream three stars. I love that it&#x27;s natural and smells great! I think that if you had very corse thick curly hair this would work very well. However not for me! I have fine curls and although it did curl my hair it was WAY to heavy and felt very gummy in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this.  It turns my naturally frizzy hair into tamed curls.  No more blow drying--yay!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I even love it more than the ever popular (and way more expensive) Deva Curl Styling Cream, which to me has a sort of synthetic scent to it and leaves my hair a bit frizzy. Sure, if you put too much of this stuff in your hair, it might make it feel a bit gummy, but once you fiddle with it and figure out how much your hair likes, it gives you soft, defined curls with shine and volume. The smell isn&#x27;t perfumey either; just subtle, natural coconut scent. Perfect for my 2c/3a curls!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that I wish the smell lasted longer. It is easy to apply and to wash off hands</li>
    <li> Great to get your hair really curly , use in combination with shampoo and conditioner , you will love it,</li>
    <li> This gives me control of my unpredictable curls without leaving my hair hard or crunchy.</li>
    <li> Hair cream received as indicated, on time. Packaging was very adequate.  Product is my favorite hair cream, giving me extra volume and body, as well as the soft curls as advertised.  In my opinion, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my 3 year olds hair. It&#x27;s perfect for her curly hair and does a nice job smoothing out the frizz. It&#x27;s smells great too. Most important it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any toxic chemicals. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite but works ok. Scent isn&#x27;t quite as I has expected but isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
    <li> So far I am in love with this hair cream. I have slowly started using more and more Desert Essence products because of their natural ingredients, reasonable prices, and overall effectiveness. I have wavy/curly hair that tends to be oily and finicky when it comes to styling. No two hair days are ever the same! While there&#x27;s nothing I can do about my hair type, I have to say this hair cream has really impressed me so far. I use a very small amount, emulsify in my palms, and it spreads evenly throughout my hair. Not once have I felt like it left an oily/greasy residue. Very nice, light coconut scent. It works great whether you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower, or you&#x27;re re-applying to dry hair to style.</li>
    <li> The only gluten-free curly hair product that I have found. Gluten in hair products makes my scalp itch like crazy, and it took forever to find out the source of the problem. I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this product! It&#x27;s gluten-free, it is quality, it isn&#x27;t full of chemical garbage, and it works for my hair!! Yay! What more could I ask? &#x3D;-)</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, I put it in my hair as a moisturizer everyday and pull it up into a ponytail to help my dry hair. I also like that it&#x27;s silicone free, so it doesn&#x27;t give my hair that &amp;#34;fake shine&amp;#34; look. I love the smell too :) It really makes my curls POP, and elongates them. I can&#x27;t wait to style my hair with heat with this too!</li>
    <li> very nice product..i will use then i will decide if i am going to order more and i will tell all my friends about it..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. leaves my curls soft and shiny :)</li>
    <li> I give this a four star because it smells really good. It feels like lotion except it doesn&#x27;t go on the skin it goes on my hair. Once applied to my dry hair, it gives it shine. I have noticed it works best on damp hair then blow-dried with a diffuser or left to dry in a protective hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that is wavy/frizzy on top and has ringlets underneath. I&#x27;ve always wanted to wear it curly but never could so I blow it out. This product is FABULOUS! I have absolutely gorgeous curls with this product. I may never use my blow dryer again!</li>
    <li> I thought this might be an alternative to Alba&#x27;s soft control cream, which works very well, but smells like glue. This does have a great mild coconut scent. But no hold or curl formation at all. It&#x27;s basically just expensive leave-in conditioner. (I have long, curly 3b type hair)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. I have natural ringlet curls that are very, very long and this works fantastically. It smells heavenly - a very soft, clean coconut scent. It keeps my hair from fizzing out of control but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky in any way. It dries soft and smooth and washes out easily the next day.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything. It just sits on your hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, left my hair feeling crunchy and dry.  I have med-course hair that is naturally wavy that needs a leave in product to retain moisture between washes. Smells great though!</li>
    <li> I gave it one star because it smells really good. That&#x27;s the only good thing about this cream. It did nothing to tame my hair, or my curls.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle worker for curly hair</li>
    <li> This product is great, gives great definition to my curls, my curls didnt get frizzy, smells great highly recommend it.</li>
