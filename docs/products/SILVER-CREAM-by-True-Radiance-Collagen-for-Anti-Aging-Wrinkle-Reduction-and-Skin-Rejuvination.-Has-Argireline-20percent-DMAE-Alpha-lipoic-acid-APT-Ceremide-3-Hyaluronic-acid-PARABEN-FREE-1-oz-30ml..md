      <li>, so you get a much more powerful hyrdration</li>

      <li>cannot possibly say enough good things about this product.</li>

      <li>very runny - felt as though water was added to it.</li>
      <li>Many other brands list the same ingredients but contain only miniscule amounts of them, not enough to really do you any good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the more expensive products and True Radiance is as good or better, and much less expensive.</li>
      <li>3 ingredients seperately, &amp; this is high &amp;#34;medical</li>
      <li>Unlike other stuff out there, True Radiance actually tells you HOW MUCH of each ingredient their product contains.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth...nice smell....</li>
      <li>Was hopeful that this was really going to help my dry skin</li>

    <li> i used this product for two months and noticed some subtle changes.  However, then i quit using it and started using something else.  I noticed my skin was not as radiant looking and wrinkles were showing again.  I ordered it again right away.  i like this product.</li>
    <li> i bought this after seeing Dr. Oz recommend a cream containing argireline to a woman for her wrinkles - it&#x27;s supposed to have the effect of a topical botox.  i like the cream, it&#x27;s lightweight and soaks right in without being at all greasy (and doesn&#x27;t give me clogged pores) but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m seeing any \\&quot;botox-like\\&quot; results.  it&#x27;s only been a few weeks and i know these things take time to work but....</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin. Didn&#x27;t give it 5 because of the cost.</li>
    <li> I use it after applying the derma roller - very soothing on the skin, very impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> I use every time I use my derma roller (which is at right before bed). It makes my face feel silky and leaves no residue.  A little seems to go along way. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> True Radiance is, far and away, the best anti-aging/anti-wrinkle product out there. I&#x27;ve tried many of the more expensive products and True Radiance is as good or better, and much less expensive. Visible results in minutes. Unlike other stuff out there, True Radiance actually tells you HOW MUCH of each ingredient their product contains. Many other brands list the same ingredients but contain only miniscule amounts of them, not enough to really do you any good. All of their basic products (Radiance, Silver, and Youth) are excellent, and the site provides great advice on what&#x27;s best for your particular skin type. Excellent customer service. And their \\&quot;free gift with every purchase\\&quot; is a great way to try different products. Aleta, who owns the company and who developed the formulations, is happy to help you find what&#x27;s best for your particular needs.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot possibly say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> it smells bad.  i&#x27;m not sure what the smell is from.  that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> I watched someone on youtube using this product and she had a very nice skin, and I just went ahead and ordered it. I really like it. I use it in the morning and at night time, I notice that the wrinkles around my eyes, my forehead and the sides of my mouth are by far less noticeable. YES to this product!.</li>
    <li> very runny - felt as though water was added to it. I will not buy again</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the Retinol-A after using the roller.  I apply it morning and night in between the roller days too!</li>
    <li> This product plus the micro derma needle roller got rid of my acne scars. I have beautiful skin now !</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing skincare product!  Worthy of a buy and try! Happy new year, Lisa</li>
    <li> Great product ...noticeable difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying more. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  Packaging is not fancy, but man does it work!!!</li>
    <li> Within days of using this product my skin has totally transformed.  I am 49 and a smoker.  My skin was discolored, with fine tiny lines, frown lines, and puffy eyes.  Within days my skin looked fresher, the discoloration diminished along with the tiny lines.  Even my eye puffiness has reduced along with the sharp wrinkles under them.  I am odering more and thought I would also try the Golden Serum.</li>
    <li> Very very  nice hydrating cream. The best I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> this cream does not work as well as they say. For the price, I would not order it again!!&lt;br /&gt;I will look for a product, that works for me!!</li>
    <li> Have not noticed much improvement with this product in the two weeks that I have been applying it, morning and night.</li>
    <li> Have tried many products and this one really packs it in for the price. Many great, crucial ingredients for hydrating and anti-aging incorporated into this Silver Cream. Love that it penetrates quickly and is not sticky. Consistency is great.</li>
    <li> I just got this in a few days ago.  It is very powerful for regenerating healthy glowing skin, zapping wrinkles, &amp; hydrating&lt;br /&gt;thirsty skin.  I used it all over my face, neck areas and skin has a very velvety glow.  My make up went on very smooth&lt;br /&gt;&amp; a lady I had lunch with said I looked like I was getting more rest.  Apparently I looked tired.  Unhealthy skin can make you&lt;br /&gt;look exhausted.  I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about Marine Collagen combined with Argireline , Hyluronic Acid, so I did not have to purchase&lt;br /&gt;these 3 ingredients seperately, &amp; this is high &amp;#34;medical grade&amp;#34; serum, not cosmetic grade, so you get a much more powerful hyrdration&lt;br /&gt;into all layers of the skin.  It leaves no residue.  I wait at least 2 hrs before applying make up or pore perfectors/illuminators etc. to give&lt;br /&gt;it proper time to feed your skin.  This perhaps should be called Feed your skin because that is what it is doing.  Good stuff.  I have tried&lt;br /&gt;so many products that have failed to deliver, so am glad I finally hit on this 5 star Silver Cream Serum  Very good stuff.  And this price&lt;br /&gt;is much more reasonable than the others that did not work.  This one contains the most Argireline/Collagen I could find in a blend.</li>
    <li> Was hopeful that this was really going to help my dry skin but the jury is still out on this product.</li>
    <li> The WORST product I have ever tried. Not kidding at all. It smells so bad, it gave me stomach ache. Dries my skin out too. It&#x27;s not only waste of money, it makes me gag. It STINKS like chicken poop. Wells its a fish collagen at the end. I can&#x27;t help it. Tossed out.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this product on my face and it has marine collagen in it. I alternate this product with the Clinicians Complex Retinol-A Serum 1 oz after my facial roller procedure. There are other great benefits to this product and I love the fact they are all in one bottle. My skin is really looking so good. I will definitely purchase this product again. And I recommend it to everyone when they say, &amp;#34;what have you had done to your skin&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth...nice smell....no major results! Will continue to use.  Looking for major results around the neck line.</li>
