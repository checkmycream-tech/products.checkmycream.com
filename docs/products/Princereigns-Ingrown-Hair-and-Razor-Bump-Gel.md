### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very Happy I stumbled on the combo.</li>
      <li>I use this and TendSkin and the combo of them both WORKS superbly.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent.</li>
      <li>Instead the Emjoi post epilation cream was awesome.</li>
      <li>downside is Flawless</li>
      <li>This product is just Amazing!!</li>
      <li>I am proud to say \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to go to the beach this summer!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>item works great brought over 5 bottle  </li>
      <li>According to the reviews, it has worked great for some people and I can&#x27;t imagine they are lying.  </li>
      <li>I read a lot of great reviews about this product</li>
      <li>I am thrilled I did!  </li>
      <li>I am a woman of color; therefore shaving and waxing the bikini area is all an issue for my skin type; but I can say this product is good with eliminating redness and irritation after a bikini wax.  </li>
      <li>I donot mind paying for a good product</li>
      <li>This product wasn&#x27;t as good as i had imagined and for the price and size of the bottle I will not be buying this again.</li>
      <li>I am going to order more when I run out!</li>
      <li>The results are fantastic!!</li>
      <li>I will never do business with this company again and I will make sure I warn family and friends!</li>
      <li>I was hoping to write a positive review about how wonderful it was after a couple weeks.    </li>
      <li>I think it has a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and is easy to apply, but not what I had hoped for.  </li>
      <li>I have used it twice a day for over two months hoping that with more use I would start to see some effect.  </li>
      <li>It unearths even the most stubborn of hairs.</li>
      <li>Just ordered two more bottles.</li>
      <li>I realize this has worked for many but did nothing for me.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Bikini Season! :-)</li>
      <li>I have suffered for many many years from ingrown hairs (ever since I started shaving).</li>
      <li>Both my wife and I use it and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I would also suggest Flawless from Nordstoms, it is just as good if not better...</li>
      <li>However, I think aloe vera or pure water would have been just as effective for me.    </li>
      <li>I bought this after doing a lot of research and hearing such great reviews.  </li>
      <li>is in a much smaller bottle, great smell; but comes out like water unlike Princereigns which is somewhat thicker.  </li>
      <li>Sound familiar?  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll need more than one bottle if you really want to get the full benefit of this treatment.</li>
      <li>few days and great results.</li>
      <li>For 18.00 a bottle, its definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>it is so worth it.      </li>
      <li>With consistent use, we&#x27;ve found that fewer and fewer bumps are forming at all, and when they do form they clear up much more quickly.  </li>
      <li>But since we&#x27;ve had success with it, we wanted to share the good news with other sufferers.  </li>
      <li>The one good thing I can say about it is that it didn&#x27;t burn going on like some other things (bump patrol specifically)</li>
      <li>It prevents ingrowns, and it also smells pretty fresh.</li>
      <li>I was so hopeful this would solve all my problems, but I have not seen very much change since beginning to use the product.</li>
      <li>I am off to try another similar product and am hopeful about better results.</li>
      <li>For the first week, it seemed to work, then it just stopped working.</li>
      <li>I get ingrown hairs pretty often though and got this product on a recommendation from my waxer.</li>
      <li>This product is nothing short of magical.</li>
      <li>The Item was exactly what I wanted and needed</li>
      <li>When I first started using the product I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but I kept using it until it was finished</li>
      <li>It helps get rid of the scars and makes sure that no new ones occur.</li>
      <li>I would certainly give it a try.</li>
      <li>Perhaps this product is designed to relieve razor bumps more so than ingrown hairs-although I till experienced the terribly painful irritation that corresponds with ingrown hairs.  </li>
      <li>I get waxed monthly because shaving causes me so much irritation.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended !</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Princereigns; bumps and ingrowns gone!</li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>The pores become plugged up with keratin and very often an ingrown hair gets tangled inside.  </li>
      <li>This product, while not inexpensive, works very well.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I exfoliate frequently and used this product (you are supposed to use it 2 times a day-</li>
      <li>I live in a humid climate &amp; the summer months seem to cause more ingrowns than other times of year.</li>
      <li>Since my original post, I have come back to better review this product because I have used it for a few month now.  </li>
      <li>I have seen a reduction in the amount of ingrowns &amp; a lightening of older discoloration spots.</li>
      <li>After having tried many different products to get rid of ingrown hairs and razor bumps on my neck , I had never found something that actually did the trick.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much; I was truly surprised by the results.  </li>
      <li>For me and for my daughter, at least, this is the long-searched for, effective treatment for keratosis pilaris.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used another product for years and was hesitant about trying something new ...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the price scare you, it lasts a long time, and is well worth it.</li>
      <li>SO FAR!</li>
      <li>Squeezing or picking leads to bleeding and scars; acne medications are ineffective, and dermatologists generally tell their patients they \\&quot;just have to live with it.\\&quot;  Cortisone-type steroids can help, but they damage the skin in the long term, and using them every day on a substantial portion of the skin can make the skin thinner and more fragile, like an elderly person&#x27;s skin, far too early in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I must say I was a little skeptical at first with this product, but it turned out to be pretty good.</li>
      <li>, I tried the Prince Reigns gel, since it was said to help clear up ingrown hairs, and ingrown hairs are involved in this condition.  </li>
      <li>I have seen a marked change in my skin, it is smoother and I feel like there are fewer bumps and the discoloration is fading.</li>
      <li>so far, nothing.</li>
      <li>-- there&#x27;s no long-term benefit as far as we can tell.  </li>
      <li>The product is a green gel that applies smoothly, twice a day.  </li>
      <li>nothing special at all...just a waste of my cash....</li>
      <li>but when it was shipped to me the bottles were not completely sealed and leaked into the box  Not too much.  </li>
      <li>I have only been using this product for a few weeks now, but I have noticed a significant difference.</li>
      <li>Skin that was rough to the touch and appeared to be covered in acne now looks and feels a whole lot</li>
      <li>But so far this is the ONLY product that has helped at all.</li>
      <li>I guess I will go back to tend skin, which is ok, not great either.</li>
      <li>It changed the texture of my hair, instead of it being down and in my skin it started to grow straight.</li>
      <li>The hairs are growing in straight instead of curling, therefore, by passing the little red bump.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not a magic cure, but it seems to soften the keratin plugs, which makes them flatter and less noticeable right away.  </li>
<li> It also evens out the skin tone in the areas that you shave/wax, and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I had tried tend skin along with several other products to prevent ingrown hairs.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m currently using a braun pulsonic series 7 (790) electric razor which received rave reviews on amazon, cnet, and about any other site that reviews electric razors.  </li>
<li> Have not used this product very long; but after a bikini wax this product did eliminate all redness and irritation.  </li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
<li> Before using this product I had been using Tend Skin, which tended to dry the area,</li>
<li> The problem with waxing is that a few days later a dark red bump would form.</li>
<li> It seemed expensive for the size of bottle, but if it worked it would be worth it.  </li>
<li> A little bit of the gel goes a long way.</li>
<li> I got this stuff to try and get rid of the scars I have from shaving due to ingrown hairs.</li>
<li> If anyone has any other remedies, PLEASE comment on this review with your ideas.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is just Amazing!! I have suffered for many many years from ingrown hairs (ever since I started shaving). I have tried everything over the counter even some old fashioned home remedies and they where all sadly disappointing.     Princereigns has changed my life forever. The results are fantastic!! I am proud to say \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to go to the beach this summer!\\&quot;  I love this product. A little pricey but I don&#x27;t care it is so worth it.      I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After having tried many different products to get rid of ingrown hairs and razor bumps on my neck , I had never found something that actually did the trick.  I read a lot of great reviews about this product so I decided to give it a try.  It seemed expensive for the size of bottle, but if it worked it would be worth it.  I was hoping to write a positive review about how wonderful it was after a couple weeks.    Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see the dramatic improvement I had hoped for after reading the reviews.  So I gave it over a month before I wrote my review hoping that it would eventually do SOMETHING.  It never has.    The one good thing I can say about it is that it didn&#x27;t burn going on like some other things (bump patrol specifically) I have tried.  It felt soothing going on.  However, I think aloe vera or pure water would have been just as effective for me.    So if you want to give this a try and have an extra [...] laying around, go for it.  According to the reviews, it has worked great for some people and I can&#x27;t imagine they are lying.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all and I am still searching for something - anything that will improve this problem.  I also switched to an electric razor about the same time I started using this.  I&#x27;m currently using a braun pulsonic series 7 (790) electric razor which received rave reviews on amazon, cnet, and about any other site that reviews electric razors.  If anyone has any other remedies, PLEASE comment on this review with your ideas.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and within a couple of days of use, the number of ingrown hairs I had reduced. I used this product only on my face. It also cleared up the dark spots caused by ingrown hairs. My skin looks healthier. I tried other products like Skin Tight but they didnt work. I apply it everyday and will continue to use this product. Just ordered two more bottles. For 18.00 a bottle, its definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a couple of weeks and already the bottle is half gone.  It did help my ingrowns but I still had to go with my tweezers and pulls the hair out. This product wasn&#x27;t as good as i had imagined and for the price and size of the bottle I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> neutral about this, because i havent seen a decrease in ingrowns, and i still get a bad reaction when i shave my bikini area.  same results as other products.</li>
    <li> Princereigns gel arrived within it&#x27;s committed delivery date.  I have used another product for years and was hesitant about trying something new ... I am thrilled I did!  I highly recommend Princereigns; bumps and ingrowns gone!</li>
    <li> I had the worst razor bumps and this saved my life. It did not burn or anything. It changed the texture of my hair, instead of it being down and in my skin it started to grow straight. I am going to order more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I bought this after doing a lot of research and hearing such great reviews.  I have used it twice a day for over two months hoping that with more use I would start to see some effect.  I have had horrible ingrown hairs on my bikini line for as long as I can remember.  I was hoping that this product would provide me with some small relief but it did not have any effect whatsoever.  Perhaps this product is designed to relieve razor bumps more so than ingrown hairs-although I till experienced the terribly painful irritation that corresponds with ingrown hairs.  I realize this has worked for many but did nothing for me.  I am extremely disappointed and am now on the hunt for a new miracle.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I get waxed monthly because shaving causes me so much irritation. I get ingrown hairs pretty often though and got this product on a recommendation from my waxer. I was so hopeful this would solve all my problems, but I have not seen very much change since beginning to use the product. First of all, I exfoliate frequently and used this product (you are supposed to use it 2 times a day- that&#x27;s a pain!). Other than a slightly reduced (very slight) amount of ingrowns, I can not say this has done a single thing for me. I am off to try another similar product and am hopeful about better results.</li>
    <li> I brought this and it was like water....nothing special at all...just a waste of my cash....there were still ingrown hairs and razor bumps and it never removed any blemishes...also I asked for my money back and I got a very very RUDE Customer rep...who pissed me off....I will never do business with this company again and I will make sure I warn family and friends!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Princereign Ingrown Hair and Razor Bump Gel every day for over a month now and while I wasn&#x27;t expecting miraculous results, I can&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever in the bumps and ingrown hairs on my bikini line. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or anything, and it wasn&#x27;t drying or stinky, it just didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would work on my in grown hair from leg waxing, but have been using twice a day for almost two weeks and I see no difference.  It smells good and is easy to apply, but not what I had hoped for.  I guess I will go back to tend skin, which is ok, not great either.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS PERIOD and in only a matter of days, I stole it from my husband and he and I cant say enough about it.</li>
    <li> I used Princereigns ingrown hair serum for about a week now and I&#x27;ve already notice less irritation on my face from where I shave.  I haven&#x27;t had any bumps appear since using this product.</li>
    <li> Have not used this product very long; but after a bikini wax this product did eliminate all redness and irritation.  Also, I have noticed less bumps caused by ingrowns.  UPDATE:  Since my original post, I have come back to better review this product because I have used it for a few month now.  I am a woman of color; therefore shaving and waxing the bikini area is all an issue for my skin type; but I can say this product is good with eliminating redness and irritation after a bikini wax.  There is no foul odor and it does aid in decreasing ingrown hairs.  I would also suggest Flawless from Nordstoms, it is just as good if not better...downside is Flawless is in a much smaller bottle, great smell; but comes out like water unlike Princereigns which is somewhat thicker.  Can&#x27;t go wrong either way, I keep both on hand.  If ingrown hairs, redness and irritation are a issue for you after waxing or shaving, this product works and it does help to be proactive and pluck out ingrown hairs as you see them!</li>
    <li> When I first started using the product I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but I kept using it until it was finished and it was time to get a wax (about 6 weeks).  To my surprise, after I got the wax I noticed the area was noticeably lighter and blended in color.  I also noticed that it seemed to retard the growth of the hair and the hair grew back even finer as well.  Before using this product I had been using Tend Skin, which tended to dry the area, but I didn&#x27;t see any dramatically noticeable results. I know some products work well for some and not as well for others, but I would recommend the use of this product on African American skin as it dramatically worked for me.</li>
    <li> item works great brought over 5 bottle  just if you have tough skin like mine it takes like a week to break threw the hair you will just get a big red spot til it pops</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. No results even after finishing one bottle. Instead the Emjoi post epilation cream was awesome. few days and great results. I donot mind paying for a good product but Princereigns was a bad buy for me. I will not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I have seen a marked change in my skin, it is smoother and I feel like there are fewer bumps and the discoloration is fading. I bought this once from the product website, and its less expensive on Amazon, and came faster. I will by this product over and over.</li>
    <li> USE THIS AFTER WAXING AND IT IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT WORKS AS ADVERTISED SO FAR! A MUST HAVE IF YOU WAX!</li>
    <li> I have been using Princereigns for a few months now.  It really works.  It isn&#x27;t an overnight type thing (at least for me) but it has improved my skin and brings those ingrown hairs to the surface.  I think it has a nice smell.  Kinda like watermellon.</li>
    <li> Ive been a devotee of this product for years. I am prone to ingrown hairs like the sun is to rising. This product is nothing short of magical. It unearths even the most stubborn of hairs. Don&#x27;t let the price scare you, it lasts a long time, and is well worth it. Try it out!</li>
    <li> I had tried tend skin along with several other products to prevent ingrown hairs. None of them did anything but burn &amp; irritate my skin. I have been using Prince Reigns Ingrown Hair Serum for about 4 months. I have seen a reduction in the amount of ingrowns &amp; a lightening of older discoloration spots. I live in a humid climate &amp; the summer months seem to cause more ingrowns than other times of year. But so far this is the ONLY product that has helped at all. I use it twice a day from the day of my Brazilian waxing service to the next service. I would certainly give it a try.</li>
    <li> The Item was exactly what I wanted and needed but when it was shipped to me the bottles were not completely sealed and leaked into the box  Not too much.  My suggestion would be double check the lids before sealing.</li>
    <li> I have an issue with facial hair. There, I said it. It is not a fun issue to deal with when you&#x27;re a woman. I prefer to wax my sideburns, lip, and chin. The problem with waxing is that a few days later a dark red bump would form. I have only been using this product for a few weeks now, but I have noticed a significant difference. The hairs are growing in straight instead of curling, therefore, by passing the little red bump. A little bit of the gel goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had tried everything before for my razor bumps and ingrown hair. For the first week, it seemed to work, then it just stopped working. Bumps came back, ingrown hair was there. I&#x27;m still using it, hoping that it will work again (plus it&#x27;s not cheap)and so far, nothing. Maybe I have stubborn skin/hair. Well, at least I now know!</li>
    <li> This product, while not inexpensive, works very well.  Both my wife and I use it and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  She uses it after a Brazillian wax and I after shaving and it virtually eliminates all ingrown hairs and razor burn.  Highly recommended !</li>
    <li> For me and for my daughter, at least, this is the long-searched for, effective treatment for keratosis pilaris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keratosis pilaris is an inherited condition appearing in childhood, adolescence and often into adulthood.  It&#x27;s quite common, and while it&#x27;s benign, it&#x27;s also unattractive and highly frustrating.  Small hard white bumps appear, most often on the backs and outsides of the upper arms (although they may appear on the legs and elsewhere).  Sound familiar?  The pores become plugged up with keratin and very often an ingrown hair gets tangled inside.  They look a lot like pimples, but that&#x27;s not what they are.  Squeezing or picking leads to bleeding and scars; acne medications are ineffective, and dermatologists generally tell their patients they \\&quot;just have to live with it.\\&quot;  Cortisone-type steroids can help, but they damage the skin in the long term, and using them every day on a substantial portion of the skin can make the skin thinner and more fragile, like an elderly person&#x27;s skin, far too early in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I tried the Prince Reigns gel, since it was said to help clear up ingrown hairs, and ingrown hairs are involved in this condition.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much; I was truly surprised by the results.  It&#x27;s not a magic cure, but it seems to soften the keratin plugs, which makes them flatter and less noticeable right away.  With consistent use, we&#x27;ve found that fewer and fewer bumps are forming at all, and when they do form they clear up much more quickly.  It&#x27;s not a complete cure, and it has to be used daily -- there&#x27;s no long-term benefit as far as we can tell.  But it does make a substantial difference.  Skin that was rough to the touch and appeared to be covered in acne now looks and feels a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, YMMV.  The product is not marketed for this condition.  But since we&#x27;ve had success with it, we wanted to share the good news with other sufferers.  Hope this helps some other folks!</li>
    <li> I must say I was a little skeptical at first with this product, but it turned out to be pretty good. It works slow but it does work. You&#x27;ll need more than one bottle if you really want to get the full benefit of this treatment.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff to try and get rid of the scars I have from shaving due to ingrown hairs. I apply it after I shave and at least once a day. It helps get rid of the scars and makes sure that no new ones occur.</li>
    <li> Though I use both, I prefer this over tend skin. You will have no ingrowns with this and it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. It also evens out the skin tone in the areas that you shave/wax, and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is truly a miracle product! I love it. It prevents ingrowns, and it also smells pretty fresh. WOuld recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is a green gel that applies smoothly, twice a day.  It helps to lessen the hyper pigmentation from previous ingrown hairs and it helps to prevent new ones.  It&#x27;s not the cure-all, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
    <li> I use this and TendSkin and the combo of them both WORKS superbly. No Ingrowns or bumps in quite some time after bikini/brazilian wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend getting both, Can&#x27;t hurt! Very Happy I stumbled on the combo. Rocking Out w/my C@ck Out!!!!! Bikini Season! :-)</li>
