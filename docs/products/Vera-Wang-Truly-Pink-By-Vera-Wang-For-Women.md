      <li>had an idea in mind of what &amp;#34;Truly Pink&amp;#34; would smell like &amp; the description sounded good, but the actual fragrance fell short.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Since it is discontinued, I bought 2 more bottles just in case I cannot get more in the future.</li>
      <li>Come on guys do something nice for your wives and girlfriends just out of the blue.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice, soft frangrance that is not too overpowering yet very feminine.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite perfume so far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sad that I haven&#x27;t been able to purchase it where I originally found it, anymore, but it is definitely more cost effective this way.</li>
      <li>far two of my friends are actually being influenced by me and they are loving it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved Truly Pink by Vera Wang for years &amp; years, and it never fails to get compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful, delicate, scent that is never overpowering.</li>
      <li>Tried many others in store, nothing can compare to this one, even those big names.  </li>
      <li>I smelled it for the first time visiting a friend of mine 2 years ago</li>
      <li>And it cost a whole lot cheaper than Macy&#x27;s!  </li>
      <li>My co-worker tried it first</li>
      <li>I love it and get lots of compliments when I wear it especially when I pair it with the lotion.</li>

      <li>Even though rose sounds a little &amp;#34;old,&amp;#34; Truly Pink isn&#x27;t sweet or cloying, not powdery or heavy at all - it&#x27;s light, fresh &amp; just lovely!  </li>

      <li>so I was not late gifting!</li>

      <li>Will continue to buy it as long as it is still available.</li>
      <li>I was thinking about getting Romance by Ralph Lauren but the price is so high</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The perfume arrived in perfect condition and on time. I had not smelled the fragrance in person before so I knew it was a bit of a gamble. I like it okay. It has a bit of a watery scent to me in the opening and I do not care for watery scents. I was expecting more of a soft rose floral fragrance, and I do not smell any rose at all. I am disappointed as the rose was what I was wanting. It is strange because usually my skin naturally brings out those soft floral scents I love but this one just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; right for me.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is such a personal preference it is difficult to rate and decide for anyone else other than yourself. For me this was not a winner. I will keep it and still wear it occasionally, but I will certainly not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was shopping for a rose-scented fragrance and this came up in my search. I was thinking about getting Romance by Ralph Lauren but the price is so high so I decided to take a chance and buy Truly Pink. I have been wearing it for a few days now and I have to say that I am glad I purchased this. It&#x27;s a very lovely and soft fragrance, not overpowering at all. The rose scent lingers for a long time with only about two sprays in the morning. I&#x27;m definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Truly Pink by Vera Wang. I smelled it for the first time visiting a friend of mine 2 years ago and I have been hooked ever since. It is a nice, soft frangrance that is not too overpowering yet very feminine. I get compliments all the time from people on this perfume. I was really disappointed to see that it was not being sold in department stores anymore so the only place I can find it is places like Amazon. So I need to stock up before it is all sold out!!</li>
    <li> Lovely, light scent ... floral but not at all cloying. The only scent (aside from my dearly departed &amp;#34;Donna Karan Black Cashmere&amp;#34;) that my husband ever notices. I really like it, and the overall product design is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued, too!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume! I was able to get a good size at a good price! Thank you</li>
    <li> A few years back I sent my mom flowers that included a sampler of some Vera Wang perfume. She liked the stuff, so since then, I&#x27;ve given her larger bottles of different kinds, and my mother hasn&#x27;t been disappointed yet. My mom says it smells like the roses in her garden, it&#x27;s long lasting/a little dab will do you, and it&#x27;s not too overpowering. She likes the present, so I say thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Delightful frangrance.  This fragrance isn&#x27;t strong but is light and smells like a flower garden.  Very nice smell.</li>
    <li> To my surprise my daughter actually love this perfume she has got many compliments and the scent is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I purchased Vera wang&#x27;s Truly Pink purely based on reviews and absolutely love this fragrance. It&#x27;s so soft and feminine! Mesmerizing smell!</li>
    <li> I get many compliments. The bottle was bigger than I expected. Great overall fragrance. Very light.</li>
    <li> I tried to save a few bucks on this perfume and boy was i suprised if it was 3.4 ounces it was just barely. the box was all beat up and the top was missing and i waited longer then i expected to recieve the item 4 to 6 weeks</li>
    <li> This bottle did not smell like the original Vera Wang Truly Pink. The original scent leaves a very nice and soft, clean and fresh aroma and unfortunately this is not the case with this one. I would like to know why?</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Mother, and I bought one for my Aunt too.  They loved it!  And it cost a whole lot cheaper than Macy&#x27;s!  Even cheaper than TJ Maxx!  What a steal!!!  I gave it 4-stars only because I don&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> This Parfum reminds me of summer days with a light citric smell to it.  It&#x27;s light and lovely.  I love it and I was so glad I could purchase it via Amazon.  It was a wonderful gift to come home to in the mail!</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous, fresh, girly girl fragrence with no overload.  My co-worker tried it first and when I made the purchase, I was so excited that it was a match.  Give this a try.</li>
    <li> This is such a delicate and heartwarming fragrance. Not strong, light and a touch of flowers.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume and was a quick ship</li>
    <li> Subtle and a light floral scents.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have been wearing it for years.&lt;br /&gt;It came new in the box and everything I expected.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this perfume from the stores a long time ago and was sad when it was discontinued. So happy to find it online and at such a great price for 3.4 ounce bottle. My order came earlier than expected, so that tripled my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Another favorite of mine. Love this scent. Came in mail fast and was a decent price too# will buy more in future.</li>
    <li> Am not able to purchase in the store (as it is discontinued)and was worried it would have an alcohol odor.  Smells absolutely wonderful!  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Truly Pink by Vera Wang for years &amp; years, and it never fails to get compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful, delicate, scent that is never overpowering. A floral, its base is a light, exquisite rose scent combined with other flowers (maybe a few white flower scents in there?). Even though rose sounds a little &amp;#34;old,&amp;#34; Truly Pink isn&#x27;t sweet or cloying, not powdery or heavy at all - it&#x27;s light, fresh &amp; just lovely!  (I love Vera Wang&#x27;s Vera Wang Woman, too - for reserved, ladylike occasions. So pretty!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also glad to have found a reliable seller! I will definitely be buying more Truly Pink here.</li>
    <li> Got this for my others birthday and she was so happy to receive a Vera Wang perfume, it came at a great price and it arrived day of her birthday! she was so happy!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent buy! It is, hands down, my favorite perfume ever! Very light and floral and extremely feminine. I receive compliments whenever I wear it.  I&#x27;m sad that I haven&#x27;t been able to purchase it where I originally found it, anymore, but it is definitely more cost effective this way. It did take a little longer than the 2 days to which I am accustomed when ordering thru Prime, but I was ok with the extra time. It was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents!</li>
    <li> Simply wonderful this is now my signature fragrance!</li>
    <li> Vera Wang is my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FRAGRANCE, FAST DELIVERY, EXCELLENT PRICE!  THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ANY SPECIAL LADY IN YOUR LIFE.  NOT TOO POWERFUL AND VERY IMPRESSIVE!</li>
    <li> Got lots of compliment when I use it.  Elegant but not overpowering.  It is my favorite perfume so far.  Tried many others in store, nothing can compare to this one, even those big names.  Since it is discontinued, I bought 2 more bottles just in case I cannot get more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Vera Wang Truly Pink.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other perfumes by Vera Wang but this is still the best.&lt;br /&gt;So far two of my friends are actually being influenced by me and they are loving it!</li>
    <li> Scent is weak and mostly smells of alcohol</li>
    <li> The scent is light and pleasant! I always get my mother the original for her birthday but this year I got this one. We both fell in love with the scent. And delivery was day before her birthday so I was not late gifting! 👍👍</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  Floral/citrusy without being overpowering. Will continue to buy it as long as it is still available.</li>
    <li> bought this product for my mom and she loved it. thats all i can say lol as a guy who went out on a wing, just got a good gift.</li>
    <li> This was nice, but reminded me of something else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an idea in mind of what &amp;#34;Truly Pink&amp;#34; would smell like &amp; the description sounded good, but the actual fragrance fell short.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed &amp; will be selling or gifting it to someone else.  :(</li>
    <li> delightful!  scent of roses with a whisper of something else......</li>
    <li> bought this as a little surprise for my girlfriend.  she smelled it on a customer and liked it.  I surprised her with it and she was very happy.  Come on guys do something nice for your wives and girlfriends just out of the blue.  You know they deserve it.</li>
    <li> This perfume is so clean smelling.  I love it and get lots of compliments when I wear it especially when I pair it with the lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite perfume by one of my daughters.  I only wished I had purchased a bottle for myself.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but it only lasts about half the day. However it smells so good that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the Vera Wang  perfumes. I love the light scent of roses it has &amp; I find it to be very romantic which means it can be worn during the day as well as at night year round.  I think however that it is not being made anymore because I had a hard time finding it when my other one started to run out.</li>
    <li> Excellent eau de parfum.the parfume concentration is higher than eau de toilet.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle and wonderful fragrance!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance when I spray it in the air, it does smell like roses.  However, when I spray it on me or my clothes, the fragrance quickly dissipates and the fragrance changes so it is not as pleasant.  I will use it more as an air freshener.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a birthday gift. It did not take long to arrive, it took about a week or less. As soon as I received it I opened it and was curious of the smell. And OH MY GOODNESS! The scent is just soooo goood! It remindes me of roses the delicacy of it being light (Not a Stong scent but enough of the decency to smell) and long lasting. The reason I bought this for that person is because she previously had this but finished it. As soon as she finished her bottle she was looking for it to buy again but during that time it was discontinued. She tried to look at every store and I saw how sad she was that she didn&#x27;t find any. So I decided to surprise her with this. Overall I truly recommend this to everyone! I would buy for myself but I have too much perfumes hehe.</li>
    <li> I have always this perfume. Great price</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! My daughter bought me some as a present and I was sad when I ran out and could not find it in the stores. I bought enough to last me for quite a while!! Have had nothing but compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great price one a great perfume!</li>
    <li> Excellent product all the way around,  fast shipping and excellent pricing.</li>
    <li> This scent is so feminine and subtle! It is very delicate. I have been using it for several years and constantly receive compliments on it. The price on Amazon is incredible  - cannot beat it!</li>
    <li> Oh My!  I&#x27;ve purchased fragarence in the past from kiosk(s) and outlets and the scent was a taint to alcholol-ly (is this a word...????), so of course I was a little apprehensive when I saw this daily special.  I am so pleased with my purchase and I will be ordering all my scents from Amazon.  Thank You</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great packaging. Love it.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a lovely, subtle scent.</li>
