      <li>and it&#x27;s huge.</li>
      <li>Bottle is HUGE.</li>
      <li>The aroma is light and never overpowering</li>
      <li>The scent is fantastic and distinctive.</li>
      <li>Lasts lightly (as it should)</li>
      <li>Packaging and Shipping were fantastic.</li>
      <li>(cheap)</li>
      <li>Sometimes I wear both but have found I get more positive reviews of the EDT.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance smells very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and elegant on him.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately redness disappeared, but it never happened before and practically whole bottle of Terre or</li>

      <li>I love that this is not your everyday popular scent that everyone in a crowd is wearing.</li>
      <li>I prefer to buy it directly from Hermes even if it costs more, I know the difference</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find the bottle was larger than I had expected.</li>
      <li>The Amazon title states, \\&quot;Terre D&#x27;Hermes by Hermes for men Pure Perfume Spray,\\&quot; however, it is eau de toilette, which is significant difference in quality.</li>
      <li>Settles down quickly and lasts a good four hours.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!!  </li>
      <li>the first day i wore it</li>
      <li>In addition, and this worries me even more, immediately after spraying it my skin became red.</li>
      <li>but this is a great , unisex, anytime and long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>Very exclusive and remarking fragrance!</li>
      <li>Every year, under the Christmas tree, my husband can depend on finding his large bottle of Terre D&#x27;Hermes.  </li>
      <li>Got both luxury scents like this and Creed and on the low end really enjoy 4711 and iterations of Bay Rum.</li>
      <li>After 15-20 minutes there is no trace of fragrance, no matter how much of it you spray on your skin.</li>
      <li>The fragrance stayed with me the whole day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced for what you get and less $ than most Hermes products.</li>
      <li>Most of the perfumes I buy are not long lasting.</li>
      <li>Have bought from many different suppliers and it always was the same.</li>
      <li>Similar to Voyage is that it has citrus top notes and smells what has been described as an initial antiseptic twinge.</li>
      <li>A mainly, sharp, and bold tribute to Hermes men.</li>
      <li>A complete waits of money.</li>
      <li>I may have to go direct to the company to buy and forego the pleasure of a discount.</li>
      <li>1) it&#x27;s counterfeited, or 2) it&#x27;s very, very old and kept in very hot place, or 3) it&#x27;s made exclusively for one of those third world countries with substandard quality (diluted) to keep price low, but I would be very surprised if Hermes would do such things.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m long time user of Amazon and Terre in both forms EDT and pure perfume.</li>
      <li>I know very well how this fragrance smells and how long it lasts after you spray it.</li>
      <li>I bought a larger bottle than I would normally</li>
      <li>Strength lasts exactly the same as the bottle I bought at a much more expensive department store.  </li>
      <li>The smell is long lasting and lasts the whole day.</li>

    <li> Great Cologne. Warning: Bottle is HUGE. Amazon will not accept returns, which sucks cause it cost a small fortune, my bad. Get the 1.6 oz Size.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and the Amazon price was the best I could fine great value! Great Product I also purchased the after shave balm it smells so good.</li>
    <li> This has been my number one scent for a number of years now.  A mainly, sharp, and bold tribute to Hermes men.</li>
    <li> Women compliment me on this fragrance.  So, I purchased a replacement.  This was a good value from Amazon.  Some of the department stores have discontinued this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and came packed very well. I would highly recommend!!  I was very happy to find the bottle was larger than I had expected.</li>
    <li> One of the best perfumes ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;All the people love it and they always keep asking me the name of it. It stays for a long time.</li>

The aroma is light and never overpowering and it&#x27;s the scent I get the most compliments from coworkers and friends.  In the environment I work in a lot of people have allergies and sensitivities to certain brands but never got a complaint about Terre D&#x27; Hermes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a suggestion, the EDT is a much better value than the Parfum. EDT doesn&#x27;t last quite as long but the scent is cleaner smelling and less musky. Sometimes I wear both but have found I get more positive reviews of the EDT.  Similar to Voyage is that it has citrus top notes and smells what has been described as an initial antiseptic twinge. Settles down quickly and lasts a good four hours.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!! (me too!!) He had tried some in Paris but we did have time to go back to the shop to buy...glad we didn&#x27;t price was better here!!!</li>
    <li> Always get complimented on this scent and it never disappoints. No longer as &amp;#34;niche&amp;#34; though so may be looking to change to something else. The scent is fantastic and distinctive. People always remember you :)</li>
    <li> The Best scent for a man!  My husband loves this and won&#x27;t even think of trying another scent. The price just can&#x27;t be beat! Great value!</li>

    <li> Hello everyone. I don&#x27;t know where to begin. I&#x27;m long time user of Amazon and Terre in both forms EDT and pure perfume. I know very well how this fragrance smells and how long it lasts after you spray it. What I got from Amazon is a joke and I feel like I was robbed out of $123+Tax. After 15-20 minutes there is no trace of fragrance, no matter how much of it you spray on your skin. There is NOTHING to smell. In addition, and this worries me even more, immediately after spraying it my skin became red. Fortunately redness disappeared, but it never happened before and practically whole bottle of Terre or whatever is inside is unusable completely, not even 15-20 minutes. Don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon. I&#x27;m furious but I have learned the lesson. Never ever I will buy anything from Amazon which can not be returned, especially fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can cause something like this? The way I see it it&#x27;s one of these three options: 1) it&#x27;s counterfeited, or 2) it&#x27;s very, very old and kept in very hot place, or 3) it&#x27;s made exclusively for one of those third world countries with substandard quality (diluted) to keep price low, but I would be very surprised if Hermes would do such things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time Amazon service is very good. Unfortunately this time I&#x27;m furious and I don&#x27;t blame any one else except Amazon. My mistake was blind trust that Amazon is reputable seller and is selling product which is of equal quality as that at department store or Hermes store. I was wrong. In my opinion either they should sell product of the same quality or don&#x27;t sell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t forget, you can&#x27;t return fragrance to Amazon. Please believe me, I&#x27;m not one of those sells clerks at some department store to scare you to get more customers. If I could, this time Amazon would get from me ZERO stars. I still love Terre, but not from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************Update 01/17/2014***************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two phone calls to Amazon I have received refund. Congratulation Amazon, your service deserves five stars. However, I&#x27;m not changing rating in my review because after all, fragrance is useless anyway, even though I was asked by Amazon representative if I want a replacement. I prefer to buy it directly from Hermes even if it costs more, I know the difference and it&#x27;s huge.Congratulation Amazon, your service deserves five stars.

    <li> Started using this product last year as present from my wife, won&#x27;t change for another. Excellent size and price (cheap)</li>
    <li> Voted number 1 on Basenotes site, no wonder.Great price and free shipping.I bought a larger bottle than I would normally but this is a great , unisex, anytime and long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before and it is wonderful. Long lasting as well.</li>
    <li> 100% counterfeit or extremely old.&lt;br /&gt;The sent was weak &amp; within minutes was gone. No one could smell it on me within 15 minutes. This sent always stays on me for hours. Not very honest  A complete waits of money.</li>
    <li> One of best perfume that stays all day and my wife loved it.</li>
    <li> Love this EDT!!  Smells great with out being over powering.  I get compliments on it every time I wear it. Strength lasts exactly the same as the bottle I bought at a much more expensive department store.  I love that this is not your everyday popular scent that everyone in a crowd is wearing.</li>
    <li> Great scent, and a great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great cologne... I get complimented at least 3 times a week from random strangers; more so in the summer. It smells spectacular. Packaging and Shipping were fantastic. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like the last time I got it. Must be fake!</li>
    <li> Very exclusive and remarking fragrance! One of the best colognes for men ever released. Do yourself a treat and get one!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s father had it on, or smelled wonderful and my sisters and I decided to buy a big one for our dad.</li>
    <li> The smell is long lasting and lasts the whole day. Most of the perfumes I buy are not long lasting. I am very happy with the perfume.</li>
    <li> The scent is marvellous</li>
    <li> I have worn this product for years. This is the first time I was not pleased with the fragrance. It may be old stock, therefore not as wonderful.  Have bought from many different suppliers and it always was the same. This time just not as strong. I may have to go direct to the company to buy and forego the pleasure of a discount.</li>
    <li> Every year, under the Christmas tree, my husband can depend on finding his large bottle of Terre D&#x27;Hermes.  What a nice luxury - for both of us!  The fragrance smells very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and elegant on him.  Lasts lightly (as it should) all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;And love the convenience of ordering it on Amazon rather than fighting the Mall rush!</li>
    <li> Smelled this on a friend of my husband&#x27;s and asked him what it was.  Purchased it for my husband and all my friends tell him how good he smells.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I very much liked this purchase.  I with pleasure use and I recommend to each person to get this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is either bad product or was extremely watered down.  I cannot smell anything after a few seconds, even after 5-10 sprays.  I cannot return the product, now I have to see what I can do to file a claim for the purchase.  In looking at other comments, I am not the only person who received a bottle of, essentially, colored water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Sephora the other day and tried their Terre D Hermes.  The fragrance stayed with me the whole day.  This is a great fragrance but beware buying from the internet.</li>
    <li> Just an amazing amazing amazing cologne .. it smells very good and the first day i wore it i was asked by two different people what cologne was i wearing ...</li>
    <li> An outstanding smell, I love it.  It is pricey but it is Hermes!  Would be a great gift for any man.</li>
    <li> Nice size and smells good for the price but the scent is not as long lasting as I expected. My other cologne definitely lasts longer. Just something to think about when purchasing and  always try to check the manufacturing date if possible.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the most exquisite fragrances I own.  It smells incredibly good and I often get compliments on how great it smells all the time.</li>
