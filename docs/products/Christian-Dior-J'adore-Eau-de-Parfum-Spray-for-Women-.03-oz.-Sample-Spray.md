      <li>Very pretty scent.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell so much that I will have to put the large size on my xmas list!</li>
      <li>This is a great way to learn of a new scent being the tiny size.</li>
      <li>I was actually expecting a potent scent, but  this is not that strong.</li>
      <li>Pleasant and not too heavy, not too light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great little tester to try out to see if you like the scent.</li>
      <li>was well worth the price.</li>
      <li>christian dior j&#x27;adore parfum spray smells really nice.</li>
      <li>right in the midrange of floral to spice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t go out much, to spend the money on a big bottle of this, but I do love how it smells and wanted it for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>Ordered as an add-on for the wife, and what arrived is clearly the samples they give out at the perfume counter - for free.</li>
      <li>this is a pretty smell.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants a &#x27;signature&#x27; perfume for themselves!</li>
      <li>I Am allergic to most all strong smells, however, this is the first sent that I have been able to wear that doesn&#x27;t cause my tongue to go numb.</li>

      <li>I was really after armani.but</li>
      <li>I really like this parfum.</li>
      <li>Bottle is not transparent and you will never know how much you have (if you Have) inside</li>
      <li>caused me to go and get a real bottle.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is much stronger and lasts longer.</li>
      <li>However, the fragrance is the real Jadore.</li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>so if you know the scent and like it i suggest the dior store directly for smaller quantities as you will get more bang for your buck.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They got here on time as promised but only one of them was full of perfume.</li>
      <li>I love it and will break down and buy it soon.</li>
      <li>There were about 3 squirts inside the little atomizer bottle, not even enough to get a good idea of the perfume.</li>
      <li>Glad to find this mini product prior to purchasing a larger size.  </li>
      <li>I only wish that this bottle came with a cap, as with a little pressure in the purse it will spray on its own.</li>
      <li>It smelt like a stinky old lady!</li>
      <li>until I cave in and buy the big bottle ;)</li>
      <li>but I developed a headache wearing it.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY..  </li>
      <li>so much would like to get a larger version</li>

    <li> I absolutely love the smell. I can now buy the full size product and know that I will use it.</li>
    <li> christian dior j&#x27;adore parfum spray smells really nice. love it, love it , love it. will probably purchase it again</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume on a friend &amp; so ordered this sample to try out..But hers smelled a lot better!! This one is very mild &amp; maybe works well for daywear</li>
    <li> Glad I ordered more than 1, these are samples. However, the fragrance is the real Jadore. Great as a refresher during the day.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Great purse size.</li>
    <li> Had I realized I was going to get a sample like the one I get at Macy&#x27;s, I&#x27;d have saved my money and gone to Macy&#x27;s.  On top of that, the sprayer did not work.  What a rip off!!  Never again</li>
    <li> I love it, smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for travel.  Love them and will be back to order more. I like the price and received quickly.</li>
    <li> That is just a little for $10 i go to Macy&#x27;s get it for free I just spend 1 hour of my hard work money</li>
    <li> Be sure your know this is a really little sample.  I like the smell.  Probably better to find a good perfume counter if you can.</li>
    <li> My little tester arrived and the cap on the bottle was missing or did not have one.  Went to try it out and there was nothing zip, came out! good grief you would think for the money, they would give you something!!  Do not recommend buying this tester!</li>
    <li> Love it for its clean and fresh scent.  This is a great way to learn of a new scent being the tiny size.</li>
    <li> My order arrived in a timely manner and I look forward to placing more orders.</li>
    <li> Item arrived without a top so I had to discard.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> I received this perfume spray and it did not work. I thought maybe the spray bottle was defective, but after shaking it a bit I don&#x27;t think there is any perfume inside.. Maybe it evaporated or I got scammed! Nevertheless it is considered an item that cant be returned. HMMMMMMMM??????????? Buyer BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> It was very very small. The spray does not work. It&#x27;s stuck.</li>
    <li> Lovely floral fragrance. It smells like a bouquet of flowers!</li>
    <li> I can;t return.. and it arrived empty.  Not one squirt in it.  put a q-tip inside, dry as a bone.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY..  I can&#x27;t afford a larger bottle,  as I was laid off from my job.  I wanted to treat myself to a one time maybe two time use.  Pfft..  Should be ashamed of yourself taking peoples hard earned money (or very little money) for an empty bottle and it not be allowed to be returned.  Embarrassing enough having to buy so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People, please buy this somewhere where you won&#x27;t be ripped off.. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry Amazon.. that was NOT NICE............</li>
    <li> Bought this to test it and without a dout buying the big size its totally worth it as a giftwill update later after seeing how the gift is received.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.  My own fault, I smelled a tester in a magazine and got the names mixed up.  I was really after armani.but this is a pretty smell.  I might still use it up.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance was just a sample for travelling will be placing an order for a larger bottle soon if still available</li>
    <li> this perfume is a beautiful oriental style flavor. right in the midrange of floral to spice. It must have a decent amount of parfum oil as it is long lasting. however the mini only has about 1 day of wear before it empties so if you know the scent and like it i suggest the dior store directly for smaller quantities as you will get more bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you for resending the product, even though it didn&#x27;t work out so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to tell you that your jadore samples leave something to be desired. I do not want to put this in customer review as you have done due dillegence in trying to correct the jadore sample issue and i appreciate that. but have been unable to contact you through normal channels so here&#x27;s where it must go.&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you your j&#x27;adore samples are either to old and evaporated or someone sold you a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;the j&#x27;adore always stops working after one application, this may be a trick of the manufacturer and if it is I am ashamed of Dior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im sure you have noticed many customer complaints on review and reciept of this batch of jadore samples. it is also possible Dior is unaware and a bad batch escaped the factory floor.  If you want to help your reputation with customers in the future I would advise at least pulling this batch from the shelf and see for yourself. I have a sample of shalimar which i ordered on the same day, it came earlier and is still going, same size. I have worn it 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;thought you should know either this batch or year or supplier is bad for your business.&lt;br /&gt;Again thank you for resending the product, even though it didn&#x27;t work out so well. I would still order from you, just not in tiny spray bottles</li>
    <li> J&#x27;dore is my favorite perfum but its very expensive so I thought I would buy the sample. I purchased two and they do not last. A couple of sprays and its empty.</li>
    <li> just loved it on my girl friend now have to order a big bottle</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go out much, to spend the money on a big bottle of this, but I do love how it smells and wanted it for special occasions.  I figure I have about 5 or 6 good uses of &#x27;&#x27;the good stuff&#x27;&#x27; until I cave in and buy the big bottle ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my Mom for Christmas! It smells so good! I recommend this to anyone who wants a &#x27;signature&#x27; perfume for themselves! I also bought Mom the 2.5 oz for home!</li>
    <li> This perfume is the most amazing and incredible frangance i ahas ever have. I will get the full size botle soon</li>
    <li> Deceptive item...I should have read other reviews or at least put the price I paid ($6) towards larger purchase. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Ordered as an add-on for the wife, and what arrived is clearly the samples they give out at the perfume counter - for free. Rip off!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Not for re-sale&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my favourite perfume and I always have it .I&#x27;ve bought this one because of  travel size.Love it</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of these,  and 3 was empt and the other 2 only sprayed once. .will not odere again</li>
    <li> I like clean floral scents, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I&#x27;ve only ever bought Eau de Toilets, and stepping up to the Eau de Parfum was well worth the price. The fragrance is much stronger and lasts longer. This tube is itty bitty, but the product is top notch (one spritz on the wrist is all you need). A good buy to try out how it will smell on you if you&#x27;re curious, or good for a pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  There were about 3 squirts inside the little atomizer bottle, not even enough to get a good idea of the perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent. it deserves a 5 star rating.  i just wished that there was more in it.</li>
    <li> I only wish that this bottle came with a cap, as with a little pressure in the purse it will spray on its own.</li>
    <li> This was helpful when I could not afford a big bottle. Smells great cannot wait to wear to my Christmas Party!!!</li>
    <li> Glad to find this mini product prior to purchasing a larger size.  Fast service.</li>
    <li> Too slippery to spray.  Hardly smells like anything</li>
    <li> by Dior.  Smells wonderful.  I had to try it after seeing the commercial with Charlize Theron...such a small sample was within my budget.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this Parfum after smelling a sample on a sheet. I got a vial because it is pricey. I love it and will break down and buy it soon.</li>
    <li> Bottle is not transparent and you will never know how much you have (if you Have) inside</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and she adores it! Just the right size to carry around in her purse for a quick spritz!</li>
    <li> I like this scent and would buy it again. Pleasant and not too heavy, not too light. sample spray is great for portable use</li>
    <li> Small bottle looked old and barely had one pump of the perfume in it.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pretty scent.  Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Horrible I could not tell if the fragrance is good or not coz this thing is not working</li>
    <li> NOT J&#x27;adore! I purchased this sample on 12/22/14. It arrived in a timely manner BUT this is not J&#x27;adore! It smelt like a stinky old lady! Gross. We&#x27;re all safer shopping in Department Stores</li>
    <li> I really like this parfum. It is more of an evening scent being a bit stronger than I wear during the day</li>
    <li> Really love this scent. I wanted to try it out before making a big purchase and am happy I did. Love, love! Fast shipping by seller. Would purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Product appeared to be used, unknown substance on exterior</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance very much. The sample bottle I ordered had a problem with the spray pump and I wasn&#x27;t able to use all of it but enough of it to decide it is an item I would buy.</li>
    <li> The scent was good, but was very disappointed with the longevity of the smell and faded after an hour. I was actually expecting a potent scent, but  this is not that strong.Perfumes smells so great for some people and not for others.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance, but I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this sample item had I realized how very tiny it was.</li>
    <li> Loved it wish I could by a bigger size.  I would recommend shopping at Amazon where the prices are unbelievable and what I found in this perfume was magnificent!</li>
    <li> Vial was empty. Envelope smelled nice though.</li>
    <li> Nice stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Got the items (I ordered 2 tiny perfumes). They got here on time as promised but only one of them was full of perfume. The other empty.  It was such a small order that I didn&#x27;t feel like sending it back and bothering with it. Still would have been nice to get what I paid for though.</li>
    <li> Thank you , to all the sellers on Amazon , my grand daughters are at an age they should experience the better things in life , if i can influence them to education and enjoying the better things in life , then i have accomplished a goal , they can do for them selves .</li>
    <li> caused me to go and get a real bottle.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell so much that I will have to put the large size on my xmas list!</li>
    <li> I liked the smell in the magazine ad I first seen this perfume in. So I ordered the sample. Glad I did. The scent is nice but I developed a headache wearing it. Glad the sample was available, saved me a lot of money!</li>
    <li> This smells like a fake...sorry. Perfume smells nothing like dep. store test. I brought the mini just to try it out. My advice, purchase it from Macy&#x27;s online instead.</li>
    <li> Was a little smaller than expected...oldest daughter loved the smell of it so much would like to get a larger version</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Very pleased with my purchase. I Am allergic to most all strong smells, however, this is the first sent that I have been able to wear that doesn&#x27;t cause my tongue to go numb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great little tester to try out to see if you like the scent. Well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and delivered quickly</li>
    <li> I orderd 3 of these for travel and recived a few more samples of different scents. It was a very nice surprise.</li>
    <li> Excellent totally love it</li>
