      <li>Love love love this product!</li>
      <li>fragrance is actually very pleasant, on the masculine side but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>When I got this product and used it for the first time my skin felt great.  </li>
      <li>Plus, the fragrance is very light.  </li>
      <li>The flip top cap is nice and easy to use</li>
      <li>I am not quite sure why so many reviews say this product causes them to break out.  </li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, you don&#x27;t feel like you have been doused with a scent when you use this body wash.  </li>
      <li>I gave this a try since it had the most user reviews on Amazon out of any men&#x27;s body wash.</li>
      <li>This one is better than a lot in that the scent is not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>Most bar soaps just aren&#x27;t moisturizing and leave the skin feeling scaly, but this product leaves skin feeling moisturized.  </li>

      <li>would recommend this product to friends, except most of my friends</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the product ...</li>
      <li>Go figure.  : )</li>
      <li>but i just saw this at costco and it is significantly better.  </li>
      <li>I felt clean after using it, my skin felt good, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>

      <li>It smells nice and it leave you feeling clean.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job, I got clean and smelled nice.  </li>
      <li>--lathered well, smelled good, overall good feeling.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it smell very good, in a manly way, but it&#x27;s not greasy and can be used for</li>
      <li>I used this body wash with a body scrubber (instead of rubbing directly on my body with my hands) and it felt great</li>
      <li>The exfoliating beads help make you feel nice and fresh.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a nice musk, and not strong at all, very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I would say the best thing about the product though is the scent, which has a neutral fresh scent that is lasting on your face.  </li>
      <li>In use, I found it to be a gel that lathers up and did rinse off easily.  </li>
      <li>I kind of like gel more, and would prefer this unscented, or with a much lighter scent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll stick with this body wash, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide anything special in comparison to the existing favorite.</li>
      <li>Basically it performs its job very well and has a very refreshing fragrance, not too sweet or cloying.</li>
      <li>that will make our product sound revolutionary?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was comfortable.  </li>

      <li>The &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; scent is very distinct -</li>
      <li>Personally, I prefer to have the bottle dispense from the top, and while most containers can work with either side up, this one requires a bit of a balancing act if you want the dispenser at the top.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely unique</li>
      <li>These products will all get you clean, and they keep the Madison Avenue advertisers in business.  </li>
      <li>It smells clean yet manly.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to spend longer in the shower or use two products to get clean.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell which is in fact so mild, that I have used it myself.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Forget the Old Spice man, smell like a Dove man!  I used this body wash with a body scrubber (instead of rubbing directly on my body with my hands) and it felt great and I smelled great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends, except most of my friends and I don&#x27;t talk about body washes.  One downside, the bottle is large and will last a LONG time ... only a downside if you like to switch it up every now and then.</li>
    <li> Did not receive item, so have no idea how it would or would not perform.</li>
    <li> To some extent, soap is soap, whatever the form.  What makes this Dove Body Wash better or worse than similar products?    It gets you clean:  that&#x27;s good.  On the other hand, there&#x27;s nothing exceptional about the job it does.  In addition, if you are particularly sensitive to smell, the fragrance may be a bit much.    What I dislike about this product is the package.  Personally, I prefer to have the bottle dispense from the top, and while most containers can work with either side up, this one requires a bit of a balancing act if you want the dispenser at the top.  What annoys me more, however, is the opaqueness of the container, which makes it harder to determine how much body wash you have left.    Overall, this is an okay product, but not one I&#x27;d go out of my way to get.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a nice masculine scent.  The tiny abrasive beads are nice, and not nearly as \\&quot;rough\\&quot; as a lot of other microbeads I have felt.  Unfortunately, they are still too rough (and the scent probably too strong) to be used on the face.    To get the full effect, I even purchased the oddly-shaped [[ASIN:B002TSA90C Dove Men + Care Active Clean Shower Tool, 1-Unit Packages (Pack of 4)]] that Dove markets alongside the body wash.    I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll stick with this body wash, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide anything special in comparison to the existing favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I originally got it for my oldest son, but my husband used it and it smells so good!  He&#x27;s been using Dial soap since we met and the children and I use Dove and he finally has crossed over to OUR side!  ;)  I also went and bought my oldest son this brand.  They love it!  Not only does it smell very good, in a manly way, but it&#x27;s not greasy and can be used for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use DOVE products!  Recommend to all men!</li>
    <li> I gave these to my brother to try.  He was not thrilled with the scent but he said it wasn&#x27;t bad.  He also said it didn&#x27;t lather up much.  He did say that his skin hasn&#x27;t been as dry as it normally is so I guess that is a plus.  Overall he said he would use it but not necessarily buy it again.  I just think it is a guy thing.  He will probably just go back to using the bar soap that dries him out.  Go figure.  : )</li>
    <li> I asked my husband to give me his opionion of this product as I thought it would be more useful than mine.      He likes the smell (I do too by the way - I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s overpowering which some scented soaps are).  He does NOT like the gritty texture of the soap and doesn&#x27;t feel that adds to the cleaning capabilities.  The soap does not cause him to break out or give him rashes.  I have been experimenting with liquid soaps recently to reduce soap scum in his tub - this was not a winner on that front - I noticed even more soap scum than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using liquid soap... excuse me... body wash... for a few years instead of bar soap, and I haven&#x27;t really found a strong commitment to any particular brand. Dove hasn&#x27;t really changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By and large, it&#x27;s not unlike any other major brand you&#x27;ll see out there. It has the kitschy microbeads that most of the Axe varieties have, with a relatively strong scent that&#x27;s somewhere between \\&quot;designed by Old Spice\\&quot; and \\&quot;this is what a focus group of women at Dove think that men want or should have\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the scent goes away relatively fast, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere (or compete, in Old Spice&#x27;s case) with your cologne or aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathered pretty well in hard water, and left me feeling clean. If you don&#x27;t like the gel-type body wash brands (Axe, Neutrogena, etc.) and don&#x27;t mind smelling like someone cracked open a bottle of [[ASIN:B000C1VWJU Brut]] for a few minutes, you&#x27;d probably like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me? I kind of like gel more, and would prefer this unscented, or with a much lighter scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different body washes over the years and this one is one of the more masculine smelling ones when you compare it to the normal brands of body wash, so that is nice if you would prefer not to smell like roses or peaches.  It has a good lather without being too overly soapy and rinses off without any soapy residue after feel.  The flip top cap is nice and easy to use and I like how it is stored with the cap down so you don&#x27;t have to shake it to get it out like you do with ones with the cap on the top.  So it an overall good body wash with a well designed bottle.</li>
    <li> I struggle with dry skin and I was excited to try this product, as Dove has always made gentle products that have irritated my skin less than some other brands. I have mixed results with this product, though overall I am pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I appreciate that the bottle is easy to open, which is something I have learned not to take for granted. I have used bath and body products that are packaged such that it is next to impossible to open the packaging. This is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is actually very pleasant, on the masculine side but not overpowering. After a good shower there is still the slightest hint of the fragrance left behind, enough that it can be picked up when close but not enough to tell when more than a couple of feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel lathers up nicely and washes off nicely too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that after using it, my skin is no longer dry but is actually slightly oily. I do not have severe dry skin so perhaps this product is meant for people who have more of a problem with dryness. The oiliness is short-term, though, and after skipping a day my skin returns to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice product for men with dry skin. It smells nice and it leave you feeling clean. If you struggle with severe dry skin this product will please you. If, like me, you have slightly dry skin you may feel a little oily afterward - keep this in mind when shopping for bath products.</li>
    <li> My husband said that this is by far the best bath wash he has ever used.  It moisturizes and scrubs at the same time.  Plus, the fragrance is very light.  So many of these products have such a strong smell that it can be annoying.  It is very mild and pleasant.  I enjoy the smell which is in fact so mild, that I have used it myself.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was quite happy with how this product worked as a body wash, but I won&#x27;t be buying it until the price comes down.  Given that every body wash that I&#x27;ve used has gotten me clean, my criteria for choosing one over another are pretty simple:  I want something with a pleasant scent, I want a product that isn&#x27;t overly thin and watery, and I want to feel like I&#x27;m getting a good value.  This Dove body wash met the first two of those, so I give it a thumbs up in regards to performance.  The one balking point for me is that it costs about three times as much as the Suave men&#x27;s body wash that I typically use, and I don&#x27;t like it all that much more than the Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I gave it four stars.  Performance is a solid five stars, but value is closer to three stars, IMO.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a body wash? Does it get you clean? Yes. Well isn&#x27;t that enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently not because this one has MICROMOISTURE technology. All these jargon words really make me laugh. You know there is a room of marketing guru&#x27;s just sitting around thinking, \\&quot;what words can we put together that will make our product sound revolutionary?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This team came up with: patent filed technology (yes that&#x27;s right, \\&quot;filed\\&quot;), micromoisture technology, clinically proven, dermatologist recommended, and total skin comfort. I&#x27;m sure one of these is a typo on the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let&#x27;s talk about the product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture - it has \\&quot;purifying grains\\&quot;, which means it&#x27;s sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It&#x27;s gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to use it - it says \\&quot;body and face\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you&#x27;re scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it&#x27;s been cleaned very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what don&#x27;t I like? It&#x27;s not a shampoo &amp; body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won&#x27;t apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don&#x27;t recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised the product gets 4 stars. Improvement idea would be to make an all-in-one product so I don&#x27;t have to spend longer in the shower or use two products to get clean.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men+ Deep Clean body wash is nothing to write home about. You use it to wash with, then you rinse it off, just like hundreds of similar other products. This one is better than a lot in that the scent is not too overpowering. Some products cause me to have a rash. This one does not, so that has to be a positive. All in all this product isn&#x27;t better or worse than most available &amp; if it was on sale for less than others I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband because I didn&#x27;t like him using our Zest Deodorant bar soap on his face - thought he could use for a body wash as well. He tried it out but found he had body odor soon after washing.  He tried using his regular bar soap for his under arms after he washed with the liquid soap but had the same results - it must leave a barrier so that any subsequent soap can&#x27;t be used.  He did use the Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash to wash his face ONLY* and went back to our Zest Soap (aqua or orange one) for his body.  And, no, he normally does not use underarm deodorant unless we are going somewhere special because he doesn&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update (11/17/11) My husband no longer uses this at all - he didn&#x27;t use it after the first week.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  First of all the size is much bigger than most body washes I have purchased.  I really liked that the cap was on the bottom and flat, it makes it easy to store, and reduces product waste.  The smell is a nice musk, and not strong at all, very pleasant.  The scrubbing particles are smaller than most body washes I have used, but still too big to be very useful.  To exfoliate well, they really need to be about the size of sand.  The product does clean well, and is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Normally, I would try to find some good points about a product even if it has a bad scent.  However, the scent of this body wash is so overpowering that I cannot get past it to find some endearing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell triggered a migraine even when my father was the one to use the body wash.  Yes, it is THAT bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Dove.  I wanted to like you. I love your deodorant, shampoo, and usually your soap.  This time, you failed me.dove</li>
    <li> First let me start off by saying I used to use a competitors body was that was not designed for men (or women for that matter). It really did little to moisturize my skin.    When I got this product and used it for the first time my skin felt great.  It took a little getting used to the gritty feel but after that it didn&#x27;t bother me. I got one of the Shower tools they sell a few days later and it helped me use a little less and get the same results.</li>
    <li> My husband uses Dove body wash products regularly so I ordered this product for him to sample.  He thought it was a fair/good product --lathered well, smelled good, overall good feeling.  However, he wasn&#x27;t impressed by it enough to want to spend two or three times as much for this item as compared to other similar items on the market.  Additionally the product&#x27;s grainyness while fine for the body wasn&#x27;t a good idea on the face...especially if one shaved before or after using.  Overall a nice product but not necessarily one that he has to have or purchase.</li>
    <li> The price is great until costco started carrying this it.  the price was the best around but i just saw this at costco and it is significantly better.  until then it was the best around</li>
    <li> The beads provide a nice tingly texture to the lather and it has a nice smell, which isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I don&#x27;t care for it as a face wash, but for a body wash it does what it advertises. The smell isn&#x27;t too feminine or overpowering, it lathers up well, and does a good job of cleaning without leaving a residue or film. Four stars because it doesn&#x27;t work for us well as a face wash, but does a good job of cleaning other bits.</li>
    <li> This is great soap. I don&#x27;t like heavy scented soaps.  Dove men is the silky smooth liquid version of the old standby Dove Soap. Leaves me smooth and clean with the fresh Dove smell. I pack it in my gym bag for after swimming showers.  Nice stuff.</li>
    <li> So while this product may be for men, I think a woman could use it as well.  I loved the exfoliating beads that were in this body wash.  The exfoliating beads help make you feel nice and fresh.  The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, you don&#x27;t feel like you have been doused with a scent when you use this body wash.  I really think this body wash can be used by everyone in the house.  In fact, I have enjoyed this body wash far more than many other body washes I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> New Dove Men Care has deep cleaning micro grains that exfoliate as they clean.  The wash leaves a good smell on the skin that isn&#x27;t too floral. It lathers and rinses well.  The only complaint is that sometimes it isn&#x27;t strong enough.  Keep your bar of cake soap and alternate.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast service.</li>
    <li> Smells good, makes me feel clean, feels good while applying to my body in the shower. Never thought I would be reviewing shower gel but Amazon sent me an email to do so....and I do everything Amazon says. This is good stuff thought. I also have the other varieties and they all are nice.</li>
    <li> I am not a big gel wash guy preferring the more tactile soap bar, but this wash has converted me!  Why?  Due to the small deep cleaning microbeads, the wash has the feel of really getting in to your pores and washing you clean.  I would say the best thing about the product though is the scent, which has a neutral fresh scent that is lasting on your face.  I actually wash my hands with this product as well because I love the fresh smell-that stays around for awhile.  Never fear-it is not feminine at all, but for ladies it is not too manly either as my wife uses it as well.  As a bonus, the gel is highly concentrated so a little dab will do it!</li>
    <li> Dove has a long history of making quality bath products.  This one is no exception.  Dove has expanded its line of products to include some men&#x27;s products.  This body wash has a nice scent.  It is a masculine scent without being too overwhelimg.  It smells clean yet manly.  One of the advantages of this product is its moisture level.  Most bar soaps just aren&#x27;t moisturizing and leave the skin feeling scaly, but this product leaves skin feeling moisturized.  This is a body wash and facial cleanser in one so it is two products in one.  It does contain some exfoliate type beads that are different for a men&#x27;s body wash.  You may want to consider it that before purchasing it.  Overall, it is a good value and a great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually pay much attention to things like body wash or soap, mostly just taking them for granted as about equally effective and as about as important as the background music in an elevator.  It&#x27;s nice that it is there but I don&#x27;t really notice that it&#x27;s there so much as I (and others) notice that it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I wasn&#x27;t too excited about what the possibilities for this product were so much as just seeing if it would work as well as the assortment of soaps and body washes I&#x27;ve used before.  When I received the product I noted that the bottle wasn&#x27;t particularly fancy but somewhat similar to other brand name body wash or shampoo bottles.  So that lead me to believe that this product wasn&#x27;t so much about the hype as hopefully just being a quality product that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of what it claims for itself these are my observations and experiences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Claim: It fights dryness -  Reality:  I found this to be true.  I don&#x27;t pay too much attention to my skin but I know that when I use a soap that is harsh that it strips the oils from my skin and particularly if the air is dry and hot, that I will be uncomfortable an itchy.  I felt clean after using this product and I noted that I felt as if I had followed up with a skin lotion.  It wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.  It was comfortable.  To my observation it does what it claims in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Claim:  Micromoisture Technology - Activation during lather to protect skin and keep it comfortable - Reality:  I don&#x27;t really buy into this obviously marketing based type of appeal.  This is just attempting to put sizzle to the steak.  It&#x27;s really just the same thing as the claim to fight dryness.  There are obviously common ingredients to this product as what you would find in a skin lotion.  So it&#x27;s replacing some of the natural skin moisture with an oil based element that bonds to the skin despite the water of the bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Claim: Rinses Clean  Reality:  I felt clean after using the product.  The water on my body beaded.  That&#x27;s no doubt another result of the oil based moisturizer/lubricant it left on my body.  Also of note, was that the product is heavily fragranced and perfumed.  That also gives the illusion of cleanness and \\&quot;freshness.\\&quot;  It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant and no doubt I was clean.  If you have any strong aversions however to oils and fragrances, even ones less floral and more masculine, then this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The promotional material for this product notes that it is intended to be used with a special shower tool.  I did not have that to use so I can&#x27;t comment upon it.  Just using it a normal body wash however, I found it to meet expectations, to leave my body clean but very fragranced (my wife noticed it and wasn&#x27;t particularly thrilled with that element of it).  It isn&#x27;t harsh.  It does leave a moisturizing layer of lotion like oils following the rinse and overall I can&#x27;t fault it in terms of meeting basic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not, however, something that I will purpose to buy or to continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bart breenwater on my body beaded.  That&#x27;s no doubt another result of the oil based moisturizer/lubricant it left on my body.  Also of note, was that the product is heavily fragranced and perfumed.  That also gives the illusion of cleanness and \\&quot;freshness.\\&quot;  It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant and no doubt I was clean.

    <li> The company blurb says it all and like all cosmetics there is a matter of taste/opinion involved. Basically it performs its job very well and has a very refreshing fragrance, not too sweet or cloying. I don&#x27;t see why women couldn&#x27;t use this product as well!</li>
    <li> While I like the smell and cleanliness, the biggest turn off is the exfoliating beads or whatever they are.  While they&#x27;re effective, I often am left with the little beads on my skin when I&#x27;m done with a shower.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the chance to try \\&quot;Dove Men\\&quot;, in part because I didn&#x27;t know that real men weren&#x27;t allowed to use regular Dove products.  Looking back, I believe my grandparents had Dove soap at their house ... it&#x27;s amazing I escaped my childhood visits there with even a shred of manliness intact.  (Remove tongue from cheek).  Ok, can you tell I&#x27;m a little skeptical when brands feel the need to develop a \\&quot;for men\\&quot; or \\&quot;for women\\&quot; offering?  Especially when they feel the need to pour millions of dollars into trying to convince people to buy it: usually a clear sign that they are trying desperately to differentiate what is at heart a commoditized product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product has a nice fragrance--if a little strong--although I will agree with another review that it almost seemed too calculated: this smells like the consensus of what a hundred focus groups decided \\&quot;manly\\&quot; should smell like.  I felt no more and no less clean than from using other soaps or body washes, so if the \\&quot;micromoisture technology\\&quot; was at work, I didn&#x27;t really notice it.  But perhaps that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t use the [[ASIN:B002TSA90C Dove Men Shower Tool]], which is apparently a loofah but much more manly because it includes the word \\&quot;tool\\&quot;.  Men like tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not really notice or mind the \\&quot;cleansing grains\\&quot;, but from reading other reviews they appeared to bother a good number of people.  So, note that there are versions of this product without these cleansing grains, if you have sensitive skin but want to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So at the end of the day, it&#x27;s a body wash, no more and no less.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you add the phrase \\&quot;for men\\&quot;, try to convince people that they are a \\&quot;dirty boy\\&quot;, or that they should smell like a man and not a lady (Old Spice has definitely won the advertising wars, haven&#x27;t they?).  These products will all get you clean, and they keep the Madison Avenue advertisers in business.  I enjoyed the product ... but once it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;ll probably go back to my good old bar of soap.  But not Dove soap, of course ... I want to smell like a man, not like a lady.  I&#x27;m on a horse.old bar of soap.  But not Dove soap, of course ... I want to smell like a man, not like a lady.  I&#x27;m on a horse.</li>
    <li> I really like the Dove Men Body Wash.  I have dry skin and find it to be lightly moisturizing without a greasy feeling.  The scent is also lightly &#x27;manly&#x27; without being too much and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne.  There are little scrub things in it but I don&#x27;t think they do much as far as exfoliation.  All in all a good wash for a guy.</li>
    <li> I was reading in \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Health\\&quot; that washing with an exfoliating scrub can help with clogged pores that cause tiny blackheads and when your face gets dry and little bits of skin flake off.  The article recommended creamy soaps that are formulated with finely ground nuts and nutshells or other granules that slough off dirt and dead skin.  Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body and Face Wash fits that category and I generally liked using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s advertised as a deep cleansing gel that rinses off easily with purifying grains.  In use, I found it to be a gel that lathers up and did rinse off easily.  There are little \\&quot;grains\\&quot; in it, and I felt \\&quot;clean\\&quot; after using it.  The article I read did warn not to scrub too hard, or you&#x27;ll irritate your skin.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with this and I used the wash on body and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main goal is to get clean, and it worked for that.  I&#x27;m not that concerned with scent, but I don&#x27;t particularly want to smell flowery, so I&#x27;d rather use a product aimed at men.  I&#x27;d also prefer not to have my skin dry out, so I liked that this wash contained moisturizing elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like shower gels and washes that come in ease tubes rather than messy bar soap that I used for so many years.  These are just more convenient and less messy.  Bottom line:  I felt clean after using it, my skin felt good, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  It&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> Yes I know this says Dove for Men and I&#x27;m a girl but you know, it was in the shower so I was like, what the heck, soap&#x27;s soap right? Also seeing as how my husband will use my girly body washes, I felt no guilt in using his. Well in all basic necessities, it did it&#x27;s job, I got clean and smelled nice.  The smells not too overpowering nor did I smell like a dude unlike some other body washes who shall not be named.  Maybe guys aren&#x27;t used to the \\&quot;grains\\&quot; to exfoliate but I liked them.  For a quick rinse shower, I could see how they could be a bother when you&#x27;re trying to get in/out really fast and frantically trying to brush it off. But if you&#x27;re taking your time in the shower, scrubbing with the beads was quite nice.  Husband likes it as well.  He really likes how there are now MEN lines in body washes and shampoos.  It&#x27;s about time that companies realize that guys DO care about how they look and will take care of themselves.  Overall we enjoyed the product. It may say MEN but it can be totally unisex in a pinch.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice and I have started using it as a soap.</li>
    <li> it feels really great on the skin, but you have to put a lot on for it to foam. So eventually it runs out pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I like the Dove products for men. This product does not dry out my skin, smells fine, and works well.  I paid for 3 bottles of item.  The packaging was poor and one bottle broke open spilling most of it&#x27;s contents.  I was able to recover about 25% of the third bottle. The bottles were placed in a plastic bag with no other padding, i.e. anything to keep the bottles from getting damaged.  No air bags, no peanuts, nothing at all for protection.  At this point, sending them all back is not an option.</li>
    <li> Nice and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect body wash that suits my needs. Cleans great, rinses off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin. The only body wash that does this for me is Nivea for Men and Dial for Men. I gave this a try since it had the most user reviews on Amazon out of any men&#x27;s body wash. I got it this morning and used it twice. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon after a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the body wash and rinsed off, I didn&#x27;t feel clean. It didn&#x27;t clean the deodorant on my skin and i had to rewash myself and it still didn&#x27;t come out all the way. It also left my skin feeling sticky which I&#x27;m guessing is the moisturizer. The second time I took a shower it was better but it still left a sticky residue on my skin which i hate the feeling of. Overall, this is great for anybody who has dry skin but for anyone that has rough skin, it just doesn&#x27;t clean good enough. I work out and play sports daily and I needed something powerful that doesn&#x27;t left a residue and this wasn&#x27;t it. It might be great for the everyday guy who doesn&#x27;t do much physical activity but it does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great body wash product that will leave your skin feeling refreshed, clean, and best of all - moisturized. Many body washes on the market dry out my skin but Dove Men makes my skin feel very hydrated. The &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34; scent is very distinct - it has a spicy cinnamon / potpourri scent that makes me think of fall. It&#x27;s definitely unique but I like the smell. Of course once you&#x27;re out of the shower and dried off the scent is very muted, so don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to walk around smelling like fresh cinnamon. I would recommend this to any guy who wants a manly smelling body wash but wants something more mature than Axe.</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure why so many reviews say this product causes them to break out.  It does the total opposite for me.  I have been searching for years for a product that can take care of face and body breakouts and finally found this.  It&#x27;s not even advertised as an acne treatment, but it is the only thing that has ever worked. I have naturally oily skin, I suppose, so the drying effect described by many is beneficial for me, as it returns the skin to normal.  It leaves your face feeling tight, but not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely attest to the fact that this is a different product than the same label in the store.  The review that mentioned this was much more watery and less scented hit the nail on the head.  However, It still does the job. It&#x27;s just curious that it&#x27;s different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could by 3 smaller bottles at my local grocery store for close to $20 or get three huge ones here for 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you have oily skin all over, this works.  If you don&#x27;t, I figure it may dry it out...</li>
    <li> This stuff works great as face and body wash.  It leaves my face feeling as clean or cleaner than most facial soap I&#x27;ve tried.  The small beads really help scrub the oil and dirt out of your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry or itchy.  The scent is nice without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Just so you know, your body soap smells like Japanese bug spray.\\&quot; -My wife&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use other Dove body washes, and they always smell better.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and this is exactly how I will be purchasing this soap in the future. I LOVE the way this soap both leaves me feeling/smelling and also the scrubbing sand is perfect for exfoliation.  Love love love this product!</li>
    <li> I have just recently been using this product,Dove Men + Care Body and Face Wash, Deep Clean, and really have enjoyed it. I am giving it four stars because I ordered a pack of 3 but only received 2 :( but I really needed it for i was nearly out of my previous bottle so I didn&#x27;t bother to tell Amazon</li>
    <li> Dove makes some excellent hygiene products and this is certainly one of my favorites. The smell is great and it gets you incredibly clean. The exfoliating beads are great for an enhanced clean feeling!</li>
    <li> Coming from my partner: save yourself from the bad news for your taint that is this body wash. Itchy, rashy, bad news.</li>
