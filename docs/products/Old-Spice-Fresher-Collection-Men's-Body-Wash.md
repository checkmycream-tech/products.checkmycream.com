<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cost is more than you would pay for same product at CVS or WalMart.  Recommend lowering price to make me want to buy product again.  Love the product.  It is excellent.</li>
    <li> I, the wife, went through Old Spice&#x27;s new smells and found this Denali scent the best and most manly, clean and classic smell of them all. I liked it so much, I picked up the Denali anti-perspirant for my husband and he instantly made it his favorite requesting more products in this line. I got him the body wash as a stocking stuffer and he likes it so much that he had me subscribe and save the three pack, as well as the anti-perspirant and he still goes with the original after shave since it seems that it doesn&#x27;t come in the Denali scent. We both love the classic scent. He&#x27;s 40 and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and neither of these scents ever get tiresome or \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smelling. Our 11 yr. old son loves it, too. Like father, like son.</li>
    <li> great smell, works, and purchased when price was low.</li>
    <li> I only want three things out of a body wash.  It needs to lather up, it needs to smell good (and masculine), and it needs to meet those two goals at as little cost as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great.  It lathers reasonably well although not as well as I would like.  But the price is right.  I have already made a repeat buy.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I am really ticked off about the scent change. The new scent is terrible and too perfumey. I was happy that I finally found a shower gel that I like and dammit, it was changed. I will not buy anymore. If you can find a container with the maroon colored lid, that is the one that smells good. The red top stinks!</li>
    <li> I sure don&#x27;t look like the old spice guy, but I sure do smell like him haha. This body wash is probably the best smelling body wash i have ever smelled. It smells way better than any axe or other men&#x27;s body wash. My lady loves the scent of this wash, so I don&#x27;t plan on replacing this body wash any time soon. Seriously though, it really does have a great scent that doesn&#x27;t give you a headache.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! I will definitely be buying this again. My husband loves it and I love the smell :)</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this soap. And you just cannot beat the price - it is cheaper than the big box stores. And on a side note it does not seem to burn my eyes like St. ives did.</li>
    <li> like getting the 3-packs - keep me clean for a while - lol.  I tried the generic brands, but the scent conflicts with the deoderants sometimes so i prefer the actual Old Spice brand.</li>
    <li> When it comes to cleaning it does the job, and I like the smell of it. It was the first time I had used any old spice body wash and it lathered up well and didn&#x27;t require much to get cleaned up. The smell is strong but surely a nice smell that both me and my wife enjoyed, which was nice because buying this was a gamble based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I had noticed was that I feel the smell didn&#x27;t last too long after the shower, it could simply be that my cologne was far stronger but I had hoped it would last longer.</li>
    <li> As advertised. smells good and works well.  Price was right which is important as well.  Would buy it again soon.</li>
    <li> Denali body wash smells really good and one can feel really clean after showering with it. The only problem I have with it, is that it dries up my skin near my armpits.</li>
    <li> Scent is wayyy to strong you can basically taste it, it doesn&#x27;t go away for quite sometime... I guess that&#x27;s good if you really smell bad...</li>
    <li> I got these for a great price so I wont comment based off of that but I have to say I really enjoyed the scent of these and the 3 pack kept me going for a while. Would I buy them again, well maybe at the price I got them for of course. This is a pretty good product and I would prefer this over the AXE equivalent any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is made great for flipping over in the tub and the scent is wonderful. I do have to say though since having a toddler these caps aren&#x27;t the greatest I know knit picky but the caps allow water to leak into them. I only know this because my toddler likes to push these into the tub and leave them there, doing so sadly ruins the rest of the bottle but overall I do like this.</li>
    <li> There is a reason Denali is always sold out at the store.  It smells so good.. everyone loves it.  Great body wash, good lather, Old Spice Denali scent. The scent is magnified in a steamy shower, but it&#x27;s not over powering on you when you dry off get dressed and start your day. A little soap goes a long way on a loufa.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Body washes abound, but Old Spice manages to offer a pretty good selection, and this one is good . . . good cleaning and good smelling. Pretty reasonably priced and a good-sized container (check the size before you buy any . . . to compare your costs). No more bar soap for me. Old Spice it is.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good. It&#x27;s the hardest scent to find regularly at the drug stores, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s always sold out or if it&#x27;s just unpopular but everything from the Denali line has a nice scent.  It smells really great on my husband and I actually sometimes use it too when I run out of my own soap and have no issues with it since I wear a sort of spicy women&#x27;s cologne as it is.</li>
    <li> I was concerned with gimmicky pitches trying to sell the scent . . .&lt;br /&gt;And the scent is good!  I can&#x27;t find any other way to appropriately describe the scent or i would.</li>
    <li> I like the refresh and citrus smell, which reminds me of summer.&lt;br /&gt;Tried Matterhorn and Denali, I would say I prefer this over the other.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to anyone looking to get the fresh collection.</li>
    <li> I used the old scent (maroon cap) for years, and was highly disappointed when my new bottle had a different scent. I, like many others, want the old scent back. However, that is not what aggravates me. Changing a fundamental component of a product and keeping the name is what grinds my gears. I also strongly dislike the new smell. It reminds me of a cheap car air freshener. Yes, the ones that look like trees.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell of the Denali Body wash. He used to only use bar soap, but I&#x27;ve converted him to this, and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I love rubbing this stuff all over my body.</li>
    <li> I really like the Old Spice brand.  I decided that &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; was not my favorite scent, but it is good.  I like everything about it except for that.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it is a good price here.  My favorite of all the old spice scents</li>
    <li> I found this body wash to e very refreshing. It smelled great, lathers well, and a little bit went a very long way. This is a pack of three and would purchase it again since it lasted me quite a long time. One of my favorite body washes.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly what I needed.  I am very pleased with it and would get it again if I had to.</li>
    <li> i wondered why this product was so cheap but i bellied up and bought in bulk because thats what i like to do, smells good i will buy a few more cases now that i know its worth it</li>
    <li> This is from the Fresher collection, I dont like the new smell as much as the old &#x27;Fresh&#x27; collection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now cause I love it!!! It smells so good and the scent lasts for a while. Comes off clean too.I will continue to buy this body wash for a while.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great and ladders up well. I love it. Great man product I reccomend all men should buy it.</li>
    <li> For me, I need to use a lot of this soap for it to be at all effective. That&#x27;s the main drawback. The scent also doesn&#x27;t last very long. Overall, pretty disappointed. I expect better from Old Spice.</li>
    <li> He is so particular on the body wash he uses. Anyway I am always trying to save a buck here and there on bath products, Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save sure helps with that. Love the bodywash, smells like freedom :)</li>
    <li> I like the new formula, especially the consistency, it is not as thick as before which means on intended amount comes out of the bottle and doesnt fall to the ground before touching the body. I have always liked the smell of old spice fragrance so complains there. Feels fresh, doesnt dry my body or leaves film of chemicals like Nivea sensitive does, this is my 3rd order. Glad to find a product that i can use in al seasons.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite. It smells good and cleans good as well as it should. It did as advertised and I will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> The whole room fills with it&#x27;s fresh scent when my men come out of the shower. I definitely like this purchase ;)</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiancé as he has been using the Denali collection for a few years now but when we opened the bottle this time, it smelled completely different and honestly not very pleasant. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a labeling error but this is not the old Denali fragrance.</li>
    <li> Bought it a while ago and only used one bottle right now. My brother and I share this product and it always leaves us smelling really manly. The best way to use this is to use a loofah and lather it on the body to get the deep clean and have the smell stay on you. You may not realize how strong the smell is but walk to someone after your shower and they&#x27;ll immediately smell you.</li>
    <li> This is a fresh but masculine smell that is mouth watering. It IS strong, but a little goes a long way and I enjoy waking up to the smell of steam and this when my husband takes a shower. I also use it in MY bath with a little lavender oil. truly a drool worthy scent.</li>
    <li> I try different body washes in the same clear wall dispenser so it&#x27;s easy to see which are the thickest- they stay at the bottom while the cheap thin stuff rises up. This is the thickest best quality. Denali is my favorite as it&#x27;s got that masculine spicey wood scent.</li>
    <li> it smells strong.  so if you like to smother yourself up with the scents other then your own this is good.  It also does not dry my skin out...many of the cheaper products will dry my skin out in th summer even.  But this does not.  If the scent was milder I would give it another star</li>
    <li> A roommate of mine advised me to purchase this product due to its great smell and how long it lasts, and I must agree that this product smells amazing and keeps you smelling great through out the day.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the fresh scent.  Does fine for hair and body.</li>
    <li> Benn using for years this is great stuff and keeps you smelling like new. would recommend to anyone. Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> I like this body wash and would purchase again</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get a better deal than the subscribe and save!  Smells great, the mister loves it and I don&#x27;t have to leave the house - yay for me!</li>
    <li> smells great I love it the only thing is using it in the shower you have to use quit a bit for lather on your sponge. I will get it agian</li>
    <li> Very good product, I simply like that scent. Bought one item in Dallas/TX this summer during our holidays. I like it very much, the scent is perfect.</li>
    <li> Just as with many other Old spice products , we are happy with the purchase. The scent is very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and fresh, not strong or overbearing.</li>
    <li> I have tried many body washes and varieties of scents, but OLD SPICE remains my favorite brand. For this particular Denali scent, I feel that it smells more sweet than the Fresh, Sport, or Swagger versions. Nevertheless, the clean is still great without leaving my skin dry. Old Spice still rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of using any good body wash is that the scent serves as a temporary air freshener after you get out of the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Smells somewhat like Old Spice Playmaker but the smell is not as strong as that.  In a shower cubicle, Playmaker would almost be too strong if there is no ventilation, making you grasp for breathe as if you are at the aisle of a shopping mall selling perfume.  This is just nice.  Very nice &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; smell.  I think most folks would love this.  A bit expensive though, at only 16oz.</li>
    <li> Used this product for about three years. Love the fragrance. You will feel fresh when using this product for showering. Men only Please.</li>
    <li> I subscribe and save this item. The scent was unexpectedly changed to a pine scent. Horrible. Now I see the original is $$$ and looks to be scarce. Bad move Old Spice.</li>
    <li> Clean and refreshing but the fragrance is very strong.</li>
    <li> recieved two different scents</li>
    <li> All the hype about long lasting scent/odor protection hardly applies to body washes. For a clean scrub and crisp smell this is thee go too inexpensive body wash for Men. After a hard workout, in the morning or just before a big night I always utilize this body wash to wash away nasty odors and make my skin feel great. After the shower I top the effect off with some expensive cologne which really makes the difference on first impressions. The smell of the body wash hardly lingers after the shower, that is why it is important to top the effect off with a good quality cologne (and also not spend that much money on body washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon really does have the best price for this body wash. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it in stores as it is upwards $4.50 per bottle especially here in Utah. On Amazon after a $1.00 coupon the price was $2.66 per bottle! Definitely a bargain with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact me if you have any questions about this product.</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome, my wife loves it absolutely on me.I think its worth a try for everyone.Old spice has come up with a good product, it is for sure better than axe</li>
    <li> My daily go-to for clean. great scent, that lasts pretty well.</li>
    <li> great product great price my husband loves it! its kinda werid buying this kind of thing on line but hey if its cheaper which it is yep im in!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for My son who requested I keep My eye out for bulk men&#x27;s body wash.  Stated they are too expensive in the stores so when I saw this in bulk and for a fairly good price I had to get it for him.  He likes the way it smells, says it lathers well.  He&#x27;s pretty satisfied with the product.  He likes old spice too.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and leaves me feeling clean. Its helped to take care of the little pimples that I get on my face. Theyre not very visible in the first place but its nice to see them go away.</li>
    <li> Man that stuff smells good!!!!!</li>
    <li> The enduring Old Spice traditional scent now gives way to a somewhat sweet scent of Denali in this airy body wash! This Old Spice body gel is too sweet smelling to my liking, but it does foam up rather well. The scent is in fact long lasting to its credit. I am not over enthusiastic about this gel, but it did leave me feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> Okay, but not great product. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it&#x27;s kind of weak scent-wise. Seemed to get used up quickly, as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this awesome 3 pack for my husband because it&#x27;s much cheaper than at our local store. First off, I love the scent! Smells very sexy. He always smells so good when he gets out of the shower. It is a lasting scent as well. I can smell it all day on him. It doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out either like a lot of other body washes have. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  My husband loves it and this is his and my favorite scent.  Smells like a man should smell.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this product again!! my wife &amp; kids love the smell so I&#x27;m pleased by this. I was a little hesitant to get this but now I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> We buy this for my husband. He&#x27;s been using this and the deodorant for about a year now. We have no plans of changing anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  Does what it is supposed to, I can smell a hint of it on me after my shower and I do normally use their body spray as well.  Old Spice is not just for old guys anymore, they have totally revamped their entire line.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells great, comes in a very large quantity, and is very cost effective. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this item (provided you like old spice products).</li>
    <li> This has a very nice scent and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;nice product.&lt;br /&gt;most men would love it, and be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Smells good and cleans good. This soap works just like you&#x27;d expect and the bottle illustration is nice and tasteful.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, it&#x27;s my favorite body wash. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Old Spice, and Denali has been my favorite for a while now.</li>
    <li> I have been using old spice&#x27;s &#x27;swagger&#x27; body wash for years, but have been wanting to change scents for quite some time, as I feel silly when someone asks why I smell good and I have to say it&#x27;s old spice &#x27;swagger&#x27;...&#x27;denali&#x27; smells good and doesn&#x27;t have such a rediculous name.</li>
    <li> Love Old Spice scents</li>
    <li> I was really stupid when I ordered this and thought it was deodorant (didnt really read just got trigger happy with the one-click button) and was a bit sad when I got it, but it was a great purchase in the end. It was way cheaper than I could find it in stores and has lasted a long time. I shower almost every day and this will last me a year at-least. Plus who doesn&#x27;t like smelling like success?</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Good smell.  Scrubs up nice gets nasty work grime off well.  Sent strong and lasts a while.</li>
    <li> With the new commercials and introducing the legendary new old spice guy, old spice has been becoming very popular. I came across this product at my local drugstore and instantly thought of the hilarious commercials on TV. I thought to myself, hey why not. I bought this product not having any expectation and gave it a try. The smell of this product is wonderful, and my girlfriend adores it. The smell is very powdery and has a tropical feel to it. It&#x27;s the best smell out of the new scents introduced. Compared to it&#x27;s rival axe, it is not as overpowering and more people tend to compliment me on it. Overall, this cleans your body very well and the smell stays on for hours. Hey, we may not look like the old spice guy, but we can sure smell like him. So what are you waiting for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I helped. I usually write bigger more detailed reviews but this product is just wonderful and does everything it is advertised to do. If you have any other questions feel free to ask and I will answer them as soon as possible!</li>
    <li> have used the product for a few years, but this was a GREAT price, packaging was good also.</li>
    <li> I switched over from Dove to Old Spice to try something new and I love it. The old spice smells great and cleans very well. Compared to others this is a great price and a no brainer!</li>
    <li> I feel like a man and I smell like a god. Old spice you make my pits happy. Buy it now.</li>
    <li> I was kind of overwhelmed by the strength of this soap. I didn&#x27;t realize that I would be smelling like a cologne covered man after a shower. I think that if I skipped showering for a couple of days, I&#x27;d still smell like this body wash. I will go with something more mild and less stinky-teenager.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in a 3 pack for around $12 and will buy it again! 5 stars on this product!</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  It is OK if no other soap is available.  As I said in my review on the Old Spice Matterhorn Body Wash, Denali has no distinguishing features. Smells like many other cheaper soaps available in the market.  In the Fresh Collection, Zanzibar is good.  It is OK if you get it for three dollars.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash - it smells great and fresh.  I was a little weary buying a 3 pack for one person, but even at the end of the 3rd bottle, it smells as great as the first use of the first one.  It is not overly strong where you can continue to smell the scent hours later.  Compared to the Dove mens sport body wash, this gives much more of a clean feeling after using it.</li>
    <li> Best smell ever!!! And its stays on you for quiet a while. Not over powering like some of the others on the market.</li>
    <li> Old Spice has really come a long way with these body wash products. All fragrances are awesome. this Denali sent smells great it lathers up thick and rinses off well leaving you feeling super clean and smelling good. will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I loved the Old Spice Denali FRESH collection body wash, however they changed the formula and this is the Old Spice Denali FRESHER collection body wash. It does not smell the same as the Fresh version, it smells much more like pine and less like the original. It still smells ok, but not as amazing as the Fresh Collection version did.</li>
    <li> my son loves this and anything that keeps a teenager from reeking is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;amazon price with the 15% off is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;the spray not so much.</li>
    <li> I love the body wash, but when I received it in the mail, two of the three bottles were damaged and one of them leaked all in the bag they came in so I had to wash them off. Really annoyed by it.</li>
    <li> Old Spice recently changed the formula for Denali for their &amp;#34;Fresher Collection&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s wayyyyyyyyy worse.  Seriously, I&#x27;m super bummed.  Denali has been my go-to body wash for a couple years now.  It was seriously the best smelling stuff of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so disappointed they changed the formula.  WIll probably not be buying again :(  Please Old Spice, if you&#x27;re out there reading this, please!  Change it back it was so good!</li>
    <li> Then no one would go outside. It has the weirdest \\&quot;I tried to mask a nasty smell with roll-on\\&quot; odor to it.</li>
    <li> This is the first purchase that I have made on Amazon with which I am unhappy.  I have been using this product for a year or so.  Normally, I purchase this product from the grocery store.  This is the first time I purchased it on-line.  There is a significant difference in the amount of fragrance.  The product delivered on this order is almost fragrance free (not a good thing).  It may be the items in this 3-pack simply came from a lot that had a shortage of fragrance.  If anyone out there has lot information to compare, the &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; lot from the grocery store was  #22775395WA; the &amp;#34;non-fragrant&amp;#34; lot received from this order is #30935395WD.</li>
    <li> wonderful smell yet i was allergic to it an got a rash.</li>
    <li> not sure what else to say about this, its body wash, its at a good price and well, the old spice denali is a nice scent. not overpowering and not too fruity.</li>
    <li> Smells great,lathers well and makes me feel clean. Cant ask for much more in a body wash, will buy again</li>
    <li> He loves it so I love it. Smells awesome. Feels great. Recommend...recommend...recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Greatbody wash, smells amazing, and I love the matching deoderant. I can&#x27;t wait to try more different scets from Old Spice again!</li>
    <li> item is as described and arrived quickly and seems to be of good quality would order again also the price is very cheap</li>
    <li> The body wash is good, but I felt the odor (albeit nice) was way too strong. I would prefer a little less intense bodywash.</li>
    <li> This scent is great.  By far my favorite body wash that I have ever used.  Would definitely recommend to anybody.</li>
