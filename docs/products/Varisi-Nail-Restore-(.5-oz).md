      <li>Great stuff works great...</li>
      <li>so we ordered 2 more here!</li>
      <li>Love the inexpensive cost too!  </li>
      <li>This is an absolutely amazing product</li>
      <li>It is so Nice to be able to wear saddles without embarrassment.</li>
      <li>I am especially happy that there are no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I ordered more bottles after hearing that you need to use it for 6+ months or maybe forever.  </li>
      <li>But it works fine.</li>
      <li>For hiking related toe nail damage this is a great healing treatment product.</li>
      <li>we put this on my boyfriends toenail fungus, he is able to use it nightly because it is so easy to apply and he feels he is seeing visible results after just the first bottle</li>
      <li>She was right!</li>
      <li>I had purchased this product before, it not only works effectively, but very quickly.</li>
      <li>worth a try if you have nail fungus esp for the ease of use and the value and as I said he is seeing results, the 1st bottle lasted about a month so pretty quickly!</li>
      <li>I apply every morning, after my shower and right before bed.</li>
      <li>and this product has made my names grow really health and clean</li>
      <li>it really helps my nails</li>
      <li>I used it for weeks without much to show for it.</li>
      <li>It really works - - may take up to a month, but WORKS.  </li>
      <li>The main reason I like this product is how quickly it works, anything else I tried was not only uneffective, but you had to apply if forever.</li>
      <li>I am still using the original bottle, so it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>this product really works, and its all natural.</li>
      <li>After a month I can see that the fungus has cleared up and new nails are growing in.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping that it will all be clear by Spring or summer.  </li>
      <li>I will use this daily until the new nails completely grow in and then will use it for maintenance afterwards.  </li>
      <li>~ I started using a few drops on each toe several times a day and the nails have grown back healthy reattached to the nail bed.</li>
      <li>I have not been using this product long enough to know if it really works for my problem nails, but my cousin recommended it.</li>
      <li>After 60 days, four toes on my left foot are clear.  </li>
      <li>The product works to clear your nails ( in my case toenails ) as long as you continue to use it.</li>
      <li>The other ones have taken longer to grow out, but they are coming in pretty clear and half the size of thickness of before.  </li>

    <li> I have not been using this product long enough to know if it really works for my problem nails, but my cousin recommended it. She said it worked for her but she had to use it for about a year. It shipped immediately!</li>
    <li> It really works - - may take up to a month, but WORKS.  Have left over in case I need it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this often.  May not re-order.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product before, it not only works effectively, but very quickly. The main reason I like this product is how quickly it works, anything else I tried was not only uneffective, but you had to apply if forever.</li>
    <li> Works like charm!  Had a podiatrist tell me I had some weird toenail thing that couldn&#x27;t be cured. A woman at the nail salon tell me that Varisi was the way to fix it. She was right!</li>
    <li> OMG - I can&#x27;t believe this is working!  I heard about this at a nail salon, where they were selling it for $15. I ordered more bottles after hearing that you need to use it for 6+ months or maybe forever.  I have had thick fungus nails forever and I have tried just about every remedy imaginable.  In about 30 days I could see a difference.  You need to cut back all of the damaged nail area and expose the skin, because the fungus kills the skin (a salon can do this for you, if you cannot).  Then, put the drops on every night and every morning.  There is some orangey discoloration to the nail, until you wash your feet well in the shower, with soap.  After 60 days, four toes on my left foot are clear.  They were the least affected.  The other ones have taken longer to grow out, but they are coming in pretty clear and half the size of thickness of before.  I keep trimming back the fungus area and it seems to be clearing it up.  I am hoping that it will all be clear by Spring or summer.  I am still using the original bottle, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for removing nail fungus. The best cure would be to contact a doctor.</li>
    <li> the nail salon I go to happened to give me a bottle of this they had sitting around, after 2 years of varied home remedies we put this on my boyfriends toenail fungus, he is able to use it nightly because it is so easy to apply and he feels he is seeing visible results after just the first bottle so we ordered 2 more here! worth a try if you have nail fungus esp for the ease of use and the value and as I said he is seeing results, the 1st bottle lasted about a month so pretty quickly!</li>
    <li> this product really works, and its all natural. I have never been without one because I have acrylic on my nails, and these can get damaged really badly</li>
    <li> I have been using for about two years now.  Slowly the fungus is going away.  Patience and time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use but have to be diligent in using</li>
    <li> Great stuff works great...</li>
    <li> Works wonders, my dermatologist thought I had a wart underneath my nail, and prescribed wart removers. This helped out a ton</li>
    <li> I was having a terrible problem with an ingrown big toe&lt;br /&gt;toenail...the pain was bad...a friend gave me a small&lt;br /&gt;bottle of Varisi which I started using daily and surprisingly&lt;br /&gt;the pain finally stopped. I give this product a high&lt;br /&gt;five star rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure because I have been using that product for a few weeks and don&#x27;t see any result :-(</li>
    <li> It did not work well and was very disappointed. I used it for weeks without much to show for it.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely amazing product</li>
    <li> it really helps my nails</li>
    <li> This is helping with a fungi I have for some time now, where it seems that nothing was working this is helping.</li>
    <li> I have taken prescription Lamisil, trued the soaking in tea method etc.  Then my nail salon recommended this product. Both my big toe nails had lifted all the way back to cuticle ~ I started using a few drops on each toe several times a day and the nails have grown back healthy reattached to the nail bed. You have to be dedicated for it to work ~ but if you are persistent in applying I assure you it does repair and stop the fungus.  It only takes a small drop under the nail ~  allow in to run under the nail bed. I apply every morning, after my shower and right before bed. Mine were extremely bad and it has taken almost a year to  grow  back completely. It is so Nice to be able to wear saddles without embarrassment. Highly recommend.  Love the inexpensive cost too!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> I damaged the big and second toes on each foot over 15 years ago on a long downhill hike and they became infected with nail fungus.  I have tried every cure from tea tree oil to vinegar with no results and had resigned myself to awful looking nails.  Finally, however, I am getting results with this little bottle.  I followed instructions and brush my nails with hydrogen peroxide every day, and use the drops twice a day morning and night.  After a month I can see that the fungus has cleared up and new nails are growing in.  I will use this daily until the new nails completely grow in and then will use it for maintenance afterwards.  I am especially happy that there are no harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I had really bad toe nails and this product has made my names grow really health and clean</li>
    <li> The product works to clear your nails ( in my case toenails ) as long as you continue to use it. It&#x27;s probably not the products fault but the nature of the nail fungus that requires constant diligence. But it works fine.</li>
    <li> For hiking related toe nail damage this is a great healing treatment product.</li>
