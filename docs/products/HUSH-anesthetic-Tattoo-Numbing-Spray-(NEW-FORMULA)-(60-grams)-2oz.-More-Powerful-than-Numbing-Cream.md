### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product, shuts up the timid when tattooing!</li>
      <li>(I wanted to know which product would be best for my wife.)  </li>
      <li>exellant product very happy</li>
      <li>This spray was great.</li>
      <li>They were extremely happy</li>
      <li>Good medium ground.</li>
      <li>so I tried used some while I tattooed my own stomach and have to say it worked amazingly!</li>
      <li>The name itself caught my eue and made me laugh, works great!</li>
      <li>suggestion, buy yourself a lottery ticket and hopefully that is a better return on investment!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The both products worked effectively.  </li>
      <li>Worked great- needed it the last 30 minutes of shading when I was worried I was going to squirm and not get the perfect artwork.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to girlfriends and they have enjoyed the process more.</li>
      <li>Better than not having it,  that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I bought the gel which was outstanding.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the most painless tattoo</li>
      <li>Better than cream...</li>
      <li>I guess these products work better on some than on others...</li>
      <li>Was better off not trying this.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>It burns pretty intensely when it&#x27;s initially sprayed on, and when you&#x27;re already to the point of needing a numbing product of some kind having a burning sensation of any kind isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <li>Doesnt work as well as everyone made it sound.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good if applied hours before and wrapped in plastic wrap until ready to tattoo.</li>
      <li>This stuff made my skin so much more sensitive that the needle hurt sooooo much more....</li>
      <li>Worked quickly and took the edge off.  </li>
      <li>I did have to sit through the linework first, as the skin has to be broken for the spray to be effective, but it sure made the coloring and shading far more pleasant.</li>
      <li>and it did not numb the area at all.  </li>
      <li>Cost wise, thetwo products were comparable, $18.50 including shipping for 3x10g tubes of the other product vs $27.00 plus shipping for the 60g Hush.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to have your tattoo artist open the skin with a quick pass over parts to be shaded.</li>
      <li>The spray seemed to have much less effect on her, so she pushed on through the 4 hour session, using the spray fairly often.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After the first 5 minutes, I started feeling every needle prick.</li>
      <li>Rather than constantly wincing, I was able to relax into the process for a large tattoo on my chest.</li>
      <li>Good for smaller pieces but NOT for larger pieces.</li>
      <li>I had a large tattoo and used the spray.  </li>
      <li>Certainly helped.  </li>
      <li>It made a lot of work possible in a short amount of time, I am a chronic pain patient with hyperalgesia, so pain can push me over the edge easily, and HUSH spray was very useful in making the process much easier on my wimpy self.  </li>
      <li>got this huge bird on my back.</li>
      <li>Really helped when getting into the armpit area.</li>
      <li>In 100% fairness, this product came fast and on time.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I was very unsatisfied and would not recommended it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Best to try Ink Eeze or Dr. Numb instead.</li>
      <li>Works ok but not really worth it.  </li>
      <li>Maybe she has different skin or lower pain threshold, but it worked for maybe 60 minutes before she started to feel some mild pain.  </li>
      <li>The other product generally seemed to work better for longer, but the Hush certainly worked for up to maybe 90-120 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It helps a little, but for $25 it should help alot more.</li>
      <li>ever I have a lot of ink and did my whole chest with this and was nearly painless</li>
      <li>But soon realised I had read some where that the sensation was normal.</li>
      <li>After the initial burn wears off it numbs okay, but personally I prefer Bactine because you get the same level of numbing without the intense burn beforehand.</li>
      <li>Worked good, it does burn a little when first applied but that was expected as it is being sprayed on open wounds.</li>
      <li>Three friends tried it and had the exact same results.</li>
      <li>The first 5 minutes, the basic outline, I didn&#x27;t feel a thing!</li>
      <li>The lidocaine felt like an intense icy hot on my skin.</li>
      <li>After the outline session, I decided to order some numbing cream since my wife was struggling with the large piece on her back.  </li>
      <li>no where near it.</li>
      <li>This seemed to help for maybe 30 minutes before the effect wore off, but no where near as well as the gel or cream.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, an hour later I am at the tattoo parlor and ready to go.</li>
      <li>Both products used about the same amount to cover, and we used two 10g tubes on my wife&#x27;s large back piece, and probably 10g on my large upper arm</li>
      <li>Without this product I would have surely tapped out and left with an incomplete piece and anxious to go back.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since my session was first, I used Hush on the top half of my arm, and the other product on the bottom half.  </li>
      <li>my skin became super sensative, at least I think so, and the spray did not do a dang thing to bring back the numbness.</li>

<li> my skin became super sensative, at least I think so, and the spray did not do a dang thing to bring back the numbness.</li>
<li> It numbed, but didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> I had almost no feeling for around 60-90 minutes, and then started feel more, but it was certainly still less painful.  </li>
<li> After the burning stopped it took at least 75 percent of the pain away until the very end of a 160 min tattoo.  </li>
<li> The Hush and the other product both arrived on the same day, so I had a chance to compare both products...</li>
<li> So after about 15 minutes I unwrapped and applied a second layer (I&#x27;m a huge chicken when it comes to handling tattoos) and then remembered wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The bottle says skin needs to be broken first</li>
<li> The product works instantly after using on previous line work</li>
<li> Definitely takes some of the alien autopsy feeling out of some work on the ribs and inner thigh.</li>
<li> Both use the same active ingredient, with Hush a gel at 4% and the other product a cream at 5%.  </li>
<li> nervous because I knew it was going to be rough.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice the first product I ordered was coming from Hong Kong, so it was taking longer than I expected to arrive.  </li>
<li> Now I can&#x27;t wait to get my other pit</li>
<li> (Hush says 1 hour, the other product says 1-2</li>
<li> /&gt;We still have another session to finish off, so I will be ordering the other product rather than the Hush Gel, and will try the Hush Gel once it wears off, since it says it can also be used during.  </li>
<li> I am almost finished with a sleeve tattoo and have not felt any pain due to this gel &amp; spray.  </li>
<li> /&gt;We used the other product on my wife.  </li>
<li> My tattoo artist even said afterward he wouldn&#x27;t recommended lidocaine before tattooing because it makes the skin less absorbent or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
<li> After less than 2 hours, we needed to use the spray.  </li>
<li> and I lasted about 2 hours with little to no pain.  </li>
<li> I thought this was for little b*tches</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> BIGGEST waste of money, ever.</li>
<li> My artist pulled the spray out of her hat &amp; used it on me; it burned like hell for a few minutes.</li>
<li> A few days before our follow up session, I order the Hush Gel and Spray.  </li>
<li> And remember, even if the tattooing hurts, it&#x27;s a few hours of pain for a lifetime of beauty, if you picked your tattoo well.</li>
<li> At first I thought I was having a bad reaction.</li>
<li> As I said it won&#x27;t numb you completely</li>
<li> If I could give this a negative rating, I would.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get the wrong impression this doesn&#x27;t numb you completely.</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t completely numb a spot just takes it down a notch or two.</li>
<li> Buy it &amp; use it for those tough areas, you won&#x27;t regret it.  </li>
<li> The outline was tough but doable and 40 min into the shading I thought I was going to cry.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27; waste your money on this,it does not work!!!</li>
<li> Disgusting how much I payed to ADD pain to my tattoos.</li>
<li> After about 2 hours the gel wore off and we used the spray on the broken skin and completed outline.  </li>
<li> I rubbed it isn&#x27;t like lotion two times before tattoo and a couple times after the skin was broken while he would be switching needles or what have you</li>
<li> felt 5x worse than the outline.</li>
<li> Horrible, did absolutely nothing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product works instantly after using on previous line work</li>
    <li> Horrible did nothing for my foot. I followed directions and all. Worst part is that I ended up having both feet done and the one that didn&#x27;t have the spray was easier to handle the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Would never recommend this product</li>
    <li> This spray was great. I did have to sit through the linework first, as the skin has to be broken for the spray to be effective, but it sure made the coloring and shading far more pleasant. Rather than constantly wincing, I was able to relax into the process for a large tattoo on my chest. It made a lot of work possible in a short amount of time, I am a chronic pain patient with hyperalgesia, so pain can push me over the edge easily, and HUSH spray was very useful in making the process much easier on my wimpy self.  And remember, even if the tattooing hurts, it&#x27;s a few hours of pain for a lifetime of beauty, if you picked your tattoo well.</li>
    <li> I have been getting tattooed for 15 years, and a tattoo artist myself for 10, I recommended trying a numbing cream to a customer and the purchased hush. They were extremely happy so I tried used some while I tattooed my own stomach and have to say it worked amazingly! Of course you&#x27;re still gonna feel the damn needle but it makes it substantially easier to sit for several hours. In some spots i couldn&#x27;t feel the tattoo at all!</li>
    <li> Better than not having it,  that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Worked good, it does burn a little when first applied but that was expected as it is being sprayed on open wounds. It numbed, but didn&#x27;t last very long. My tattoo took almost 3 hours altogether and he sprayed it on me 3 times. Tattooed me for an hour with no spray, then put it on every 30 minutes after that.</li>
    <li> The spray actually worked!  I used it during the session.  It took away the burning sting of the area that had just been tattooed.  Certainly helped.  Dont care for the gel.  It didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I thought this was for little b*tches and then I remembered I&#x27;m a petite female so I gave it a try. Definitely takes some of the alien autopsy feeling out of some work on the ribs and inner thigh.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my skin so much more sensitive that the needle hurt sooooo much more....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this huge bird on my back. The bottle says skin needs to be broken first so he did the entire outline... Then he sprayed me up and let it sit for 10 mins to activate... Once he started to shade my bird in it felt 5x worse than the outline. It hurt so bad I had to stop my session and schedule another. I was very unsatisfied and would not recommended it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it just yet for a tattoo but I have sprayed it on my skin. And it does numb. Hopefully it stays just as numb during a tattoo.</li>
    <li> I guess these products work better on some than on others...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I were both having some work done.  After the outline session, I decided to order some numbing cream since my wife was struggling with the large piece on her back.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice the first product I ordered was coming from Hong Kong, so it was taking longer than I expected to arrive.  A few days before our follow up session, I order the Hush Gel and Spray.  The Hush and the other product both arrived on the same day, so I had a chance to compare both products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my session was first, I used Hush on the top half of my arm, and the other product on the bottom half.  (I wanted to know which product would be best for my wife.)  Both use the same active ingredient, with Hush a gel at 4% and the other product a cream at 5%.  I had both on for around 90 minutes by the time we started.  (Hush says 1 hour, the other product says 1-2 hours.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The both products worked effectively.  I had almost no feeling for around 60-90 minutes, and then started feel more, but it was certainly still less painful.  The other product generally seemed to work better for longer, but the Hush certainly worked for up to maybe 90-120 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the Hush spray.  This seemed to help for maybe 30 minutes before the effect wore off, but no where near as well as the gel or cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used the other product on my wife.  Maybe she has different skin or lower pain threshold, but it worked for maybe 60 minutes before she started to feel some mild pain.  After less than 2 hours, we needed to use the spray.  The spray seemed to have much less effect on her, so she pushed on through the 4 hour session, using the spray fairly often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We still have another session to finish off, so I will be ordering the other product rather than the Hush Gel, and will try the Hush Gel once it wears off, since it says it can also be used during.  Cost wise, thetwo products were comparable, $18.50 including shipping for 3x10g tubes of the other product vs $27.00 plus shipping for the 60g Hush.  Both products used about the same amount to cover, and we used two 10g tubes on my wife&#x27;s large back piece, and probably 10g on my large upper arm piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the Hush work... yes.  Better than cream... no.  Did it last 4 hour... no.  The spray... no where near it.</li>
    <li> Worked great- needed it the last 30 minutes of shading when I was worried I was going to squirm and not get the perfect artwork.  Worked quickly and took the edge off.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works well. Don&#x27;t get the wrong impression this doesn&#x27;t numb you completely. You still feel a bit of pain but nothing like you would without it. Make sure to have your tattoo artist open the skin with a quick pass over parts to be shaded. Then spay on the ointment and let it sit for 60 seconds before continuing. As I said it won&#x27;t numb you completely but it will take the bite out of the process. I&#x27;ve recommended it to girlfriends and they have enjoyed the process more. No damage to tattoos color or healing times.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all while getting my tattoo. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money just suck it up and deal with the pain</li>
    <li> In 100% fairness, this product came fast and on time. Obviously simple purchase process with amazon so a+ there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a smedium sized rib piece this weekend. And after doing my research and reading the directions over and over, I began my process. I bought both the spray and the gel prep. So I soaked my rips and surrounding skin in the gel formula with one layer, that I didn&#x27;t rub in, then saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burn baby burn. The lidocaine felt like an intense icy hot on my skin. At first I thought I was having a bad reaction. But soon realised I had read some where that the sensation was normal. So after about 15 minutes I unwrapped and applied a second layer (I&#x27;m a huge chicken when it comes to handling tattoos) and then remembered wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, an hour later I am at the tattoo parlor and ready to go. The first 5 minutes, the basic outline, I didn&#x27;t feel a thing! I was internally celebrating, I could definitely handle 4 hours of this, I could fall asleep. But no no no. After the first 5 minutes, I started feeling every needle prick. Death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my skin became super sensative, at least I think so, and the spray did not do a dang thing to bring back the numbness. I was in miserable pain for the rest of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all. My personal opinion. 5 stars for convience and shipping. 1 star for actual effectiveness. Good medium ground. 3 stars. My tattoo artist even said afterward he wouldn&#x27;t recommended lidocaine before tattooing because it makes the skin less absorbent or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had sucked it up.</li>
    <li> I rubbed it isn&#x27;t like lotion two times before tattoo and a couple times after the skin was broken while he would be switching needles or what have you and it&#x27;s the most painless tattoo ever I have a lot of ink and did my whole chest with this and was nearly painless</li>
    <li> Horrible, did absolutely nothing. This was the thing I counted on to relieve me, or even give me comfort during my tattoo session. Utterly disappointed and feel cheated.</li>
    <li> Great product, shuts up the timid when tattooing! The name itself caught my eue and made me laugh, works great!</li>
    <li> Not only did this not work, the area I used it on swelled up. I had to stop the tattoo and will b finishing another day.</li>
    <li> I have been getting tattooed for almost 20 years and decided to go for my pit.  I went in totally pumped up/nervous because I knew it was going to be rough.  The outline was tough but doable and 40 min into the shading I thought I was going to cry.  My artist pulled the spray out of her hat &amp; used it on me; it burned like hell for a few minutes. After the burning stopped it took at least 75 percent of the pain away until the very end of a 160 min tattoo.  Without this product I would have surely tapped out and left with an incomplete piece and anxious to go back.  Now I can&#x27;t wait to get my other pit done!!&lt;br /&gt;  Buy it &amp; use it for those tough areas, you won&#x27;t regret it.  BK</li>
    <li> This stuff did not work at all for me. I was very disappointed for the price I paid! I wont be recommending it.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good if applied hours before and wrapped in plastic wrap until ready to tattoo. Tends to wipe away the stencil if used while tattooing. Plus it stings on open skin.</li>
    <li> Works ok but not really worth it.  Just get the gel and be done!</li>
    <li> SUCKED.  I bought the gel which was outstanding.  I have multiple tattoos over my entire body and I thought i&#x27;d cheat for once. I used the gel to start and I lasted about 2 hours with little to no pain.  After about 2 hours the gel wore off and we used the spray on the broken skin and completed outline.  The spray was applied and the plastic wrap was put back on for the 15 minutes desired.  DIDNT DO ANYTHING and went through the rest of the session with no relief.</li>
    <li> I am almost finished with a sleeve tattoo and have not felt any pain due to this gel &amp; spray.  I will not get another tattoo without it!</li>
    <li> A so-so numbing product. It burns pretty intensely when it&#x27;s initially sprayed on, and when you&#x27;re already to the point of needing a numbing product of some kind having a burning sensation of any kind isn&#x27;t ideal. After the initial burn wears off it numbs okay, but personally I prefer Bactine because you get the same level of numbing without the intense burn beforehand.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all for me.  Followed directions and nothing.</li>
    <li> The gel cream works but not the spray</li>
    <li> Don&#x27; waste your money on this,it does not work!!!</li>
    <li> I had a large tattoo and used the spray.  It only worked for 15 minutes and re application s did not work.</li>
    <li> exellant product very happy</li>
    <li> This product not only did NOT work it also feels like someone lit you on fire where it is sprayed. Would not recommend this product to anyone ever. Disgusting how much I payed to ADD pain to my tattoos.</li>
    <li> the spray did not work, I will request  a refund.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a negative rating, I would. BIGGEST waste of money, ever.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. This doesn&#x27;t completely numb a spot just takes it down a notch or two. Really helped when getting into the armpit area.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the location of my tattoos, but HUSH did not work like I&#x27;d hoped it would.  I have a &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; tattoo.  I followed the directions to the T and it did not numb the area at all.  My artist and I even let it sit on my skin under cellophane for 30 minutes and it did not make a difference.  I was hoping for a feeling where I could tolerate the tattoo on my knee and along my shin bone.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. If anything, it intensifies the pain. Three friends tried it and had the exact same results. Buyer beware. Best to try Ink Eeze or Dr. Numb instead.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to a T. This product did not work, but worse, it feels like a cold burning sensation while its on. Wish I could have a refund!</li>
    <li> Not a fan at all!!  Wears off too soon and I followed the instructions carefully.&lt;br /&gt; Gets too pricey and timely to keep reapplying even if you use the Hush spray, still have to wait 15 minutes wrapped after starting, and time equals money especially when you pay for your tat by the hour.&lt;br /&gt; I think I&#x27;ll just endure the pain as I have and save the money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion, buy yourself a lottery ticket and hopefully that is a better return on investment!</li>
    <li> I purchased both this and the gel. Gel didn&#x27;t work and neither did this. Also after using this spray it made my tattoo session 10 times worse! Was better off not trying this. I won&#x27;t be recommending this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Says on here that you don&#x27;t need to break the skin before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottle it says skin just be token before use.</li>
    <li> Left it on for two hours, wrapped it, etc. only lasted about 45 min to an hour. Good for smaller pieces but NOT for larger pieces.</li>
    <li> It helps a little, but for $25 it should help alot more.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work as well as everyone made it sound.</li>
    <li> Did not numbs skin at all</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even work. Waste of money.</li>
</ol>
