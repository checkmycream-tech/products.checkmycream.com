### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>In my opinion, this is the best hair gel on the market.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>Naturelle gel has great hold and is especially good for those with sensitivity to fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found it because my hair tends to do whatever it likes.</li>
      <li>This gel works great as a styling gel and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
      <li>Great styling gel.  </li>
      <li>This gel works great and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitivity.</li>
      <li>But I have to say that this gel is AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>I actually laughed after the fact.</li>
      <li>gave this product a fair shake.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light and runny gel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got this product because I have been experiencing a lot of dermatitis, and I had read that using unscented products around your face is very important.  </li>
      <li>I love this hair gel.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many products before finding this one and</li>
      <li>Takes out most frizz.</li>
      <li>so I can incorporate it better.  </li>
      <li>try it for sure.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get gooey but helps my hair be more manageable all day.</li>
      <li>Love this gel.</li>
      <li>i was okay with that...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but wisher it were a bit stronger hold.  </li>
      <li>Almost every day I use it, I love the way my hair looks</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even feel my contacts any more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know to date how many people were laughing at me.  </li>
      <li>The more I tried to remove a glob of rubber, the more rubber globs presented themselves.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it thank you for making this product available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>I also love that all the ingredients are curly hair friendly.  </li>
      <li>After being on quite a journey to find something that held her coarse hair AND that she wasn&#x27;t allergic to, I&#x27;m glad to have found this product that she is happy with.</li>
      <li>i had got this product as i am allergic to strong smelling gels.. however this didnt work...</li>
      <li>I was looking for something light</li>
      <li>but I can see if you have shoulder-length or longer hair it may be too light for your use.</li>
      <li>The holding power is great for my short hair,(short layers ending at my neckline)</li>
      <li>The gel is great for scrunching hair after drying, especially the ends.</li>
      <li>then you scrunch the stiffness out once its completely dry for beautiful, well formed curls and waves.  </li>
      <li>Leaves the hair feeling clean and odor free.  </li>
      <li>Those shampoos are generally pretty strong.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or sticky, has great hold, and doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
      <li>Turns out I need something with less \\&quot;hold\\&quot; than a gel, but this works ok for me if I use it sparingly, even though it is made to do more than what I want.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think it is any better than watering down a strong hold gel.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years now and love it.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise I apply this product when my hair is pretty damp/wet</li>
      <li>and I seem to be able to use it every day, which is far more than I can say for all of the other gels and products I have tried for my wavy/curly hair!  </li>
      <li>and this is generally when I am on day 3/4 hair and am trying to smooth out frizz.  </li>
      <li>I love it because I used to have to cut my hair short in order to look decent because I could not style my hair</li>
      <li>it doesnt set the hair strong enough..</li>
      <li>I suffer from severe sensitivity to smells so have had to go totally fragrance free in all my products.</li>
      <li>But I can tell you 100% that if you have irritated eyes, you should absolutely give this a shot.</li>
      <li>Really.  </li>
      <li>I wonder if those with flaking issues are using too much product.</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>For me, this &lt;$10 bottle of hair gel has really improved my quality of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Too much</li>
      <li>This product Sets my hair very well.  </li>
      <li>An old eye injury that left a scar on my cornea would eventually get so irritated that I would have to remove my contacts for a day or more in that eye until the irritation went away.</li>
      <li>But I found this gel didn&#x27;t hold for long or strongly at all.</li>
      <li>but this is half the price, seems to work better, and doesn&#x27;t smell - which I prefer.  </li>
      <li>I read quite a few good reviews about this gel on some different websites for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this is just not the right gel for coarse hair.  </li>
      <li>It does not tame hair, but it does cause allergic itching and burning.</li>
      <li>I have eczema, and regular styling gel makes my scalp really itch.</li>
      <li>far as the performance of the gel itself, I would say its a soft hold.</li>
      <li>Do not waste money on this product.</li>
      <li>It has a very faint scent from the herbs used in it, which is very pleasant, but so faint that most people probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
      <li>Then, I washed my hair and applied the product and went out to the social event.  </li>
      <li>Occasionally I have minimal issues with flaking but only if I apply too much</li>
      <li>It works like a strong gel hold, but the only thing i found fault was i have dark hair and at the end of the day it dried into flakes if touched and made my hair look like dandruff.</li>
      <li>But after a few hours the light hold that it gives breaks down and flakes causing irritation.  </li>

<li> I would say that solution to this problem would be to put the product on and don&#x27;t touch your hair for a long time.</li>

<li> Will not weigh hair down.  </li>
<li> , that might help a little with frizz and not weigh my curls down.  </li>
<li> When I visited the restroom, I noticed gummy-bear clumps--rubbery little off-white collored balls sitting around my forehead and hanging about in my hair.  </li>
<li> This dries a little crunchy</li>

<li> I have been using my Naturelle Hypo-Allergeinc styling gel for a few weeks and have had no problems at all.</li>
<li> Not many options out there for those who have sensitive scalp unfortunately.</li>
<li> That is almost impossible to find at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> I have found that I can at least use to go to dinner with out getting itchy eyes.</li>
<li> It Is not too thick, but lasts all day for me.</li>
<li> I use it because I don&#x27;t do sulphates and silicone on my curly/wavy and thick hair.</li>
<li> and my hair looked dirty, too little and no result.  </li>
<li> This gel stiffens up your hair well and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave anything behind when washed out.  </li>
<li> Not impressed with the holding power.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have particularly difficult hair</li>
<li> To the point that I want to buy it in bulk because I am afraid they may take it off the market or change the formula</li>
<li> It would become quite painful.</li>
<li> since I started using this product I&#x27;ve yet to have those annoying spots on my head.</li>
<li> It looked and felt horrible because it would itch</li>
<li> It is awful.  </li>
<li> No reason to go in to its  terrible performance as a gel when it isn&#x27;t hyper allergenic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> This gel stiffens up your hair well and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave anything behind when washed out.  Turns out I need something with less \\&quot;hold\\&quot; than a gel, but this works ok for me if I use it sparingly, even though it is made to do more than what I want.</li>
    <li> This product Sets my hair very well.  I will definitely buy this gel product again.  It also works well on waves. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> The gel is great for scrunching hair after drying, especially the ends. It is not oily.  Leaves the hair feeling clean and odor free.  Takes out most frizz.</li>
    <li> Love this gel. Speedy shipping. Did not leak</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best hair gel on the market.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or sticky, has great hold, and doesn&#x27;t stink.  The biggest plus is that it doesn&#x27;t make my head itch.</li>
    <li> I have a client who requires products with NO scent.  After being on quite a journey to find something that held her coarse hair AND that she wasn&#x27;t allergic to, I&#x27;m glad to have found this product that she is happy with.</li>
    <li> It did not bother my allergies at all! It works like a strong gel hold, but the only thing i found fault was i have dark hair and at the end of the day it dried into flakes if touched and made my hair look like dandruff. It holds as a gel but needs R&amp;D on flaking apart.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now and love it.  To the point that I want to buy it in bulk because I am afraid they may take it off the market or change the formula and I would have to find something else.  I used to use Aveda liquid styling gel but this is half the price, seems to work better, and doesn&#x27;t smell - which I prefer.  Occasionally I have minimal issues with flaking but only if I apply too much and this is generally when I am on day 3/4 hair and am trying to smooth out frizz.  Otherwise I apply this product when my hair is pretty damp/wet so I can incorporate it better.  I also love that all the ingredients are curly hair friendly.  That is almost impossible to find at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My scalp has stopped breaking out.  Great styling gel.  It Is not too thick, but lasts all day for me.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe sensitivity to smells so have had to go totally fragrance free in all my products. This gel works great and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly difficult hair I just have sensitive skin, so I bought this hoping to be able to adjust for my bad skin with a nicer product. But I found this gel didn&#x27;t hold for long or strongly at all. After a few minutes when my hair dried it&#x27;d be just as frizzy as it was without it.</li>
    <li> It was too watery and gooey to begin with. Then, I washed my hair and applied the product and went out to the social event.  When I visited the restroom, I noticed gummy-bear clumps--rubbery little off-white collored balls sitting around my forehead and hanging about in my hair.  While this product might serve some other purpose, it was not the purpose I intended.  Perhaps there is an additional application of some sort that goes along with this.  It was Cinderfella night.  I had to leave.  The more I tried to remove a glob of rubber, the more rubber globs presented themselves.  I didn&#x27;t break out or anything, so I guess it is hypo-allergenic, but that comes with a peculiar cost.  I don&#x27;t know to date how many people were laughing at me.  I actually laughed after the fact.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, and regular styling gel makes my scalp really itch. This gel works great as a styling gel and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. I&#x27;m happy to have found it because my hair tends to do whatever it likes. Will buy again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for several years.  I will not use anything else. I do not use it because of allergies.  I use it because I don&#x27;t do sulphates and silicone on my curly/wavy and thick hair. I have type 2c hair. This dries a little crunchy then you scrunch the stiffness out once its completely dry for beautiful, well formed curls and waves.  Will not weigh hair down.  It&#x27;s a very light and runny gel.&lt;br /&gt;If you have my hair type,  try it for sure. I can&#x27;t speak for other hair types.</li>
    <li> Naturelle gel has great hold and is especially good for those with sensitivity to fragrance. Switched over to this from DevaCurl products. I wonder if those with flaking issues are using too much product. Three stars (deducted two for price - you can buy this at Sally&#x27;s for around $7.00).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but wisher it were a bit stronger hold.  Not many options out there for those who have sensitive scalp unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I wish this was the answer. It&#x27;s not. No reason to go in to its  terrible performance as a gel when it isn&#x27;t hyper allergenic.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a fair shake. Used off and on for months even got a 2nd bottle. Why. It is the only gel that  I have found that I can at least use to go to dinner with out getting itchy eyes. But after a few hours the light hold that it gives breaks down and flakes causing irritation.  I am done with this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is any better than watering down a strong hold gel.</li>
    <li> I have a problems with the \\&quot;wings\\&quot; of my hair. This stuff takes care of business and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a situation with irritated eyes for a while now that is compounded by the fact that I wear piggyback contact lenses (soft and hard lens in each eye). An old eye injury that left a scar on my cornea would eventually get so irritated that I would have to remove my contacts for a day or more in that eye until the irritation went away. It would become quite painful. It got to the point that it was occurring every 2-3 weeks and I could not for the life of me figure out what was triggering it. I knew it was allergies, but I thought it was related to pets or just general pollen in the air, so I would often take OTC allergy stuff which helped a little. I started to think it was related to shampoos in hotels since I travel a bit for work. Those shampoos are generally pretty strong. I started searching for hypoallergenic shampoos and then stumbled on this hair gel. I&#x27;ve been wearing hair gel since I was a teenager. I gave this a shot and it had a immediate effect. My eyes no longer feel like they are burning 24x7. I can&#x27;t even feel my contacts any more. I&#x27;m just over 3 weeks in after switching and I can&#x27;t tell you how relieved I am to have possibly solved my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to effectiveness for any type of skin irritation as that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. But I can tell you 100% that if you have irritated eyes, you should absolutely give this a shot. For me, this &lt;$10 bottle of hair gel has really improved my quality of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the performance of the gel itself, I would say its a soft hold. If you&#x27;re looking for spiky hair that doesn&#x27;t move, this is not going to give you that.</li>
    <li> Do not waste money on this product. It does not tame hair, but it does cause allergic itching and burning. Buy something else instead.</li>
    <li> I am ordering a second bottle of the hair gel because it holds my short hair well and does not make my very dry scalp itch. I have tried many, many products before finding this one and every one of them caused severe scalp itch. The holding power is great for my short hair,(short layers ending at my neckline) but I can see if you have shoulder-length or longer hair it may be too light for your use. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> I read quite a few good reviews about this gel on some different websites for curly hair.  It is awful.  Really.  I was looking for something light, that might help a little with frizz and not weigh my curls down.  I adjusted the amount I used over several days and never found an amount that worked.  Too much and my hair looked dirty, too little and no result.  Maybe this is just not the right gel for coarse hair.  It provided no hold, and gave no definition for my curls.  It actually made my hair straighter.</li>
    <li> it doesnt set the hair strong enough.. i was okay with that... however a couple of days after applying the gel, i found flakes in my hair so i stopped using the product.. not recommended.. i had got this product as i am allergic to strong smelling gels.. however this didnt work...</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the holding power. My hair lays flat even when I apply this stuff after toweling my hair. I need a product that doesn&#x27;t have tons of parabens and other chems that make my face break out. I was hoping this was it. Not so much.</li>
    <li> I use only a nickel size in my palm, rub it on my hands and run my hands through my wet hair. It doesn&#x27;t get gooey but helps my hair be more manageable all day. And it&#x27;s hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> I love this hair gel. I used to get all kinds of red spots on my head. It looked and felt horrible because it would itch and I would get dandruff from those red spots. Who knows what it was. all I know is that it would get triggered from using hair products (gel, hairwax etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using this product I&#x27;ve yet to have those annoying spots on my head. I love it because I used to have to cut my hair short in order to look decent because I could not style my hair but now I use this product. I absolutely love it thank you for making this product available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say though, is that if you put the product on your hair and style it and immediately wear a hat or a hoodie or something like that it will get flaky sort of like dandruff. I would say that solution to this problem would be to put the product on and don&#x27;t touch your hair for a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have been experiencing a lot of dermatitis, and I had read that using unscented products around your face is very important.  But I have to say that this gel is AMAZING!  Almost every day I use it, I love the way my hair looks and I seem to be able to use it every day, which is far more than I can say for all of the other gels and products I have tried for my wavy/curly hair!  It has a very faint scent from the herbs used in it, which is very pleasant, but so faint that most people probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.  Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I broke out in a severe case of hives a year ago. I quit dying my hair and using over the counter hair products because that may have been the cause. I have been using my Naturelle Hypo-Allergeinc styling gel for a few weeks and have had no problems at all.</li>
