<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There are three bottles included in this package.&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle holds about 3.4 ounces of liquid/ solutions.&lt;br /&gt;The lids are flip-open design. Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic of the bottles is hard and of good quality. Doesn&#x27;t get bent or squished in my bag. Yet, it is easy to squirt out some lotion from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I out lotion in one of the bottles to take with me and it doesn&#x27;t leak out. So the bottle is safe and clean to carry in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are BPA free and environmentally friendly.&lt;br /&gt;1 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and evaluation.</li>
    <li> Works great. No leaks and easy to open and squeeze soap out of.</li>
    <li> Clean bottles and great for mixing oils for hair and eyelash serums.</li>
    <li> It serves my purpose. This are very good leak proof containers. I had one earlier but that used to leak all the time. This one is really good, I carried them with different liquids (shampoo,body wash,face wash) and they didn&#x27;t leak. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping to get, thanks! They&#x27;re perfect for my shampoo and oils when travelling.</li>
    <li> Nice size but they are not squeezable!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the carrying case just the bottles, bottles are ok nothing special</li>
    <li> These bottles are perfect for my use, but they are not very good as squeeze bottles. You can squeeze out a drop or two, which is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;The flip-top closure does not leak, even with organic solvents.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to receive. As described</li>
    <li> Items received were as described in the Amazon listing; I&#x27;ve only had them a short while, but so far no complaints with the quality.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t leak, but the plastic cap snapped off one of them the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size! Love them !</li>
    <li> Very happy with this BPA free bottles.  Great for carrying salad dressing and useful for transporting even my vitamins easily when I am on the road.  Love that they are made in the USA! Also great for traveling by plane as they meet TSA standards.</li>
    <li> Crap.  Two of them broke after 2 weeks from squeezing them.  Plastic is hard and not sqeezable.  So like catchup bottle shaking lotion out.</li>
    <li> Too sturdy...hard to squeeze out to use it.</li>
    <li> Cute little bottles just the right size for shampoo and conditioner, with an extra one if I can come up with anything else I want to pack. Arrived quickly, well packaged.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about these bottles. I put lotion in them that I made, but when I squeezed the bottle to get the lotion out it cracked and shot lotion everywhere.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3 bottle pack. The pictures show lids being purple, white and yellow. I received purple, white and pink. I ordered these bottles partially because of their color. Also, the picture shows a carry pack and the description says &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; indicating that you&#x27;d receive a carrying pack for the three bottles to fit in. You do not receive a pack, just three bottles at whatever color lids they choose. The product quality seems good, just disappointed that the item was not as described.</li>
    <li> There the perfect size and it helps to have different color caps for different lotions or liquids.  Quality is good and they arrived in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Awesome bottles.  Great size.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Bottles are a little thin but I have used them twice so far and they work perfectly</li>
    <li> great product and service from this seller. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product was what it said. Received in a timely manner.</li>
