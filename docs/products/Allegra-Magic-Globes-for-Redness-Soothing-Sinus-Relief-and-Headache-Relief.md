<li> The white plastic handles are the right size (for me anyway) to hold the globes without your hands getting too cold and they feel like the glass is thick enough that they won&#x27;t break easily (we&#x27;ve only broken 1 in 3 years)</li>
<li> My only complaint would be that the handles could be longer.</li>
<li> I keep mine in the freezer inside a cosmetic case that I lined with small bubble wrap to prevent breakage based on other reviews.  </li>
<li> They stay extremely cold for much longer than I anticipated.  </li>
<li> The only thing is that when I put it in the refrigerator, it wasn&#x27;t cold enough.</li>
<li> one broke very easily,I was very unhappy about that</li>
<li> But they should be used delicately anyway.</li>
<li> or it was already broken</li>
<li> I put them in a bowl for the day on a few ice cubes and they stay ice cold all day.</li>
<li> On the VERY thin side.</li>
<li> I keep cold in the freezer for head ache relief and for after mini-facials, of course.</li>

    <li> one broke very easily,I was very unhappy about that,I tried to get it replace but got no respond,I feel like it wasn&#x27;t package correctly or it was already broken</li>
    <li> Just like in the spas</li>

    <li> After an eyebrow wax, when you have a headache, when a kid gets a bump, on a hot day ... really, these little things are indispensable.   An affordable luxury.   I&#x27;ve given them as shower gifts (keep in the freezer until she gets to your card!), to RAVES!!</li>
    <li> I just these after waxing to soothe redness. Also after a chemical peel to calm the skin. I hear they are good for planterfacitis, but I don&#x27;t have that.</li>
    <li> So excited when I got these in the mail. I know a lot of estheticians that use these so I knew they worked! Definitely a must have for a chemical peel!</li>
    <li> A wonderful treatment, tightens skin and feels great.</li>
    <li> These globes are very nice glass. On the VERY thin side. We ordered two boxes (4 total) as they tend to break often. The globes stay nice and cold while being use and quickly chill again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE these globes!!</li>
    <li> Works well with a milk mask. The only thing is that when I put it in the refrigerator, it wasn&#x27;t cold enough. Then when I put it in the freezer, the liquid froze.</li>
    <li> I use these on clients after aggressive extractions or treatments. Really helps to cool down redness &amp; inflammation on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great for relieving sinus pressure and for soothing inflamed skin. I&#x27;d highly recommend these globes for use during a facial or after waxing.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and use these for calming and soothing after peels or extractions. In the supply houses these go to professionals for around $100. I put them in a bowl for the day on a few ice cubes and they stay ice cold all day. My only complaint would be that the handles could be longer. Overall, these are a great deal and work great on anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  So soothing and has wonderful tightening results.  They stay extremely cold for much longer than I anticipated.  I have also used for migraine relief.  Love how it truly helps my expensive face creams penetrate the skin.  Highly recommend.  I keep mine in the freezer inside a cosmetic case that I lined with small bubble wrap to prevent breakage based on other reviews.  I have been using for over a month and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and these work wonders after giving an active chemical peel to my client and want to calm their skin down and reduce inflammation.  I massage the face with these gently over a hydrating mask for about 5 minutes.  Be very careful as I broke one (just bumped it onto the granite counter... and crack, splash, blue mess)  and had to reorder another set.</li>
