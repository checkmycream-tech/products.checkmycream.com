      <li>Nice lotion, My daughter loves it</li>
      <li>Firstly, let me just say it smells AMAZINGLY!!</li>
      <li>I love this the smell is fabulous and it works great.</li>
      <li>The scent is actually VERY pleasant (sort of sweet, but fresh), and it doesn&#x27;t change on the skin after tanning, like some lotions do.</li>
      <li>Good buy for someone who wants a good smelling lotion without a tingle.</li>
      <li>I really like sweet scents so this was perfect for me.</li>
      <li>It has a nice floral odor and is easy to apply</li>
      <li>This smells more like lemon then cupcake</li>
      <li>I feel so bronze and sexy when I put this on.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many others</li>

      <li>I love the smell also</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I love smell of this lotion and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite lotions.</li>
      <li>I love the beachy/vanilla cupcake smell.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells fabulous!</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>Will probably end up using this one at the beach more than in the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this tanning lotion</li>
      <li>smells great, really yummy, even better when your dine tanning.</li>
      <li>I found using it, then leaving my house to tan, worked out much better.</li>
      <li>You do get some delicious color from it, and who can argue with that for the ten dollars I paid?</li>
      <li>This is a lighter color being as it is only X10 bronzer, which is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I thought this lotion was just okay.</li>
      <li>But I also recommend AG&#x27;s Cheeky Brown as well! :-)  </li>
      <li>a must order:)</li>
      <li>It smells delicious, like a mix of pink sugar and vanilla cupcakes.</li>
      <li>I received this product very quickly (before the expected arrival date) and it was in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it makes your skin very soft &amp; it smells sooooo good</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this, and if I run out I can just purchase more since it is such a great deal.</li>
      <li>love this lotion and quick to get in mail</li>
      <li>Skin still smells like tanning bed after but this lotion gives a fast tan and nice bronze tone.</li>
      <li>light bronzer - doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s such a great price as compared to buying it in a salon.</li>
      <li>it was relatively cheap.</li>
      <li>I got a decent color from this product, and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Smooth and clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>definitely worth buying!</li>
      <li>but I think the Australian Gold &amp;#34;Deviously Black&amp;#34; is more effective.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>and I put it right to work!</li>
      <li>Again --not bad or anything, but not cupcakes, cake or sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>fast delivery :)</li>
      <li>After only two weeks a using this product I look as good as George Hamilton</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell is great!! Fairly good tanning lotion. Very hydrating</li>
    <li> I feel so bronze and sexy when I put this on. After only two weeks a using this product I look as good as George Hamilton</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t wait to use this the next time i go tanning i purchased it because of the price &amp; i was looking for bronzer opened it up and smells so good!!! fast delivery :)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion,spells good too!!!!</li>
    <li> This product had little bronzing affect for me.  I was not pleased it at all.  I expected a more vanilla or cookie smell and it wasn&#x27;t there.  The only thing I can say that&#x27;s a positive is that it spread evenly and was smooth feeling on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to the tanning game but I always bought my lotions in the store. I love this lotion. It showed up at my house exactly when expected and I put it right to work! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love smell of this lotion and how it makes my skin feel. I have and do use all kinds of lotions from low cost to high cost and this is still a fav. Got it in two days! Always a +</li>
    <li> It worked good. And smells good</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, My daughter loves it</li>
    <li> The only positive thing about this lotion is it comes in a pink bottle...other than that, it sucks and stinks. I have a full bottle, only used once...wasted my money.</li>
    <li> love this lotion and quick to get in mail</li>
    <li> This lotion smells like a lemon type cleaner and hardly any bronzing at all.  Terrible product.....who sells a lotion with cupcake in the name of the product and it smells like lemons :-(</li>
    <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t cost very much, so I didn&#x27;t really expect very much from it, either. I&#x27;ve paid over sixty dollars for tanning lotions in the past, and frankly, this one actually works (and smells) a lot better than most of them. The scent is actually VERY pleasant (sort of sweet, but fresh), and it doesn&#x27;t change on the skin after tanning, like some lotions do.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Great price. Very nice scent. Perfect pre-tan product. I use it every time that I go tanning.</li>
    <li> I tried a trial pack of this at the salon and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this unless you want to smell like a mopped floor. I was expecting a nice bakery smell but it has a horrible lemon smell. The only thing that&#x27;s nice is the pretty bottle. Does not smell like cupcakes at all!</li>
    <li> gets you brown and smells decent!</li>
    <li> Like the smell, got good color. Will order again!</li>
    <li> This lotion does smell nice after tanning. It seems to be helping sustain my tan altho I alternate it with an accelerator/bronzer.  It shipped &amp; arrived quickly. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got this because of the price, and Australian Gold hasn&#x27;t done me wrong so far. I got a decent color from this product, and it smells amazing. My only problem is if you don&#x27;t put it on at least ten minutes before tanning, you stay a little greasy, it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb like other lotions. I found using it, then leaving my house to tan, worked out much better. It didn&#x27;t get rid of the &#x27;burnt&#x27; smell you get after tanning either. You do get some delicious color from it, and who can argue with that for the ten dollars I paid? I recommend this lotion, as long as you use it before you leave your house.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Skin still smells like tanning bed after but this lotion gives a fast tan and nice bronze tone. Works fast after a few tans I went from super pale to golden :)</li>
    <li> This tanning product is very good to use. I also like the smell. It has a nice floral odor and is easy to apply</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Firstly, let me just say it smells AMAZINGLY!! I love the beachy/vanilla cupcake smell. It&#x27;s not a major bronzer, but I always notice color when I put it on. I have absolutely no complaints about this lotion at all.</li>
    <li> Smells great and made my skin feel smooth. So far it&#x27;s working in getting me tanned. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good bronzer, smells weird. Nothing like cupcakes!</li>
    <li> Great product and smells amazing!!! I got compliments on how good I smelt lol I haven&#x27;t tried many others Bc I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and in good condition. The fragrance is sweet and seems to be more noticeable to other people than to me. I will continue to purchase the Australian Gold products.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like cupcakes</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Great prices thanks♥</li>
    <li> I was planning on buying this after reading the good reviews. Lucky for me my tanning salon had a sample and I decided I would try it early. I am so glad I did, this stuff is terrible. Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like cupcakes at all. Instead, it smelled eerily like my organic lemon toilet bowl cleaner. So if you are hoping for a nice vanilla scent look somewhere else. Even my husband commented on the cleaner smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I have olive tone skin and have been tanning for two and a half weeks. I have tanned many times and by the third week I always have a good base. So I am already noticeably tan, that being said I put this stuff on and went into tan. Before I ever got in the bed I was a bit itchy, then I got to the salon late and had to cut my time down to a measly 6 minutes, and now I am home and my skin is on fire! I feel like I am burnt to a crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to be fair I do have some skin allergies, namely metal. But I have NEVER had a reaction to tanning lotion like this. Only once before have I had a reaction and simply after a week of tanning my skin started to feel tight. But never have I felt like this. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> smells great, really yummy, even better when your dine tanning. light bronzer - doesn&#x27;t streak. I recommend it and will buy it again</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird when you first put it on but smells better once it&#x27;s dry and you&#x27;re out of the bed. Good moisturizing lotion to keep you from feeling dry and just enough bronzer to give you a bit of color but won&#x27;t make your hands turn orange if you don&#x27;t wash them right away. Good lotion for the price. Will probably end up using this one at the beach more than in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Love it... Nice smell great color.. fantastic! !!!</li>
    <li> I received this product very quickly (before the expected arrival date) and it was in perfect condition. It also smells really good and leaves me with a bronze (NOT orange) tan!!</li>
    <li> I loved the scent of this lotion and it&#x27;s such a great price as compared to buying it in a salon.</li>
    <li> This smells more like lemon then cupcake but I love this brand and its cheap!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really good!  I love Australian Gold products and this one has been no different.  Good buy for someone who wants a good smelling lotion without a tingle.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fabulous! It give a great looking tan fast without yellow or streaking. It&#x27;s awesome. I will by it again . Thanks</li>
    <li> This is good lotion but not the best . I like to use different lotions when tanning,I will use this in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and it smells great too . if your looking for a bronzer then this is the one !</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend AG&#x27;s Peace, Love &amp; Cupcakes. I love the fact that it makes your skin very soft &amp; it smells sooooo good, I don&#x27;t know about cupcakes but it does smell just like old country time lemonade &amp; the smell just gets stronger as you tan. I am a fair skinned ginger &amp; it worked wonderfully on me.. out of all 7 of my tanning lotions this is by far my favorite! But I also recommend AG&#x27;s Cheeky Brown as well! :-)  Candi</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell anything like cupcakes and it also doesn&#x27;t help bronze my body at all during tanning sessions.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my salon n it was relatively cheap. I used it for a mth n had a lil color but def not the color i should have from tanning 2-3 times a wk for a mth. Got a new lotion n i can see the difference immediately. Didnt do nething for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing, just sayin! I am totally obsessed wih cupcakes and this works so amazingly! I love the smell also(: thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I normally buy tingle lotions but since I had a baby a few months ago I thought it would not be a good idea. So I decided to try this because I saw it on the counter when I was starting up my package and I have to say it works really well! I was surprised how fast I got color! And as for the smell I like it! I think some people just will never be pleased with anything for those complaining about it!!!</li>
    <li> good stuff a must order:)</li>
    <li> I love this the smell is fabulous and it works great.</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was just okay. Nothing special. Not sure if it actually domes anything. Smells strange after tanning. Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I give this lotion a 4 out of 5 for the great price and long lasting product.  I hate thick tanning lotions and this product gave me what I was looking for - easy to apply and silky feeling after application.  The scent is more citrusy that I had expected but it does well to cover up the bronzer odor.  The product has lasted a long time, and I use a lot at one time. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I just recently started tanning, and my salon was offering this lotion at a much more expensive price. I loved the smell, so I looked online and found it here for a fraction of the cost they were asking. It is a great deal. The bottle came quickly, packaged well. It smells delicious, like a mix of pink sugar and vanilla cupcakes. I really like sweet scents so this was perfect for me. I don&#x27;t understand the other reviewers saying they smelled lemon, or disinfectant cleaners. This smells fresh and sweet, nothing sour or odd about it. I am very fair, and wanted something that would be lighter while I work on my tan. This is a lighter color being as it is only X10 bronzer, which is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t want to end up looking orange, so this is great. I enjoy using this, and if I run out I can just purchase more since it is such a great deal. It leaves my skin soft and smelling sweet.</li>
    <li> It works. The smell is kind of off-putting and not what I had expected from the name. But it does its job a fair amount.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me since I started the tanning bed. I thought this would smell good and work well, since I used tanning beds n high school, and always used Australian Gold products. However, this stuff is pure crap. The smell is gross, I don&#x27;t even know what to liken it to, or how to describe it. Also, it does nothing to moisturize either. It&#x27;s supposed to have bronzing agents, telling you to wash hands right after applying so you don&#x27;t get stained, and I forgot. But no big deal, because this does not bronze you whatsoeve, it didnt even stain my hands. I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake bottle or someone used an empty bottle and filled it with something else, but I will definitely NOT use this ever again. Glad I&#x27;m only out $11.99.</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well without leaving a bad smell like some of the other lotions I have purchased in the past.  definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I love Australian Gold products except this one it smells like insecticide. I will stick with other Australian Gold products.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this tanning lotion but I think the Australian Gold &amp;#34;Deviously Black&amp;#34; is more effective.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lotions. Helps extend the life of your tan and gets you bronzer faster! Also smells good!</li>
    <li> I love this!  Smooth and clean feeling.  Not greasy or filmy.  Feels nice and smells great.  Highly recommended.  If you need an inexpensive indoor tanning lotion – this is it.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample at my local tanning salon and had to buy some for myself. The prices here are half what the salon wanted. It smells so good sometimes I dab some on for perfume.</li>
    <li> Very good product.Arrived sooner then I expected. It smells really good and is cheaper then buying at the tanning place!</li>
    <li> This product does not smell sweet. No vanilla, berry, caramel or any kind of cupcake smell. It is kind of an outdoorsy lemon-y scent.  Seriously. Like a lemony face astringent smell - after the alcohol dries. It is not a strong smell and is very muted. Again --not bad or anything, but not cupcakes, cake or sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not impressed with the bronzer in this and used it at the tanning salon. At least it&#x27;s a relatively small bottle. I will use this when I run out of something else. Whatever.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how large the bottle was upon arrival. It has a great smell and no lingering &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; scent that some lotions can leave behind. However, it doesn&#x27;t bronze quite as much as I would like. But still a great daily tanning bed product for those of us who maintain our tans year round.</li>
