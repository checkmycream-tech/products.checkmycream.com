### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was very happy to see I could get just the triangles.  </li>
      <li>I had gotten a mixture before and found the triangle was the best shape for me (</li>
      <li>impressive</li>
      <li>line - perfect!  </li>
      <li>These are great!</li>
      <li>I used these when I was pregnant/breastfeeding and couldn&#x27;t do Botox… they were great!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced that using the triangle between my brows, but I have experienced that</li>
      <li>These patches are great.</li>
      <li>but if you use some of the products out there that Freeze the skin for the day than teh combo of these strips and those lotions would be great .&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these and I will continue to use them nightly!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the wrinkle relieving face patches that are out there, and now I&#x27;ve found the perfect one for me.</li>
      <li>These are good for the &amp;#34;angry 11&amp;#34; lines between the eyebrows.</li>
      <li>this is the best available.  </li>
      <li>I have loved this product since I started using it, but they&#x27;ve continued to change/cheapen the material these are made from.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product that really works!!!</li>
      <li>Well, received product promptly and was very pleased with the results.</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
      <li>frownies are better</li>
      <li>or if I&#x27;m working at home (they are not so invisible as to be able to wear them to work or on an outing).</li>
      <li>They do work better though but could be firmer.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s safe.</li>
      <li>love this product...</li>
      <li>Love...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick to my face many of the nights.  </li>
      <li>for me, it worked better than the crescent, which I think is the one that is meant for this location on your face).  </li>
      <li>Softens the lines and gives you a more relaxed look.</li>
      <li>Dermagen patches adhere and re-adhere as advertised, and I love them except for these shapes (triangle).</li>
      <li>The size that is perfect for me is the medium size and is the size that came in the mixed set.  </li>
      <li>Better than Frownies</li>
      <li>I need to cover more area to stop night lights from side sleep</li>
      <li>They made my &amp;#34;11s&amp;#34; more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t magic</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these for a couple of years now and have been pleased.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, very comfortable to wear overnight.</li>
      <li>Very cool.</li>
      <li>These Patches R the BEST along with the other collagen gel ones I mention and reviewed called Smoothies,&lt;br /&gt;these</li>
      <li>/&gt;very easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>You have to hit it when the lines are just starting (according to a friend who has more prominent lines and didn&#x27;t have as good of luck with them.)</li>
      <li>and they work fine.</li>
      <li>I think it has helped tremendously!  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a couple years now and it has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to wear</li>
      <li>Very happy, was skeptical, but I&#x27;ll be getting more of these!</li>
      <li>The company was so nice and recently just sent me a free gift!  </li>
      <li>I think they work great at lessening lines, but there are only 13 that are the right size for me,</li>
      <li>From my first use with these patches there was a noticeable softening of the frown lines and they were easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These patches work great on flattening raised scars on my arm and face, due to burns and cystic acne.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the instructions were easy to follow.</li>
      <li>However they are perfect for me in that location; I can catch a little line above the lip on each side and still smooth out the nose to mouth</li>
      <li>If it was entirely - are they effective  </li>
      <li>If they don&#x27;t seem to stick, I just hold them to my forehead until they warm up a tiny bit</li>
      <li>These are a bit softer than Frownies, and more nearly invisible, which means I can wear them all day if I want to</li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t stick to freshly moisturized</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re probably worth trying.</li>
      <li>they were pretty obvious (OK, like railroad tracks!)</li>
      <li>Alone they won&#x27;t stay unless you get lucky and if it is hot, for get it, they come right off.</li>
      <li>The woman at the company (who was very nice) suggested that I could cut the large one in half (which I tried</li>
      <li>Love them and they last longer than two applications.</li>
      <li>I saw an improvement  between my eye brows the first time I used them.</li>
      <li>So my problem is - I really like these patches!  </li>
      <li>Infinitely better than paper and glue based products claiming similar results.</li>
      <li>The DermaGen Anti-Wrinkles Patches are much better than Frownies (which sting like the dickens when you pull them off the next morning!).</li>
      <li>I think that the company must keep records on how often customers order because the last time I received mine, I got a bonus free gift!</li>
      <li>Even medium one is too narrow, and doesn&#x27;t restrict muscle movement which is exactly what you are looking for - not to be able to frown!</li>
      <li>if you smile as normal.</li>
      <li>The other good news is that the wrinkle doesn&#x27;t come back as distinctly during the day.</li>
      <li>DermaGen is certainly easier to put on compared to frownies but it just does not work.</li>
      <li>I always felt like I was sticking a stamp on myself with the Frownies… highly recommended!</li>
      <li>so I can use the whole sheet.</li>
      <li>I feel like these really work.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>They stick very well to my skin and&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some folks seem to really like them.</li>
      <li>I really like this patches.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really think these patches were going to work</li>
      <li>but they have really sold me.</li>
      <li>and I noticed more wrinkles on one side of my face than the other.</li>
      <li>The 11 is not bad  and these only help to minimize and control it.so if you&#x27;ve git it already &amp;</li>
      <li>I looked up the main ingredient</li>
      <li>These things do stick better but are  more expensive.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>have purchased Dermagen&#x27;s new Expression set (triangle), it&#x27;s more expensive, contains more patches</li>
      <li>Not ready for needles, this is fine.  </li>
      <li>(if you have the right size), they definitely rate a 5 star.</li>
      <li>The new ones don&#x27;t stick as well either.</li>
      <li>lowered my five star rating to two stars because I no longer like the new product and will be searching for a replacement.</li>
      <li>Not enough patches to do much of anything...saw no difference and you absolutely cannot reuse these.</li>
      <li>The patches are easy to use, and you can get a few uses out of each patch.</li>
      <li>They wotk better than any topical lotion i have used in the past and will continue use these, as they really do work, but you must use them dilligently.</li>
      <li>Right before bed, I cleanse my face thoroughly, pat dry and let my skin rest for about 15 minutes before putting on the patches.</li>
      <li>Once I started wearing these patches to sleep, the lines look so much less significant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is much gentler on my skin than other similar-type products I have used in the past.  It also blends in with your skin tone so it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing an obvious patch on your face at night!</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have been ordering it for years.  The company was so nice and recently just sent me a free gift!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Yes, I recommend these. While I haven&#x27;t used these patches for long, I already have seen an improvement in the furrows between my eyebrows....they were pretty obvious (OK, like railroad tracks!) and now are softer. The patches are easy to use, and you can get a few uses out of each patch. So I&#x27;ll continue to apply them before bed. Those squiggly little lines around my mouth are my next target!  The DermaGen Anti-Wrinkles Patches are much better than Frownies (which sting like the dickens when you pull them off the next morning!).</li>
    <li> I feel like these really work. I keep ordering them over and over, love them. I wouldn&#x27;t say you can get three uses out if them, definitely two.</li>
    <li> I usually use Frownies, and wanted to try these. These are a bit softer than Frownies, and more nearly invisible, which means I can wear them all day if I want to or if I&#x27;m working at home (they are not so invisible as to be able to wear them to work or on an outing). The softness means I feel it less if I inadventantly wrinkle my brow, while Frownies you can definitely feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that if I gently rinse these every other day, maybe rubbed with a very small drop of soap, they can be used for well over two weeks each. If they don&#x27;t seem to stick, I just hold them to my forehead until they warm up a tiny bit and they work fine.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very comfortable to wear overnight. I&#x27;ve been able to reuse the pads for at least three days. Infinitely better than paper and glue based products claiming similar results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a deep 1 inch &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; next to my left eyebrow - It&#x27;s one of those &amp;#34;squint&amp;#34; wrinkles. One of my friends actually asked me, &amp;#34;How did you get that scar?&amp;#34; I was mortified and started to look for an over-the-counter solution. After reading the Amazon.com product review, I settled on this product, hoping the collagen-impregnated patches would help reduce the prominence of my wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle patches for about 6 weeks (I apply it before bed and sleep with it on every night), my wrinkle has flattened out and plumped up in the center. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an 85-90% improvement upon waking up. The other good news is that the wrinkle doesn&#x27;t come back as distinctly during the day. It&#x27;s as if the DermaGen patches are &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; the skin and muscle beneath to lie flat again. I feel like if I keep using the patches, this wrinkle might almost disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DermaGen patches are virtually invisible when applied, and you don&#x27;t feel them at all. They adhere well and remove painlessly. They don&#x27;t dry my skin out and they are odor-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really think these patches were going to work but they have really sold me. I&#x27;ll continue using them as long as I have my big problem wrinkle and as I develop others.</li>
    <li> Once you put these on they don&#x27;t move!! I use them at night because I am a side sleeper and I noticed more wrinkles on one side of my face than the other. Now that I use these patches I can sleep on that side and the patches keep the skin smooth!! I love these and I will continue to use them nightly!!</li>
    <li> I like these and find them effective for the lines from nose to mouth.  Yeah I know, that&#x27;s apparently not how they are normally used.  However they are perfect for me in that location; I can catch a little line above the lip on each side and still smooth out the nose to mouth line - perfect!  I had gotten a mixture before and found the triangle was the best shape for me (for me, it worked better than the crescent, which I think is the one that is meant for this location on your face).  I was very happy to see I could get just the triangles.  However, I did not realize the triangles in this package were actually different sizes: small medium and large.  The size that is perfect for me is the medium size and is the size that came in the mixed set.  For me - the small was too small and the large was too large. I called the company and they said they only sell the triangles in sets of different sizes.  There are 13 of the average size that is useful for me.The woman at the company (who was very nice) suggested that I could cut the large one in half (which I tried but they end up too small). So my problem is - I really like these patches!  I think they work great at lessening lines, but there are only 13 that are the right size for me, cutting the big one in half makes two small triangles - no good for me, they just don&#x27;t cut into a good size for me.  that makes them $9.95 plus shipping for 13, close to a dollar a piece and that is pretty expensive, since you can only use each one a few times.  That&#x27;s why I went with 4 stars instead of 5.  If it was entirely - are they effective  (if you have the right size), they definitely rate a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I recently tried botox and became very ill. I have since been searching for a natural solution and then click this is the best available.  Of course the results aren&#x27;t permanent but works well temporarily.  On my last order I received the wrong shape. I emailed the company and they sent out the correct ones immediately without asking for the wrong ones back.</li>
    <li> Did not stay on my skin, and if it did it didnt keep my deep &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; wrinkles flat like the paper frownies.  The patch was wrinkled too.  Gave them away for someone else to try</li>
    <li> I used these when I was pregnant/breastfeeding and couldn&#x27;t do Botox… they were great! Better than Frownies in that they had the hydrocolloid gel that stuck by itself and hydrated the skin overnight. I got 3-4 uses out of each one. I always felt like I was sticking a stamp on myself with the Frownies… highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Dermagen patches adhere and re-adhere as advertised, and I love them except for these shapes (triangle). This set comes in 3 different sizes. I can only use large triangle between my brows, the other two are very small. Even medium one is too narrow, and doesn&#x27;t restrict muscle movement which is exactly what you are looking for - not to be able to frown! They are also soft and pliable. I find that inflexible frownies are much better particularly for those deep furrows between the eyebrows. I will have to double them up, not a good deal at this point even if they were $5. I don&#x27;t have problems reusing them several times so that&#x27;s the plus. The smallest triangle is too small for anything but can be used on pimples. These do reduce blemishes overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased Dermagen&#x27;s new Expression set (triangle), it&#x27;s more expensive, contains more patches but they are all the same size as these. They do work better though but could be firmer.</li>
    <li> These just didn&#x27;t work for me. They came off in the night and didn&#x27;t re-adhere well. Shipping was fast and the instructions were easy to follow. Some folks seem to really like them. They&#x27;re probably worth trying.</li>
    <li> I must worry when I sleep because I started waking up with a line in between my eyes that would go away mid morning.  Well, that line started sticking around longer and longer so I decided to try these patches to help me along.  I found that one triangle prevents the wrinkle from forming.  Whats the problem then?  It doesn&#x27;t stick to my face many of the nights.  The directions say something about using it over and over again 2-3 nights which is crazy because I barely can make it through night 1 and thats it.  Like another reviewer said, you would have to put some sort of tape over it to get it to stick. The other shapes in the package are useless especially the small triangle which is a joke.  Worst of all the latest batch I used caused a rash.  I know 100 percent that these caused it because when I moved the triangle to another location and left overnight the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the wrinkle relieving face patches that are out there, and now I&#x27;ve found the perfect one for me. These little stickies really have staying power and I&#x27;ve found that I can get at least 3 uses out of each one. Right before bed, I cleanse my face thoroughly, pat dry and let my skin rest for about 15 minutes before putting on the patches. I leave them on overnight, and when I wake up in the morning, the lines are barely noticeable. I must actively make faces in my sleep because when I don&#x27;t use the patches, I wake up with the same lines I had before. I think that the company must keep records on how often customers order because the last time I received mine, I got a bonus free gift! Very cool. I plan to always have these on hand so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about lines on my face making me look angry or worried all of the time. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I can get a few days out of each piece. I work at home so I wear a triangle between my eyes all day. It’s not very noticeable to me or distracting if you’re talking to me (I’ve inquired). Not sure about the ones on the sides of the mouth. I need to cover more area to stop night lights from side sleep so I use frowns. These things do stick better but are  more expensive. Still you can get at least 2 days out of each one.</li>
    <li> love this product...thanx*****</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that really works!!!</li>
    <li> Really do work, but kind of expensive to keep purchasing. I wish they were around 5 bucks a sheet instead of 10.</li>
    <li> I have used frownies for years when I sleep to avoid getting creases on my forehead. I find them annoying to put on but they do the job. I was hoping that this product would do the job as there was a similar new product (frown ease) that was on the market a few years ago that looked similar. DermaGen is certainly easier to put on compared to frownies but it just does not work. It is too thin and I wake up with creases on my forehead. I bought 2 boxes but I&#x27;m throwing the second one in the bin and will return to using frownies.</li>
    <li> It did nothing.  You obviously need to also purchase the gel.  I did not.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Returned them.  I don&#x27;t see how being so soft these patches can &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; your muscles not to forwn. &amp;#34;Frownies&amp;#34; it is.</li>
    <li> Too soft they don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> They work.  Not forever, but they flatten out the vertical line I have between my eyebrows.  Just one vertical line, but it makes me crazy.  Not ready for needles, this is fine.  I slap one on at night.  In the am, no line.  Until I start squinting....sigh....</li>
    <li> I like these a lot for my frown crease between my brows.  I&#x27;m 35 so, it was beginning to make me look angry all the time because the crease from a furrowed brow stayed permanently.  Now sleeping with this on, I wake up and there are no creases...at least until I frown.  I think it has helped tremendously!  Very happy, was skeptical, but I&#x27;ll be getting more of these!</li>
    <li> These are great! I use them right in between my brows , don&#x27;t do botox because it doesn&#x27;t work on me :( so this is it. The 11 is not bad  and these only help to minimize and control it.so if you&#x27;ve git it already &amp;#34;a wrinkle,&amp;#34; this will only help but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> These patches are great. I put them on at night and when I take it off in the morning, I can see the results! It says they can be reused, but they loose their stickiness after the first use.</li>
    <li> If you are a side sleeper, do not buy these.  They made my &amp;#34;11s&amp;#34; more pronounced.  I am going back to Frownies.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years now and it has made a huge difference. My &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines are almost non existent. I probably put a triangle on before bed 4 out of 7 nights a week. You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there. I looked up the main ingredient and it&#x27;s only gelatin so it&#x27;s safe. I sent it to friends and it&#x27;s such a hit with them as well. I don&#x27;t understand why this is not a huge product. It&#x27;s such an inexpensive non invasive way to fight wrinkles! I think if you have deep lines I don&#x27;t know if it would work as well? You have to hit it when the lines are just starting (according to a friend who has more prominent lines and didn&#x27;t have as good of luck with them.) I get only the triangles and they are not all the same size. I only want the mid size so I use two small ones together and cut the large ones down so I can use the whole sheet.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering these for about a year and realy like how they work.  Will continue to reorder when these are gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting. They aren&#x27;t magic but I can definitely see a difference. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t hold the skin in place. frownies are better</li>
    <li> I am in my thirties and the only considerable lines I have are between my eyebrows - I unfortunately realized once it was too late that the expression I was making while asleep was the biggest reason for them.  I would wake up with the lines looking the deepest.  Once I started wearing these patches to sleep, the lines look so much less significant.  I know there are some reviews that people say they can go some nights without them but that isn&#x27;t the case for me, I have to wear them nightly to maintain the effect.</li>
    <li> Love...3rd order&lt;br /&gt;Really works for the 11 lines&lt;br /&gt;Very impressive</li>
    <li> The patches do not hold unless I put 3m tape over them.  Alone they won&#x27;t stay unless you get lucky and if it is hot, for get it, they come right off.</li>
    <li> AHHHH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the heavens PART! These Patches R the BEST along with the other collagen gel ones I mention and reviewed called Smoothies,&lt;br /&gt;these stick on wont come off till you peel back AND can use over nite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a scar for years on my face and these skin tabs peels left on for a week 2x a day over nite too has lifted the indented scar to where it can be covered fully by makeup! Beofre the indentation was too DEEP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO for wrinkles you can imagine what my results are im  truly shocked. I use them on deeper forhead lines I typically do Botox for and use every nigh over night and wait 30 min after appmy AHA glycolic cream , then put a stip  of these on my head and eye corners and next day there are no visble wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just if you smile as normal. There doesnt seem to be a lasting day long effect but if you use some of the products out there that Freeze the skin for the day than teh combo of these strips and those lotions would be great .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these just on their own ! thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a couple of years now and have been pleased.  In my mid-30s I started to develop frown lines between my eyebrows that would deepen when I slept.  At the time, I used Frownies, but wanted something easier to remove.  Also, Frownies kept me from furrowing my brow at night, but they didn&#x27;t help to soften the lines that were there.  From my first use with these patches there was a noticeable softening of the frown lines and they were easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews about them leaving crease marks while you sleep.  I haven&#x27;t experienced that using the triangle between my brows, but I have experienced that with the forehead strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get multiple uses out of each patch. Tip: Wait a while after putting on moisturizer to apply them. They won&#x27;t stick to freshly moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 3/23/15:  I have loved this product since I started using it, but they&#x27;ve continued to change/cheapen the material these are made from. The original product was really thick so it didn&#x27;t leave crease marks while I slept, but the material is now so thin they crease each time I use them, which defeats the purpose of reducing wrinkles. The new ones don&#x27;t stick as well either. I have had a few nights where it falls off in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lowered my five star rating to two stars because I no longer like the new product and will be searching for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Love them and they last longer than two applications.</li>
    <li> I really like this patches. I saw an improvement  between my eye brows the first time I used them. They stick very well to my skin and&lt;br /&gt;very easy to remove. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are good for the &amp;#34;angry 11&amp;#34; lines between the eyebrows. They keep this area smooth and relaxed while you sleep, if you have a tendency to make expressions or tense up. Comfortable to wear and you can use them several times. Softens the lines and gives you a more relaxed look.</li>
    <li> Well, received product promptly and was very pleased with the results. These patches work great on flattening raised scars on my arm and face, due to burns and cystic acne. They wotk better than any topical lotion i have used in the past and will continue use these, as they really do work, but you must use them dilligently.</li>
    <li> Not enough patches to do much of anything...saw no difference and you absolutely cannot reuse these.</li>
