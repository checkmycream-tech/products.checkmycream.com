    <li> Excellent, arrived on time</li>
    <li> this was a good price and the equipment works nice. looks nice and everything is there to get started right.</li>
    <li> Great kit for beginners. I got mine along with practice skins just to practice and it&#x27;s perfect I suggest you buy more black ink though</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware, the items I received where damaged and illegal products, the Sterilized needles where not Sterilized (according to the package), the gloves full of rips and tears (looked like Swiss cheese), the power box was and is so scratched and dented and rusted it dose not work. This kit is not worth the money it is junk and apparently used. It is an unsafe kit. I recommend looking into another kit.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. ITS GREAT WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. GOT GOOD PRODUCT FOR CHEAP. DEFFENTLY GOT MONEYS WORTH AND THEN SOME</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t not arrive when was suppose to. The power supply started losing power. I suggest getting something else. Will be returning this...</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Received the wrong product</li>
    <li> I was missing half the order I would not order this kit</li>
    <li> Great starter package. Awesome job with dilivery and exactly what I paid for. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love the equipment! !!! The only thing was the instructional dvd did not play in my dvd player or xbox or play station so I couldn&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> Machine cuts out a lot, and the DVD that came with the kit does not play at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money! Everything this came with sucks!!!  Took for ever to receive and when I got it it worked Maybe for a hour and other does not even Come with the right foot peddle!!! it came with a  really small foot peddle so small I could fit one toe on it .. took it to a tattoo shop to see if they can make it for me and they laughed and say sorry but you got ripped off..I contacted and asked for a refund and I&#x27;ll send everything back.they told me there&#x27;s no proof I bought it from them and they can no help me!!! Don&#x27;t get ripped off like I Did!!! go else Where!!!! hope this helps everyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great kit for starters  but the power supply sucks I blew out mine&#x27;s today and I just received  my kit today less than 30 mins. ago</li>
    <li> Needles are extremely dull, barely break skin and ink doesnt set well at all. The machines and the power supply are great, but accessories suck.</li>
    <li> Tatto machines r ok but the ink was expired can&#x27;t use the ink</li>
    <li> This is a decent little kit! The power source is appealing to the eye and hasn&#x27;t over heated on me. The machines didn&#x27;t need any fine tuning just readjusting and they run damn good. A couple of the inks suck and the needle variety isnt great but i gave it 5*. All in all, I&#x27;m glad I picked this one out of all the options on amazon. It&#x27;s a good platform to build off of.</li>
    <li> the guns work good the power supply gets hot it needed vents in it the ink didnt want to take real good but it did ok all in all it was an ok product</li>
    <li> Well i dident get the gun in the pitcher an got the rong power sapply but thay were good an sent me a good power sapply all in all its an ok set but one thing i dident like were the inks so make shere u get some beter ink if your gona get this packeg ....</li>
