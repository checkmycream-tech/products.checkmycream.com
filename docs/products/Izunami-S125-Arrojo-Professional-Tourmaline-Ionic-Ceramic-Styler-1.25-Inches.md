      <li>AND IT SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE TOP IRONS.</li>

      <li>(healthy looking).  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>

      <li>I love this iron.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>The best flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Best flat iron iIhave ever used.</li>
      <li>It heats up very quickly and heats evenly on both sides.</li>
      <li>My hair has NEVER been so easy to style.  </li>
      <li>its easy to use, style lasts longer, there is no auto shut off</li>
      <li>and it also has a swivel cord end for easy usage.</li>
      <li>Right before this iron, I actually had the Croc, which I thought was the best until it broke</li>
      <li>The ceramic plates are very nice for not pulling and the rolled edges are a major plus because square edges will leave a square edge in your hair.</li>
      <li>So smooth, heats up very quick.</li>
      <li>I love the quick heat up time and the fact that it glides through my hair without pulling or tugging.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to flat irons, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>totally worth the money, works great and is very light weight, love the different heat settings and the fact that it stays hot!</li>
      <li>It straightens my hair and makes it smooth &amp; shiny</li>
      <li>, that is no problem for such great results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and  it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull on your hair, or burn your hair.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and it glides through the hair so smoothly</li>
      <li>AND I THINK ITS WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
      <li>It is usually priced upwards of $150 so this price if excellent.</li>
      <li>I also love how it&#x27;s designed so that you can get really close to your scalp without burning yourself.  </li>
      <li>It has a cool tip</li>
      <li>This is a really good flat iron.</li>
      <li>By far the best flat iron/styler I have ever used at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>and it left me searching for the next best thing, when I found this one through my hair stylist.</li>
      <li>This is a excellent flat iron, Especially for kinky hair.</li>
      <li>Use Argan oil on your hair first, then straighten and you will have smooth, sleek results.</li>
      <li>Would totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a great quality flat iron :))</li>
      <li>it came quickly, and had a safe and beautiful box, it works like a dream, heats up fast then gives a  little beep to let you know it ready.</li>
      <li>From the Hot Tools wide plate, to the Chi, the Paul Brown iron and all the irons at the kiosks, this by far is the best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, not dried out, and most importantly, STRAIGHT!</li>
      <li>The iron is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
      <li>The iron gets super hot in seconds, and you can adjust the temperature.</li>
      <li>I just guesstimate starting from end to end, and measuring equal distances (I like equations lol).</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair with a nice healthy sheen/shine and gets my thick hair very straight</li>
      <li>It gets hot super fast.</li>
      <li>very soft shiny and NO FRIZZ!&lt;br /&gt;Totally Recommend!!!</li>
      <li>I have had many different irons and nothing compares.</li>
      <li>it get hot</li>
      <li>Pretty too.</li>
      <li>so I could do the bottom layers first</li>
      <li>This one really does wonders!</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron &amp; won&#x27;t leave home without it.  </li>
      <li>Izunami Arrojo flat iron does everything it claims and more.  </li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Love this flat iron and how it works like a charm.</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with this flat iron and think it is nicer than some that the stylists use at the salon I go to.</li>
      <li>IT MADE IT SO PERFECT AND LAST FOR AT LEAST 2 TO 3 DAYS</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t heat up as fast as my Kyoseki irons, but it still is pretty rapid.</li>
      <li>Love this flat iron!!!!</li>
      <li>I have owned three other flat irons from well-known brands and I&#x27;ve never been happy with any of them.  </li>
      <li>I actually like this flat iron better than the original Izunami ITC450.</li>
      <li>and I liked it so much that I found one online and bought it for WAY less than he was selling it for.  </li>
      <li>I can NOT blow-dry my hair straight (unless I use oil and take it inch by inch).</li>
      <li>My hair stays straight and shiny all day, a feat for chemically treated hair in high humidity Hawaii!</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and it can be used to straightening or curling hair.</li>
      <li>AND I HAVE VERY WAVY HAIR</li>
      <li>, MY CUSTOMERS ARE REALLY UPSET WITH THE PRODUCT AND WANT A GUARANTEE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to really work at this.</li>
      <li>I have always had problems with straighteners, but find this one, keeps my hair straight even on a rainy day.  </li>
      <li>So much cheaper than anywhere else</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s too much heat.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the desired result</li>
      <li>She highly recommended it and even told me to order it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so be sure to grab it by the little tip handles</li>
      <li>I tried them for the 1st time last night, and they get HOT!</li>
      <li>hair will feel soft, look shiny and be absolutely straight.</li>
      <li>Love my flat iron, this is the flat iron my hairdresser uses and she recommended it.</li>
      <li>And, because $200+ is ridiculous to spend on a hair appliance, buying it on Amazin for less than half the original price was perfect.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> best straightener i ever had</li>
    <li> This is a fairly decent flat iron. It leaves my hair with a nice healthy sheen/shine and gets my thick hair very straight&lt;br /&gt; (with multiple passes however). I actually like this flat iron better than the original Izunami ITC450. Another pro is the clear hard plastic case it comes with for when you&#x27;re on the go right after flat ironing your hair.</li>
    <li> The stylists at the salon I go to raved about this iron.  The iron is nothing short of amazing.  It is lightweight and it glides through the hair so smoothly it feels like nothing.  The edges are curved so you can also do curls with the iron.  My hair stays straight and shiny all day, a feat for chemically treated hair in high humidity Hawaii!</li>
    <li> This is a excellent flat iron, Especially for kinky hair. It&#x27;s smooth and  it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull on your hair, or burn your hair. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the 450 Temperature. I think that&#x27;s too much heat.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve used. It makes your hair look healthier. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since using this iron.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product.  When I saw how great my hair looked I asked about the flatiron and he told me to get it on Amazon.com. It heats up in about 2 seconds. You can dial up the heat or set it to a lower temp for what your hair needs.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will feel soft, look shiny and be absolutely straight. Be careful because your hair will be very hot coming from the flat iron, that is no problem for such great results. If you don&#x27;t like it -- it may be operator error.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a good deal on this iron that my stylist uses on my hair. It is usually priced upwards of $150 so this price if excellent. This iron will leave your hair shiny and will last for days...I have had many different irons and nothing compares. The only downside is that it gets extremely hot and doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off, but that is something I can live with but just be cautious of.</li>
    <li> By far the best flat iron/styler I have ever used at a very reasonable price.  It heats up fast and it can be used to straightening or curling hair.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER AND I BOTH TRIED CHI THEN WE TRIED THE SOLIA UNTIL IT DIED ON US DIDNT EVEN LAST A YEAR AND IT SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE TOP IRONS. I PURCHASED THIS ONE AND MY DAUGHTER AND I HAVE VERY WAVY HAIR IT MADE IT SO PERFECT AND LAST FOR AT LEAST 2 TO 3 DAYS I LOVE IT AND I THINK ITS WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> My stylist gave me a short lesson in flat ironing so I bought this one based on the extra width and the end piece I could touch without burning myself. I watched a video about it that was kind of goofy but helpful. I watched some videos about flat ironing hair to see if I thought I could really do it. The ceramic plates are very nice for not pulling and the rolled edges are a major plus because square edges will leave a square edge in your hair. You can&#x27;t tell what the temperature is so I just set it on max and turn it on. It heats up very quickly and heats evenly on both sides. That is nice. In no time at all my hair is done. I use a thermal protectant before using the flat iron and recommend this to keep from damaging your hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the desired result so I don&#x27;t have to really work at this. For a rank amateur I get a really nice result with long hair. The unit appears to be solidly built. I bought some clips from Amazon to section my hair so I could do the bottom layers first and then the top layers. This works well. If you put the clips in hot hair they will leave a crimp so only put them in cold hair. Keep combing your hair because you don&#x27;t want to iron in a matted section. I am really pleased with this flat iron and think it is nicer than some that the stylists use at the salon I go to. I would definitely recommend this unit. Buy some thermal protection conditioner to use with it. Be careful around your ears. Be patient if you are just beginning. Watch some videos. This is a really good flat iron. Pretty too.</li>
    <li> Used at my salon and recomended by my stylist. Best flat iron iIhave ever used. One sweep and you are done. Heats up in seconds...do not think twice about buying this one, you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I love it. It was recommended by the stylist who cuts, colors, and straightens my hair! I bought it while I was having my hair done.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews before I bought it. I&#x27;ve owned every flat iron known to man (fhi, chi, global, ghb, Hanna, one that vibrated as u used it, one that u put a solution in and it infused your hair) they all sucked next to this iron. I have thick course heat damaged hair that this iron makes sleek I only hve to touch up the next day and with other irons it would be that I would hve to start from scratch every day. Buy it and see for yourself! I love it</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron!!!! :) does not burn hair one bit!! I was using other straighteners and they would damage my hair. This one really does wonders!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended that I buy this one and it&#x27;s absolutely awesome.  It&#x27;s better than the chi brand that i used to have.</li>
    <li> I BOUGTH THESE FLAT IRON LAST MONTH, AND PRESENT PROBLEMS WITH THE MATERIALS, ON THE TOP OF THE FLAT HAS  A DAMAGED ON THE COVERING, I DONT KNOW IF IS ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE OR THE PRODUCT  BUT APPEARS A BREAK ON THE TOP, MY CUSTOMERS ARE REALLY UPSET WITH THE PRODUCT AND WANT A GUARANTEE.&lt;br /&gt;I LIVE IN BOGOTA COLOMBIA SO PLEASE I NEED URGENT A SOLUTION FOR MY CUSTOMERS.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron from September 2012. Love this flat iron and how it works like a charm. its easy to use, style lasts longer, there is no auto shut off so you know there&#x27;s no need for waiting to reheat to style. It can curl, straighten, flip and does everything. Its great all around. Nothing chips or fades so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a straightener that I LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been one to buy straighteners at the drugstore.  Which, of course, means I&#x27;ve gone through many, many straighteners.  The last time I had a blowout, my stylist used this.  There was no pulling or tugging - it effortlessly straightened my hair.  She highly recommended it and even told me to order it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just in case you think it only works in a trained hairdresser&#x27;s hands...I used it the morning after I got it (and every morning since) and it&#x27;s the easiest time I&#x27;ve ever had straightening my hair.  It&#x27;s smooth, not dried out, and most importantly, STRAIGHT!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I have curly Puerto Rican hair  all I have to do is wash blow or air dry and use the straightener. My hair looks FABULOUS!  I did a kerotin treatment 2 years ago and after I use the straightener my hair looks like I just had it done, very soft shiny and NO FRIZZ!&lt;br /&gt;Totally Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love my flat iron, this is the flat iron my hairdresser uses and she recommended it. I decided to buy it and give it a try, very happy with my purchase, totally worth the money, works great and is very light weight, love the different heat settings and the fact that it stays hot! Would totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a great quality flat iron :))</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair stylist has one and has used it on my hair several times. I love the quick heat up time and the fact that it glides through my hair without pulling or tugging. It has a cool tip so you can touch the end and it also has a swivel cord end for easy usage. They are $160.00 and more retail but I got mine for 80 bucks. Great investment. I expect it to be the last hot iron I ever buy.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  My hair stylist has one and I liked it so much that I found one online and bought it for WAY less than he was selling it for.  I have owned three other flat irons from well-known brands and I&#x27;ve never been happy with any of them.  They NEVER straightened, flattened or smoothed the way this product does.&lt;br /&gt;The Izunami Arrojo flat iron does everything it claims and more.  And, it truly does have even heating ALL the way through.  I also love how it&#x27;s designed so that you can get really close to your scalp without burning yourself.  It&#x27;s very comfortable to use and it glides right through my thick coarse hair.  This is a high quality flat iron and is VERY well made.  I KNOW this will be last for years and years.  My hair has NEVER been so easy to style.  I wish I would have known about this flat iron a long time ago.  I get compliments all the time about how shiny and healthy my hair is.  Everyone who flat irons their hair NEEDS this one.  You won&#x27;t be sorry and you&#x27;ll have the best hair days of your life. This is truly a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; flat iron and you&#x27;ll have the smoothest hair you&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I almost purchased this EXACT flat iron at the Douglas Trade Show for $195 (wholesalers price).  I found it on Amazon for way less.  I love this flat iron &amp; won&#x27;t leave home without it.  It straightens my hair and makes it smooth &amp; shiny (healthy looking).  It also beautifly curls hair and gives my hair life &amp; bounce!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU...THANK YOU...THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I sold all my other flat irons as soon as I got my Izunami S125</li>
    <li> Used a Chi for years and my hair stylist turned me on to this one.  I love it!  So smooth, heats up very quick.</li>
    <li> I love this iron. It gets hot super fast. I have thick wavy hair and it straightens it in one or two quick swipes. Stays straight for the whole day, even the next day if I don&#x27;t wash it. Use Argan oil on your hair first, then straighten and you will have smooth, sleek results. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my hair stylist (who works at Arrojo) and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have thick, naturally curly hair and I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to flat irons, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve used. The wrap around metal plates make such a difference. And, because $200+ is ridiculous to spend on a hair appliance, buying it on Amazin for less than half the original price was perfect.</li>
    <li> As a strong supporter of flat hair, I&#x27;ve tried every flat iron out there. From the Hot Tools wide plate, to the Chi, the Paul Brown iron and all the irons at the kiosks, this by far is the best. Right before this iron, I actually had the Croc, which I thought was the best until it broke and it left me searching for the next best thing, when I found this one through my hair stylist. The iron gets super hot in seconds, and you can adjust the temperature. I have super thick hair and was able to cut down the time required to straighten my hair. And it doesn&#x27;t rip or pull my hair, which others did. I don&#x27;t have to go through the same strand repeatedly with this iron. It&#x27;s very easy to use and you just must get it.</li>
    <li> So my Kyoseki flat irons finally died on me after 3 yrs (1st pair died after 1 yr!), and I needed something QUICK! I almost bought a $50 Remington, but being unfamiliar with them I fenced it a while, then I found this! I found this one a year ago for $250, so it was definitely on my wish list a long time. I read poor reviews about their customer service, however, I am assuming that Amazon shall do the job if these fail miserably. I tried them for the 1st time last night, and they get HOT! The tip truly does stay cool (not even warm!). I have to get used to the wider plates, but I have quite long hair, so it cuts styling time down. They don&#x27;t heat up as fast as my Kyoseki irons, but it still is pretty rapid. I do not like, though, how it is hard to tell what temp I have it set on, as there is no clear marker for temp. I just guesstimate starting from end to end, and measuring equal distances (I like equations lol). Overall, my first use went well. I&#x27;m not in love yet, but hopefully in 3 years (or more!) I will be looking for another Arrojo and not something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE ON MY HAIR TYPE: I&#x27;m of several races, and my hair type is hard to put a finger on. It&#x27;s thick, yes. Naturally curly. I can NOT blow-dry my hair straight (unless I use oil and take it inch by inch).</li>
    <li> This flat iron, heats up incredibily fast and makes your hair like silk when used.  I have always had problems with straighteners, but find this one, keeps my hair straight even on a rainy day.  So much cheaper than anywhere else I found.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> it came quickly, and had a safe and beautiful box, it works like a dream, heats up fast then gives a  little beep to let you know it ready. It get up to 450 degrees! it get hot so be careful because for curling all sideas of it are hot so be sure to grab it by the little tip handles I would recommend this to everyone</li>
