### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with purchase.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a great bargain!</li>
      <li>For best results: Use a blowdryer on this for about 15 to 20 seconds.</li>
      <li>i used some that i had on hand and the curler works GREAT!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had my eyelashes look this great!</li>
      <li>Very impressed with this curler as it grabs almost all my lashes without pinching.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>so the quality is great.  </li>
      <li>This curls your lashes great, I&#x27;ve had no problems.  </li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>This was AMAZING!</li>
      <li>This one did not work so good for me.  </li>
      <li>I figured since it was a Tweezerman it would be good.</li>
      <li>and I love these!</li>
      <li>Love this one!</li>
      <li>I thought that this would be a perfect eyelash curler since I have large eyes and wanted to curl ALL lashes.  </li>
      <li>and it is super good quality for the price!</li>
      <li>I am not so thrilled with this eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>The pad is silicone which is nice, since I have a latex allergy ruling out any rubber</li>
      <li>It warms up nicely with a hair dryer and doesn&#x27;t burn you like a metal one can.  </li>
      <li>I love using this curler with a blow dryer with no mascara</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I love this one.  </li>
      <li>(Even at 66)  : )</li>
      <li>I love how it curls and it doesn&#x27;t pinch the side of my eyes.</li>
      <li>I love the way it curls my eyelashes (coming from a strait lash girl)</li>
      <li>You have to get used to not being able to see your curling eyelash.</li>
      <li>: It&#x27;s cheaply made and pinches and ripe out eyelashes!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my buy.&lt;br /&gt;Made of plastic.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>love that the pad is made of heat resistant silicone.</li>
      <li>not pinch my eyes when I curl them :)</li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;m mostly happy with it, but I think next time I&#x27;ll look for a cage-style curler that has this kind of stopper/pad.</li>
      <li>I love the cage free design...and it comes with four pads...</li>
      <li>Easy to use, and worked well.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Would anyone be able to sell a hair curler that really inserted acute angles into your hair instead and called them \\&quot;curls\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as strong as metal curlers - bulkier, too.  </li>
      <li>The classic designs are more popular for a reason.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a fine curler, just not \\&quot;the</li>
      <li>This curler means it when it say super curl!</li>
      <li>It took a little time to get used to it, but once I did, it worked great!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light.  </li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s Tweezerman brand, I should be ablt to more easily buy replacement pads and not have to buy the whole curler</li>
      <li>It gives a very natural curl when warm.  </li>
      <li>top part of the curler could be a bit longer to really get at the lashes in the corners.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it because I can heat it gently using my blowdryer</li>
      <li>and i get a super nice natural look.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Tweezerman Super Eyelash Curler for about 8+ years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sooo good, even my 15 yo daughter picky for all beauty things uses it instead of hers much more expensive eyelash curler. :-)</li>
      <li>While it still could use tweaking, it is by far a better product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, it comes with three replacement pads in a nice stoppered vial, for a total of four given.</li>
      <li>It leaves the right amount of curl in your lashes without crimping or breaking off your lashes.  </li>
      <li>the only thing that could be improved is that the plastic - the material is not durable and breaks after a long while ( still ok, but there is room to improve) but i absolutely love how it grips and curls!</li>
      <li>After I find my lashes, it curls pretty well BEFORE mascara application.</li>
      <li>The Revolution when it first came out</li>
      <li>My daughter ordered this eyelash curler for herself and after trying to use it many different ways, discovered that it doesn&#x27;t work at all!  </li>
      <li>This accomplishes two things: it allows you to gently heat it for a better, longer lasting curl, as well as making allergies to latex a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>do i am really disapointed for the first time with a tweezerman product...</li>
      <li>eyelash curler is fine, but doesn&#x27;t defy the crimping standard as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>like it more if it weren&#x27;t so wide</li>
      <li>I really like this eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>I really like this eyelash curler better than any other I have used.  </li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite curler, as opposed to the other standard curlers it actually grips every lash especially toward the outer corner and curls them nicely!</li>
      <li>Comes with 2 new changers for the white soft foamy part that pushes together with the top plastic portion of the curler.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>- I tend to have trouble fitting large eyelash curlers up to my eye - the half width ones work much better.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t care if I have to buy a new one every 3 months...</li>
      <li>Definitely not getting a \\&quot;super curl.\\</li>
      <li>Due to my stigmatisem and near sight when I use most any eye lash curler I pinch my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>Well I&#x27;ve tried using this one several times and each time it pulls out whole sections of eyelashes!!</li>
      <li>(and yes, I did change to a new one</li>
      <li>so I thought i would try something new.</li>
      <li>The concept is ridiculous to me, even more so considering how long they haven&#x27;t changed against the progress made in the beauty industry.&lt;br /&gt;Enter cage free eyelash</li>
      <li>And they stay curled as long as I use a mascara formula that leans more towards the dry consistency.</li>
      <li>much much better than other regular curlers.</li>
      <li>I have very light eyelashes that are hard to see, and this curler enhances my lashes.</li>
      <li>Its harder to use than the average metal curler, but if you can get it on your lashes straight, it does curl them ok.</li>
      <li>Super bummed they didn&#x27;t last because actually did curl my lashes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m perfectly fine replacing the curler ever few months since it works so well.</li>
      <li>Also, the way the top is attached, the thick bar at the top gets in the way of the eyelashes so the ones in the middle press up against it and are bent a little forward.</li>
      <li>I need an eyelash curler that&#x27;s wide enough to fit my lashes</li>
      <li>there was a minuscule curl from my natural lashes--i would not recommend--- and  </li>
      <li>my eyelid as it was with the old style.</li>
      <li>so it wasn&#x27;t just that it was too old).</li>
      <li>I got this to replace an old metal eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>Tweezerman Super Curl is made of plastic, making it lighter and less unwieldy to use.</li>
      <li>buy, especially if you are allergic to metal / have sensitive eyes like my eyes</li>
      <li>This curler lasted two months exactly before the upper plastic arm broke off as i was clamping down on my eyelash.</li>
      <li>My lashes are too long for this curler and get crimped on the ends, hard to see, easy to miss some lashes.</li>
      <li>Curler is very bulky and blocks my view to my lashes (I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have Asian eyes, though I have not had this problem with any other curlers.</li>

<li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
<li> Dont loose your lashes or pull them out with those metal curlers</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a complete fan of Tweezerman, but these eyelash curlers are completely horrible! It&#x27;s nearly impossible to place them in a position on your eyelid to use.  Absolutely horrible!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this curler as it grabs almost all my lashes without pinching. A little hard to see by the angle, how much lashes I&#x27;m grabbing,  but it does the job of getting even my corner lashes.</li>
    <li> I seem to loose an eyelash or two when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler hoping it wouldn&#x27;t crimp my eyelashes - it&#x27;s beyond me why eyelash curlers almost universally seem to be crimpers.  Would anyone be able to sell a hair curler that really inserted acute angles into your hair instead and called them \\&quot;curls\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler is fine, but doesn&#x27;t defy the crimping standard as I had hoped.  the plastic bit narrows to a a fairly sharp edge.  The pad is silicone which is nice, since I have a latex allergy ruling out any rubber pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a fine curler, just not \\&quot;the curler\\&quot; I had hoped it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like it more if it weren&#x27;t so wide - I tend to have trouble fitting large eyelash curlers up to my eye - the half width ones work much better.</li>
    <li> I am not so thrilled with this eyelash curler. Its harder to use than the average metal curler, but if you can get it on your lashes straight, it does curl them ok. I would not recommend this to any one though, try another product.</li>
    <li> I have incessant contact dermatitis from an endless array of makeup and accessories, including nickel. Nickel is in traditional metal eyelash curlers. This one solves several problems at once. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> there was a minuscule curl from my natural lashes--i would not recommend--- and  i bought 2 of them! i&#x27;ll be donating the other one-</li>
    <li> This curls your lashes great, I&#x27;ve had no problems.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great bargain!</li>
    <li> I purchased these after I noticed that my previous curler had actually broken off some of my eyelashes. The previous one was a traditional cage-style curler. This one takes a bit of getting used to if you usually use that kind - it was hard for me to get close enough to the base of the lashes for a while. I think I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it now, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this curler and I like that the stopper is not that rubbery material - I think that material is what made my eyelashes break off before when they got stuck to it (and yes, I did change to a new one so it wasn&#x27;t just that it was too old). I also like that because it&#x27;s Tweezerman brand, I should be ablt to more easily buy replacement pads and not have to buy the whole curler again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, it is still kind of hard for me to get as close to the base of the lash/my eyelid as it was with the old style. I&#x27;m getting used to it still (have had this for a couple months). That said, it does curl my lashes, but it&#x27;s not as dramatic a curl - probably because I&#x27;m just not getting the right spot. Definitely not getting a \\&quot;super curl.\\&quot; I&#x27;m mostly happy with it, but I think next time I&#x27;ll look for a cage-style curler that has this kind of stopper/pad.</li>
    <li> Save your money, this is not a good buy.</li>
    <li> Due to my stigmatisem and near sight when I use most any eye lash curler I pinch my eyelid.  This has an attached plastic guard that you put the curler on the lash and rest the guard on the eyelid then curl.  I get the lash root and not the eyelid.</li>
    <li> It warms up nicely with a hair dryer and doesn&#x27;t burn you like a metal one can.  It gives a very natural curl when warm.  Caution: don&#x27;t pinch too hard or the plastic will crack (I learned that the hard way).</li>
    <li> The structure of this curler makes it difficult to see if you&#x27;re getting all your lashes in the right spot.  The F shape of the clamps is really clumsy and difficult to manipulate.  It also still crimps the eyelashes, something I was hoping to avoid.  Also, the way the top is attached, the thick bar at the top gets in the way of the eyelashes so the ones in the middle press up against it and are bent a little forward. The classic designs are more popular for a reason.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this nifty, new looking thing... it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite curler, as opposed to the other standard curlers it actually grips every lash especially toward the outer corner and curls them nicely! the only thing that could be improved is that the plastic - the material is not durable and breaks after a long while ( still ok, but there is room to improve) but i absolutely love how it grips and curls! much much better than other regular curlers. And i have invested enough in those things, i have a lancome curler, mac, chanel… they are just not doing it like tweezermans curler!</li>
    <li> I have used lots of eyelash curlers in the past and this type far surpasses any of them. It leaves the right amount of curl in your lashes without crimping or breaking off your lashes.  All you do is heat the curler with your blow dryer for a few seconds and then hold to your eyelashes. My lashes stay curled all day. These lash curlers do not last forever so buy two at a time and replace when you&#x27;re on the last one.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s made of a soft plastic that will break quickly if squeezed too hard or the heat weakens the plastic... but they have tried making them with a harder plastic and for some reason, those have not performed as well.  I really don&#x27;t care if I have to buy a new one every 3 months... they&#x27;re inexpensive and I hope Tweezerman never discontinues making them.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler better than any other I have used.  I have very light eyelashes that are hard to see, and this curler enhances my lashes.</li>
    <li> I love how it curls and it doesn&#x27;t pinch the side of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love using this curler with a blow dryer with no mascara and i get a super nice natural look.  (Even at 66)  : )</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler. It works great and I have not experienced the pinching some of the reviews mentioned.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sooo good, even my 15 yo daughter picky for all beauty things uses it instead of hers much more expensive eyelash curler. :-)</li>
    <li> The pluses about this product are that you can customize the curl and the cagefree aspect lets you get close to the base of the eyelash without pinching. The minuses are the annoying rubber constantly coming off and the awkwardness of application. You have to get used to not being able to see your curling eyelash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used eyelash curlers with metal handles so I thought i would try something new. This curler lasted two months exactly before the upper plastic arm broke off as i was clamping down on my eyelash. Super bummed they didn&#x27;t last because actually did curl my lashes.</li>
    <li> This one did not work so good for me.  Maybe for those with longer lashes, but not for my short ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have big eyes and can&#x27;t ever find an eyelash curler that works for my eyes. Well I&#x27;ve tried using this one several times and each time it pulls out whole sections of eyelashes!! The #1:complaint I have is it doesn&#x27;t open wide enough to even get all your eyelashes in it! 2: It&#x27;s cheaply made and pinches and ripe out eyelashes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my buy.&lt;br /&gt;Made of plastic. Comes with 2 new changers for the white soft foamy part that pushes together with the top plastic portion of the curler.&lt;br /&gt;Does not pinch my eyes when I curl them :)&lt;br /&gt;Good buy, especially if you are allergic to metal / have sensitive eyes like my eyes</li>
    <li> I have long lashes and a lot of them.  I need an eyelash curler that&#x27;s wide enough to fit my lashes and I thought because this was open at the ends it would do that.  However, the part that does the curling still isn&#x27;t long enough so I don&#x27;t really see what the benefit of this curler is, other than just being a little awkward.  Someone mentioned is helped them because they had an astigmatism.  Maybe it&#x27;s for that.</li>
    <li> Of all the eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve used this is the one I continue to purchase. I&#x27;ve been using the Tweezerman Super Eyelash Curler for about 8+ years. I absolutely love it because I can heat it gently using my blowdryer and it curls my lashes like nobody&#x27;s business! And they stay curled as long as I use a mascara formula that leans more towards the dry consistency. Due to the heat, the plastic eventually breaks down and it will snap but it&#x27;s usually after about 2-3 months. I&#x27;m perfectly fine replacing the curler ever few months since it works so well. I look at it like it&#x27;s mascara which you also usually replace every couple of months.</li>
    <li> This was AMAZING! I love the way it curls my eyelashes (coming from a strait lash girl) and it is super good quality for the price! 10000% recommend this product</li>
    <li> My lashes are too long for this curler and get crimped on the ends, hard to see, easy to miss some lashes.</li>
    <li> this product is made of plastic and is not a good quality doesnt curl the lashes as the shu uemura/mac eyelash curler do i am really disapointed for the first time with a tweezerman product...</li>
    <li> I thought that this would be a perfect eyelash curler since I have large eyes and wanted to curl ALL lashes.  However, the product itself is so thick that every time I tried to use it, I either pinched my eyelid or misjudged the thickness and poked myself in the eye!  I need to return it!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an old metal eyelash curler.  I love this one.  It&#x27;s light.  It&#x27;s a Tweezerman so the quality is great.  Comes with replacement pads.  Easy to use.  Sturdy.</li>
    <li> i would not reccomend this product,especially if you already have long eyelashes. the rubber falls off and hurts your eyelashes</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail the other day and I love these! Tweezerman is my brand, they have never let me down. This curler means it when it say super curl! I&#x27;ve never had my eyelashes look this great! It worked nicley on my falsies as well. Very happy with purchase. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! It took a little time to get used to it, but once I did, it worked great!  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Not great the handle snapped. Plastic very weak. Prefer Tarte brand curler</li>
    <li> the pads that arrived with the curler would not stay in the slot. i used some that i had on hand and the curler works GREAT!!</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered this eyelash curler for herself and after trying to use it many different ways, discovered that it doesn&#x27;t work at all!  It went into the garbage.  : (</li>
    <li> Curler is very bulky and blocks my view to my lashes (I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have Asian eyes, though I have not had this problem with any other curlers. After I find my lashes, it curls pretty well BEFORE mascara application. I cannot use it AFTER mascara is applied because lashes sticks to the curler.</li>
    <li> These work well, like all Tweezerman products I have tried.  I actually curled my individual false lashed too much and now I can&#x27;t uncurl them! Easy to use, and worked well.</li>
    <li> Never pinches me and gives me that curl I cant get with just mascara and it came with a few replacement pads which is always a plus!</li>
    <li> Dont loose your lashes or pull them out with those metal curlers - Crimping your lashes is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Not as strong as metal curlers - bulkier, too.  Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the worst eyelash curler. I figured since it was a Tweezerman it would be good. Boy was I wrong. Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> I cannot stand caged eyelash curlers. The concept is ridiculous to me, even more so considering how long they haven&#x27;t changed against the progress made in the beauty industry.&lt;br /&gt;Enter cage free eyelash curlers.&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased Urban Decay The Revolution when it first came out and it was the worst waste of money ever. It fell apart withing the month, and disgusted, I pitched it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this curler and had to try it. While it still could use tweaking, it is by far a better product. Tweezerman Super Curl is made of plastic, making it lighter and less unwieldy to use. The hinge is simple, no springs to stretch or break. The part above it, where both pieces meet and rub against each other, could use a little work to reduce drag and the light sticking which accompanies this.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the pad is made of heat resistant silicone. This accomplishes two things: it allows you to gently heat it for a better, longer lasting curl, as well as making allergies to latex a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like top part of the curler could be a bit longer to really get at the lashes in the corners.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it comes with three replacement pads in a nice stoppered vial, for a total of four given.</li>
    <li> I only gave this four stars, because you have to get used to using this. I love the cage free design...and it comes with four pads...the one already inserted and three replacements! For best results: Use a blowdryer on this for about 15 to 20 seconds. Curl your lashes. Then apply mascara. After your mascara has dried, take a spoolie brush, spray some hairspray on that and go over your lashes again so that the curl will hold all day. I will never go back to a standard lash curler again! Love this one!</li>
