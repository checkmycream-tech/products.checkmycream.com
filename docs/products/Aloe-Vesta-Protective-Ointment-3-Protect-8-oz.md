<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love it.  took shower today with it</li>
    <li> This stuff really works - does the job better than other similar products.</li>
    <li> This is a barrier ointment so it&#x27;s thick and it takes a while to sink into the skin but if you have dry skin or have problems with itchy skin or eczema in the winter try this.  My hands get very dry and itchy in the winter and it&#x27;s hard to keep them constantly moisturized.  This works better than even Aquaphor does for me.  It will last through one thorough handwashing.  If you apply it after bathing it protects your skin for almost 24 hours.  I have not been able to find out if this is noncomedonegenic and since it is a barrier ointment I don&#x27;t apply it to my face, but if I can find out that it won&#x27;t clog the pores on my face I will definitely use it on my face too.  The biggest con about this is it takes time to sink into your skin, so you have to apply it when you have about half an hour to wait but if you have dry skin you should give this a try.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin and healing surgical scars!!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this for sweaty, excoriated areas</li>
    <li> The best for keeping my hands moisturized!</li>
    <li> Great product for my mom! Recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great protection for elderly family member that uses a diaper. Good Price.</li>
    <li> Awaiting, expect tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer protects your skin no matter what. I&#x27;ve used it every day for the past three years, and my skin has kept soft and in great condition. I&#x27;m outdoors quite a bit, and I don&#x27;t worry about hurting my skin because of this.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff ever use it all the time when needed  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I simply love this cream. I use it to prevent and treat my diaper rash, since I wear an adult diaper. And it does everything it proclaims to do. I even use it under my breasts and stomach, in order to treat and prevent fungus infections. This cream is a little pricey, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended because of how sensitive my skin is, and it&#x27;s works, I wish I could of bought just one but I had to buy three, wasn&#x27;t happy about that</li>
    <li> Every now and then areas on my hands get so dry that NOTHING else works... Not even Eucerine (not even with gloves). This was used on my sister in a hospital &amp; I was amazed by it.  I like the fact that it has lanolin in it--I swear it heals somehow...doesn&#x27;t just moisturize. One application on my hands alone is usually enough to stop any cracking--overnight with cotton gloves is guaranteed to get healing. The smell isn&#x27;t so great, (lanolin) but it doesn&#x27;t linger long. Thick &amp; heavy--very small amount on rough skin areas &amp; hours later (or next day) it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> excellent for skin protection</li>
    <li> I use this product for anti chafing for distance running and for my exposed skin when going out in very cold/windy conditions.  This stuff works like a charm, and is cheaper than other products.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for those who sit or lie down for extended periods of time; protects skin when wet for lengths of  time.  Great product for elderly, wheelchair or bed-bound.  Light fragrance, great texture for daily use and multiple times during the day and night.</li>
    <li> That was a quick delivery. I haven&#x27;t had my girlfriend&#x27;s nurse try it yet but I will be sure to let everyone know how it works.</li>
    <li> I am using this on my lips, hand, feet to prevent winter dryness.  I apply before bed, add gloves and sock for super soft skin.</li>
    <li> Use just a small amount and put socks on.  In the morning you won&#x27;t believe the difference.  Nurse gave me this while at the hospital.  She was right.  It protects for diaper rash type irritations also.</li>
    <li> Alleviates dry skin, burning, itching, and irritability in sensitive skin. It also serves as a healing balm for seniors with tender skin.</li>
    <li> I use this on the bum of my 88 year old father to prevent skin tears and bed sores.  It works wonders with diligent use, his bottom is like smooth like that of a new born baby .  I am so glad that I found this product for him!</li>
    <li> Thank you. It helps my dry skin. It is great.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT...RECIEVED VERY FAST..THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL HELPING TO KEEP SKIN FROM BREAKING DOWN... REALLY GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This was recommended when I was in the hospital to relieve some chaffing and it work great. Use it all the time now.</li>
    <li> I found this product among my mom&#x27;s belongings after she passed away. After years of struggle with chapped hands, spending top dollar on the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; lotions and creams, this did the trick.</li>
    <li> We use this fo my Dad and his skin looks great!! This cream really protect the skin. We order this regularly.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I care for a  disabled young man.  This ointment keeps his diaper area protected.  We apply it at every diaper change.</li>
    <li> My family has used this product for years to care for my grandmothers bedsores. It&#x27;s a good product and a great price... We will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> Great covering for fat folds and other moist places. Apply after bath and drying done. Every one should try some Aloe Vista ointment.</li>
    <li> Originally, I was sent home from the hospital with this. It works very well, but is quite thick and heavy. Works well though on very dry cracked areas on hands and elbows.</li>
    <li> This product is great to protect skin for the bed ridden. I was able to prevent bed sores and protect the skin form body fluids. A good product.</li>
    <li> I use this for an incontinance problem works better than any thing else Protects skin area very well no rashes</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff, would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> We used this cream when our mother became bedridden ---it has been fantastic---it has helped us preseserve her skin going on 3 months and her skin is in great shape.  I would highly recommend for home health care or anyone needing protective ointment</li>
    <li> Heavy duty moisture does go into skin for several minutes but really moisturizes extremely dry skin</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried many products to no avail. When I was in the hospital, they gave me this ointment and it is a miracle! I get skin irritations and my husband tried the product I brought back from the hospital for his irritation and he marveled at the swift results!&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful in all ways! Really protects and heals!</li>
    <li> My mother is elderly and suffers with diarrhea and this cream works wonders to help heal and prevent skin breakdown.  I am and a RN and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First encounter with this was in hospital.  Works wonderful so bought more for self and granddaughter who has extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My 11 year old daughter has severe eczema and this is her favorite lotion. She puts it on her face everyday and her skin is looking great and her face is really clear and smooth. I&#x27;ll keep ordering this product many times.</li>
    <li> Extremely Thick ointment with a small dispenser opening. I have to take main cap off to be able to squeeze some out</li>
    <li> Soothing and not too greasy, 3 tubes for the price is a good value purchase</li>
    <li> Great stuff...it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this on a 98 year old patient daily for about a year.  Works very well at keeping bed sores away!  This is also the best price I&#x27;ve found. The local pharmacy price varies between $18 and $22 per tube.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion recommended by our doctor and used by many nursing homes in our area. We apply it to our home care patient before putting on his Depends. Have had no problems with skin breaking down after prolonged sitting. Applied to skin rash on back, which he found soothing.</li>
    <li> Mom is in a nursing facility and this product helps protect her skin.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with your hidden skin areas this will surely help</li>
    <li> I sit on my butt 24/7..wheelchair 15 hours a day and bed 9 hours a night, and i haven&#x27;t had a skin breakdown since I started using this 3 years ago. I run out and sure enough, skin gets dry, little breakdowns. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> The product was packaged for safe and undamaged delivery.  It is a great product in use and provides the protection to the skin that other brands do not.</li>
    <li> Good ointment that protects. Have used before and liked a lot.</li>
    <li> Very good product !!!! Excellent !!!</li>
    <li> Well pacled and well packaged</li>
    <li> The combination of A&amp;D and this ointment makes a very easy to apply cream and it works well for us.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and I use Aloe Vesta on hands, arms, feet, legs, for years so I don&#x27;t flake away.</li>
    <li> Same product used in hospitals to prevent skin irritations. No perfumes or fishy odors.</li>
    <li> As a person with intensely dry skin (xerosis) accompanied by flare-ups of eczema, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this ointment. Pleasant, light smell. Yes, it is thick--it&#x27;s suppose to be, as it&#x27;s petroleum-based, as are all ointments. What I have found helps my skin condition the most: Every morning, apply Eucerin Diabetics&#x27;&#x27; Dry Skin Relief Body Creme FIRST, as it contains alpha hydroxy acids which firms skin and greatly relieves xerosis. THEN apply Aloe Vesta as a wonderful protective barrier that seals in the Eucerin so that I don&#x27;t need to re-apply it until the next day. Prior to using Aloe Vesta, this was not the case; I was using body creme at least twice a day! It is especially useful on rough hands and feet. As I was turning my father every 2 hours when he was bedridden, I used it on his hips, heels, and elbows and other bony areas to prevent decubitus ulcers. It worked very well--highly recommended!</li>
    <li> very good for dry tender skin.</li>
    <li> A review from Mrs. L-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent ointment for very dry skin that is difficult to clear up.  I should probably even say it was THE BEST ointment I have ever used.  After using this ointment for 4 or 5 days straight, the problem I had last winter with dry skin just disappeared.  It takes a little bit of time for the ointment to be absorbed. Consistent use on cry, cracked heals results in significant improvement in skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very please with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Thick &amp; protective.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Discovered this as a caregiver for my Mom. Best moisturizer ever.</li>
    <li> as described, quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Does a good job on the skin.</li>
    <li> wonderful for chaffing  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Best barrier cream available.</li>
    <li> Great use for skin protection..  Not greasy and no smel..  Will order done more if it runs low</li>
    <li> keeps my skin from peeling and helps heal small cuts</li>
    <li> Aloe Vesta truly does protect. I am totally satisfied.  This is my second order of  AVPO, but not my last, as long as the cream works on my troubled fingers.</li>
    <li> It works for incontinence rashes very well. I bought two three  packs.The price for the three pack was very good.</li>
    <li> If you need this stuff, it&#x27;s great but frankly, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the tube.  The manufacturer needs to put it in a tub or a jar.</li>
    <li> Aloe Vesta Protective is great for my family&#x27;s skin , because it absorbs, isn&#x27;t too thick, gives great results, by preventing her skin from getting bedsores.  Thank you for having a solution to her problem!</li>
    <li> I have painfully dry skin and this really works. It is thick and does take time to absorb but it lasts all day and I only have to re-apply before bed</li>
    <li> Love this product for diaper cream.  Our hospital&#x27;s NICU department used it on our peemie son&#x27;s sensitive skin &amp; we can&#x27;t find anything better.  It is smooth &amp; absorbs into his skin while protecting it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any messy residue.  We won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
    <li> This lotion has been the best thing so far to help with my chronic stasis dermatitis.  It offers the protection and keeps the skin from drying out while it is healing.</li>
    <li> I had a baby that was ill, sha had a raging diaper rash caused by antibiotics. I tried everything from the typical diaper ointments , to bag balm. She was hospitalized , aloe vesta was used, and the diaper rash was immediately better, and healed completely in two or three days.&lt;br /&gt;I always unclude a tube or two to any baby gifts I give.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff AND it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive odor.</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed, quick delivery, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best ointment to use on cracked fingers during the winter plus it is odor free and not greasy. I wash my hands frequently at work with harsh antibacterial soaps that are very drying. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of other lotions, petroleum jelly products etc.  This ointment has been a life saver for me</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply, provides almost instant relief of most irritation, and takes a small amount of the cream to be effective. We have been using the product for several years, since my wife was introduced to it while recovering from surgery in a nursing home. Unfortunately, she found a need for it as a side issue, but it has always provided relief. I usually spread a small quantity over the affected area, and gently massage it in for a minute or so. The redness starts to disappear almost at once, and usually is minimal when I&#x27;ve finished. The pain is also gone after the application. The large tubes, especially in the three pack, are inexpensive, and last a long time. We haven&#x27;t found any change in effectiveness on product that has not been opened, so reasonable storage is not an issue. Individuals may be affected differently, but in our case, pain and irritation are quickly and efficiently relieved, just as the product claims. A solid 5 star product.</li>
    <li> This product is really awesome for skin protection and healing. I trust it more than prescription products that I tried. I was much more successful using this.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review on an earlier purchase of this product.  I simply want to briefly confirm what I said in the first review--it absolutely lives up to its claims of protection for the skin.</li>
    <li> Great protective ointment for my mom who is bed ridden.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is very good at healing and clearing up any rashes.</li>
    <li> This product works so well on skin burns in peri area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to fragrance and this item does the job! Very thick and doesn&#x27;t go on greasy. Just right for the protection needed. I always use this product in the dry winter months. Keeps my skin soft and moisturized. Try it, won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> Our Nursing Aids like this product for my aging Mother</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for 4 years now and even after 2 foot surgeries, within 3 days my feet are soooo soft.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day, and just love it.  It keeps my skin from cracking during the cold winter months.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it on my elderly mother in law. We also use it on the grandkids! It gets rid of any kind of rash. Highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product  is superior for keeping the skin supple, moisturized and clear of pressure folds and breakdowns with incontinence. Great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite protective cream for my husband.  If I oversleep and he is wet most of the night, he has had no problems with his skin being affected negatively.  No more fungal infections in his groin since we began using this.  It is not white and sticky.  Instead it spreads very easily.</li>
    <li> After years of messing with zinc oxide-based products I found this ointment to be effective and less &amp;#34;invasive&amp;#34; of clothing. Furthermore it was abount 75% less in cost.</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream ever.</li>
    <li> Great creamy barrier cream. Helps prevent skin breakdown in the perineal area in bedridden people. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got my product when I was supposed to  get  and it was good.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for preventing diaper rash and other sores.</li>
    <li> GREAT PIECE AT A FABULOUS PRICE!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Only with is wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Slather on to prevent bedsores!  It&#x27;s like a miracle cream!  My aunt even puts a light application on my uncle to help sooth his dry skin.  And this seller is always spot-on.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Has helped my husband&#x27;s eczema; works well at sealing in moisture and protecting skin.  I use it on my feet and hands, before bed; sleep with a pair of socks/sport anklets on, and you&#x27;ll awake with soft feet in the morning.</li>
    <li> I use it on my feet in the wintertime with socks and it keeps my feet and heels smooth.  It&#x27;s a very heavy cream.  My friend who works in a hospital recommended it because they use it on patients that are bedridden and have bed sores.</li>
    <li> An absolute necessity in the prevention of irritation in caring for an incontinent adult.Alow Vesta also has excellent cleaning products for the skin. I have been using it for years and am very happy with it. However, I will add that whenever I do see the even the beginning of a redness in the skin , I immediately add Zinc Oxide Ointment USP which I buy in one lb tubs from Rugby. For protection from and treatment of any kind of pressure irritation or other, they are a magic formula. I learned that trick from a hospice nurse and will be forever grateful.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly as described. Pleased with all. Thank you</li>
    <li> This mixed with some Desitin is the best solve all for diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Heals personal areas nicely!</li>
    <li> great buy, great product.  will reorder again when time comes</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product in the hospital where the nurses found a rash in my groin area.  It was soothing and eliminated the rash right away.  I have been using it over the past 5 years and never been unhappy with the results.  It tends to last me for an entire week after applying a thick layer.  I hope they never change this product as I don&#x27;t know what I would do without Aloe Vesta.</li>
