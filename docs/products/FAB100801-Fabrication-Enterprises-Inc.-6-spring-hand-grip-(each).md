### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best hand gripper I have used.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent hand exerciser.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>In concept this seemed to be the best design on the market.</li>
      <li>Good product, excellent seller and shipper.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, in good condition and priced very fairly</li>
      <li>This is a great product and does wonders for toning hands, forearms, even biceps and shoulders.</li>
      <li>The concept of it is great.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISER FOR STRENGTHENING THE HANDS  </li>
      <li>and this thing will work great for years.</li>
      <li>Great product.    </li>
      <li>This grip exerciser is great because it can vary from one to six springs, it forces you to use balanced grip including all fingers, if you apply unbalanced force the handle jams which is actually a good thing.</li>
      <li>Not desinged for this kind if force!</li>
      <li>Good luck.  </li>
      <li>This is some 50 years ago and this device still is a good buy.</li>
      <li>I loved this thing when I was a kid</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it has variable resistance which makes it perfect for all ages and all levels.</li>
      <li>Good product, needs some work, but that&#x27;s what lubricant does to allow more free movement of the exerciser across friction producing</li>
      <li>I had to get a couple more.</li>
      <li>TO MAKE IT EASIER OR MORE</li>
      <li>I believe that most oils will work.</li>
      <li>I gave it a five based on functionality, handles could be better.</li>
      <li>Hopefully there&#x27;s something like it with a better design.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is much better that the standard hand squeeze exercisers because it is more effective and more challenging.</li>
      <li>This thing is great, you can even add more resistance to it once you get strong enough to do reps with all six springs.. which, will take you a while.</li>
      <li>The resistance is easy to change, the tension is even, and the device functions smoothly.</li>
      <li>I never knew they were available again until I found them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It seems that the oil got into the metal and now it works smoothly.</li>
      <li>This effectively provides resistance mainly to both thumbs.</li>
      <li>Six springs give a bit more resistance than I wanted at first</li>

      <li>B000FS5A48 Ivanko Super Gripper]] or a [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Most people will only need 2-3 springs at most.</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;d be better off going with a solid, mostly metal</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now, and it still works great.</li>
      <li>and I still do...beats any grip exerciser that I know of and the price was right...</li>
      <li>Went to the trash bin right away.</li>
      <li>Bought the green one you will find here on Amazon, great but bulky, this is smaller and better.</li>
      <li>Even with only 2 springs it can be quite challenging to do 2 sets of about 10-15 reps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another problem when I first got it was that it would get stuck or lock up somewhat as I was squeezing in and out.</li>
      <li>The steel frame and springs are very well made.</li>
      <li>I really like this design with the ability to vary the resistance.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much longer the product will hold up.  </li>
      <li>As you get stronger you can easily make it harder by adding a spring.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEMD IT</li>
      <li>The rigid guide prevents natural squeezing motion - and I have quite large hands which should help the device out.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this over all other hand exercisers.</li>
      <li>This piece of equipment is tempting, but is ultimately doesn&#x27;t work quite right.</li>
      <li>The handles are made out of wood, so far, no problems, recommendation to the manufacturer; use rubber instead.</li>
      <li>So not really even worth one star.</li>
      <li>Right hand - starting up on rep #5 and the grip shattered in several pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Actually this new one I bought through Amazon is smoother than the old one - which I still have BTW.</li>
      <li>Because after less than a week&#x27;s use, the top grip (both are wood, btw) started to crack, sometimes slipping off its prongs or jamming the sleeve track.</li>
      <li>When I used it again about 2 hours later I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>But the grips are made of pine or similar soft wood.</li>
      <li>Be careful here not to use too much resistance.</li>
      <li>This is for serious people who want to train their hand strong.</li>
      <li>Mainly don&#x27;t get it wet</li>
      <li>The new item  is well constructed but the spacing of the grips is too long for those with smaller hands, It is about 1/2&amp;#34; longer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been looking for this product for some time. It not only strengthens your grip, but it also build the muscles in your hands. Great product.    Deacon Anthony LaTerza</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was a kid. Or rather my dad did &amp; I used it too. This is some 50 years ago and this device still is a good buy. Low tech, well made, and will probably last longer than you will with proper care. Mainly don&#x27;t get it wet so it doesn&#x27;t rust. Actually this new one I bought through Amazon is smoother than the old one - which I still have BTW. Arrived on time, in good condition and priced very fairly I feel by the vendor.</li>
    <li> This piece of equipment is tempting, but is ultimately doesn&#x27;t work quite right. The rigid guide prevents natural squeezing motion - and I have quite large hands which should help the device out. If you keep it lubed (not included) it can work in a pinch for budget strengthening. Just get a Captains of Crush - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I really like this design with the ability to vary the resistance.  Unfortunately, similar to other users, my inner handle cracked apart after less than 20 uses.  You *must* reinforce the handles, or they will likely break.  Others have suggested using electrical tape.  I&#x27;m going to use some closet, clothes rack doweling and drill holes in the end to replace my broken handle.  I think you&#x27;d be better off going with a solid, mostly metal [[ASIN:B000FS5A48 Ivanko Super Gripper]] or a [[ASIN:B000NLF93Y Vice Super Gripper]].  Good luck.  You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> I had one of these about 20 years ago but lost it when we moved. This is an excellent hand exerciser. It comes with 6 springs which is overkill in my opinion. Most people will only need 2-3 springs at most. Even with only 2 springs it can be quite challenging to do 2 sets of about 10-15 reps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor flaw is that it doesn&#x27;t exercise your thumbs when doing standard squeezes. However, I found a way to solve that problem. If you put your 2 thumbs on the bottom handle, holding it in reverse, you can squeeze both thumbs at the same time as you do reps. This effectively provides resistance mainly to both thumbs. Be careful here not to use too much resistance. Even 1 spring can give your thumbs a workout. Another problem when I first got it was that it would get stuck or lock up somewhat as I was squeezing in and out. To solve that problem I rubbed a few drops of olive oil on the metal sides. I believe that most oils will work. When I used it again about 2 hours later I was pleasantly surprised. It seems that the oil got into the metal and now it works smoothly. Since using the oil once, I&#x27;ve used this at least 6 times over the last week and it continues to work flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better that the standard hand squeeze exercisers because it is more effective and more challenging. Most importantly, it has variable resistance which makes it perfect for all ages and all levels. As you get stronger you can easily make it harder by adding a spring. I strongly recommend this over all other hand exercisers.</li>
    <li> This grip exerciser is great because it can vary from one to six springs, it forces you to use balanced grip including all fingers, if you apply unbalanced force the handle jams which is actually a good thing. I loved this thing when I was a kid and I still do...beats any grip exerciser that I know of and the price was right...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these things for years and eventually bent up the first one so badly I had to get a couple more. To understand how well this thing works along with the grip I bench press 400lbs.  On a calibrated grip test in the doctors office I pulled over 200 pound of pressure. If you put a thick lubricant such as gear lube for a manual transmission or some Molybdnum Disulfide Chassis grease  on the slides and this thing will work great for years.</li>
    <li> This item is the definition of \\&quot;poor engineering\\&quot; and \\&quot;low quality\\&quot;. The moving piece is guided on a bent sheet metal, and there is excessive amount of play + friction in the handle. Went to the trash bin right away.</li>
    <li> Ordered to replace one I had had for years; not as pictured and finger roller was loose.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had one of these several years ago, but for some reason, I lost it. I never knew they were available again until I found them on Amazon. Good product, needs some work, but that&#x27;s what lubricant does to allow more free movement of the exerciser across friction producing surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with this if you need an inexpensive hand exerciser to use around the home or office. Good product, excellent seller and shipper. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> In concept this seemed to be the best design on the market. The steel frame and springs are very well made. But the grips are made of pine or similar soft wood. Six springs give a bit more resistance than I wanted at first so I removed two of them. Left hand - 10 reps. Right hand - starting up on rep #5 and the grip shattered in several pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to visit Lowes to buy parts for proper grips that will outlast me. But come on!!! It&#x27;s not my job to build it for them. I recommend nobody buy this until the manufacturer fixes this inexcusable defect! If I can break it then you can too.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT EXERCISER FOR STRENGTHENING THE HANDS  YOU CAN ADJUST THE SPRINGS TO MAKE IT EASIER OR MORE DIFFICILT  HIGHLY RECOMMEMD IT</li>
    <li> The best hand gripper I have used. The resistance is easy to change, the tension is even, and the device functions smoothly. I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now, and it still works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and does wonders for toning hands, forearms, even biceps and shoulders. Then why only the three stars?  Because after less than a week&#x27;s use, the top grip (both are wood, btw) started to crack, sometimes slipping off its prongs or jamming the sleeve track. I&#x27;ve had to wrap electrician&#x27;s tape around it to continue use.  I don&#x27;t know how much longer the product will hold up.  Hopefully there&#x27;s something like it with a better design.</li>
    <li> The rear handle cracked and broke off the second time I used it.  The front handle rotated around every time it was pulled back and eventually enlarged to 3 times its size and then it cracked and broke off.  So not really even worth one star.</li>
    <li> This thing is great, you can even add more resistance to it once you get strong enough to do reps with all six springs.. which, will take you a while. The handles are made out of wood, so far, no problems, recommendation to the manufacturer; use rubber instead. Great product! Bought the green one you will find here on Amazon, great but bulky, this is smaller and better. I gave it a five based on functionality, handles could be better.</li>
    <li> I bought this instrument for the express purpose of strengthening my fingers and hands as I am a piano player. As I have gotten older, it become increasingly difficult to play fast pieces. I thought this would help strengthen my hands. The third time I use it, the handle broke!!! I manage to jury rig it, but it broke again two days later. I do not like to write bad reviews, but this \\&quot;Toy\\&quot; is not worth a dime! I really had high hopes for it but was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace one made by Whitely that is 20+ years old: all of the springs have broken. The new item  is well constructed but the spacing of the grips is too long for those with smaller hands, It is about 1/2&amp;#34; longer.</li>
    <li> WHILE SQUEEZING THE HANDLE THE SPRING ACTION IS NOT SMOOTH WHILE DOING THIS MOTION. THE METAL ON METAL IS VERY DIFFICULT  WHILE DOING THIS.</li>
    <li> The concept of it is great. This is for serious people who want to train their hand strong. I opened the package and immediately closed it on the hardest setting and the wooden handle broke. Not desinged for this kind if force!</li>
