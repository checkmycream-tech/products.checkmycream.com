<li> Used this now for the past month really helps</li>
<li> Being a very thrifty and frugal person, I decided to find an alternative, or at least try.</li>
<li> Have used this product for 15 yrs and several other family members have too.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
<li> do not feel anyone should start adding hormones without careful consideration</li>
<li> I also started losing hair at an alarming rate and gained weight.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I rub a small amount one to two times per day on my inner thighs or arms.  </li>
<li> It also costs about $14 less on Amazon than in the pharmacy or health food stores.</li>
<li> My husband suggested I tried to buy it on Amazon and it was half  the price.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s really reduced my PMS symptoms - no more bloating, no more exhaustion, no more cramps!!</li>
<li> I am so please that it makes me sleep well, and my body not fell heavy,....</li>
<li> My only issue is that I didn&#x27;t use Amazon, I went for a cheeper offer and it took weeks to get which was frustrating.</li>
<li> Have a difficult time getting this, so order 2 and then order again when you have 1 left.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure about this product.</li>
<li> My hair started growing back and my face is cleared although not perfect.  </li>
<li> I was having heart palpitations, excessive sweating and insomnia!  </li>
<li> Unable to return due to seller&#x27;s policies.</li>
<li> I dumped a stupid doctor who said nothing could be done about my fibroids because of my weight (his fault, for letting my estrogen get out of control) and immediately found a new doc who correctly diagnosed my ED and yanked me off the HRT.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s seems to work but the effects on me are no good.</li>
<li> No hot and cold flashes.  </li>
<li> Approximately one month ago, I forgot to use it for about 4 to 5 days and my symptoms started to return.  </li>
<li> and it was quite expensive.  </li>
<li> My husband hate when I use this, because he thinks i look like a zombie .</li>
<li> I have been horribly estrogen dominant for years (and may, in fact, have had NO progesterone all that time).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really efficient, has helped me solve problems with skin and irregular cycle.</li>
    <li> Used this now for the past month really helps</li>
    <li> Thank you. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Meets my expectations</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sold right off the bat, but using it over time has improved all symptoms of menopause. Perhaps even symptoms I didn&#x27;t notice... now I know if I skipped it. Have a difficult time getting this, so order 2 and then order again when you have 1 left. Also the pre-measured ones are great for travel and to remind you how much to use out of the tube. Mine lasted over 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this pro-gest cream for years, love it, and would not go without.  My only issue is that I didn&#x27;t use Amazon, I went for a cheeper offer and it took weeks to get which was frustrating. Learned my lesson. Next time I will order straight from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product for women pre-menopauseal or post-menopausal it really helps to makes your world a better place.</li>
    <li> Has regulated my menses for 12 years now - no more HUGE clots!  Heard about it in the book What Your Doctor Won&#x27;t Tell You about Menopause.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 15 yrs and several other family members have too.&lt;br /&gt;My sister and a friend have actually increased their bone density by using this.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth using and the money. Will keep your bones stronger.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product since reading, John Lee&#x27;s book about peri menopause.  The product has helped to easy symptoms.  Amazon offers an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is saving my life!! I have been horribly estrogen dominant for years (and may, in fact, have had NO progesterone all that time). I dumped a stupid doctor who said nothing could be done about my fibroids because of my weight (his fault, for letting my estrogen get out of control) and immediately found a new doc who correctly diagnosed my ED and yanked me off the HRT. I started getting better right away, but after a few months, I thought I should feel a LOT better than I did, so researched and discovered Emerita. I can&#x27;t say enough good about it!! I can sleep! I&#x27;m not a weeping, screaming, depressed psycho bitch! I can think and remember again! I. Am. Getting. Well. Thank you, Emerita, and THANK YOU to the late, great John Lee, M. D.!!!!! My marriage--and my life--have been saved!! :)</li>
    <li> I was dia&#x27;d with fibroids and used two a day doses of PROGESTERONE to balance estrogen dominance. BEWARE internet advice: Progesterone GROWS FIBROIDS!!!!!! I had just one fibr 5CM and after using another brand of prog one month&amp;gt; I looked 3-4 mos preg.  Look up brand new research: The abortion pill RU 486 stops body from using progesterone and all fibroids dissappeared. Be warned. This product may be good one - I dont know - I havent opened yet. I want to shrink my abdomen(fibroid) first before trying a tiny maintenance dose for bones, etc.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been taking it for years.  It helps with hot flashes, sleeping and mood.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I Have been using Pro-gest for several years. Makes a difference in my life. Even helps me sleep at night.</li>
    <li> Works great and is paraben free.</li>
    <li> My post hysterectomy sex life is better than ever thanks to this product.  No dryness.  No moodiness.  No hot and cold flashes.  Better than estrogen.  Better than the competitors  I have tried.  Absorbs easily.  One tube lasts forever.</li>
    <li> started to use it and notice i may be to young just now for it. but i can feel the effects.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Ladies I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.I use  to feel like I was walking around in a fog. Now I have a lot more energy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 months.  I rub a small amount one to two times per day on my inner thighs or arms.  My sleep is improved and i can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a night sweat!  Approximately one month ago, I forgot to use it for about 4 to 5 days and my symptoms started to return.  As soon as I re-started my symptoms vanished!!  A little goes a long way.  All I use is a pea size amount and I still have a lot left in my tube.</li>
    <li> Great product does what it says.  Seems to help with my HOT flashes and allows me to get a good night sleep!  😀</li>
    <li> Well priced. Not feeling any noticeable change yet. Using for menopausal relief.</li>
    <li> This cream is easy to use and has balanced my whole system.  I feel young again.  I am telling all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> I am not convinced that this product contains any appreciable amount of real progesterone. I have used it every night for over a year and while my sleep is slightly better with it when I had my blood levels drawn my doctor told me I have NO measurable amount of progesterone in my system.</li>
    <li> the cream is nice quality but I had an allergic reaction the first time using it and had to return. the seller was great answering my emails and making everything hassel free.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for twenty years and cannot imagine being without it.  It balances my estrogen levels.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and it does make a difference!</li>
    <li> I have repurchased this several times, definitely helps.</li>
    <li> the only thing keeping me from punching everybody in the face also helps keep my breath smelling down and my mood much better during my period as well as lighter cramps.</li>
    <li> Excellent products! I am so please that it makes me sleep well, and my body not fell heavy,.... It is a very helpful products!</li>
    <li> Had my doubts about this stuff but it&#x27;s really reduced my PMS symptoms - no more bloating, no more exhaustion, no more cramps!! I do wish it came in a dosing mechanism (like a dial syringe) because I have noticed side effects if I use too much - mainly insomnia.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS and dont have periods at all. I started using this product after having alot of issues with Birth Control. After only one month my period returned. Still not completely regular but this product definitely works!!!</li>
    <li> After years of being on estrogen after a total hysterectomy I started getting hot flashes, and for the first time in my life I started to develop cystic acne. I also started losing hair at an alarming rate and gained weight. I went to a specialist who said I had estrogen dominance. He put me on an apothecary blended hormonal cream which was costly, not to mention the cost of the office visits for the specialist. Being a very thrifty and frugal person, I decided to find an alternative, or at least try. I ordered the progesterone cream and to my surprise it was just as effective as my prescription cream. I really could tell no difference. So now I take my estrogen pill with one dose of Emerita pro-gest cream daily. My hair started growing back and my face is cleared although not perfect.  I noticed if I put the cream higher than my groin/thigh area or used this twice daily I did develop some breast tenderness.&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel anyone should start adding hormones without careful consideration and I would not have felt comfortable if the physician did not put me on it already. I am very grateful for this option. It also costs about $14 less on Amazon than in the pharmacy or health food stores.</li>
    <li> I used this product according to the directions and it caused a huge rash at the application site. Unable to return due to seller&#x27;s policies.</li>
    <li> Try and buy this fine product in a health food store and see the difference in price! It&#x27;s a great buy and even better when you have Amazon Prime you can usually always find it for free shipping!</li>
    <li> I am a postmenupausal breast cancer survivor; therefore, I have to avoid estrogen driven products. Emerita is perfect for my needs and the price is better than a supplement shop in the area. I have used Emerita for years with complete satisfaction . PBH</li>
    <li> Love, love love. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helpful so far</li>
    <li> When my doctor first prescribed this I bought it  in the stores and it was quite expensive.  My husband suggested I tried to buy it on Amazon and it was half  the price. It is the identical product and it comes within 2 to 3 days.  I&#x27;m quite satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for menopause. My friend uses it for PMS and my daughter uses it to regulate her period. No side affects noted. This is the best price found anywhere!!!!! I am never going without this cream. I stopped once for a year and paid the price. My hot flashes came back, while my labido left.</li>
    <li> Menstrual cycle under control since using this product, back to normal flow instead of extremely heavy flow with lots of pain.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I have tried so many different brand of progesterone creams and this one STOLD the show!!!  I was having heart palpitations, excessive sweating and insomnia!  Within 3 weeks the symptoms were almost non-existent!  This beat my doctor&#x27;s progesterone cream!  I am pleased with the results so far :)</li>
    <li> After taking pills and then wearing a patch for many years, I decided to try something more natural.  Bought it at Whole Foods first - very pricy - but it works.  So happy to have found it at Amazon for less and in a larger package.</li>
    <li> Items arrived promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> my daughter and I have been using it for years&lt;br /&gt;good product</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a year. Can&#x27;t really tell what it&#x27;s doing for me but have faith in it because of the clinical trials.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure about this product. Every time i use it my whole body is sore and i get really sleepy. My husband hate when I use this, because he thinks i look like a zombie . It&#x27;s seems to work but the effects on me are no good.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time</li>
