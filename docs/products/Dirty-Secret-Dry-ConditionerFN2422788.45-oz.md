### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this product is perfect for finishing the just washed look.</li>
      <li>Loving this for my ends!!</li>
      <li>Keep up the good work, Tigi!</li>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>Best quick fly away or</li>
      <li>This is a good product to reboot some shine and volume to your hair after sleeping, etc.</li>
      <li>However, when I travel I don&#x27;t pack the conditioner because Besides smelling good I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a necessity.</li>
      <li>Seems like a good product</li>
      <li>Good stuff</li>
      <li>and I loved it.</li>
      <li>Works amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
      <li>But, all in all, this product smells nice and works well.</li>
      <li>Nice and shiny ends-</li>
      <li>For the price it was nice but from now</li>
      <li>best thing Ive found so far for my curly hair in between washes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine if you need that.</li>
      <li>Not as in strong</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good or do as good a job as the cheap Suave dry conditioner.</li>
      <li>Product seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy AT ALL and leaves it feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>so dry conditioner is a great way to smooth and moisturize my hair without sticky leave ins.  </li>
      <li>This dry conditioner is great.</li>
      <li>haha :)</li>
      <li>The price was fantastic, but the shipping price was a little higher than normal (more than the product itself), but was not outrageous.</li>
      <li>and  if u have  straight think hair it makes it feel more greasy than soft.</li>
      <li>The TIGI formula worked well but was pretty smelly.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go in 5 min instead of restyling for 30!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite a bit higher in price</li>
      <li>Dry shampoo can leave your hair a little \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, and this is the perfect fix for that.</li>
      <li>It does make it soft and more manageable, but make sure you have some ventilation wherever you spray it, as it does leave a thick cloud and strong smell.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it helps me get a little more body before heat styling.</li>
      <li>I bought the product because I love the rockaholic dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Just do not use too much.</li>
      <li>but I must add that the packaging was really lacking to the point that the nozzle would not stay on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy like I expected at all, and I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I have to return back to work, and sometimes it leaves my hair a little brittle looking, but after using this it looks amazing!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this dry conditioner!!!  </li>
      <li>If you live in a city that is very humid.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>only cons about it are: price (too high), and the fact that my dry shampoo (Dove) smells about 100x  better than the TIGI does.</li>
      <li>Works really well and gives hair that extra softness when you need it.</li>
      <li>Have actually never heard of dry conditioner before, only dry shampoo, but love this brand!</li>
      <li>I bought this by accident thinking it was dry shampoo, I just didn&#x27;t read very well, but I was very surprised at the results.</li>
      <li>You just spray it from mid strand down and it leaves your hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Also has a very strong, distinctive smell that can be pretty unpleasant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used dry shampoo for years, but this is actually the first time I ever tried a dry conditioner.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried when I first went to use it, but my fears were washed away the second I sprayed this one.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair possibly shinier and definitely less frizzy, but also feeling very full of product, borderline sticky, and stiffer than usual.</li>
      <li>I much prefer other brands of dry shampoo to this &amp;#34;dry conditioner.&amp;#34;</li>

<li> I ordered this on accident thinking that it was dry shampoo, should have read closer obviously.</li>
<li> I have tried over 5 different brands of Dry Shampoo etc and have found it difficult picking the one that is just right, but this one is different being a dry-conditioner.</li>
<li> I use this with the Dry Shampoo and I like how my hair looks.</li>
<li> My hair stylist recommended this product because I have wavy dry hair.  </li>
<li> A bit of dry shampoo at the roots then this at the ends</li>
<li> My hair can get greasy on the roots, but really dry on the ends.</li>
<li> I dry shampoo</li>
<li> I thought I purchased dry shampoo.</li>
<li> This dry conditioner makes my hair look SOOOOO greasy...</li>
<li> Maybe its just because I dont use it with dry shampoo</li>
<li> Unlike Dry Shampoo it does NOT absorb oil!</li>
<li> I have very dry, wavy hair</li>
<li> It offers the same concept as a Dry Shampoo would, but does give a subtle shine and helps slick down flyaway hair.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not a clean smell like other dry conditioners.</li>
<li> though, just not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it regularly.</li>
<li> I LOVE the dirty secret shampoo and thought I would try out the conditioner.</li>
<li> I use it to give a little texture to my hair.</li>
<li> The only reason I gave it a 4-star is because it smells really bad like an old 80s</li>
<li> If you seriously need to condition your hair because it&#x27;s dry, I don&#x27;t think this is going to help.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again.</li>
<li> I use this quite a bit on my daughter&#x27;s hair too as washing it everyday drys it out!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve icky used it a couple times</li>
<li> note that this is the one for DRY hair not for DIRTY hair.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s my dirty little secret</li>
<li> I will say that the smell is not great though.</li>
<li> So, unfortunately I have had to throw another aerosol can in the waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Almost a dirty laundry smell to me.  </li>
<li> This product is horrible and smells so bad.  </li>

    <li> I bought the product because I love the rockaholic dry shampoo.  I&#x27;ve icky used it a couple times and  if u have  straight think hair it makes it feel more greasy than soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dry conditioner!!!  I use dry shampoo all the time, especially after a mid-day work out and I have to return back to work, and sometimes it leaves my hair a little brittle looking, but after using this it looks amazing!  It&#x27;s not greasy AT ALL and leaves it feeling silky and smooth.  I keep bottle at home and a spare in my gym bag.  It smells great and it&#x27;s my dirty little secret haha :)</li>
    <li> best thing Ive found so far for my curly hair in between washes.</li>
    <li> Best quick fly away or next day fixer, ever!</li>
    <li> My error. I thought I purchased dry shampoo. This is obviously not shampoo but I must add that the packaging was really lacking to the point that the nozzle would not stay on. So, unfortunately I have had to throw another aerosol can in the waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, time and ozone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dry shampoo for years, but this is actually the first time I ever tried a dry conditioner. I was a little worried when I first went to use it, but my fears were washed away the second I sprayed this one. It&#x27;s not greasy like I expected at all, and I absolutely love this stuff. Dry shampoo can leave your hair a little \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;, and this is the perfect fix for that. You just spray it from mid strand down and it leaves your hair smooth and shiny. Keep up the good work, Tigi!</li>
    <li> Loving this for my ends!! I dry shampoo my roots all the time and this product is perfect for finishing the just washed look.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good or do as good a job as the cheap Suave dry conditioner.</li>
    <li> This dry conditioner is great. Nice and shiny ends- no frizz, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily. A bit of bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons about it are: price (too high), and the fact that my dry shampoo (Dove) smells about 100x  better than the TIGI does.</li>
    <li> A bit of dry shampoo at the roots then this at the ends and I&#x27;m ready to go in 5 min instead of restyling for 30!</li>
    <li> Does what it says. I spray it on my ends  only. If you live in a city that is very humid. Like houston,it will condition your hair but it wont keep the frizz away.</li>
    <li> Have actually never heard of dry conditioner before, only dry shampoo, but love this brand! Works amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. The price was fantastic, but the shipping price was a little higher than normal (more than the product itself), but was not outrageous. Will order again!</li>
    <li> My hair can get greasy on the roots, but really dry on the ends. I use this with the Dry Shampoo and I like how my hair looks. I will say that the smell is not great though.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, wavy hair so dry conditioner is a great way to smooth and moisturize my hair without sticky leave ins.  The TIGI formula worked well but was pretty smelly.  Not as in strong but it&#x27;s not a clean smell like other dry conditioners. Almost a dirty laundry smell to me.  For the price it was nice but from now on I&#x27;ll stick with the Surge Normant brand.  It&#x27;s quite a bit higher in price but I don&#x27;t smell after!</li>
    <li> I bought this by accident thinking it was dry shampoo, I just didn&#x27;t read very well, but I was very surprised at the results. Works really well and gives hair that extra softness when you need it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product because it works as described. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it. I will purchase again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> note that this is the one for DRY hair not for DIRTY hair.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine if you need that.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work fine. I LOVE the dirty secret shampoo and thought I would try out the conditioner. However, when I travel I don&#x27;t pack the conditioner because Besides smelling good I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a necessity. Seems like a good product but I&#x27;m not sure I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product because I have wavy dry hair.  She said to use it on the day after I shampoo and every day until I wash/condition again.  It does make it soft and more manageable, but make sure you have some ventilation wherever you spray it, as it does leave a thick cloud and strong smell.  Good stuff though, just not sure if I&#x27;d purchase it regularly.</li>
    <li> This is no different than a shine spray. If you seriously need to condition your hair because it&#x27;s dry, I don&#x27;t think this is going to help. I am throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This dry conditioner makes my hair look SOOOOO greasy... Maybe its just because I dont use it with dry shampoo but I don&#x27;t like it. The only thing I do like about it is the \\&quot;grease\\&quot; sticks my flyaways to the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> Just awful! Makes hair feel heavy, look very stringy and oily... Just terrible!</li>
    <li> This product is horrible and smells so bad.  There are a ton of options this one is not one of them I would never pruchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have tried over 5 different brands of Dry Shampoo etc and have found it difficult picking the one that is just right, but this one is different being a dry-conditioner. It offers the same concept as a Dry Shampoo would, but does give a subtle shine and helps slick down flyaway hair. I use this quite a bit on my daughter&#x27;s hair too as washing it everyday drys it out! This is a good product to reboot some shine and volume to your hair after sleeping, etc. Unlike Dry Shampoo it does NOT absorb oil! The only reason I gave it a 4-star is because it smells really bad like an old 80s Aqua Net smell! Nasty!! I would have preferred something else of course had I known it smelt like that in advance.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a can several months back and I loved it. I use it to give a little texture to my hair. I have fine hair and it helps me get a little more body before heat styling. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair possibly shinier and definitely less frizzy, but also feeling very full of product, borderline sticky, and stiffer than usual. Also has a very strong, distinctive smell that can be pretty unpleasant. I much prefer other brands of dry shampoo to this &amp;#34;dry conditioner.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered this on accident thinking that it was dry shampoo, should have read closer obviously. But, all in all, this product smells nice and works well. Just do not use too much.</li>
