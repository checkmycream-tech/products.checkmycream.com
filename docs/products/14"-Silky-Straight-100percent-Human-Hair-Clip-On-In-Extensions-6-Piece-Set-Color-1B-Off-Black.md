      <li>Compared to the $200 extensions I saw when I went into a Sally store, I think these are a GREAT buy.</li>
      <li>I LOVE Amazon!!</li>
      <li>I had to color them to match my hair (which was no problem) and they took color very nicely.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ll buy more soon :D</li>
      <li>Mine was perfect and am able to use again and again.</li>

      <li>They can be clipped on easily and look very nice.  </li>
      <li>Once again its amazing</li>
      <li>I kind of see it as a get what you pay for kind of thing</li>
      <li>I wish I had nice things to say about this..</li>
      <li>They are very easy to put in.</li>
      <li>i suggest you either make your own extensions or buy something more filling to your hair type.</li>
      <li>The hair was very fine and the amount of extensions were lacking.</li>
      <li>the length was perfect for me because I like a more natural look.</li>
      <li>and I am pleased</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall these were pretty awesome and did exactly what I needed them to do.</li>
      <li>I love these hair ext.  </li>
      <li>Its mostly about 9 inches, with maybe 15-20% of hairs between 8-14 inches (it starts tapering around mid-length, so that if you were to even out the length it would be 9 inches at the most, probably even 8).  </li>
      <li>I love this hair.</li>
      <li>I love the hair</li>
      <li>so my hair would look more believable.</li>
      <li>this review helps :).</li>
      <li>They can become stressfull to the hair if you dont make sure that you make a secure part!</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m sure no one will notice.</li>
      <li>But, I love them nonetheless.</li>
      <li>I love it already</li>
      <li>so I think that once I get a touch up, they will blend in even better.</li>
      <li>Having these clip-ins helps them to transition to more permanent hair extensions options because they are already accustomed to the care and maintenance required.</li>
      <li>to all my AA women go for it its way better than a sew in or glue and wigs..</li>
      <li>the quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t  as great as what i had first ordered the clips weren&#x27;t as strong .</li>
      <li>Hair is easy to curl and also easy to apply!</li>
      <li>beautiful , soft and easy to use.</li>
      <li>They are usuable for a Good Couple of month if you keep them Clean and Fresh</li>
      <li>The price cannot be beat if that is what is most important to you.</li>
      <li>My first time going for extensions and not too pricey for how good they sound.</li>
      <li>It looks natural and feels great.</li>
      <li>They may not be good for someone who&#x27;s going for thicker hair or wants the finest extensions around</li>
      <li>The extensions arrived right when promised!!</li>
      <li>Thanks!!! :)</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I wanted to try clip ins for the first time, and I must say that I am OVERLY pleased!</li>
      <li>They are easy to wash, curl, straighten, etc.</li>
      <li>to be honest these are my first clip in extensions</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s naturally beautiful Human Hair.</li>
      <li>In the end my daughter will buy a cheap bottle of dye to make it darker and cover the grays and sew in the wig clips.</li>
      <li>(although the price is cheap)</li>
      <li>but sometimes you get what you pay for,if you just want some cheap hair,it will do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>I kept these on for a full day and they held up quite well.</li>
      <li>I like how many pieces you get, and the clips that are put on it work really well.</li>
      <li>and these are much softer and better quality.</li>
      <li>Very soft very easy to put in.</li>
      <li>The hair itself is descent quality,however like the other reviewers have said this is not 1B,the hair is brown which would be great for me</li>
      <li>After using these clip-ins, many clients enjoy them so much that they want a more permanent option, so they ask me to use one of my many hair extensions methods to give them other hair fashion  options.</li>
      <li>It was smooth and pretty</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say about 7 maybe less days to get to my house (LA), well packaged and in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hair is thin, but works great since my hair is layered and short, great for the price though</li>
      <li>However, i have gotten extensions from a diff seller w/same feel + look and over time it got so many split ends and just looked like the ends completely fried up.</li>
      <li>the hair was good for the price, but unfortunatly i had to deduct points because i found many gray and blonde hairs mixed in with my extensions.</li>
      <li>but in this case there is far too many to take out without compromising the strand.</li>
      <li>This hair is useful as an add-on to add volume, but if you are looking to get a lot from this hair, it won&#x27;t happen.</li>
      <li>The hair is pretty thin, but it is perfect for me when i decide to straighten my hair or wear it up in a ponytail.</li>
      <li>I will never buy extentions from here again, it looks like a good price but its not worth it.</li>
      <li>overall I&#x27;m not quite sure the money is even worth it</li>
      <li>The shipping was SUPER fast.  </li>
      <li>The quality of the hair feels pretty good, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for Black people.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m overall pleased with the hair..</li>
      <li>The length was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(texture) if this is not 100% human hair it sure feels and looks it.</li>
      <li>My stylist curled these with the curling iron and the curls held  the whole night!</li>
      <li>The hair is silky straight, so if you are AA you will need a fresh perm in order for this hair to blend well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> color is off so i had to buy dye to get it to the right color waste of money :C</li>
    <li> the quality of the hair wasn&#x27;t  as great as what i had first ordered the clips weren&#x27;t as strong .</li>
    <li> This hair sheds like crazy and there are lots of grey hairs mixed in. I had to pluck those out. I will only use this hair for creating fullness for updos but nothing else.</li>
    <li> I got these extensions only 4 days after ordering.  The shipping was SUPER fast.  The packaging was GREAT and the extensions were so silky smooth and matched my hair color perfectly.  I would highly recommend this product.  The length looks great with my face frame and they attach so easily.  I have shoulder length short, very thin hair, and these extensions add the perfect amount of volume and slight length, making them look so natural.  VERY VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> I just ordered these and thanxs to reviews I am anxious for them to get here! My first time going for extensions and not too pricey for how good they sound. I&#x27;m sure I will LOVE them!! My hair is a red on top and the half bottom back of my hair is black, so I got these in black to make my back hair longer. I LOVE Amazon!!</li>
    <li> So i just got this like yesterday, and i tried them on  they look really great on me.. Im so happy with my purchase , Thanks so much (: . It also came earlier than i thought it would ! Great Extensions .. i&#x27;ll buy more soon :D thank&#x27;s again!</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying these because of the price (it seemed too good to be true given how much extensions usually go for) and since I am African American I have a slightly thicker hair type, so I assumed they would be more on the thinner side. Even though they are thin, as it turns out, I really like these extensions.  I wore them today and while the color matches perfectly with my natural hair, the texture wasn&#x27;t the same (though there were a few people who couldn&#x27;t tell if I played with my hair the right way). I relax my hair though so I think that once I get a touch up, they will blend in even better. I am happy with them though and my sister is even thinking about trying these now.</li>
    <li> So I took my chances with this and I would say if you can buy two orders do it because the quality of this hair is thin but its managable if you no how to work with it..to all my AA women go for it its way better than a sew in or glue and wigs..i tryed a new way in installing the hair..i braided my real hair and clip the clips right on my braids the hair look so natural i forget its weave at times. just awlsome yea it is 14&#x27;</li>
    <li> Clips did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never worn hair extensions before, but I bought these for a wedding I was a bridesmaid in. I have black hair (Asian) so it&#x27;s not a TRUE black (witch wig black), but more of a very very dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR: these hair extensions blended in my hair perfectly! Nobody could tell the difference between my hair and the extensions.&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE: they look pretty natural (not ratty doll hair). The clips can get a tad bit frizzy from broken strands but what natural hair isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;STYLING: I wore my hair curled, half down and half up. I don&#x27;t have very thick hair which is why I bought these extensions - I wanted the half down part to still look thick even with half my hair up. My stylist curled these with the curling iron and the curls held  the whole night! By the very end they had lost a little bounce, but so did my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;LENGTH: I have long hair that falls to about my chest (not below it). This set was long enough to match my natural length. My hair is very layered anyways so any of the shorter pieces blended well.&lt;br /&gt;CARE: I haven&#x27;t tried washing them yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;ll hold up being washed. I feel like these can definitely be styled/used again though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because of the texture. I wish the strands were a little stronger (less brittle) so they couldn&#x27;t get frizzy.. I&#x27;m thinking of those shampoo commercial hair that are perfectly smooth - but I personally don&#x27;t even know what higher quality extensions are like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these were pretty awesome and did exactly what I needed them to do. The set also includes plenty of clips - my stylist didn&#x27;t even end up using all of them! Compared to the $200 extensions I saw when I went into a Sally store, I think these are a GREAT buy.</li>
    <li> Nowhere near the length claimed. I&#x27;m OK with the fact that its very very thin (given the price I expected that), but in reality its not 14 inches at all. Its mostly about 9 inches, with maybe 15-20% of hairs between 8-14 inches (it starts tapering around mid-length, so that if you were to even out the length it would be 9 inches at the most, probably even 8).  If you really want 1t inches from this brand you would have to buy the 20 inch and cut it to 14.</li>
    <li> Most than what I expected. The clip ins blends well with my hair color. The clip ins are thin however, I have thick hair so it doesn&#x27;t bother me but for someone with thin hair they might want to reconsider. Human hair care instructions were included in the package and they arrive earlier than expected. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overall pleased with the hair.. it matched mine very well.  I have long hair already its just thin so these were great for adding thickness.</li>
    <li> These are really good starter extensions.A must buy.There made very good.Shipped pretty fast got them in about 4 days.great clips to they don&#x27;t hurt your head.</li>
    <li> very professional, clean, and snaps on tight! better than i expected when i read the other reviews. Mine was perfect and am able to use again and again. added volume and blended in so well. its beautiful</li>
    <li> - I installed the clip in hair and I can&#x27;t tell you how beautiful it curls. I love the hair and I recommend this hair to everyone, because you can take it out when you want to. I bought two packs of hair and blended the hair with my hair and you can&#x27;t tell that the hair is even there. I love this hair. beautiful , soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like how many pieces you get, and the clips that are put on it work really well. But When I put it in my hair you can see right through it, and it is very obvious that I have extensions in it. I haven&#x27;t really been able to use it because of this reason :-(</li>
    <li> Extensions are great and sturdy. Minimal shedding. I had to color them to match my hair (which was no problem) and they took color very nicely. They are easy to wash, curl, straighten, etc. If you have thick hair, you may want to order two packages, because they are a bit thin. But, I love them nonetheless. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I asked for offblack- I got reddish brown- I am trying to get a refund and had already sent it back and forward them tracking number for USPS but I have not heard when I am getting the refund.&lt;br /&gt;I ask  that Amazon to intervene so I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> The hair is very thin and cheap.  You get what you pay for and cheap is not good for hair.</li>
    <li> I realliy didn&#x27;t want to invest in very expensive hair for my teenage daughter. We went with this and it was perfectforher. A good match and looked nice for her. Clips were new to me but seem to work well.</li>
    <li> I got my package in about a week and after all that waiting and anticipation, it only led to disappointment. The hair was falling out badly, the clips weren&#x27;t even sewn in properly, the hair is just ugh. I will never buy extentions from here again, it looks like a good price but its not worth it. I would definitely NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try clip ins for the first time, and I must say that I am OVERLY pleased! the clips in came in before expected, AND they even include needle, thread, and 2 extra clips if you need to make more clips ins. The hair is extemely soft, but somewhat thin. In reading other reviews I saw that alot of people complained about the hair being thin, which is why I chose to purchase 3 bags. Hair is easy to curl and also easy to apply! I would so purchase it again!!!</li>
    <li> My hair was shipped on march 2 and I received it on march 6th so i was surprised by the speedy delivery. Most of the reviews say that the hair is thin and I want to tell you now that yes the hair is pretty thin, at first i thought i would be ok because I have very thin hair but after putting the extensions in it looked too thin, so i purchased another set. The hair also does a little bit of shedding -___- so you might want to be careful about how you tend to it. The length was exactly what I was looking for. but like i said the hair is pretty thin and if you have thick hair i suggest you either make your own extensions or buy something more filling to your hair type. I kind of see it as a get what you pay for kind of thing so you pay half the price for 6 pieces you get half the hair you normally would. to be honest these are my first clip in extensions and i like them, i just had to by another pack so my hair would look more believable.</li>
    <li> These extensions were perfect for me. They may not be good for someone who&#x27;s going for thicker hair or wants the finest extensions around but if you&#x27;re like me and have never bought extensions before and don&#x27;t know where to start this is definitely the product for you. I bought the 6 piece set which came with 2 three clips, 2 two clips, and 2 one clips. I bought them in black because the bottom of my hair is dyed black and they blended perfectly. Until I get enough money to buy $200 dollar extensions these will be the ones for me.</li>
    <li> Is not the correct descriptive color and had a couple thread strands in the hair. It is very soft hair that semi curls</li>
    <li> the hair was good for the price, but unfortunatly i had to deduct points because i found many gray and blonde hairs mixed in with my extensions. The hair is pretty thin, but it is perfect for me when i decide to straighten my hair or wear it up in a ponytail. the color was a bit lighter then what i would have imagined it to be which would be a blackish brown but instead it came out a brownish off black with a mixture of other colors in it. the length was perfect for me because I like a more natural look. Overall i give it 4 stars because of delivery,length,and the inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> I got my order a week before estimated which made me very happy. The hair is very good hair, this is definitely a great deal. Also there was no shipping and handing fee. This gives me just the amount of thickness I was hoping for. Get this product! I love it already</li>
    <li> The quality of the hair feels pretty good, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for Black people. The hair was very fine and the amount of extensions were lacking. I guess I would need two packs for my hair to even look decent</li>
    <li> This was really convenient for me especially when i straighten my hair. If i don&#x27;t feel like doing anything big i part my hair and put these in.</li>
    <li> The price cannot be beat if that is what is most important to you. The hair itself is descent quality,however like the other reviewers have said this is not 1B,the hair is brown which would be great for me but I bought for my daughter whose hair is dark and every other 1B has always matched perfectly. There is a ton of gray hairs,she has had this problem before and pulled them out but in this case there is far too many to take out without compromising the strand. Also,they were not clip in, it was the strand with the wig clips thrown loose in the bag. In the end my daughter will buy a cheap bottle of dye to make it darker and cover the grays and sew in the wig clips. A lot of extra effort but sometimes you get what you pay for,if you just want some cheap hair,it will do.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality of hair. It is a &amp;#34;Remy&amp;#34; hair that is very versatile. I purchased the 1b and it was a perfect match. I am African American and this silky hair blended well with my hair. I would definitley recommend. Also, shipping was fast. I&#x27;m a prime member and received it within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% Chinese with generally thin, dark brown/black hair so these extensions looked very natural and blended very well on my head. I currently have a layered bob, and these extensions were able to make my hair look naturally long. I tricked a lot of people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with several different sized extensions as said in the description, it&#x27;s necessary for me to use every one of them to make my hair look full enough to pass. A few hairs fell out, but I think that&#x27;s acceptable. I kept these on for a full day and they held up quite well.</li>
    <li> So I received my order today so shipping was really fast. Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m African American and I have long hair. I ordered the 14\\&quot; because I thought it would be the same lenght as my hair. It isn&#x27;t, so I think the lenght is a little off. The hair is silky straight, so if you are AA you will need a fresh perm in order for this hair to blend well. I just permed my hair last week, so no problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is off, I ordered 1b like I always have used. Well this hair looks like a # 2, which isnt a bad thing because it&#x27;ll be dark so i&#x27;m sure no one will notice. But if you normally use 1b, please order 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the pieces are thin. But that&#x27;s not a big deal because I just wanted a little more thickness for the ends of my hair. I&#x27;ll probably keep these pieces as a back up because i&#x27;ll use the smaller sectioned pieces to add a slight color change in my hair. I&#x27;ll probably look for a longer size and order in a darker color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps :).</li>
    <li> The extensions arrived right when promised!! The colour matches my hair perfectly! The problem is, they are so darn thin, that you can see where my thick curly hispanic girl hair ends and the stringy thin extensions begin. When I straighten my hair its not so bad, but you can still see where my hair ends and this hair begins. Just ordered a set of Alexxis extensions to see if I can make my hair thicker looking!! The clips are already falling off of the extensions and I&#x27;ve had them for1 week. There are also a few grey hairs sewn in which is weird. They look alright when they&#x27;re curled...overall I&#x27;m not quite sure the money is even worth it (although the price is cheap)</li>
    <li> These extensions have been nothing but satisfactory for me. I will order over and over again ! Highly recommended bc they are long lasting and not expensive ! Color is perfect and they are shipped in a timely manner. 5 STARS !!!</li>
    <li> simply incredible! curlable bouncy and petty hair... although it is a bit thin. at this price...you cant go wrong. Once again its amazing</li>
    <li> They are ok...not that great or easy to put on. But they do look real though. I use them sometimes.</li>
    <li> This hair is too silky and doesn&#x27;t appear to be the one advertised in the photo.</li>
    <li> Hair is thin, but works great since my hair is layered and short, great for the price though and I am pleased</li>
    <li> The hair was mailed in a timely manner, but the hair unfortunately wasn&#x27;t think enough for the look to be achieved.</li>
    <li> My clients at Omaha Hair Extensions Salon in Omaha, Nebraska bring these clip-ins for me to put in their hair all the time! They are very easy to put in. Most clients order 2 sets and we usually end up only using 1 1/2 sets in their hair. After using these clip-ins, many clients enjoy them so much that they want a more permanent option, so they ask me to use one of my many hair extensions methods to give them other hair fashion  options. Having these clip-ins helps them to transition to more permanent hair extensions options because they are already accustomed to the care and maintenance required.</li>
    <li> This hair is useful as an add-on to add volume, but if you are looking to get a lot from this hair, it won&#x27;t happen. My hair is thick, coarse and is dry. This hair will get oily in one day and it doesn&#x27;t curl much even using a curling iron. So, if you are looking into buying something to add volume, this could be a choice to blend with your hair, otherwise wear a sew in.</li>
    <li> Good quality hair, a little stringy, not very thick, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but then again maybe you would. Fast shipping, I guess it depends what you are using it for.</li>
    <li> These Clip In&#x27;s Are Beautiful if you apply them the correct way! They can become stressfull to the hair if you dont make sure that you make a secure part! They are usuable for a Good Couple of month if you keep them Clean and Fresh i usually take them out a night just to give my hair alittle brake from the extensions i recommend these extensions especially for the price! It&#x27;s naturally beautiful Human Hair. I use doo growth on my scalp so that my hiar can grown even while the extension Are in. this product is a must have for anyone who want&#x27;s thicker Fuller long length Hair!</li>
    <li> These are the best hair extensions I have ever got. I bought some for my daughter from Sallys and paid over $100.00 for them and these are much softer and better quality. I will be ordering more, in the near future. Thanks!!! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money! My daughter was happy with the clip ins. I would have spent way more if I&#x27;d went to Sally&#x27;s or another hair supply store.</li>
    <li> Sellers keep e-mailing to change my review.  The quality of this product is very poor, the hair keeps falling out.</li>
    <li> They blend in with my real hair very well after I dyed it to match with my hair and trim a little at the end.  They can be clipped on easily and look very nice.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love these hair ext.  my hair is thin so with these it makes it look jut a little fuller.  It looks natural and feels great.</li>
    <li> Product:&lt;br /&gt;(color)The color was identical with my hair color! I have dark brown hair and didn&#x27;t know what color i should get at first so i took a guess and got 1B-off blk and it was on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(texture) if this is not 100% human hair it sure feels and looks it. However, i have gotten extensions from a diff seller w/same feel + look and over time it got so many split ends and just looked like the ends completely fried up. We&#x27;ll see how these go..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(downside)The roots are pretty thick to the threading so it makes it kind of hard to clip into my hair, making my head feel weighed down. Also had a few white strings sewn into then a well that looked like white hairs, but no biggy -just pulled em out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment: They didn&#x27;t take long to arrive at all. I&#x27;d say about 7 maybe less days to get to my house (LA), well packaged and in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth a try especially for the price, but for me i&#x27;ll most likely experiment w/other sellers.</li>
    <li> THIS HAIR WAS MATTED AND TANGLED WITH THE THREADS ATTACHING IT TO THE  CLIPS. THE HAIR WAS PRACTICALLY SLAPPED ON THE CLIPS WITH THREAD FLYING EVERYWHERE. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I wish I had nice things to say about this.. I dont like it at all. The hair falls out instantly. I no sooner took off the fastens from packaging and large clumps fell out. Clips arent fastened in the center of the hair wefts so it looks awkward when attached.  Some of the string where the hair is held at the top of the weft falls down into the hair and looks ridiculous. There are some red hairs mixed into the brown... It was smooth and pretty but you get what you pay for. The seller was great... The item wasnt :c</li>
    <li> I already have thick hair and under estimated my length, when I received the hair I was surprised by the time frame. It was on time but disappointed at the quality for my hair personally but I will use it on my mother but not myself.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great! Very soft very easy to put in. My only problem was the thinness. I&#x27;ve got extremely thick hair. I should&#x27;ve ordered 2 packs instead of one. They also get kinda stringy. Have to constantly brush them out.</li>
    <li> I like the versatility that clip ins offer because I am not a weave person and these were good in quality but the clips break off after a few months which is expected. They did last me a long time though. I cut and dyed mine black. I have resorted to trying wigs though now. Then I don&#x27;t have to blend my hair with anything.</li>
