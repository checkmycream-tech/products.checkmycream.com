      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried that many different serums, but this product seems great.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t expect my fine lines to disappear.  </li>
      <li>The good thing for me is I have very sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
      <li>Fine lines and even the deep ones have faded and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>This is scent free, lightweight and goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I have sun damage from years of being outside without sunscreen and this just feels great on my skin.  </li>
      <li>great facial cream</li>
      <li>As for this product: It went on smooth as silk  &amp; has a light fragrance that is pleasing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>My skin does feel good and soft, however, I am using masks about once a week.</li>
      <li>So happy that I just ordered more, even though I expect my first bottle to last another two months.  </li>
      <li>Definitely it is worth a try!</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel soft and smooth and bright after your first try.</li>
      <li>Using it sparingly, it can last a good long time and still give you great results.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a good product for their face.</li>
      <li>WHO HONESTLY LOOKS EARLY 50S</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and blends right in without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>It has no offensive sent, moisturizes, makes my skin feel soft, goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and does not make my face sweat like so many moisturizers do.  </li>
      <li>After I try this product , I can&#x27;t live with out this any more.</li>
      <li>and it makes my face feel smooth and vibrant and gives it a good shine the next day.</li>
      <li>Great skin care product for year round use.</li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and have never had an issue with any of the Meaningful Beauty products.</li>
      <li>have a second bottle which I will use, then it will depend on if I can find a nice price if I will continue using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I look in the mirror every day with a smile.  </li>
      <li>This is good quality moisturizer, I can&#x27;t buy it too often because price was a little high, but the quality is outstanding.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel smooth and soft without any greasy look after.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin even smooth and clear.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more of this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle and will continue buying this product on Amazon because the price is so much better than in the beauty supply stores.</li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced, so was worth the money to check it out.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve really noticed a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>use it at night, and it has made my skin much softer and smoother.  </li>
      <li>AND PEOPLE HAVE REALLY NOTICED</li>
      <li>Lets be real.  </li>
      <li>How many REAL (not rich model)</li>
      <li>I really was surprised that it did anything, truth be told.  </li>
      <li>I really have never liked Meaningful Beauty.</li>
      <li>My tired, stressed out looking skin looks healthy and rejuvenated again!  </li>
      <li>The pores were large and now seem significantly smaller.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time with night creams because most have a scent that bothers me when I sleep.  </li>
      <li>The product smelled old and that makes me feel like I shouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any improvement as far as wrinkles or sun damage go - NONE.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; have no issues with this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 39 years old.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve seen so many negative reviews</li>
      <li>LOOKED LIKE 65 YR OLD</li>
      <li>My skin is  Scots-Irish sensitive</li>
      <li>However, I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect base before my moisturizer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old and have been a skin freak for the past 4.5 decades;  this night cream goes on smooth, soaks in well, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, improves elasticity, and exfoliates.  </li>
      <li>I use it at night, but know a couple people who use it morning and night, and it apparently wears well under makeup.  </li>
      <li>BUT I JUST TURNED 60 YRS OLD WHITE MALE</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product! I saw great results almost from the gate.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel, and the lines are slowly softening. Great Product and I will be buying it again for sure!!!!</li>
    <li> I really have never liked Meaningful Beauty. It is not what I thought it would be. It&#x27;s a lot of hype with Cindy Crawford selling the products acting like this product does it all for her. She probable goes to dermatologist and I have read Cindy has had a facelift. I don&#x27;t understand why people use her products.</li>
    <li> Serums are all the rage these days, and this one did not disappoint me.  I have been using it in lieu of night creams and could not be happier.  I have a hard time with night creams because most have a scent that bothers me when I sleep.  This is scent free, lightweight and goes on smoothly.  My skin basically drinks it in.  I have sun damage from years of being outside without sunscreen and this just feels great on my skin.  I use it at night, but know a couple people who use it morning and night, and it apparently wears well under makeup.  No matter what your age is, I would recommend using this.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my skin even smooth and clear.  I gave up all my other creams and only use this twice a day, once in the morning and then after cleansing at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old and have been a skin freak for the past 4.5 decades;  this night cream goes on smooth, soaks in well, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, improves elasticity, and exfoliates.  Very good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Nice Product.  It goes on smooth and blends right in without feeling greasy. My skin feels great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life- Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> I will definitely be getting more of this and normally I&#x27;m not into this stuff. I put it on before I go to bed every night and it makes my face feel smooth and vibrant and gives it a good shine the next day.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this...thx Amazon for getting my package to me on time.  I LOVE this stuff!!  It&#x27;s like a miracle in a bottle!  My tired, stressed out looking skin looks healthy and rejuvenated again!  I have sensitive skin &amp; have no issues with this product.  If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this serum, DO IT!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it Did not work for me, within 2 days of use I started to break out.</li>
    <li> Felt good going on my skin and smelled good but after using the whole bottle I did not see any difference in looking like I had more youthful skin.  I am not saying it is a bad product.  It may work well for some.  It was reasonably priced, so was worth the money to check it out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 3 months or 1 bottle. It does go on very nicely, absorbs quickly and no adverse reactions to report. I don&#x27;t see any improvement as far as wrinkles or sun damage go - NONE. I do find a difference in the size of my pores on my forehead, however. The pores were large and now seem significantly smaller. My skin does feel good and soft, however, I am using masks about once a week. I don&#x27;t agree with another reviewer that you can use a small dot on your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a second bottle which I will use, then it will depend on if I can find a nice price if I will continue using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside; the advertising, in my opinion, is nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 3 stars because I like it but it doesn&#x27;t make me look noticeably different except those pores.</li>
    <li> The product smelled old and that makes me feel like I shouldn&#x27;t use it. Basically, I feel totally ripped off- money down the drain.</li>
    <li> After I try this product , I can&#x27;t live with out this any more. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I rarely buy skin improvement products, and the few I did buy in the past were a disappointment, and were returned.  My skin care has been mostly limited to moisturizers.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised by this one.  It has no offensive sent, moisturizes, makes my skin feel soft, goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and does not make my face sweat like so many moisturizers do.  I like the pump which delivers the same amount each time.  I use one pump every morning.  Do I look 20 again?  I think not.  That WOULD take a miracle.  I&#x27;m no spring chicken.  Hmmm . . .  let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m retired and can get a discount at any grocery store on Tuesdays.  &amp;#60;grin&amp;#62;  But in just over a month of once a day use, I have noticed a definite shrinking of the pores on my face.  (Actually I saw a slight change after just 2 weeks)  And smaller pores make my skin look and feel younger.  My makeup goes on better and looks better too.  Before, makeup just seemed to make my pores more noticeable.  No longer a problem.  And now It appears my hard earned crows feet may be softening a bit.  Not quite sure.  The jury is still out on those crows feet, but its only been a month.  I&#x27;m hoping to see a definite softening.  But I don&#x27;t expect my fine lines to disappear.  Lets be real.  If you expect a facelift from this product, don&#x27;t purchase it.  You will be disappointed.  But if you just want your skin to improve give it a try.  I think you will be pleased.  I am.  I really was surprised that it did anything, truth be told.  Now I look in the mirror every day with a smile.  I am happy.  So happy that I just ordered more, even though I expect my first bottle to last another two months.  I just don&#x27;t want to run out.  Ever.</li>
    <li> Great mother&#x27;s day gift.this was on my wife&#x27;s list of must haves and she was more than happy to add it to the makeup collection on the vanity.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT EVEN FOR MEN THE WRINKLES AROUND MY EYES AND BAGS ETC GONE WHEN I USE THIS ON A REGULAR BASES AND PEOPLE HAVE REALLY NOTICED THEY SAY HAVE YOU BEEN ON A TRIP OR HAD A LITTLE NIP AND TUCK LAUGHING BUT ITS THIS PRODUCT AND NOT TO BE BRAGGING BUT I JUST TURNED 60 YRS OLD WHITE MALE WHO HONESTLY LOOKS EARLY 50S LATE 40S TRUTHFULLY OF COURSE GENES HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT MY DAD PASTED AWAY LAST JUNE HE WAS 81 LOOKED LIKE 65 YR OLD</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream.I use it twice a day and will continue to use it as long as they make it.I could take a bath in it and I&#x27;m sure feel and smell fantastic.Love it,Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it works. I have seen a difference in my skin in just 3 months. I have had more than one person remark on how good I look. The good thing for me is I have very sensitive skin and allergies. I have tried many products and this I can use without any problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Crème de Serum for about 6 months. . .I use it at night, and it has made my skin much softer and smoother.  I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a good product for their face.</li>
    <li> Just like all the other wrinkle creams. It helps somewhat with lines but does not lift sagging skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Makes my skin feel smooth and soft without any greasy look after.  It&#x27;s the perfect base before my moisturizer and I&#x27;ve really noticed a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes.  I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle and will continue buying this product on Amazon because the price is so much better than in the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.Your skin will feel soft and smooth and bright after your first try. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Whenever I see a product on an infomercial, I take all the accolades that the actors/&amp;#34;real people&amp;#34; have to say with a grain of salt. But this product does everything it claims to do and more.  You don&#x27;t have to use tons of it for it to work either. I use a small dot on the tip of my finger every morning after cleaning my skin. It adds the glow my skin hasn&#x27;t had since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  Fine lines and even the deep ones have faded and my skin looks great. When I tell people I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s they think I&#x27;m joking.  I&#x27;ve actually had to pull out my driver&#x27;s license to prove it.  This is a great product and worth every penny. Using it sparingly, it can last a good long time and still give you great results.</li>
    <li> I like this creme de serum.  It makes my skin feel softer.  I use it every other night in place of my night cream.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried that many different serums, but this product seems great.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and have never had an issue with any of the Meaningful Beauty products.</li>
    <li> This is good quality moisturizer, I can&#x27;t buy it too often because price was a little high, but the quality is outstanding.</li>
    <li> Youth serum for Your skin. It hydrates and fills and wakes up you chin,forehead puts a youthful glow into your cheeks</li>
    <li> This is a great serum for nighttime use. Helps my skin stay smooth and beautiful! Great skin care product for year round use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see what are the hype is :(</li>
    <li> great facial cream i use it every day...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this helps wrinkles but I love the way my face feels. Glad I found it and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I never review anything. But I&#x27;ve seen so many negative reviews and I feel I need to say that the meaningful beauty product are awesome. I have acne prone skin. I&#x27;m 39 years old. Finally, a product that doesn&#x27;t screw up my face and it works! My skin is softer, brighter and healthier! Love it! And if you go through meaningful beauty website you can customize your kit and how often you want it. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Just a very small amount is needed.  Glides on very smoothly and feels silky!  Definitely it is worth a try!</li>
    <li> Love all her products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this cream for soo long, but was put off by the cost &amp; having to join a club.  The ads are so tempting but no-way would I get it from the company.&lt;br /&gt;So I was very happy to see it offered here.&lt;br /&gt; As for this product: It went on smooth as silk  &amp; has a light fragrance that is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt; My wrinkles are less apparent &amp; my skin tone is prettier &amp; firmer. I could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;  I take care of my skin &amp; use sun block every day.&lt;br /&gt;  My skin is  Scots-Irish sensitive so I have to be careful.  But my skin loves this.  I&#x27;m gonna use it forever &amp; will order more when this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;I love that I don&#x27;t HAVE to join the stupid club Cindy Crawford&#x27;s company demands!  That is a major rip-off in my book. Are they kidding?  How many REAL (not rich model) people can afford that every month?&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in good condition, good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to order it for gifts too, as the price is good.&lt;br /&gt;Works for me!</li>
