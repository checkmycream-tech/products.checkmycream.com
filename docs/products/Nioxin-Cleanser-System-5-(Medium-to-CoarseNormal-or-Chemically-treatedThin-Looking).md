    <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;does the work&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ll add a review in a few months to let u know if my hair looks better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last 2 years and it has been pretty good. The shampoo leaves your hair soft after the shower and your hair \\&quot;looks\\&quot; thicker than when you don&#x27;t use it. So, I have really enjoyed using this product.</li>
    <li> Been using their products for 13 years and always satisfied.  This system 5 - directed by web site - is watery, has a bad smell, is causing dandruff to return after being long banished by  System 1,2,3.  Hair feels and looks flat and missing any body.  Their first clunker - going back to System 2.  Anyone want 30 oz. of junk hair product?</li>
    <li> This product arrived promptly and does what is says it will do. I would suggest this product for anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for many years and it has controlled my thinning hair.  I ran out of it about three months ago and I started losing handfuls of hair every time I shampooed.  Hopefully, this will put a stop to that.</li>
    <li> My head feels better!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Been using it for at least 4 years.  It cleanses my hair very well, and helps promote hair growth with my color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> Soul mates are brought into your life so that you can grow and expand into the best version of yourself.</li>
    <li> Nioxin is a wonderful product. I bought this for my sister going through chemo, as the shampoo is gentle on her head, and important as hair starts to grow again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nioxin products for several years now.  I had noticeably thinning hair.  Within 2 weeks even my husband could see a difference.  I&#x27;ve stuck with it and been happy with the way my hair looks.  I&#x27;m sticking with it!!</li>
    <li> It works. It took a few months before I could tell it was working, but the proof is really in the before and after pictures.  My hair stylist found the new growth noticeable and I&#x27;ve recently convinced my husband to start using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t grow hair, but the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t claim that it does. It provides more volume to give the appearance of more hair, but more importantly, it severely slows the falling out process, which I can attest to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am not pleased with the Nioxin Bodyfying Foam. On numerous occasions it is arrived with a cracked nozzle. The replacement products continue to be cracked when they arrive as well.</li>
    <li> I like using Nioxin mostly for how clean it leaves my scalp, which gets rather oily. I have no idea if it does anything for hair loss, and that is why I got it. My hair loss slowed awhile after I started using it, but I think that it did that on its own and had nothing to do with the Nioxin. I have found another brand of similar shampoo and conditioner that is even better than Nioxin, however, the Nioxin is more affordable, which is something it has going for it. Overall I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered Nioxin System 5.  I did not realize I actually got something else (Nioxin Smoothing Actives).&lt;br /&gt;So just check what you get vs. what you ordered.  The product does most of the things I was looking for in a Nioxin product so I continued using it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfide. Makes your hair feel silky smooth! Does help hair regrowth. I would recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I have been using the nioxin not because of thinning hair but because of a dry scalp. I have tried many other products with no success. This product works good and feels great. I wish it smelled a little nicer but we can&#x27;t have it all!</li>
    <li> Product is a fake. I have been using this product for 8 years and can identify this as a fake.  I did not return product because I did not want to pay for shipping on return very dissatisfied with product. Amazon should screen suppliers on their site</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended the shampoo, and I feel that my hair is getting healthy again. My husband uses it also.</li>
    <li> As a seventy-something senior, have been using the Nioxin System 5 for several years and am delighted with both the Cleanser and Conditioner.  Use them as a set.  Hair comes out clean and soft!</li>
    <li> Cleans as shampoo is suppose to do :o)</li>
    <li> This cleanser for hair does a good job.  However, I had heard that it will promote hair growth, and I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had the product long enough to determine if that will occur.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works as advertised, price is better than in store, hard to find #5 in stock, too; makes my wirey hair soft.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with this product</li>
