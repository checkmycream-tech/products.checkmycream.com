<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very good , thank you</li>
    <li> Wife loved it! I rather enjoy the smell. Fragrance</li>
    <li> Love it. Last 8hours+!</li>
    <li> It is a great product, very satisfied, thanks</li>
    <li> it has a delightful scent and is definitely a perfect perfume for summer time~~~~ I love it a lot! :)</li>
    <li> Authentic perfume. Fast shipping. Good packaging. Love it!</li>
    <li> Someone said &amp;#34;it smells like mosquito repellent&amp;#34;...........it does.</li>
    <li> This smells like a combination of new vinyl (think new shower curtains) and bug spray....not just on my skin but also just spritzed into the air (I got a sample from another site).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit on my skin for a while to see if things improved....nope.  I washed it off before anyone else got a sniff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a subtle yet unique scent. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about this perfume other than that I LOVE it. You can wear it during the day or night. Finishing up my first bottle, probably going to purchase another one before it runs out.</li>
    <li> Did not like fragrance.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this perfume constantly.  A very clean, fresh scent and well worth the money.  A lot less expensive online compared to department stores.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so up set about this product because is a fake perfume. This perfume doesn&#x27;t fix and smell originally.&lt;br /&gt;Please contact to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed and I need the Amazon do something for me.&lt;br /&gt;I love so much to buy with you and I was happy with all products that I bought with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate your attention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aline</li>
    <li> IN MY POINT OF VIEW THIS FRAGANCE SMELLS LIKE GRANDMA, I BOUGHT THE LOTION AND A FEW PEOPLE SAID IT SMELL LIKE OLD PEOPLE. I HAD TO GIVE IT TO MY AUNT AS A GIFT.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it has a delicate, fresh rose scent, yet long lasting that other people can smell it on me even 8 hours after I spray it.  I get SO MANY compliments when I wear this perfume.</li>
    <li> I  never had the opportunity to smell Chloe before buying it.  It has no smell and absolutely no lasting fragrance.  Sorry that I spent so much money on this product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Thats all I have to say. Personally I like the smell. However, I do think this perfume is for ladies and not for teen girls.</li>
    <li> It has no smell !!! I think its water.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d with cellophane on package very loose &amp; not sealed, smell is different than the original one I purchased from a department store.  Not worth me even contacting to send back &amp; forth.</li>
    <li> Bought this gift for my loved one and she loves it!!!! Great to have for any woman and price is cheaper on amazon!</li>
    <li> OMG this perfume, smells really good. I had gotten a sample from sephora and was hesitant to purchase this one. So i kept some from the sample and ordered, once received i did the &amp;#34;match smell test&amp;#34; and YUP they are the same.</li>
    <li> You wont begin to understand the essence of this perfume until a least an hour later. The initial scent is very floral and almost funeral like until the undertones rise to the occasion. It lasts FOREVER! I am a very heavy sweater and it stays and stays! So glad I purchased it here. I saved nearly $60 buying it online vs. Macy&#x27;s where my sister originally introduced me to it.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. I bought this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loved it. Very nice buy and not too expensive. But the bottle was smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> This product seems similar to the original, but DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a FAKE product. I opened it and sprayed it once and the entire&lt;br /&gt;perfume was all over my hand. The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work, no it&#x27;s not a&lt;br /&gt;defect or anything, you can tell it&#x27;s fake since I compared it to the original&lt;br /&gt;small sample I had months ago and it looks and smells much different.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
    <li> Loved this perfume and will buy more!!!the price was also very reasonable compared to stores I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, and she really liked it. Although it is kinda expensive for such a small bottle, it is still worth splurging.</li>
    <li> This was such a great deal.  The parfume smells amazing.  I bought as a gift and want one for myself as well.</li>
    <li> I tested the perfume at macy&#x27;s and I instantly fell in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;It is sweet but not over the top.&lt;br /&gt;I found it here for a much cheaper price than that at the department store.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I found out that I didn&#x27;t like it as much as when I tested it.&lt;br /&gt;It is very floral, and not as sweet as what I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I received a sample of this perfume from Sephora,&lt;br /&gt;and I realized this perfume smells ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THE SAMPLE..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure whether the perfume sold here is fake or has been exposed to heat for too long.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest paying extra money at a department store for a perfume that you know you actually like.</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume at Ulta but bought it on Amazon because it was a better price. A beautiful scent that&#x27;s very clean. I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Chloe for years.  I enjoy a fragrance that reminds me of scents from nature and dares to also make you wonder where you have enjoyed this fragrance before.  I was glad that the new Chloe was still related to the captivating smell I wore years ago and yet was deliberate in a new twist of fragrance to enjoy.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order from Amazon after reading some of the reviews regarding fake perfume but I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.  The price was reasonable, shipped from Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this scent.  I found it in a magazine and then spritzed myself at the store before buying it online. The smell is sweet but not sickeningly so - it&#x27;s low key and great for work or a night out.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s light and flowerly. It&#x27;s very feminine and I use it daily. I am so happy I found this perfume!</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this perfume because of some of the negative comments people left about it being diluted and a knock-off.  I purchased the Chloe New By Chloe Roller ball from Sephora,  because I wanted to compare the scent to the one I purchased from Amazon.  Ladies and Gentleman, they smell exactly the  same! Both perfumes lasted the same amount of time. The trick was applying the perfume to several different places on my body  for it to last all day. To my surprise,  I applied my perfume at 3:00 a.m. this morning, and I still smell it at 10:19 p.m.. The scent is  lighter, but I can still smell it.  I have been sweating because it was nearly 100 degrees today.  I am happy I purchased this from Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been stalking this perfume for a year now. I just could not bring myself to pay $115. I purchased it for $57.00. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Im so disappointed cuz i found that the liquid spilt from the side of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;it should be replaced.</li>
    <li> Crisp, clear, fresh, soapy floral. I definitely catch rose and white florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not your mother&#x27;s or grandmother&#x27;s Chloe. Nothing like the original but better for it, imo.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, graet quality and price</li>
    <li> Great scent and price! You aren&#x27;t going to find a deal like this anywhere else.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Was always my wife&#x27;s favorite and my daughter grew up loving the smell.  She got it as a gift and was thrilled.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY IT! This is not the original parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife previously bought the same parfum at Sephora and macy&#x27;s; and the smell always lasted the full day. She bought at least 3 bottles and never had any issue.&lt;br /&gt;With this &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; one from Amazon, the smell lasts only few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with Amazon to sell &amp;#34;fake/not original&amp;#34; products!&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with Amazon Customer Service for the full refund!</li>
    <li> I was scared to buy online as i have done my research &amp; when ordering perfume online you don&#x27;t know what you will get. I had been paying $120 or more for the smaller bottle in stores, I went ahead &amp; ordered this one &amp; its legit &amp; i will be ordering again. Great price, i think perfume is way overpriced, but don&#x27;t we all like to smell good?!</li>
    <li> I love this Chloe perfume, it is my all time favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I like wearing it on the weekend. I would recommend this to all perfume lovers.</li>
    <li> Sadly, we seem to have been ripped off. It felt very diluted from the very first drop so we compared it to an identical one bought at a retail store and not only the scent was different but any trace of fragrance would completely disappear in a matter of minutes. Certainly not Eau de Parfum (not sure we could even call it cologne). Waste of money; lesson learned with merchant.</li>
    <li> When I first smelled this parfum I fell in love. This parfum have a very soft smell but yet poweerfull. I did shopped around and this sell price was the best and I like that fact that the seller put some other test parfum for me to try.  Good business move.  Everything was package nice and sent in a timely manner. Yes I shop with this seller again. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Still using it many months later</li>
    <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, but I hadn&#x27;t smelled it in store prior to purchasing online</li>
    <li> I love this perfume SO much! I purchased some other perfume from Macy&#x27;s last year and got a sample of the Chloe perfume and a few others. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of flowery perfumes (Coach&#x27;s poppy is a staple of mine), but the smell of this perfume blew every other perfume I had away. I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the little sampler bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so many perfumes, from Jimmy Choo to Ralph Lauren (Summer Romance, yum) to Dolce and Gabbana, but my staple is Chloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to describe the smell of this perfume, but I really don&#x27;t think I can do it justice. To me it smells like a flower garden after a rainstorm. It&#x27;s a very thick floral smell with just the slightest hint of spice, but unlike Coach&#x27;s poppy, which is almost sickeningly sweet, this perfume has heavy tones. It&#x27;s mature, but subtle. And before when I said the slightest hint of spice, I mean the absolute slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my body chemistry or what, but I am 25 years old (I saw the remark about being some old lady&#x27;s perfume?) and I cannot stop smelling this perfume. Even my male friends and coworkers have commented on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume. This has been my new favorite. I had finished a previous bottle I purchased from Sephora last summer. When ran out, I searched it in Amazon, got so surprised with the much cheaper price offered by this seller. Pretty convinced with most of the reviewer comments, I ordered it. I would say the smell is identical to the real one, BUT, it only lasted for about 3-4 hours. The previous one, when I sprayed it to my winter scarf, the subtle scent would last for days.</li>
    <li> this has the loveliest light floral fragrance of roses and lilacs and just smells like a summer boquet, very nice if u like crisp scent of petals</li>
    <li> Fantastic! !!! The smell stays for a long time .It is more citric ! I don&#x27;t like very sweet perfumes. I recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragance. The smeel stay with you all day long and you can feel it during the day. Now, it is my favorite fragance and I think every woman should try once.</li>
    <li> best deal in the world! my favorite perfume of all time, me and my mom are obsessed! fast shipping! thank you so so so so much :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it&#x27;s fresh, pleasant and subtle. Lasts for 6-8 hours, just what I was looking for. Thanks!</li>
    <li> came in a clean box as new as it should from any department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i LOVE the smell, i should&#x27;ve bought a larger one</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my choice for a gift. Chloe eau de parfumerie spray for women is a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Clean. A friend came in the door wearing it and smelled so fresh and pretty. I had to have some. Light and lasting. A fresh breeze of scent.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I have had many compliments on the scent</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume and when I received it, the packaging looks like if someone opened it and put it together again, and the part of the serial number on the box is carved off!  The perfume smells like alcohol!  I tried to return it, but Amazon has a policy that it cannot be returned because its a hazard chemical!  I want my money back!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem real, but hey,you pay for what you get.. It&#x27;s not THAT bad.. Buy the real one if you want it to last longer.</li>
    <li> Not too sweet, not too spicy.  It leaves a nice dry, fresh scent after a few hours of wear.  There is a softness throughout.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and find Chloe is \\&quot;age appropriate\\&quot; - it has a mature feel without reminding me of someone&#x27;s grandmother.  It lasts all day, but it could become a bit overpowering if too much is sprayed.</li>
    <li> Nothing more to say but that she was happy with it</li>
    <li> I definitely don&#x27;t think this is the original. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as the one I had from Sephora, and also the scent varies slightly. However, it&#x27;s a good dupe for those on a budget.</li>
    <li> I get many compliments on this.  I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say, but it smells really good and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell it smell so fresh and clean, long stay on the body even after hours at work that&#x27;s my very best perfume</li>
    <li> My girls fav perfume, she loved it, therefor I loved it.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like the fragrance of Chloe that I know and love, but the bottle is pretty.  Looks good on my dresser.</li>
    <li> the best fragrance for women</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for the sophisticated yet edgy lady. It has become one of my favorites spring-summer scent. A must buy.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume that my wife wears.  It reminds me of our wedding day.</li>
    <li> Same great product, however much better price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love I was able to get this perfume for an aweseome price!!!!! Their prduct price plus s&amp;h STILL beat the department stores price - I WILL shop here again... As a matter of fact... lemme see what they have now! lol</li>
    <li> The frangrance seemed old or possibly a replica as I have worn it for quite some time and it does not smell exactly the same as the others which I have purchased from Sephora. This was darker in color and was not nearly as lasting as the others I have purchased.</li>
    <li> My favorite! Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> Been complimented on this many times . It&#x27;s got a fresh spring smell to it . I would consider it to be flirty and fun - wear it to brunch, the farmers market, to lunch . It&#x27;s not heavy. I would consider it a day time perfume . Will buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> I travelled to Taiwan from Vancouver via Japan and Korea then came back from Taiwan to Vancouver via HongKong recently. So, I had a rare chance comparing 5 airport duty free prices. Amazon has the absolute lowest price, not only on perfume but literally on everything! On this Chloe perfume, price differences are $8 to $12. Considering the $53 price I paid, it&#x27;s about 15-23% less.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping!!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this item. I wear it everybody.  I&#x27;m running out of it. I need to order me another one.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. The packaging was perfect. And the smell&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend was hoping to get it for some time and I bought this for her as a birthday gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> My sister war very happy with this perfume.(It was her Christmas gift from me)&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, sweet, and fresh scent that last all day long.</li>
