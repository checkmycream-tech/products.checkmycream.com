### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Nails should be sleek, perfect and shiney.</li>
      <li>but I was not that thrilled with it!!</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a good color of polish when even my husband stops to say \\&quot;Woah!</li>
      <li>Great seller and great product.</li>
      <li>VERY BEAUTIFUL AND SPARKLY BUT BE SURE TO APPLY TOPCOAT</li>
      <li>Great color and amazing coat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Formula is good Consistency&lt;br /&gt;You can get away with Two coats</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I also liked the inexpensive price tag.&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BRAND and COLOR!!</li>
      <li>The color was exactly what was shown online and the shipping was great also.</li>
      <li>Even after applying a high-shine top coat, the color remained matte in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Liquid Sand, Nubar encourages a top coat with their Sparkle collection, and I always use their Diamont top coat.  </li>
      <li>The brush was perfectly shaped to provide even color coverage and I only needed one coat of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That being said, I DO have the top coat...</li>
      <li>While I like the color, I&#x27;m not in love with this product.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t ask for much more in a nail polish.</li>
      <li>Mostly I stick to Zoya or Color Club nail polish.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the color and sparkles.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear it again.  :-)  </li>
      <li>Which I love.</li>
      <li>Well this is definatly not my favorite polish.</li>
      <li>it is the perfect color for a galaxy manicure that I want to attempt, and the second being that it&#x27;s a Nubar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been ultimately impressed with Nubar&#x27;s polishes, and I own quite a few.</li>
      <li>Great color, goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
      <li>Unique and lovely color.</li>
      <li>The biggest plus for it is that it drys VERY quickly.</li>
      <li>the plus side, the Nubar color was easy to remove with Acetone nail polish remove.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this stuff bears a strong resemblance to OPI&#x27;s Liquid Sand collection from the outset.  </li>
      <li>QUICK!</li>
      <li>&quot; I bought this for two reasons - the primary being</li>
      <li>It even looks great on my short nails.</li>
      <li>The photo online gives the polish a smooth, glassy look.  </li>
      <li>it looked so fabulous that i had to get it...</li>
      <li>, It chipped a lot sooner!&lt;br /&gt;Finish is grainy and clumpy, I tend to like mirror smooth.</li>
      <li>The nail polish is clumpy and does not go on smooth.  </li>
      <li>formula tends to thicken up the more coats you use&lt;br /&gt;Color was much darker than pictured, more like a Navy Blue&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
      <li>Unlike most glitter-based polishes, which require me to soak each finger for 30-60 seconds, the Nubar polish came right</li>
      <li>the price really was great and super fast shipping....</li>
      <li>polish (with the top coat) chipped on every fingertip on the first day.  </li>
      <li>I love the color polish but as I tried it on it was light and very clumpy.  </li>
      <li>which also dries quickly.</li>
      <li>have used many other Nubar polishes and have been thrilled with their quality.  </li>
      <li>Seriously that fast, awesome!</li>
      <li>I purchased Nubar Night Sparkle nail color because I&#x27;d heard very positive things about the brand and the cool and unique colors/effects that Nubar offers.  </li>
      <li>I did not read the reviews first</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give this polish 5 stars was because the color was not a shiny, glittery blue, as pictured, but more of a matte glitter denim color.  </li>
      <li>will definitely try more by this brand.</li>
      <li>This was part of an order that was my first time using Nubar.  </li>
      <li>I actually love that collection (obviously) and the texture doesn&#x27;t bother me - but it certainly isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, not harsh on my nails (3 free and VEGAN of all things!), and spectacularly pigmented (without staining my nails).</li>
      <li>but it still came out very clumpy.  </li>
      <li>This definitely helped to relieve the dullness of the polish itself, but still did not deliver the shine as rendered in the picture, nor did it provide a smooth finish, the texture is still there.  </li>
      <li>It still looked really neat, it just wasn&#x27;t what my expectation had been based on what was pictured.  </li>
      <li>The whole bottle will hit the trashcan and I will never buy another one from Nubar&#x27;s Sparkle collection</li>
      <li>I really like this one.\\</li>
      <li>And much brighter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really torn about this product.</li>
      <li>The biggest minus to it is that unless you buy the special top coat to this nail polish, you are pretty much stuck with a really rough, not at all shiny polish.</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly because I saw it on a YouTube video on someone&#x27;s haul...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After starting out with Essie&#x27;s &amp;#34;Feed Me&amp;#34; base coat, I was very impressed with how easy the Nubar nail polish was to apply.  </li>
      <li>so I swatched this real fast on one of my nails and in no time at all it was dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Nubar polishes, so I am pretty surprised at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you are looking for a deep blue sparkle polish that will (possibly) last you for just the night, no longer, feel free to take the chance on this stuff.  </li>
      <li>By the second day 1/4 of a nail had come off completely and several other nails had more sizeable chips out of them.  </li>
      <li>The color is more matte when it goes on and not such a dark blue as shown in the picture</li>
      <li>It is thick but it is very pretty.</li>

<li> The color is more matte when it goes on and not such a dark blue as shown in the picture</li>
<li> It is thick but it is very pretty.</li>
<li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the color to be pretty dead on to the picture online, as well as the bottle itself.  </li>
<li> To get the right color you would need to put on at least 3 or 4 coats and even then it doesn&#x27;t dry fully.</li>
<li> This is not at all how it comes out, as several other reviewers have noted.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s basically dry.</li>
<li> It is very gritty and didn&#x27;t last two days with base and top coat.</li>
<li> I wanted a dark \\&quot;night\\&quot; blue (hence the name), so that is what I expected, and what I received.  </li>
<li> but that&#x27;s not really what I got it for!  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to check out the other colors.</li>
<li> I love this color, and hate the application.</li>
<li> I guess if you layer it over a base coat it would work better</li>
<li> Will try to use thinner on it, it needs to lay down</li>
<li> Perhaps putting it on over a black polish would get it closer to dark but still, not like the picture.</li>
<li> As I stated in a previous review for another color in this brand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This, unfortunately, is the only place where this polish lived up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s watery and hard to see any color or sparkle.</li>
<li> it is really thin almost like its watered down!  </li>
<li> I mean, you put on a coat</li>
<li> Total waste of money. :-(</li>
<li> Its basically bad blue polish with glitter.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick, gooey and difficult to work with.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m confused how this polish made it through quality</li>
<li> The color is much darker than in the picture and the texture is horrible.</li>
<li> FAIL!</li>
<li> This polish is awful.  </li>

    <li> This polish is way lighter then I thought it was going to be it is really thin almost like its watered down!  I guess if you layer it over a base coat it would work better but that&#x27;s not really what I got it for!  I did not read the reviews first (my fault) so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way it should be but I was not that thrilled with it!!</li>
    <li> This was part of an order that was my first time using Nubar.  Mostly I stick to Zoya or Color Club nail polish.  As I stated in a previous review for another color in this brand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formula is good Consistency&lt;br /&gt;You can get away with Two coats&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula tends to thicken up the more coats you use&lt;br /&gt;Color was much darker than pictured, more like a Navy Blue&lt;br /&gt;Because the Glitter clumps on your nails, It chipped a lot sooner!&lt;br /&gt;Finish is grainy and clumpy, I tend to like mirror smooth.</li>
    <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the color to be pretty dead on to the picture online, as well as the bottle itself.  I wanted a dark \\&quot;night\\&quot; blue (hence the name), so that is what I expected, and what I received.  This, unfortunately, is the only place where this polish lived up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect the texture.  The photo online gives the polish a smooth, glassy look.  This is not at all how it comes out, as several other reviewers have noted.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Nubar polishes, so I am pretty surprised at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff bears a strong resemblance to OPI&#x27;s Liquid Sand collection from the outset.  I have all of the colors from both of their (OPI&#x27;s) Mariah Carey and Bond Girls sets.  I actually love that collection (obviously) and the texture doesn&#x27;t bother me - but it certainly isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Liquid Sand, Nubar encourages a top coat with their Sparkle collection, and I always use their Diamont top coat.  This definitely helped to relieve the dullness of the polish itself, but still did not deliver the shine as rendered in the picture, nor did it provide a smooth finish, the texture is still there.  It also did NOTHING to prolong the manicure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish (with the top coat) chipped on every fingertip on the first day.  By the second day 1/4 of a nail had come off completely and several other nails had more sizeable chips out of them.  Every time I touched up a spot, another would could off.  I am now on day 3 and my nails are a joke.  I will have to remove the polish entirely tonight.  The whole bottle will hit the trashcan and I will never buy another one from Nubar&#x27;s Sparkle collection again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many other Nubar polishes and have been thrilled with their quality.  I&#x27;m confused how this polish made it through quality testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a deep blue sparkle polish that will (possibly) last you for just the night, no longer, feel free to take the chance on this stuff.  If you expect to get 5-7 days out of your manicure...keep on looking</li>
    <li> I LOVE the color and sparkles.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear it again.  :-)  It even looks great on my short nails.</li>
    <li> The picture looks glossy and gives depth to the shimmer, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s gritty, like sandpaper. And much brighter. Perhaps putting it on over a black polish would get it closer to dark but still, not like the picture. I used this shade once to test it but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use it again. Total waste of money. :-(</li>
    <li> Great seller and great product.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the picture.  It&#x27;s watery and hard to see any color or sparkle.</li>
    <li> This polish is awful.  If does not go on well at all.  Its basically bad blue polish with glitter. FAIL!</li>
    <li> this was my second purchase of Nubar Nail Polish...LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BRAND and COLOR!! I bought this mainly because I saw it on a YouTube video on someone&#x27;s haul...it looked so fabulous that i had to get it...the price really was great and super fast shipping....</li>
    <li> The color is more matte when it goes on and not such a dark blue as shown in the picture</li>
    <li> I purchased Nubar Night Sparkle nail color because I&#x27;d heard very positive things about the brand and the cool and unique colors/effects that Nubar offers.  I also liked the inexpensive price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After starting out with Essie&#x27;s &amp;#34;Feed Me&amp;#34; base coat, I was very impressed with how easy the Nubar nail polish was to apply.  The brush was perfectly shaped to provide even color coverage and I only needed one coat of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give this polish 5 stars was because the color was not a shiny, glittery blue, as pictured, but more of a matte glitter denim color.  It still looked really neat, it just wasn&#x27;t what my expectation had been based on what was pictured.  Even after applying a high-shine top coat, the color remained matte in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the Nubar color was easy to remove with Acetone nail polish remove.  Unlike most glitter-based polishes, which require me to soak each finger for 30-60 seconds, the Nubar polish came right off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely try more by this brand.</li>
    <li> The color was exactly what was shown online and the shipping was great also. Definitely have to order this. I can&#x27;t wait to check out the other colors.</li>
    <li> so I swatched this real fast on one of my nails and in no time at all it was dry. Seriously that fast, awesome! The color reminds me of the color of David Bowie&#x27;s jacket in the ballroom scene from Labyrinth. Which I love. Great color, goes on smooth and dries fast. You can&#x27;t ask for much more in a nail polish.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s a good color of polish when even my husband stops to say \\&quot;Woah! I really like this one.\\&quot; I bought this for two reasons - the primary being it is the perfect color for a galaxy manicure that I want to attempt, and the second being that it&#x27;s a Nubar. I&#x27;ve always been ultimately impressed with Nubar&#x27;s polishes, and I own quite a few. This is no exception! It&#x27;s long lasting, not harsh on my nails (3 free and VEGAN of all things!), and spectacularly pigmented (without staining my nails). I love it! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great color and amazing coat. It is thick but it is very pretty. 5 stars all the way expecially the way it was packaged and managed to come on time.</li>
    <li> Well this is definatly not my favorite polish. The color is much darker than in the picture and the texture is horrible. It is very gritty and didn&#x27;t last two days with base and top coat.</li>
    <li> Unique and lovely color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really torn about this product. The biggest plus for it is that it drys VERY quickly. I mean, you put on a coat and it&#x27;s basically dry. The biggest minus to it is that unless you buy the special top coat to this nail polish, you are pretty much stuck with a really rough, not at all shiny polish. That being said, I DO have the top coat... which also dries quickly. While I like the color, I&#x27;m not in love with this product.</li>
    <li> Oh boy, where do I start. I love this color, and hate the application. It&#x27;s thick, gooey and difficult to work with. Will try to use thinner on it, it needs to lay down or you end up with chunky nail. I don&#x27;t like chunky nail. Nails should be sleek, perfect and shiney.</li>
    <li> VERY BEAUTIFUL AND SPARKLY BUT BE SURE TO APPLY TOPCOAT OR THIS WILL WEAR OFF QUICK! SHIMMERS LIKE A DREAM</li>
    <li> The nail polish is clumpy and does not go on smooth.  To get the right color you would need to put on at least 3 or 4 coats and even then it doesn&#x27;t dry fully. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the color polish but as I tried it on it was light and very clumpy.  I tried shaking the bottle but it still came out very clumpy.  dissapointed.</li>
