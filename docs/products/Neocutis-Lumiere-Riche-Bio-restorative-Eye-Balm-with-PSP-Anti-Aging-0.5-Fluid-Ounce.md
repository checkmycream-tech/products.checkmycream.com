      <li>So happy, at the office they wanted $100, here I got a steal, this product is amazing, in just a few short weeks it I can tell!!</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Amazon offers it for a much better price.</li>

      <li>Once I opened my new bottle, it worked fine for two days.  </li>
      <li>I like to try the latest products to see if they are better, but I have always come back to this because no other product comes close in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my skin look much younger</li>
    <li> This balm is good for keeping the skin around my eyes smooth and reduces puffiness.  Have been using this for a couple of years because I get good results without any eye irritation.</li>
    <li> I ordered the balm this time to see how it works compared to the cream. Seems to stay moist longer. Love it!</li>
    <li> I can tell when I do not use this product....it is great ....gets rid of lines around your eyes !</li>
    <li> very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Best eye balm on the market.  Rich and creamy.  Hydrates and eliminates dark circles.  Can use it underneath makeup and with contact lenses.</li>
    <li> Product does what it was made to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product based on the excellent reviews and it was even a referred by a friend who uses it as well. I used the product until it has come to an end and did not see any results. I have under eye circles, and I feel as if they have gotten worse since I have began using the product. I do not recommend this to anyone who may have to second guess.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream and I have tried a lot.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used - bar none.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this product &amp; especially the price on line!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best of the best!  I have tried them all from most expensive to least and this one with regular use works very well for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My plastic surgeon recommend this product and a friend who is a cosmetic Nurse also recommended this product for eye care.  It is not heavy by had growth factors that stimulate collegen so you eyes look amazing!</li>
    <li> The only thing that would make it better is if it actually made me younger. Takes all the fine lines out of my eyes . And hydrates the skin to look younger.</li>
    <li> After using the Neocutis Lumiere Riche Bio-restorative eye cream for two years, I decided to try this balm as a winter alternative.  It&#x27;s wonderful! A little goes a long way, too. I may switch back to the Lumiere Riche bio-restorative eye cream in the spring and summer months, but this is a great product when my skin needs more moisture. ALl Neocutis products are the best! I began using Neocutis based upon my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation, and thanks to Amazon&#x27;s pricing I can continue to use them.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I&#x27;m used so far -  really minimizes fine lines!</li>
    <li> I had a wrinkle on one of my eyelids from loose skin. I have been using this balm day and night for 6 months and its almost gone. It requires so little that one bottle has lasted a long time..maybe more than 6 months. Now I can delay that eye lift!</li>
    <li> Always a favorite eye cream.  I have never been disappointed spending the money on this product.  It makes the skin around my eyes feel soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for all the hype this products gets. I don&#x27;t mind paying a high price for a product that works, but in this case I feel let down.</li>
    <li> Love this product, best eye moisturizer I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream and is very affordable if bought on Amazon. I had an eye brow lift last year and my plastic surgeon recommended this line to help fade the scars on my eye lid. I love it because it does not irratate or dry out my eyes like other creams have down yet it is very moisturizing. I have bought the day and night creams too but this is by far my favorite in the line. The riche is thicker and for night and they make a lighter eye cream that is better for day under make up and I recommend both.</li>
    <li> Although expensive, this Eye Balm is built on science and not another high-priced cosmetic that does not deliver.  It was recommended to me by my Doctor and I use it daily.  You only need a very small amount - less than 1/2 pea size to apply around the eye area.  My skin is extremely sensitive and I do not have a negative reaction to this product.  It actually does make a difference on the wrinkles around the eye.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years after it was recommended by my dermatologist. It works to eliminate my fine lines (and I&#x27;m approaching 50).  I like to try the latest products to see if they are better, but I have always come back to this because no other product comes close in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, with rosacea and sometimes blepharitis. The &amp;#34;Riche&amp;#34; formulation, which is more hydrating, works better for me than the basic product. I experience no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Use this eye cream on a daily basis.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> Great for use around eyes does not cause irritation.</li>
    <li> I started seeing results within three days, and I don&#x27;t plan on stopping its use anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I have tried every eye cream on the market and this one has made a difference in my appearance.</li>
    <li> Love it! The dark circles under my eyes almost disappear- they are improved by 75% or more! I recommend even at the cost.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doc--love the results!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It was recommended by my esthetician and everything I&#x27;ve read about PSP is very positive.  This is my second bottle.  It is pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when my dermatologist suggested Neocutis eye cream especially since the product is so expensive. Amazon offers it for a much better price. I love this eye cream. The skin around my eyes plumps up and looks youthful in minutes.  I won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> My eyelids get really dry and flaky - not attractive. This is the only cream that helps keep them moisturized. It&#x27;s so good that now if I forget to put it on, it&#x27;s ok. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few months and am on my 2nd bottle. Great product and I can see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes...they are almost non existent . :)</li>
    <li> I like this for a night eye cream.  For those of us who are needing something with a little more moisture, this is perfect.  It is light, but more substantial and it absorbs quickly.  I also like that the applicator does not allow you to take more than you need.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. You can feel the softer skin in about a week of using product. No smell and not greasy formula.</li>
    <li> My wife claims it is the best product of it&#x27;s kind out there.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Lumiere by my Dermotoligist.  It fills out the skin around my eyes for a more youthful appearance.  It is expensive, but I only need a small drop.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream!!!  It&#x27;s soooo moisturizing!!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product many times in the past and loved it. But this time I developed allergies around the eyes. My eyes got red and very irritated from it. It is unbearable to use it, had to return. Thanks to Amazon great returning policy and customer service, I had no problems returning it.</li>
    <li> Sems to help with dark circles under eyes and crows feet.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this eye cream is wonderful, not greasy and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Use morning and night and wrinkles underneath the eyes are diminished.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream, have used it before after having many recommendations.</li>
    <li> Great under eye balm.  It is non irritating and smoothing!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s rich with moisturizers and leaves my skin soft. There is a brightness to the product which is great for aging skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it actually makes my eyes looks younger/brighter. will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist so I had high hopes.  After reading the reviews on this site, I eagerly purchased it and couldn&#x27;t wait to see the improvement in my skin.  Unfortunately, after several weeks of daily usage, I haven&#x27;t seen any change at all.  I guess it is one of those things where it works for some skin types but not all.  Too bad as it is pretty expensive not to work.</li>
    <li> Works great for puffy eyes</li>
    <li> I swear by this cream</li>
    <li> The cream was recommended by my Doctor and I have been using it for a while now,.&lt;br /&gt;it is not very thick but it is very effective.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I ever used.  Moist enough to keep fine lines not showing &amp; yet not greasy that concealer melts off.  Keeps swelling away after sleep to.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. Only gave 4 star because Haven&#x27;t used for very long to know if is going to help with puffiness and lines. It feels very nourishing. So far like it better than some of the other things I&#x27;ve tried and price point better than some.</li>
    <li> feels great on my dry eyes.  was recomened by many peope (2 derms and a med spa person).  This is the best price i have seen</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in the wrinkles and texture below my eyes immediately.  So glad my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Nothing yet.  Gave it two stars because I like the consistency.  Hasn&#x27;t done anything for any fine lines yet. Will keep using it in the hopes that it will.</li>
    <li> I am not someone who can spend this much money on skin care products.  The prices of some of these products really is insane. I have searched and tried so many other products cheaper than this, but there is absolutely nothing that compares.  I keep coming back to this.  Love it!  Hydrates to diminish my fine lines around my eyes, and eliminates puffiness.  The best!!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and visibly reduces lines and creases. I used to dread looking at my eyes in the morning until I discovered this. The \\&quot;riche\\&quot; is definitely better. Expensive but worth the money.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple of years at night. Helps puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... have been using it for 2 years and definitely see improvement in the fine wrinkles</li>
    <li> Will never use any other product! This is amazing</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this amazing eye cream, and I would not do without it!  This eye cream is one that actually works!  I have visibly seen wrinkles around my eyes disappear.  Though it&#x27;s expensive, I highly recommend this to anyone who is searching for that &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; eye wrinkle cream.  A little goes a long way with this product, so making it last is a real plus.</li>
    <li> so much cheaper than buying at a local office. product works great!!</li>
    <li> So happy, at the office they wanted $100, here I got a steal, this product is amazing, in just a few short weeks it I can tell!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for years.  Once I opened my new bottle, it worked fine for two days.  Now there is a clear oily substance coming out instead of the white.  After using for a week, I can see that my skin is changing around my eyes.  It is not working or the bottle has been replaced with something else!</li>
    <li> I think this is Magic!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from my dermatologist.  It is a very good and pricey skincare line sold in the office.  I am glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream</li>
    <li> This eye balm really moisturizers the skin around my eyes.  This is my  first time to purchase but buy again.</li>
    <li> both products arrived in excellent condition with the manufacturing seal on them.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I first bought this at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and after years of spending thousands on eye creams in department stores I will never go back. What a waste all my life! Save yourself the money and the grief and get this Eye Balm by Neocutis.  I could tell a difference in one day. It is prescription grade and you can tell. My eyes looked rested, and more smooth the very next morning after my first application. I use this morning an evening now and it took years of aging, being tired and worry off of my face. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Best eye cream ever and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> It had to be returned. Not appropriate for my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but actually comparable to a LOT of other products price-wise.  Seems to help with the fine wrinkles.  Does not irritate my skin, which is a problem for me.</li>
    <li> The Riche Bio-restorative Eye Balm helps reduce fine lines and swelling around eyes over night.&lt;br /&gt; I also use the Lumiere Bio-restorative Eye Cream in am to help reduce fine lines and to help keep the sensitive eye area hydrated.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, softens fine lines around eyes.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream ever...and a tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I wouldn&#x27;t normally rave about stuff like this, but this cream is great. It has really made a visible difference. I noticed an improvement after a few weeks, and the change has become more dramatic after 3 months. All the little bumps and unevenness under my eyes is nearly gone. This stuff has also worked great on my dark circles from too much stress and not enough sleep.</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommended by my dermatologist. Much more convenient to order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Light and effective...results seen in only three weeks....lines become less prominent and skin more moist....use it solely without any topical eye make-up concealer...recommendation by my dermatologist ...great value on line vs. $90+ at MD&#x27;s office</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! really works</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  It caused irritation and redness to the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;A very expensive mistake.</li>
