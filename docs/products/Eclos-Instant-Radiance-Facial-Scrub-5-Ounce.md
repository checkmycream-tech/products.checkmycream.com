      <li>My favorite scrub off all time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to be able to purchase it online.</li>

      <li>The thing I love most about the Eclos line is the scent.</li>
      <li>I love this product and the rest of the eclos brand :)</li>
      <li>So after a rotten day at the office, I love to take my time with it.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Very good scrub, it actually make you feel like your skin has been scrub.</li>
      <li>I bought the whole line of these products, and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love love love this scrub so much that I subscribe.  </li>
      <li>this is hands down the best brand out there for skin care.  </li>
      <li>This is a great scrub you can use daily.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy Eclos products.</li>
      <li>By the time you finish scrubbing, 30 seconds or so, the consistency has turned into a smooth lotion.</li>
      <li>If you must exfoliate, make it gentle but effective.  </li>
      <li>It warms as it&#x27;s applied, so it feel fantastic.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin so smooth and keeps my clogged pores at bay.</li>
      <li>The cream is also fantastic.</li>
      <li>I originally bought it at Target, but they must have pulled the product, but Amazon has the cheapest price I can find.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of cleansing, though if you have somewhat sensitive skin as I do, you really wouldn&#x27;t want to use it more than once a week or so.</li>
      <li>The thing I like about this stuff is that the minute it hits your skin it has warming effect which opens pores to enable the scrub to clean them out.  </li>
      <li>My face feels refreshed and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>At first I liked it because the grit was very significant for exfoliation, but something in this did not sit right with my skin, as I started to look much older.</li>
      <li>This scrub makes my face so incredibly soft and clean feeling, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I love this product and product line so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as thIe SAME product I buy in Rite Aid...</li>
      <li>I stopped using Eclos for a while because Rite Aid stopped stocking the full range.</li>
      <li>My friend gave the the last of her tube to try, she loved this product so much, and I am so glad she did.</li>
      <li>Not a lot, but enough to feel good on your face.</li>
      <li>The ingredients in this product are sold in more name brand products for a lot more money, and to be honest, with less quality!</li>
      <li>I love the slight warming effect and it smells good too.</li>
      <li>I quickly rinsed my face with cool water because it felt like it was on fire.</li>
      <li>I use this in conjunction with a home microdermabrasion wand every other day and it greatly reduces acne and smooths out my complexion.</li>
      <li>Love that it heats up, making it more conducive for pores to open up.  </li>
      <li>It is a very fine grain scrub, not harsh, that leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth, ready for serum or moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
      <li>Great product, wash well with a little bit tingling on the skin, feels a little oily(works great for</li>
      <li>This scrub really cleans and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a nice facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>Not some barely-there granules, but actual salt-type scrub that will dissolve nicely as you add water.</li>
      <li>but this is by far my favorite product that I keep returning to buy.</li>
      <li>This scrub feels so clean on my face and it leaves it feeling really clean and soft!</li>
      <li>It starts off warm on your skin, and then as you polish the fine grit it starts to dissipate along with all those dead skin cells.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping...</li>
      <li>I received this product very fast</li>
      <li>gives a little tingle, nice clean smell that&#x27;s not fruity or perfumey.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a good idea to maybe try the travel pack out and start using the whole line at once as everything works to benefit each other.</li>
      <li>I can instantly feel a smoother, more supple skin tone after using it.</li>
      <li>Seems like you need a lot to clean your face completely.</li>
      <li>My face is always soft and smooth and I feel like it&#x27;s thanks to this product-</li>
      <li>dry skin)but wash well and leaves skin very smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>The older you get the better your skin looks on a daily exfoliator regime.</li>
      <li>I have never actively saught out a skin care product if a store doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore, but this one is worth it!</li>
      <li>Minor inconvenience for such a good product.</li>
      <li>This scrubs content tasted like salt and had large chunks in it that scratched my face.</li>
      <li>Works great, because the next day I broke out in a few pimples...</li>
      <li>As I say, my roommate absolutely loves this scrub.</li>
      <li>Its very abrasive.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I really found my go-to scrub.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t so much of a problem, because it&#x27;s still just as</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the heat in this product feels great.  It appears to make my skin smoother.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub twice a week, and my skin feels wonderful.  I&#x27;m 66 years old.  This product seems to get all the old dead skin off and leaves my face looking radiant.</li>
    <li> Very good scrub, it actually make you feel like your skin has been scrub. I have tried many other scrubs and most of them do not clean my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you scrub your face with this product your skin look and feels clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
    <li> I stopped using Eclos for a while because Rite Aid stopped stocking the full range. what a mistake.  this is hands down the best brand out there for skin care.  I&#x27;m going to stock up again on all of their products via amazon.  had forgotten what a world of difference this paired with the mask and night cream makes to my skin.</li>
    <li> Great scrub. Not some barely-there granules, but actual salt-type scrub that will dissolve nicely as you add water.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scrub! It makes my skin so smooth and keeps my clogged pores at bay. I love the slight warming effect and it smells good too. I am so glad I discovered this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome for cleaning blackheads on your poors.  I use it in the shower and scrub my nose.  No blackheads.</li>
    <li> My store doesn&#x27;t sell this product anymore. Very bad situation, because it&#x27;s been my sole go-to scrub since 2012. I&#x27;m glad to be able to purchase it online. It&#x27;s the only scrub I know of that actually SCRUBS at a worthy price. I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s changed a bit since my last few purchases, along with the packaging. This isn&#x27;t so much of a problem, because it&#x27;s still just as effective-- but I did notice that the grit used to be the teensiest bit bigger in the past. Who knows, maybe it&#x27;s just me. But it still blows all the other scrubs away.  UPDATE: Removed two stars due to the price spike. I&#x27;m not paying $30 for this scrub when it used to be $13. Warning other online shoppers!</li>
    <li> I have been using Eclos Instant Radiance Facial Scrub for over a year and like the smooth feeling it leaves, like a micro dermabrasion everytime I use it.  It is a very fine grain scrub, not harsh, that leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth, ready for serum or moisturizer. It has a faint pleasant smell.  My main complaint is the scrub does not easily come out of the squeeze tube.  I have to shake it down to the opening, but when you may think it is empty, cut the end of the tube off and you will find over half left in the tube.  I use it from there and just wrap in a little bag after use.  Minor inconvenience for such a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product, wash well with a little bit tingling on the skin, feels a little oily(works great for dry skin)but wash well and leaves skin very smooth and silky. Definitively recommend this product.</li>
    <li> gives a little tingle, nice clean smell that&#x27;s not fruity or perfumey.  my skin definitely looks brighter after use.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the price, especially when you compare it to other convenience store facial scrubs that are only a few dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel it warming up as soon as it touches your skin, which is awesome. I use this in conjunction with a home microdermabrasion wand every other day and it greatly reduces acne and smooths out my complexion. My face is always soft and smooth and I feel like it&#x27;s thanks to this product- I can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
    <li> This is the most unusual facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m still not sure if I like it. My roommate loves it, though. You put a quarter-sized amount in your hand, and when you rub your hands together a bit, it actually heats up. Not a lot, but enough to feel good on your face. It does a good job of cleansing, though if you have somewhat sensitive skin as I do, you really wouldn&#x27;t want to use it more than once a week or so. It&#x27;s not a lightweight sugar scrub but definitely salt-based, as is obvious when you rinse. I find myself almost overwhelmed by the saltiness of the rinse. Your mileage may vary though. As I say, my roommate absolutely loves this scrub.</li>
    <li> My friend gave the the last of her tube to try, she loved this product so much, and I am so glad she did. What a difference! I can instantly feel a smoother, more supple skin tone after using it. My 40 year old skin feels like a baby&#x27;s behind. It starts off warm on your skin, and then as you polish the fine grit it starts to dissipate along with all those dead skin cells. By the time you finish scrubbing, 30 seconds or so, the consistency has turned into a smooth lotion. I really don&#x27;t know how they do the warming effect and the disappearing grit, but it has a wonderful result. I would say that my forehead and side mouth lines look less noticeable after using the product for two weeks. But do be careful about getting it in your eyes, it did sting a bit when I did this once. Going to give this to all of my girlfriends for Christmas and pass along the joy.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub along with its companion facial soap. My pores are shrinking, and I have less and less oil and blackheads. I originally bought it at Target, but they must have pulled the product, but Amazon has the cheapest price I can find.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because this is the best skin care product I have ever found. It actually works .</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial scrub.  The product melts away so there are no small beads falling in your drain.  Smells great and my skin feels great after.</li>
    <li> The eclos line of skincare products are all exemplary, and this scrub is no exception. I use it every other day, as suggested on the tube. I have never experienced any problems with over drying or irritation, and I love the fresh scent (true of the entire line).</li>
    <li> One of the best exfoliators I have tried. Other comparable products are two to 3 times the price. Arrive in a timely manner. Would order again</li>
    <li> Its very abrasive. You don&#x27;t want to get this in your eyes or your mouth. Doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. Seems like you need a lot to clean your face completely. Not sure if it even works. Wont be buying this again</li>
    <li> THE best I love all eclos products</li>
    <li> Part of my bedtime face routine.</li>
    <li> The older you get the better your skin looks on a daily exfoliator regime. I got the travel pack of Eclos skin products and starting using the whole line at one start. The thing I like about this stuff is that the minute it hits your skin it has warming effect which opens pores to enable the scrub to clean them out.  I had previously used an  apricot scrub before and my skin lady said it was creating tiny tears in my skin and causing it to constantly peel so I switched to this stuff which has a smoother abrasion PLUS heats up your skin.  When I ran out of the sample scrub,  I bought the big tube and continued using the whole line from the travel pack.  My skin is smoother, more even in tone.  I will have to give a 5 stars on the whole line. I use the eye cream at night as well as a eye make up remover, doing double duty.  If you must exfoliate, make it gentle but effective.  I think it&#x27;s a good idea to maybe try the travel pack out and start using the whole line at once as everything works to benefit each other. High five to Eclos for plant based beauty.</li>
    <li> Tengo 2 años usando productos eclos especial mentor este al contacts con la piel se calienta es como si se activara a mis hermanos lea encanto y lo Compran ahora.</li>
    <li> I bought the whole line of these products, and I am very pleased. I use this scrub a few times a week. It is not drying or irritating, and it makes the serum and other products work better.</li>
    <li> My favorite scrub off all time. I hope that Eclos never discontinues it.</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever used and I have used a lot trying too find one I liked. I tried this one and I was sold</li>
    <li> Really enjoy Eclos products. I have sensitive skin so I prefer no parabans, sulfates etc. This scrub really cleans and leaves my skin smooth. Definitely will be using this product as a part of my skin care regimen. It&#x27;s tough to find something my skin won&#x27;t react to and I really found my go-to scrub.</li>
    <li> I love this product and product line so much. The cream is also fantastic. This is a great scrub you can use daily. It warms as it&#x27;s applied, so it feel fantastic. I&#x27;ve spent as much as $90 on other exfoliants and have not been as happy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as thIe SAME product I buy in Rite Aid... the one I purchased from Amazon seems to be more watered down.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this product are sold in more name brand products for a lot more money, and to be honest, with less quality! Most skin scrubs are very drying to my face, and can sometimes be slightly painful, but not this product. It really does leave your skin feeling very clean but not tight or dry like other skin scrubs can. I have never actively saught out a skin care product if a store doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore, but this one is worth it! I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I chose this product because when I clicked on anti-age and oily skin this popped up. I have used this only twice and I can say this feels great on the skin. It smells like something you use to wipe windows with but it doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin very long. My face feels refreshed and squeaky clean. I have major oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 years old and female if that helps any.&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO bought the CLAY MASK as well and used it once so far. My skin felt the same way as when I used the facial wash.  The only thing I would suggest is to not use the clay mask right after washing with facial scrub. It kind of over dried my face. I would wait an hour or so. But over all good product and will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great!  Super fast shipping...Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it zero stars. I was excited to use this product due to the reviews. (WRONG!!!!) I received this product very fast i used it the same night upon first use on my face my face was tingling and turned red. I quickly rinsed my face with cool water because it felt like it was on fire. Once I rinsed it my face was very tender and red so I put some vaseline on it to sooth the burn. I then went to sleep and when I woke up and looked in the mirror I had a BIG BROWNISH/RED SPOT ON MY FACE!!!!! This has NEVER happened to me (EVER!!!). I HAD TO GO TO WALGREEN&#x27;S PHARMACY TO GET A OINTMENT TO HELP HEAL MY FACE. It is two weeks later and it has heal however I now have a BROWN SCAR ON MY FACE and Eclos Instant Radiance Facial Scrub is in the garbage. I now am back to using my Aveeno. And NO I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The thing I love most about the Eclos line is the scent. I see some complaints about it here. But I love it! It&#x27;s Ylang Ylang, which is well known for it&#x27;s aromatherapy benefits. Removing stress. Relaxation. Bringing joy. Also good for acne, which I don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a warming scrub. So after a rotten day at the office, I love to take my time with it. I also find it great on the eczema I have on both elbows. Soothing and healing.</li>
    <li> The microbeads do a very nice job of exfoliating and polishing my skin.</li>
    <li> I love Eclos products and was tired of paying high prices in my local stores. This scrub makes my face so incredibly soft and clean feeling, it&#x27;s amazing. This is a great product and great buy!</li>
    <li> the product arrived when the sender said it would. there were no issues or complications with the ordering of the product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a gentle enough anti aging face scrub that had a warming sensation when you put it on.  Something about the warming feels relaxing and luxurious but I also wanted it to be good for my face and anti-aging and this has had a good effect on my skin.  I don&#x27;t always use the whole eclos line which I do like but this is by far my favorite product that I keep returning to buy.</li>
    <li> Not too sure about this product. Seems to have a lot of salt in it and sorry to say my face aged while using this product. (I&#x27;m 45) At first I liked it because the grit was very significant for exfoliation, but something in this did not sit right with my skin, as I started to look much older. I thought I had just turned a page in the aging department ;(  but once I stopped using it, I went back to my younger looking self.</li>
    <li> This scrub does not dissolve like Eclos Instant Radiance Facial - plant cell original scrub. This scrubs content tasted like salt and had large chunks in it that scratched my face. Fraud.</li>
    <li> Traveling back and forth from high altitude conditions my skin takes a beating. Eclos facial scrub is&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY scrub that can finely tune my skin texture and open up the pores to hydration. Love this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
    <li> Love this self heating stuff!  Works great, because the next day I broke out in a few pimples...which means it&#x27;s exfoliating top layer and getting stuff underneath to come out.  Love that it heats up, making it more conducive for pores to open up.  Feels like expensive product.</li>
    <li> This scrub feels so clean on my face and it leaves it feeling really clean and soft! I love this product and the rest of the eclos brand :)</li>
    <li> Love love love this! Using the Eclos system has made my 47 year old skin look years younger after just 3 or so weeks of use: my skin is hydrated, little lines less noticeable, ruddiness calmed, and generally brightened. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Love love love this scrub so much that I subscribe.  Leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  Also it heats up a little as you use it (a result of the salt scrub dissolving in water)--fantastic.</li>
    <li> And...I&#x27;ve used the best names around.  Please do not be fooled by the price...really great stuff.  I use this and the cleanser from this line.</li>
    <li> This scrub is hard to find in stores, but of course Amazon has it!  It&#x27;s soft enough for every other day, but hard enough to exfoliate all the nasty dry skin I have on my face.  I love it.  I get so many compliments on my skin now, and I feel great!!  It has a pleasant texture and smell, and I like the heating sensation it has.  If you&#x27;re feeling like it&#x27;s too harsh, scrub more gently and slower.  My one complaint is the packaging--you can&#x27;t get all the scrub out of the tube at the end. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Bought this product with high hopes from other reviewers, but didn&#x27;t like the smell at all!  And the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; was really odd - didn&#x27;t like it.  Weird.  And then when it gets in your mouth a bit (which happens when you&#x27;re scrubbing your face), the &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; lingered for 15minutes after washing.  All bad.  I threw this product in the garbage after only a few uses.  Avoid.</li>
