      <li>Cute color.</li>
      <li>and i will be ordering more shades asap.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite lip product.</li>
      <li>Its the perfect shade of red.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I gave this as a gift and my friend love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>It is a VERY bright red.</li>
      <li>The color itself lasts for about a couple of hours, but the texture of the tint is very interesting, when you first put it on it kinda feels greasy</li>
      <li>It does last for a good amount of time throughout the day, but you might want to put some kind of balm over it since it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide moisture to the lips.</li>
      <li>Love it got here faster than I though t super happy will definitely buy again</li>
      <li>and I quite enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>I had to order the full size immediately.</li>
      <li>The color is very cherry and cute, but needs to put on with care.</li>
      <li>Its such a good product&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Its a nice cherry red and is easily worn.</li>
      <li>It lasts quite awhile, but might need to be reapplied a couple times throughout the day if you want it to be as strong as it was when first applied.</li>
      <li>The color pays off well, sometimes too well; it can get a bit bold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product thus far since it gives a nice tint to the lips while still making you look natural.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product because the color is build-able, it smells like cherries, and the formula is watery at first but then dries up like a lip tint should.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quickly become my new favorite lip product of all time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Beautiful, natural, long-lasting colour, works on lips and cheeks, seems noncosmedogenic, and it&#x27;s extremely affordable.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty lip tint.</li>
      <li>I still really really like this product!</li>
      <li>I thought it was more of a red shade</li>
      <li>It is cute and very red.</li>
      <li>I wish it doesn&#x27;t come off every time I eat or drink but for what it&#x27;s worth, I really like the effect that it gives while it lasts.</li>
      <li>at first its quite watery on the lips</li>
      <li>You do have to use a few layers if you want it that bright, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on forever, and no, it&#x27;s not a gloss, so not moisturizing.</li>
      <li>the grease/shine comes off very easily and the product becomes dry and matte.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very bright red (almost hot pink) and looks amazing on against pale skin.</li>
      <li>This is more of a pinky red than a true red in my opinion, but a gorgeous color none the less!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite liquidy but it stains your lips very well.</li>
      <li>One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it isn&#x27;t very hygienic to put it on your lips and then your cheeks because you could spread bacteria...</li>
      <li>, It doesn&#x27;t wear off much, but when it does it the lip tint is still visible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Yet, it does feel very lightweight as if you aren&#x27;t wearing anything on your lips at all.</li>
      <li>I really like the color of this one.</li>
      <li>I really like how it came with samples</li>
      <li>I apply occasionally, it depends if you drink much or eat, or maybe sweat , i apply two times only, but my sister need to apply more time.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more from them in the future.</li>
      <li>I love the color so much, I wear it everyday</li>
      <li>Also, the seller is very sweet and left a note along with several samples in the box for me when the product arrived.</li>
      <li>I like to wear it on days when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on much makeup and it really makes a difference with the red pop of color.</li>
      <li>It looks more lacure type tint that the other one in the long tube I tried.</li>
      <li>so I try to take it out and put it onto my finger to apply (instead of putting the wand directly on my lips).</li>
      <li>yet it somehow looks natural, in that it doesn&#x27;t look too neon or anything like that.</li>
      <li>A few small dots patted in and distributed with fingers usually works best.</li>
      <li>But I noticed that you should put this on your bare lips because if you put this on top of your concealed/foundation covered lips, it mixes together with the foundation and turns all weird.</li>
      <li>This could be good or bad, depending on what you want.</li>

<li> It has almost a pastel red color, which almost looks pink.</li>
<li> Lastly in order to get the color as vibrant as the bottle you have to add about 2-3 layers, it looks quite subtle with one layer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is amazing! One of my favs from etude house, after you put it on its immoveable no matter what you do, whether its eating or drinking! The color itself lasts for about a couple of hours, but the texture of the tint is very interesting, when you first put it on it kinda feels greasy and it looks shiny, however as soon as you eat, drink, or simply touch your lips the grease/shine comes off very easily and the product becomes dry and matte. Aside from that there is nothing else that is weird about this product. Lastly in order to get the color as vibrant as the bottle you have to add about 2-3 layers, it looks quite subtle with one layer.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty lip tint.Its the perfect shade of red.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. Long lasting though</li>
    <li> Love this color on my lips! Though it doesn&#x27;t last that long, you have to keep applying . Over all great product! ^.^</li>
    <li> I really like the color of this one. I would buy again! :)</li>
    <li> I love, love this lip tint. It&#x27;s so hydrating and doesn&#x27;t make my lips look dull and dry. I wish it doesn&#x27;t come off every time I eat or drink but for what it&#x27;s worth, I really like the effect that it gives while it lasts. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Its such a good product&lt;br /&gt;And I really like how it came with samples&lt;br /&gt;The color is very cute</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this a few weeks ago when i ordered a tony moly moisturizer and I became obsessed! I had to order the full size immediately. it&#x27;s a very bright red (almost hot pink) and looks amazing on against pale skin. at first its quite watery on the lips but it dries into a stain and stays on all day, even after eating and drinking. it&#x27;s quickly become my new favorite lip product of all time and i will be ordering more shades asap.</li>
    <li> Love this brand, the product is great and the color is perfect!</li>
    <li> this tint is what you would expect. I have it in red. Its a nice cherry red and is easily worn. I have trouble wearing red lipstick because it makes me look like a clown. This tint is red, but subtle enough for me to pull off. It lasts quite awhile, but might need to be reapplied a couple times throughout the day if you want it to be as strong as it was when first applied.</li>
    <li> It has almost a pastel red color, which almost looks pink. IT will stay for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product thus far since it gives a nice tint to the lips while still making you look natural. I like to wear it on days when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on much makeup and it really makes a difference with the red pop of color. The one thing I would suggest is that if you do want to use this to create a gradient effect on the lips, I would use a Q-Tip to blend it out from the inner to the outer portion of the lip since this product tends to stain the fingers. It does last for a good amount of time throughout the day, but you might want to put some kind of balm over it since it doesn&#x27;t seem to provide moisture to the lips. Yet, it does feel very lightweight as if you aren&#x27;t wearing anything on your lips at all. It should also be noted that this product has a lovely cherry scent to it, which is very fitting and I quite enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> Nice color and not drying. Lasts about 1-2 hours... I wish the applicator is a brush so it will be eaiser to apply.</li>
    <li> very nice color and it lasts longer than the other etude house dear darling tint. though the taste is terrible (but the taste goes away after it dries)</li>
    <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s versatile and can be used on cheeks and lips. It&#x27;s a pretty flushed color but be careful because a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s easy to go overboard and hard to remove. A few small dots patted in and distributed with fingers usually works best.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and my friend love it. I might buy this again as a gift.</li>
    <li> The color is very bright! Must be careful when applying it on because it can stain everything. But I like how the color is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Weird bitter taste to the tint... Not sure if it&#x27;s a fluke with the one I received or if it&#x27;s just standard. It tints for a while but eventually rubs off after consuming foods/liquids.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite lip product. It is a VERY bright red. You do have to use a few layers if you want it that bright, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on forever, and no, it&#x27;s not a gloss, so not moisturizing. But you can use it for blush and lip tint. For me it&#x27;s SO flattering, and it&#x27;s something I wear just about every day in all seasons!! I had this on one day when I went into the gym after work and like every guy&#x27;s head turned!! yet it somehow looks natural, in that it doesn&#x27;t look too neon or anything like that. I just wish it was cheaper...One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it isn&#x27;t very hygienic to put it on your lips and then your cheeks because you could spread bacteria...so I try to take it out and put it onto my finger to apply (instead of putting the wand directly on my lips).</li>
    <li> This works amazingly as a cheek tint, too, and not just for lips! It has killer staying power, as well. I accidentally slept with it on my lips and it looked just as bright when I woke up. Downside: slightly drying, but feels odd and slightly runny/greasy on lips at first.</li>
    <li> The tint is awesome but seller don&#x27;t even send one sample.</li>
    <li> Its alright. The color pays off well, sometimes too well; it can get a bit bold. But I noticed that you should put this on your bare lips because if you put this on top of your concealed/foundation covered lips, it mixes together with the foundation and turns all weird.</li>
    <li> It is cute and very red. I couldn&#x27;t get it off, even with makeup remover. This could be good or bad, depending on what you want. It got it at night and it was cute I had to test it immediately, but I couldn&#x27;t remove it fully.  Woke up still looking like I had just sucked on a cherry popsicle.   It tastes fruity.  It looks more lacure type tint that the other one in the long tube I tried. So it&#x27;s not like using a magic marker. The color is very cherry and cute, but needs to put on with care. I tossed it. I like lasting but not like that.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love it got here faster than I though t super happy will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Tried a sample of this and it was amazing!  Beautiful, natural, long-lasting colour, works on lips and cheeks, seems noncosmedogenic, and it&#x27;s extremely affordable.  I love it!</li>
    <li> nice color and i love the way it looks on my lips..this will be great for my cosplays</li>
    <li> The color is a beautiful bright cherry red. It&#x27;s quite liquidy but it stains your lips very well. Color pay off is amazing and it tints your lip for about 4 hours including eating and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got some free samples with my order! Amazing korean product. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful on. Like the others say it is a bit drying (like most stains or tints) so I put lip balm on before and wait a few minutes then put it on.</li>
    <li> I love the color and tge smell. Well packed with really good samples from the seller.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product because the color is build-able, it smells like cherries, and the formula is watery at first but then dries up like a lip tint should. But it sometimes does not give me the gradient lip that im looking for because it is hard to blend and fade. I still really really like this product!</li>
    <li> Cute color. Ship fast.good!</li>
    <li> I apply occasionally, it depends if you drink much or eat, or maybe sweat , i apply two times only, but my sister need to apply more time. i like it, the texture and how the lips looks is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is more of a pinky red than a true red in my opinion, but a gorgeous color none the less! Minus on star for staying ability, especially since it is sold as a tint. The color lasts no more than 3 hours on me, but I actually don&#x27;t mind reapplying and it really is less drying compared to other brands. Also, the seller is very sweet and left a note along with several samples in the box for me when the product arrived. I thought this was a nice touch and they seem very sweet! I will definitely be ordering more from them in the future.</li>
    <li> the lip tint consistency wasn&#x27;t wearable for me, it had a weird taste and was an unpleasant experience. overall I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This lip stain is so adorable! I am a sucker for red lip products!  So I just HAD to buy this when I saw it! I love it it stains onto your lips withen seconds and it stays on for a while! The color is red obviously! And I love love love it! It&#x27;s so pretty! I ordered the other ones too. Still waiting for them to arrive! I love etude house. They are so cute!</li>
    <li> A lot pinker than i thought it was going to be! I thought it was more of a red shade but it is still very lovely!</li>
    <li> I love the color so much, I wear it everyday, It doesn&#x27;t wear off much, but when it does it the lip tint is still visible.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it,&lt;br /&gt;Etude House rocks.</li>
