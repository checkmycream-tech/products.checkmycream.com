      <li>Nice try.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I JUST GOT MY NO NO AND USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, OR SHOULD I SAY TRIED TO USE IT? THIS WILL NOT REMOVE YOUR HAIR EVEN TEMPORARILY, IT WILL TAKE YOU AT LEAST AN HOUR TO TRY WORKING ON ONE ARM UNTIL YOU BECAME EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AND JUST GIVE UP. THE SMELL OF BURNED HAIR IS DISGUSTING AND THE WORSE PART IS SINCE IT DOESN&#x27;T REALLY REMOVE YOUR HAIR IT JUST BURNS THE ENDS OF IT, THAT&#x27;S WHERE THE SMELLS COME FROM. NOTICE THEY OFFER A BUFFER THAT COMES IN THE KIT, THAT BUFFER SERVES TO BASICALLY FILE THE TOP OF YOUR SKIN TO TRY TO REMOVE THE BURNED HAIR THAT IS STILL ATTACHED TO YOUR SKIN. I WILL RETURN THIS IMMEDIATELY AND WILL KEEP UP WITH MY WAXING AND EVENTUALLY LASER.</li>
    <li> i bought a nono plus for my mother for her upper lip but the attatchment is to big for that aera can anyone tell me if you can buy the smaller attachment for the upper lip thankyou</li>
    <li> My wife likes the way it works.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial. It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is nothing like it claims. First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing). When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming. I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result. To treat an area sized 2-3 inches I needed to spend several hours. It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway. The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial. I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;5) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial. (Sigh....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> This did not work! Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> It is pretty much useless. I could grey rid of the hairs faster with tweezers.</li>
    <li> DO not buy this product, I have had to replace it six times already.</li>
    <li> Rename this product the ZAP...  it makes a lot of smoke, as it burns a hole in ones wallet.  A total waste of time and money if you are a guy and want facial hair gone.  On the plus side, the NO No smoothing cream is worth its weight.  Love the feeling.</li>
    <li> This is not amazing... sure it removes some face hair but not those hard occasional ones.&lt;br /&gt;To stop using it now will probably have the same impact on regrowth that using an actual&lt;br /&gt;shaver would have had and that sucks. Hair does not stay gone. The cream included has&lt;br /&gt;wicked ingredients that you absolutely don&#x27;t want on your skin absorbing into your body!!&lt;br /&gt;I should have stayed using a tweezer and some wax. And this is female hair so can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;imagine any results for males would be better. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to recieve this device. The first month it ended up breaking down on me so I called and had it replace the third month the band broke again and I had it replaced. So far I have been using this product for a year and all I have recieved out of it is course hair warning never use it on the face your hair will grow in darker and courser. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was very dissatisfied in this product. I tried it faithfully and Patiently and as described in the instructions and the product web page as well as on the TV. I used it for the two months as recommended. It did not remove the hair. It seemed to melt some of it to skin level, and the next day it was back. I did not \\&quot;Get sexy, smooth, touchable skin that lasts and lasts with the no!no!&#x27; as promised. I am very disappointed, because it would have been wonderful if it did work. I emailed the NONO Company, from their web page, to ask advice, and did not receive a response.&lt;br /&gt;EVEN WORSE, Amazon did not stand by the guarantee that&#x27;s advertised. They accepted return of the product, but did not credit my account for the full purchase price. So, along with my disappointment, I feel deceived and cheated.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my no!no!, no more bumps on my face and no more ingrown hairs that come with using tweezers and other methods of hair removal. It is easy to use and takes only seconds. I like to use it every other day on my face and about once a week on my legs. One of the nicest gifts I have received!</li>
    <li> I am blonde and laser hair removal does not work. I was looking for something that would work well and without irritation. This does not do anything they say it does. In fact, I don&#x27;t believe it removes ANY hair at all. They say you need to let your hair get to a certain length before you use it. I even tried that, but who does that??</li>
    <li> Ive had my No No for about a year or so and I love it. I use to have alot of blond hair on the sides of my cheeks, NOT ANY MORE!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t perform as advertised and for the price, it is a dud. It is difficult to use and with no results that last, it is a dud.</li>
    <li> Totally ripped off. Didn&#x27;t work even close to what was advertised. I gave it to the Goodwill.&lt;br /&gt;I say no no to the no no!</li>
    <li> I bought the NO-No because I didn&#x27;t want to shave my legs anymore. On the No-No commercials, they made it sound like that was what would happen. It has only worked for my arms. It won&#x27;t work on my leg hair at all. I kept it only because it worked on my arms and I have used it on my daughter&#x27;s back. It costs way too much to not work EVERYWHERE!</li>
    <li> This product seemed to work at first. I could smell burning hair when I used it, but I later noticed that it left quite a bit of hair on my face. I have very fine \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; and thought it would be easy to remove, but the longer I used it, the less hair it removed. The tip also keeps jumping in and out. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or not but I can never get anyone to respond to me. I even got new tips but the same thing happened. What a huge disappointment!!</li>
    <li> After using the NO!NO!I can say it works. I would recommend this product to all my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> It is not as great as I had hoped but it does an okay job. I do wish it worked a little bit better.</li>
    <li> You have a better chance of your hair coming off with a flashlight. I followed the directions to the T, and ....... nothing, by the time you realize it is a huge piece of shit, your warranty is over and it&#x27;s too late to get your money back.  Don&#x27;t even think about buying it!</li>
    <li> I reviewed everything that I could find about the NoNO.  Everything seemed to say that it worked great for men.  Soooo, I bought it.  I am a getting to the point that I would like to not have some of the hair on my shoulders and neck area that seems to be popping up as I get older.  This thing didn&#x27;t even come close to working.  When you ran it across the hair, you could smell the hair burning, but nothing changed.  I tried it consistently for about a month and gave up.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It is a very expensive scam.</li>
    <li> The product does not work whatsoever on facial hair.  Have to be a certain length for it to work and who wants to let your facial hair get that long!  Works better on long leg hair, but again, it doesn&#x27;t work on the shorter hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!  Wish I had used it during the trial period so I could have gotten my money back!</li>
    <li> Wish i could have left the star park blank as it is a zero star...or negative star product. very interesting to see soooooo many people with the same feelings on this product. it was all hype...push it as fast as possible and sell as much as possible before people realize what a waste it is. Not even worth it for 10 bucks!! didn&#x27;t work at all, can not use for face at all, stopped working after first 5 minutes, very poor product AND didn&#x27;t get money back refund as they claim they will provide. SCAM!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband purchased the No-No Hair Removal Kit for my Christmas present last year! I read and viewed all the instructions along with the helpful hints. Using a scented candle while using No-No is a great idea!  The instructions say to use it twice a week in the beginning, but that was hard to do. Sometimes it was about time schedules but mostly it was because I really couldn&#x27;t see any significant areas on my legs or face that needed attention! I currently use it once a week, and I&#x27;m very happy with the device.  The Thermicon tips last a long time, the buffers are helpful and the lotion isn&#x27;t oily! I love this product and give it 4.5/5 stars. Even though excess hair on women is a touchy subject, I do recommend this product to people as often as possible; even if it is in a whisper!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00383I8T6 No!no! Hair Removal System, Model 8800, Pink 1 Ea]]I was extremely disappointed in the product and returned it.  What usually took me a few minutes in the shower took several sessions over a couple of days for me to remove on my legs.  All it does is burn off the hair. The hair inhibitor gave me a rash.</li>
    <li> Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no. I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one. I wanted to purchase a no-no, but I had several questions (or concerns) that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00. I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s are some of the questions I asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not really a questions, but I wanted their response or statement to the numerous complaints about the no-no breaking within weeks or a few months. (Is it strategically designed to &#x27;conveniently&#x27; malfunction after the 60-day guarantee expires??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Why such a limited warranty? $270.00 is not cheap. If it breaks after the 60-days guarantee, am I left with a $270.00 paperweight?  What will the company do to help its customers?&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week later and still no reply.  So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number. I didn&#x27;t catch his name, but his extension# is 39. He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  Or maybe, he was not allowed to answer them... His answers read like a script.  He tried to dodge the 3rd questions above, because if he had answered, it would have painted a negative picture of their company. He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  In follow-up to the questions above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. He says he has no knowledge of any negative consumer reviews of no-no. (Surprise surprise, right?) According to him, all negative reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the no-no because they didn&#x27;t see immediate results after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well...that was not my concern at all. I KNOW patience is required to see results. Actually, I believe it will do what it&#x27;s advertised to do.  My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the 60-days guarantee? He did offer some clarification on this. Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked. If you purchase the no-no after the 60-days guarantee is over, they now have EXTENDED the warranty to **2 YEARS**. If you get a replacement for a defective device, it does NOT reset the warranty clock. (Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.) I brought this up to the customer service rep, and he says they don&#x27;t do this...so just be aware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. So, do some models break more than others? One reviewer called customer service for a 3rd no-no replacement. The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned. (hmm...so...is this an indication that there *is* an issue of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I shared this reviewer&#x27;s experience with the representative I was speaking to, and he doesn&#x27;t basically called this reviewer a LIAR. Representatives will not divulge that kind of information. Sure. As for the no-no for men and no-no for women, he said the only difference between the two are the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Limited warranty... the rep completely went off on a tangent when I brought up this subject. He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...\\&quot;get 1 no-no today, get a second no-no for only $199.99...\\&quot; W-O-W. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I kept pressing my questions/concerns about AFTER the 2-year warranty. Customers can get as manyreplacements as needed during the 2-year warranty period, but if they keep receiving defective device that break in a matter of weeks/months, what happens then? Are we just SOL? The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My final question to him: \\&quot;If you (the customer service representative) review an account history of a customer, and you see that they have gone through multiple no-no replacements over a 2-year period (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\&quot; He didn&#x27;t reply yes or no, only that they cannot replace no-no&#x27;s after the 2-years are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Last thing I said to him before he hung up on me: It&#x27;s not that customers give up on your product, it&#x27;s your company that&#x27;s giving up on your customers.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer loyalty?  Doesn&#x27;t exist here.  They don&#x27;t care. They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me. I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products. They know it will break over time. In fact, the representative (Mr. Extension #39)  mentioned that there are logged \\&quot;batches\\&quot; of no-no&#x27;s that are known to be defective. Something else to be aware of.  WILL YOU BE ONE OF THE UNLUCKY ONES?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement. However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  Don&#x27;t invest in something that has a track record of breaking over short amount of time. How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits? Ask yourself these questions before you decide to buy. Think it over...seriously.</li>
    <li> The first thing that took me by surprise was the noise the gadget makes. But that is not the only thing that took me by surprise: the smell of my hair burning as I use the nono is not pleasant at all. My 12 year old son says it smells like burnt popcorn!. The product says to use it six weeks before seeing any results. I really hope it does; after all, I paid good money for it. I used it on my arms and problem is I can still feel the stubs as early as the next day after doing the removal. I guess it is too early to give judgement. But so far I am not too impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> Please Note: This review is based on results for a man and not a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought it for me as a Christmas present based on a blog/review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The blow review made it sound like a miracle device. The company appears to be linked to, or in business with, this blog and the blogger gets a percentage of every sale that comes from them driving people to the no-no website to purchase. Clearly the blog review was not attempting to give an unbiased review, and was trying to make it sound like a miracle product just to make money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I used the product exactly as the instructions state and the results were a process that took about 6 - 12 times as long as shaving, did not work as well as shaving, smells AWFUL like burnt hair, and offers no thinning of hair or permanent results. The hair is essentially burnt off and stinks, and it burnt off near the follicle but not as close to the follicle as just shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Again, followed the instruction and used the highest setting possible for a full month religiously and nothing but awful smelling burnt hair that grows back faster than shaving and is stubbly.  This might work on areas where there is just thin soft hair to begin with, but clearly not designed for a man who might have coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Now another part of the scam-like tactics: My wife tries to return this and, while eventually successful, they try every trick in the book to get her to not return it.  Here are some of the things this company did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service rep hounded my wife for a long time while I was at work constantly questioning her about whether I had followed the instructions properly. It was borderline interrogation. They didn&#x27;t simply ask \\&quot;You&#x27;re sure he followed the directions right and still wants to return it?\\&quot; ... no, they wanted to know EXACTLY every step I took and were hoping she would tell them one little step that wasn&#x27;t perfectly in line with their directions so they could deny her return.  Then they asked her if she had tried it and when she said no, they tried to ask her to give it a try and see if she liked it.  Of course, if she tried it and it didn&#x27;t work, by the time she tried to return it again the 60 days would have passed.  Nice try.  She said no, and they offered her $90 to keep it and not return it.  What?!?  Unbelievable.  Now they&#x27;re bribing you?  No reputable company runs their returns this way.  Seems like a total scam to me.en she said no, they tried to ask her to give it a try and see if she liked it.

    <li> I bought this product at the beginning of the year (January 2013); I have been pretty good about using it about twice a week.  I only use it on my face, I am fair skinned and approaching my late 30&#x27;s so I figured, \\&quot;What the heck, I am getting fuzzy cheeks and a mustache,\\&quot; what do I have to lose?  My mustache, which is a mixture of a lot of fine blonde hair and some course black (and if you&#x27;re a woman, you know facial hair sucks and it is embarrassing), is coming in a little more sparse and does grow more slowly.  It was definitely not a miraculous difference, which I was hoping for.  As for the blonde fuzz on my cheeks, I have no clue, other than it does grow more slowly- I don&#x27;t give it a chance to grow out.  It does not work well on my black hairs very well.  I keep hoping that it will kill them, but I go over them with the No-No, and then end up plucking out the fried hair. I guess it did save me money on getting my face waxed.  The product holds a charge pretty well.  Use Chap Stick if you use it on your face, it will irritate you lips.  Glad I tried it, but the No-No is definitely not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I saw that the reviews were very mixed, but I wanted this to work and I knew that Amazon would stand by what they sell. Followed the directions exactly; this is a serious time investment. A couple times a week, you spend 20-30 minutes carefully removing hair. It smelled a bit and the hair removal was no way as smooth as a fresh shave or waxing. But I persisted, because if it was permanent, it would be worth it. (I should note that I used it on upper lip --very difficult--and bikini area, legs and underarms--also very tricky. I have an average amount of hair; not particularly heavy or light.) After 6 weeks, the prescribed amount of time, I was seeing no difference and I knew I would not be happy with the results once shorts and bathing suits were being worn. I returned it to Amazon--but now there is a restocking fee if items are not returned within 30 days (remember this takes a purported 6 weeks to work? ) So lessons learned---and hopefully I save someone else a few bucks. This is not a solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the nono for 5 weeks. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but with the  60 day return policy, decided to try it. My problem areas are arms and kind of downy blond hair above my neck. It works well on those places. It is super time consuming if you are going to try to nono your whole body! I burned my upper lip twice so...not going to do that again. I will keep the nono because it is nice for my lower cheeks and arms. A step down from an epilator, but I wouldn&#x27;t use one of those on my face. Oh- and the hair on my legs is quite a bit lighter. Haven&#x27;t shaved in a month!</li>
    <li> Extremely difficult to use on my chin (blessed with a goatee due to menopause).  Took months to see any degree of results (temporary or not--no way to tell now except I still grow a goatee) and wouldn&#x27;t work after I charged it up the 2nd time.</li>
    <li> I paid a lot of money for this and after 4 months of using it, I get a red light and it won&#x27;t work anymore even though I put in a new cartridge blade. Is this thing made in China? What a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these &amp; some of the hairs were not even taken off. I should have kept the pages that I bought them from so I could get my money back.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> I have not dedicated the time it requires but so far am very satisfied with the results. I am sure with more time investment I will be even more satisfied. I got 1 for my sister for last Christmas and she is happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I keep trying with the Nono but I just don&#x27;t see much results. I keep wondering if the thing is a fake and is useless! I have been using it for about 3 months and don&#x27;t know how much longer I will keep trying.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite  a few months.  I see little difference in the regrowth of hair. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have had the NoNo for almost 6 months and have tried to use it as recommended.  The head keeps sticking in and all I get is a red light.  I have to turn it off, then remove the head, insert again and turn it on.  When the light does come on, it takes forever for it to remove the hair.  It is a horrible rip off and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Because it is beyond the 60 day trial, I cannot even return it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Do NOT waste your money on this product.  I used it faithfully for the time allowed, and got almost ZERO results!  And the \\&quot;allowed\\&quot; time runs out and then you can&#x27;t return it.  I kept hoping it would get better the more I used it.  NOT!!!  I just wish there was a product out there that actually does what it&#x27;s claimed to.  SO many dishonest people out to make a buck off people who want to believe what they hear.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to received this product and finally be able to handle my hair without waxing! What a major disappointment!!! I tried and tried to follow the instructions with no real results. It doesn&#x27;t take care of course hair (legs, etc.). It burns some of the hair and then it&#x27;s right back. What a total waste of money.....a scam! Items don&#x27;t fit in kit either. I received it when I was on a trip so it was too late to return after I stopped trying. From the looks of it, I would not have gotten a full refund anyway. Oh by the way, I tried to email the company too and received no response! Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased the NoNo hoping it would work.  I got nothing...no burning hair smell no less hair...nothing.  I continued trying it to no avail.  I was ready to return it when I began to get e-mails which made me think I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly.  So I used it some more.  By then it was too late to return it (probably part of the plan).  I hate it.  The biggest waste of money ever.  Remember...if it sounds too good to be true ~ it probably is!!</li>
    <li> Broke after 1/2 hour of use. It overheats and stops after a short amount of use. Save your money, this is not a good product.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I used it for 4 months and the results were so disappointing. The price was very costly and if it had done the job it claimed to do it would have been worth it. It did not so I feel it is not worth a dime!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend after seeing the commercials and reading some good reviews and have been disappointed ever since getting it in the mail.  My girlfriend and I have both used it.  It is expensive, especially after factoring in the replacement attachements that need to be replaced every few months.  It takes a long time just to do a small area, and it actually hurts when you get burned.  It is pretty easy to burn yourself with it.  It is very difficult to use, the commercials make this thing seem completely different then it actually is! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> does it remove hair? yes, in time. expect to have wirey burnt hair for months before you see total hair removal, they give you an exfoliater but it is a joke it will only buff away the burnt hair on flat surfaces, I recommend a buff puff. Even then I scrub till I am red and still have wirey burnt hair left, so I wax or shave areas after I No NO them. The NO NO device has a roller on it that turns on the laser, if the roller is not rolling smoothly over your skin the laser does not turn on, so it is difficult to use on bikini line and arm pits and any curved surface which is the main areas I wanted to use it on. the hair has lessened, but I have waxed for years and I can say the same about that also. One warning is; the booklet you get with it has a help section and for half the problems that are mentioned the \\&quot;FIX\\&quot; for the problem is to replace the head, not sure how much they cost but it might be something to be wary of.</li>
    <li> After faithfully following the instructions for many weeks, I am very disappointed to report that this product does not work.  I wish I had realized this before the warranty ran out and I would really like my money back.</li>
    <li> I have found very good results from the No No Hair Removal system.  I have fine blonde hair and use the product on my neck, cheeks and upper lip.  I have had much slower and finer re-growth.  I don&#x27;t know how well it would work for dark coarse hair but for me it is a winner.  I did have to \\&quot;practice\\&quot; - it works much better if you move in a smooth fluid movement, don&#x27;t try to hard.</li>
    <li> I brought the original no no classic hair remover approx. two years ago.  I am Afro Caribbean, and have strong thick hairs on my chin, that would curl into the skin and have to be plucked out leaving scarring.  Two years later with use  of the no no every single morning, the hairs have thinned out.  When I stopped using, the hairs returned back to normal.  There is definitely an improvement but it is a constant thing.  My chin is now more manageable and less scarred.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money!  This is totally bogus.  I gave it 6 months with no results.  Go to an esthetician and have it professionally done.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have success with permanent hair lose. My main goal was facial hair.  Found better success with a tweezers and a magnifying mirror.  On the face the wire tends to burn around the curves of the chin.  On the legs, it didn&#x27;t seem to work well with course hair.</li>
    <li> The hair on my upper lip and chin apparently are too strong for the no-no.  I smell the burning hair and when I look, the thin hairs are gone but the course hairs are still there.  Those are the ones I want removed.  Unfortunately the time got away from me and now I&#x27;m stuck with another hair removal product that does not work for me.  I think I&#x27;ll just stick to threading and waxing.</li>
    <li> The no!no! should not be recommended for the facial area. By design it does not work except for a flat, firm area. The instructions are minimal. When it makes a buzzing sound, is it working? When it makes a jumping, buzzing sound is it working? (no). I had to go online to review sites to find out this information. The only way I knew it worked at all is once or twice I did smell a hair burning. I say a hair because no more than one or two were burned. I am returning the product. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. The only reason I gave one star was it may work on some limbs (not my skinny ones) or the chest area.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels after after I use my NoNo, like the collagen is being pulled to the surface.  After 1 year of use - I use my NoNo every 4-6 weeks on my legs and once every two weeks on my face...I am OCD about peach fuzz.  The hair that grows back is finer. The customer service is awesome, if you have nay questions - call them.</li>
    <li> Because I started shaving at a very young age, my hair is now very course.  Where I have the finest hair the NoNo does great.  It does not go a great job on my forearms.  Thighs are really good after NoNo but from my knees down it is so so.  For my face it is also wonderful.  Maybe I would be better off with the model for men.  Men&#x27;s hair tends to be pretty thick.</li>
    <li> only works if you want to go over the area, over and over and over.....time comsuming and very iffy.  would not recommend for women or male. and the gift card they may offer is a joke it is for junk and that you can take maybe 10 dollars off. Don&#x27;t waste money...</li>
    <li> OK. Perhaps this is just me but this device was painful as least for use on your face.  I needed a product to deal with facial hair.  The first use burned my chin.  I thought perhaps I had the wrong setting (use low). Nope, setting was correct but it was painful.  I think it is ok for other areas of the body but not the face.  I was alittle put off as well by their customer service attempting to have me keep the device longer and continue to use.  It burned my face.....I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s a sign that it goes back.  Customer Service reps not thinking of my burned flesh but to sell me more time and another product to boot.  Would not recommend for facial use.  Legs and arms might be ok but too expensive for faiing to be useful on the facial hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now. I&#x27;ve been using it on medium setting (2 bars) mostly for sensative areas and on high setting (3 bars) for legs and arms. While I smell burning hair and I do notice the hair grows a bit slower, I have not noticed no growth yet.  All the areas I&#x27;ve been treating, the hair still grows, just slower. I&#x27;ve treating the areas every 2 days and am thinking I should do it everyday now.  My hair is not corse but not very fine either.  I think this product works best on the legs and arms since the areas are wide and flat. I do notice that hair on the legs grows back much slower than other sensative areas. I think with a little longer period of using this product (perhaps one more month), I should see better result.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using as directed and I am starting to see results.  Doesn&#x27;t burn and very easy to use.  The only negative is that it refuses to budge on very thick and coarse hair but overall a great product.  Price too steep though</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few weeks ago. While I haven&#x27;t used it long, I am returning it simply because it is too expensive for what it does. I in no way believe that this device will work on any body hair except for peach fuzz on your face, which is what I bought it for anyway. (I tried it on my arm hair and it pretty much sucked.) I have to say that I am satisfied with the results on my face, but I had to go over the same area many, many times in order to get to that result. Also, there is some sort of motion sensor that gets the unit to start, and it&#x27;s tricky to get it going in one smooth motion, so there are lots of starts and stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this thing cost $100, I would totally keep it. But it just doesn&#x27;t work well enough for $275, especially since there are ongoing costs for the replacement tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any adverse reactions or any problems with it burning my skin, but you do have to be careful. Also, this is NOT a laser. It seems to be a super heated wire that gets close to your hair and burns it off. I can&#x27;t see how that would inhibit growth over time, no matter how much you use it.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless I feel absolutely excited about a product. This product deserves an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to deal with hair problems since my early years in high school. As I got older, it got worse. I tried EVERYTHING. I did the laser hair removal which actually worked for a while then the hair grew back thicker when I stopped treatments. I tried electrolysis and it was very painful so I only did one 30 minute session and never went back. I&#x27;ve tried hair inhibitors and nothing seemed to work so I continued shaving and plucking and hair removal creams. I pretty much have to shave everyday to keep the hair growth under control. I would shave in the morning and by night-fall I would have stubble. VERY EMBARASSING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister brought up this product that she saw on an infomercial and she asked me if I ever tried it. I pretty much tried everything if it involves hair removal but I never heard of this new product. I saw some of the testimonials on the website and it convinced me to try it. I didn&#x27;t hesitate any further and ordered it the same day. When I first used it, I used it on my arm to to see how it worked and to make sure it didn&#x27;t cause any scaring. I used it for three treatments and stopped using it. I would admit, I thougth I would get instant smooth hair free skin but WRONG. It smelled like burning hair and I felt stubble. It was a very bad first impression. A few days later it must have fallen out cause it was very smooth on that arm. I ended up moving out of the country and mistakenly packed it away in my items and left it in storage. For over a year I did not use it and I happen to look at both  my arms and noticed that the arm that I treated three times HAD VERY LITTLE TO NO HAIR! I thought maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me but I compared both arms under the light to make sure it wasn&#x27;t my eyesight and the arm treated with the no no had VERY fine hair. I ended up buying it again but this time I was more consistant with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had it for a week since reordering it and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday (like every few days) and the more I use it, the less hair grows back and the less I have to shave. I would say, I have used it almost twice a day for the past week and I am VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS! If you have tried everything, this is the way to go. It takes some getting used to in the beginning and you have to be patient but CONSISTANCY is the key. Keep using it to get the best results. The more you use it, the less you will have to use it later on. No more rough stubble feeling by night fall. I&#x27;ll wake up in the morning and it&#x27;s still smooth. I&#x27;m just so excited that I don&#x27;t know what to do. I am actually taking pictures for my journal. When it&#x27;s all over, I will post before and after photos. It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I got it, was ready to return it when customer service encouraged me to stay with it. I did and am sorry.  It takes too long to do your legs, so that&#x27;s out. You have to go over and over and over it.  Most success is with my very light blond hairy arms, although, I keep at it there just to see if it will eventually work.  I go over my face and neck every few days but also use vaniqa.  Tried my underarms, nope, tried my bikini line but I&#x27;d have to be there all day going over it a million times.  Easier to shave in 30 seconds. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a complete waste of money. I began by shaving upper lip, chin, legs and under arms. Armpits were painful and could barely get any hair off so a waste of time. Back to razor there. Next, I dropped the legs. Really time consuming to go over and over the same areas and though it would burn off parts of some of the hairs, it always left stubble. I didn&#x27;t have hours to spend using this to get stubble so next I dropped the legs. It has sort of worked on my upper lip - but here I am about 3 years later (!) and the hair still grows back there. Plus some will never burn off with the No No, no matter how many times you go over the same area. The chin area barely worked. Back to plucking there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after several years, still using it to get a few hairs off my upper lip. This thing is junk. Save your money! Glad that Amazon is now selling these things now though so I can finally post a public review.</li>
    <li> Buying the Nono is the worst mistake I have ever made.  The Nono machine will only work in high and burns the skin.  I tell my friends to never ever buy a Nono product.  Wish I had never spent the 300.00 plus that the Nono cost, the money would have been well spent on something else.  What an expensive mistake!!</li>
    <li> I use the NoNo on my facial hair, which is light and fine and it works for me! I have been using it for over a year and I like it! I think it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> My husband ordered me the No!No! as a surprise present. I love it! My cousin and her daughter have one and love it so I wanted to try it. I have had no problems with it at all. I had one of the elements go out and contacted them about it and they sent me a replacement for it at no cost at all. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product hurts! It pinches your legs and face! I tried different blades and modes, it hurts! It is not worth the money! Very disappointed !</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle of marketing nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the product is flimsy and cheaply made.  It will last through the warranty time period, but will break soon after.  Secondly, it will not remove hair temporarily.  Even fine hair escaped, and it little to no effect on coarser hair.  Some hair did burn off, but left stubble, which needs to be removed with the exfoliating pad that is included.  Thirdly, although I used my unit for 3 months, my hair growth never slowed, the hairs never got finer, and they grew back as quickly as ever, necessitating use of the No!No! daily.  Save your money and buy an epilator.  Painful but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have left this review, but I got an e-mail from the company asking for one, so there it is!</li>
    <li> This product is effective, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped... I didn&#x27;t want to have to shave anymore, and the bad news is that this product definitely does NOT replace your razor or whatever else you use. The good news is that even though I still need to shave, it is much less frequently. The hair that remains is sparse and much finer- which is really all the product claims to do in the first place. So visually, you can get away without shaving for a while longer that before, which is super. However, if you can&#x27;t deal with little pricklies and need your legs to always be super smooth to the touch, you may just as well save your money and hang on to your razor. DISCLAIMER: I&#x27;ve not tried it on any other area besides legs, and I imagine the results are quite adequate for the face at least.</li>
    <li> I am dealing with cancer and on blood thinners. I like the No No. Don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself with razors. Hair hasn&#x27;t stopped but less. I still use it and like it.</li>
    <li> I used this for 3 months and the company told me to try using it everyday. NOPE the hair is still there and then when I tried to return it, I was told that it was to late my trail period was over. Spent all that money for nothing. Nice company there NO!NO!.</li>
    <li> I feel like it took some practice to get it down but it worked well the first couple of weeks.  And then it broke.  I contacted the customer service group and they told me to send it back.  I told them I would just like the piece replaced but never received anything back and they will not answer my emails.  Very poor customer service.  I felt the product worked well but I do not know if it is permanent results.  The cons were it smelled of hair burning, possiblity of burning skin, felt like stubble but the pros were that it got rid of the hair.</li>
    <li> I had to send this back twice cause the rubber band that makes the roller work was way loose so the thing skips, like on off on off. The first time took almost2 months cause they said it did not get it and I had to prove sending it in at all. Then I had to do the same thing in September. The no no goes on off on off cause the rubber band if stretched out and wont let the roller move right. I mailed it on the 7th after being told \\&quot;Since you had this same problem before we will send a new one right now just send the other at your convenience.\\&quot; Well I called today 10-1 They again said we did not get it. Prove you sent it. I am not happy. When it worked It worked but for the price it does not last. I fear when the warrantee is up it will end up in the trash. The say it is improved but still works the same. HMMMMMMMM go figure&lt;br /&gt;Since it took over a month to be returned to me do you think they will extend my warrantee the 2 months lost????????????????????? Bet not</li>
    <li> Was so hoping this product would perform as promised. Not even close. Don&#x27;t fall for the advertisements as the are all false. $300 up in smoke.</li>
    <li> It is painless, but even on the highest setting it does  virtually nothing to remove  coarse hair in an area that was previous shaved. It&#x27;s impossible, therefore to tell how long the area stays hair free since it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair in the first place..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it to others?  Not unless you have an abundance of money you don&#x27;t know what to do with.  If you don&#x27;t want to save your money, donate  it to a worthy cause.</li>
    <li> I used the No No according to the directions, and for well over six months. I do not stand behind this product because not only does it not work on course hair, but it does not work on fine hair either. I also used it on my husband&#x27;s back (hair is fine), and it did not work. In my opinion, the No No is highly overrated, and especially the commercials for it!</li>
    <li> In order to use the device, it has to be fully charged.  However, the device was made so poorly that the jack which should have plugged into the hand-held device could not be inserted.  If you looked into the hole where it was supposed to go, there was a piece of metal which appeared to have a hole in it also.  However, because the two holes were not aligned, the &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34; could not be charged.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and didn&#x27;t have a chance to use it right away, since it arrived when I was out of town. When I got back I followed the instructions and used it regularly, but all it did was burn the hair. I had to cover every inch at least 10 times before it would even scorch the hairs. It left my legs stubbly and prickly. Then two days later the hair was back. The battery runs down every time I finish my legs and the charger is not small. It is bulky. The disks that come with it are sandpaper for your skin. Not sure what that is supposed to do. It does not make anything smooth. I contacted NoNo and they refused to take it back, since the 60 days had past. They did send me another one with the same disappointing results. Now I have a useless expensive gadget that I can&#x27;t use or get rid of. Say NoNo to NoNo and save your money!</li>
    <li> This is the second no-no that I have purchased for my wife.  Both of them failed pretty quickly.  We saw a huge reduction in the amount of hair regrowth.  But the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; fail pretty quickly.  The last one I bought came with a defective blade out of the box.  Not happy for the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
    <li> This appliance was delivered to me quite a while ago, and although I have tried it numerous times, I cannot get it to work.  I am way past the return offer, so I guess I will just toss it in the garbage.  An expensive lesson to learn, and I could have used the money to better advantage.  But I will put this whole disgusting episode behind me.  How can I give it one star?  Have to, otherwise this review will not register.  I&#x27;d give it minus 5 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  We are told that it takes time so you don&#x27;t send it back for a deserved refund.  I&#x27; m sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have been using my NO!NO! only on my face, for several months now and am pleased with the results.  I am not using it as consistently now as I did in the beginning, but when I do use it, it is working.  I agree with the other reviews stating that you have to go over the same area several times to get all of the hair (especially if you let it grow out).  It doesn&#x27;t leave you as smooth as when I use a facial hair removal creme, but it is also not as harsh on my skin.  When I have a trip coming up, I use it religiously for a few weeks prior to my travel and have not had any issues with unsightly facial while on my trip ~ I like the product and have recommended it.</li>
    <li> The nono Was Given To Me As A Gift. I Enjoy Using It And It Does Remove My Fuzzy Hair, However I Notice That MyThicker Gray Hairs Are More Difficult To Remove. I Do TweezeThose.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;t Buy it. Regardless of how religious you are in using .... Hair still grows back!! it&#x27;s a joke.  If I could give a ZERO rating.... I WOULD.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed.  It does not remove hair as was represented, especially on legs.  It works ok for lip area and chin but that&#x27;s it.  Brow area too sensitive to use the no no.  I would not recommend buying it to any one now that I have had experience with it.</li>
    <li> I think this product was too expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work!!!  I used it as directed and saw absolutely NO results!!!</li>
    <li> I had ordered nono before I got married, hoping it would help prolong shaving on my honeymoon. My biggest disappointment, upon receiving the thing, is that NO ONE mentions how long one treatment takes!! If you are doing your legs, plan on at least half an hour to 45 minutes per leg! The commercials are EXTREAMLY deceiving!! The slower you go the better results; and you must trace back over the same area several times! I have found that I am unable to use nono over my knees; because you have to have heavy constant pressure, nono is completely unusable over knees! Plus thermacon tips WILL NOT LAST through entire treatment plan they recommend; especially if you are going directly by the plan they set in place. To make things even WORSE, when I tried (key word) to reorder a large thermacon tip; I find you can only order two (one big and one small) thermacon tips at a time! I would have been ok ordering two large tips, but no option. To further my frustration, you can only purchase these special tips out of this country. After placing my order... it NEVER came!! They have done brilliant marketing with this device, they got me!!! Completely dissatisfied and if it hadn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg; I would throw it away!!!! I was never able to complete a full 7-8 week (whatever they recommended) and have not EVER been able to restart due to the fact you CANNOT order thermacon tips in the states!!! JUNK!!!</li>
    <li> This is the worst item I have ever tried.  If I would not of had a death in the family side tracking me I would have returned this worthless item.  I have better results with my electric razor and it takes less time with my electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> With all the advertising and hype on this product I was really surprised to find it to be one of the worst products I have ever purchased.  If you want to remove hair have it waxed, if you want the results to be permanent have laser treatments. This product is garbage......</li>
    <li> When called to order was thrown for a loop when they asked about insurance.  You get a 60 day trial period and mine broke down just after that period.  Had not gotten insurance because could not believe it would break down that quick for the money spent.  Does not work like they show and would not recommend anyone trying it without buying insurance.  I didn&#x27;t have it working long enough to know if it really worked.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to doing what it does in the ads but after a year of use, it does slow the regrowth. I haven&#x27;t used wax or hair removal creme on my chin in a year. Just No No and some occasional tweezing. I also like how it works on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be consistent, and patient. It&#x27;s a lot of restarting the unit when you do your legs. For some reason it stops a lot when I use it on my legs.</li>
    <li> I used the no-no almost every day--what little chin hair it got rid of came back right away.  Used it for several months hoping for better results.  No such luck.  Pretty much useless. Back to plucking!</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m a man. Originally bought this to stop the hair growing on my ears (gross!) tried the beard area and privates. The ears were impossible. The other results initially were difficult, and seemed worthless, but I pursued it, and hair growth seemed to slow. I still shave. Takes extra time and another step in hair control, and has thus fallen out of use. Don&#x27;t waste this much money... I wold pay 30 to 40 bucks for it, and not feel ripped off, but the cost is too high for something tha wiki lend up in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I bought the product after deciding to stop painful electrolysis. The hair on my upper lip is coarse and I have had the No No about 10 months and have used it faithfully. In short it does not work on coarse hair...a waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004HJ6TAA Radiancy no!no! Hair 8800, Silver]]This product stopped working shortly after purchase.  Since it was a gift the recipient never told me.  Now it&#x27;s been a year since purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought for a christmas gift for my daughter she it using it and seems to like it I have not heard her say she dislikes it. Although she did say you can smell hair like it is burning.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised, but the smell is driving me crazy. No matter how much scrubbing I do, I can&#x27;t get the smell of burned hair off my skin. I&#x27;ve tried three different kinds of soap and I still end up washing my face and legs three or four times. My face is starting to get pretty raw. Anybody have any good ideas?</li>
    <li> I suffer from PCOS, (which is a hormonal disorder) and because of that I suffer from major excess hair growth. Ive tried shaving it, as well as creams, and other methods with no success. Since my hair is very light pigmented,  Im not a candidate for laser hair removal:( Ive been seeing the no no ads on TV and how it worked on HSN. A week ago it went on sale and my mom broke down and bought one for us to share. I have been using the no no for 3 days now and I see a significant reduction in my facial hair. The process is painless, and I dont break out in little red bumps. I still have other body parts to try it on (my arms and bikini line), but Im super happy with the results. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS AS A GIFT AND WHEN I OPENED IT TO TRY IT THERE IS NO GUIDE TO USE IT, AND THE INSTRUCTION CD IS NOT INSIDE EITHER. YOU SAY I CANNOT RETURN IT SINCE IT IS PAST January 31. I ONLY WANT THE DAMN INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDE. THERE IS NO CONTACT INFORMATION FOR ME TO GET THESE.</li>
    <li> i wish i would have purchase through the actual website because they have a 60 day guarantee or your money back. i definitely would have sent this back. i just dont have the time to use this, its much quicker to shave in the shower. also i have burned myself a few times with it and its painful!! im sure if i used it more often they hair wouldnt grow back but it is very time consuming and i just dont have that kind of time...</li>
    <li> It works ok.  Not great. Takes a long time to do a leg.  Heads quit working quickly. I got it as a gift.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I GOT EXITED ABOUT IT FROM THE COMMERCIALS, IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ME, THE NO!NO! IT&#x27;S JUST THAT NO NO. SILVANA WOOD</li>
    <li> What I like about this product---everything&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;easy to use&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;parts easy to change&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;most of all does the job it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to recieve my no no as a Christmas gift. It is definitely painless and does work well if you let your hair grow a bit  the only downfall is that hair burns does create a destinctive smell</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m totally disappointed with this product considering it was $290.  Biggest waste of money I&#x27;ve ever spent.  I followed all the instructions to the letter too!  The first week, while using it on my legs, the metal band broke on the large attachment!  When I went to see about ordering another one, they wanted another $29.95 plus another $14.95 for shipping and handling, guess what? I didn&#x27;t order it. I&#x27;ve used the small one on my face but my face starts getting red before any hairs are gone!  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone! You can buy alot of wax, laser treatment, etc for the price of this product!</li>
    <li> I bought the No-no for my autistic son as he cannot use regualar shavers or razors.  My husband and he loves it.  He doesn&#x27;t like the smell of burning hair, but at least he&#x27;s not squirming and screaming like he does under a razor or shavor.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 kits. Upon receiving them I gave one to my daughter and kept one for myself. Following the instructions , I began the routine of using the product.  After using my nono 3 times the filament broke on my unit.  I called to get it replaced. I was told I would have to buy a 50.00 replacement kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased the kits in November for Christmas gifts I was assured that the 60 day return policy would be in effect from Christmas on as I was not opening or using till  then. What a joke. The people I talked to in customer service were rude and snarky . They would not honor the 60 day return policy from Christmas (12/25/12). They insisted the 60 days started when I purchased the items.  Sales department tells you anything to make a sale!  Beware of what they tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this company as they do not back their product.  They know if they ignore any concerns of the customer, the customer goes away and no one is the wiser. Bad PR.</li>
    <li> I love that fact that I can take care of unwanted hair at home when I have time and not have to run somewhere. Plus I love not have red bumps were the hair was removed like with Laser treatment Trust me buy one you will not be sorry</li>
    <li> I highly recommend No!No! as a hair removal product. Even though I have had thick, course hair on my upper lip, it was effective. I can honestly say, mine has been sitting idle as I rarely need it anymore. It was easy, painless and effective.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all.  Too cumbersome to use and too expensive for what you get out of it.  All they want to do is sell you additional products to go with it (i.e., creams, lotions, etc.) to make more money.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had considered the No-No for quite sometime.  A friend of mine warned me that it was junk &amp; did nothing but provide the smell of burning hair as it notes but it doesn&#x27;t work at all, didn&#x27;t remove a SINGLE hair.  Unfortunately I did not head her warning, paid a fortune for the product &amp; ended up throwing it away as a situation came up that was beyond my control and I was unable to return it in time to get a refund.  I CANNOT believe the new advertisements I have seen this past week on TV - new better improved etc.  DON&#x27;T BELIEVE IT!  I don&#x27;t know how the No No can be advertised the way it is when it does NOTHING!!!!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I feel totally ripped off by the cost and the effectiveness of the Nono .&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the Nono I burned my face. The product is inconvenient and downright impossible to use. It takes forever to cover a small area and the hair is still remaining. I have the same amount of hair as I had when I purchased the product.  The case broke immediately so I just threw Nono in the drawer without the case, it is in a box in my closet.&lt;br /&gt;Because I did not want to bother to return Nono I just put it in a drawer and forgot. I did not read the small print about the additional cost a d was surprised with two additional withdrawals from my bank account which was beyond the time given for returns.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this product! Donate the money to a worthy cause or have a great week end for yourself.</li>
    <li> Well I guess I am one of the few that had a bad experience.  In my opinion it just doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. Not only does it make your house smell like burnt hair it also leaves behind a course field of stubble that catches on any nylon or microfiber material you might be wearing. I am disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in February. This product is highly overrated. It does not work on coarse hair and is difficult to use on face, neck and curvy areas. Now I am stuck with an expensive item that is useless to me.</li>
    <li> Worse thing I ever bought. Had to keep it 90 in order to get my full refund back and of course they took theirs before giving it back. Didn&#x27;t work no matter how many times I went over the same area. Wouldn&#x27;t have minded the awful smell if it did the job. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This device was touted as an instant waxing without the pain.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t work near that well.  It is painless, and seems to do what it says.  But its effectiveness, at least in my case, was not very good.  I have been using it for several months, and while the hair is finer and fewer, it is by no means equivalent to a waxing.  I tried to return the product, but I was a few days too late.</li>
    <li> The hair gets tiner.  It worked fine but after a year it does not work any more.The wire on the head turns red and not working. It broke very fast.</li>
    <li> After only one week of use, I am already seeing a definite decrease in facial hair. Wish I had purchased it much sooner and save all the $$$ I have spent on waxing!!</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I tried using the nono with no success. My wife did nothing but complain about the hair growth, seems to grow more after use. Myself after using up to everyday my beard continues to grow, and I hate shaving.Its been right about 6 months and now sits back in the box gathering dust,, Also the smaller tip only lasted about 6 uses, and when we called to order a new tip they didn&#x27;t even offer to replace the faulty tip.</li>
    <li> I love my no no its quick convenient  I can take it every where  no more waxing for me  all the unwanted hair gone perfect .  I have no clue what took so long to get my no no</li>
    <li> This was terrible and did not work at all. I followed the directs and attempted multiple times, yet it never did a thing. I really wish I had not waited to long to return it, now I am stuck.  A huge waste of money.  Don&#x27;t fall for it.</li>
    <li> Using the no no takes a little practice but if you use it every week, in 2 months you will have only fine \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hair where you used to have coarse dark hair.  I&#x27;ve continued to use the no no every week even though it is only fine light hair on my legs and arms.  I have no complaints - it sure beats shaving every single day !</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product. It was not easy to use and did not work well on facial hair at all, which is the reason I purchased this product to start with. It does work ok on legs if you can spend about 30-45 minutes per leg. Does not hold a charge very long either.</li>
    <li> This device is difficult to use, and barely works under ideal conditions. Given the length of time you must use it to achieve the desired results, save your money and grab a good old fashioned razor. The problem is that when NoNo is used, it only works at a very specific angle and speed. If the angle is off by just a few degrees, you might as well be dragging a Popsicle stick over your body. Then if the speed is too fast or too slow, the device will not operate at all. Most frustrating miracle device I have ever seen. They did honor the 60 day money back guarantee however.</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 weeks ago and am still trying it out. I have thick, dark, coarse hair on my pasty white legs. I have to shave everyday. Basically, I get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs. It stinks. I have gone to waxing, but that only lasts about 2-3 weeks before regrowth. So I thought  I would try this as it seems promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had it for three weeks so far, so my rating will change as I continue to use it.  I have been using this 3 times a week since I got it and I have also been using the lotion after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week One: No real reduction in hair growth.  Couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week two: Have pricklies.  Not silky smooth results, but this is only the second week of use and the directions say to wait four weeks before noticeable results. Basically, I have constant stubble on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week Three:  The growth seems to have slowed, but I still have constant stubble on my legs.  I cannot tell if I am getting any results from treatment. I still need to shave if I want to go out in a skirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my arms was finer when I began and it has been reduced after 3 weeks of using it 3 times a week.  The hair on my upper lip has also bee reduced. My chin however is no change. Partly because it is so bony that I can&#x27;t get the no no to work there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this updated as I go. Hope I start getting some real results soon.  If by week six I have nothing better to show other than constant stubble, I will send this back for a refund. Though it has reduced the hair on my arms so I may keep it for that, but until then. Like I said, I am only on week 3 and have 3 more to go until their promised results are supposed to be evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 4:  Still have constant stubble on the legs.  Not looking too promising that I will get the silky smooth results. I have noticed some complaining about this burning their skin. I have not had that. It does feel warm, but it doesn&#x27;t burn. The hair on my arms has lessened and the hair on my upper lip is not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 5: Sorry if I&#x27;m a bit late for this.  No real improvement from the constant stubble on my legs and underarms.  The hair is not getting finer or any less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 6:  Same as week 5.  Though it has dramatically reduced the amount of hair on my arms and my upper lip; my legs still look hairy.  Basically, the most I have gotten is constant stubble on my legs which means I still need to shave in order to weak shorts. I have another week to go before I can call for a refund.  At this point I am not sure if I want to return it or not.  But considering I paid about $265 for this and am not getting the results I thought I&#x27;d get, I will probably return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will leave this at 3 stars because though it did not get rid of the hair on my legs, it did reduce it on my arms and lip.</li>
    <li> I used it and for the cost of the item I do not think it krystalizes the hair as well as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to do ok on finer hair, however the course stubble,it leaves it behind.</li>
    <li> This is a rip off company a third party NOT a professional business it&#x27;s done by mother/daughter in home deal. Might be selling &amp;#34;knock offs&amp;#34; reselling them for profit. ALL communication with them has been VERY unprofessional and RUDE with character insults etc! My advice is beware of anything bought on Amazon o/t books, etc because they don&#x27;t screen their &amp;#34;third party vendors&amp;#34; appropriately. ALSO if you purchases an item and aren&#x27;t given the option to send FedEx or UPS it&#x27;s a HUGE RED FLAG!!</li>
    <li> Since moving past the big \\&quot;M\\&quot;(enopause) time of life, my facial hair has become a problem (wish it grew so vigorously on my head!!). The facial hair remover creams were very hard on my skin...dry spots, red spots; and my ONE venture with moustache waxing (two days before I left on vacation!) gave me a huge scab!! After a year of no-no, once or twice a week, I am very satisfied with the results....this was a great investment. It is fast, easy and has never affected my skin adversely. There is some burning hair odor, but that lets you know it is working. Also, the customer service is excellent. I had a problem with a faulty power supply. A replacement was shipped out immediately with no cost to me. I have recommended this to a number of friends and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Where do I start. Got no-no in the hopes to get a quick and painless hair removal procedure, &#x27;as advertised on TV&#x27;. What I ended up with, was a lengthy painful procedure, with hair not being removed entirely, but with tops visibly seen above the skin. I figured rather than burning my skin with no-no, I&#x27;d help to remove the left covers with a pincher. As time was of value, I simply ended up doing the bikini line with my old depilator - in fact, it proved to be less painful ( imagine that!), faster and leaving nothing behind. This product is a fraud, and it literally burns the skin, the smell of burnt hair is almost unbearable, and it does not remove hair completely, so doesn&#x27;t replace neither a razor, nor a depilator.</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of money. Save yourself $200+ and go buy an electric razor. This product does not work at all to remove hair. If I could have rated it 0 stars I would have.</li>
    <li> The no!no! is a good product and does thin the hair out, but it is very time consuming and is not an instant fix.  You have to have longer hair (even know it says short hair use) I find it is more effective on the longer hair and you have to use it all the time, it is not a once a week routine for it to be effective(you can&#x27;t shave in between uses).  So if you are looking for instant gratification look to other options, as the no!no! takes time.</li>
    <li> All I could find on the Internet was gushing reviews about the wonder of this simple device; the type that sound exactly like ad copy.  Sucker that I am I decided to give it a try nonetheless. I followed the directions carefully and patiently and exactly as described.  I guess finally wore out the most useful attachment as it would not longer function (getting parts is another problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device does not work.  I saw no change whatsoever in the amount or nature of hair despite over two months of nearly daily application. I should have attempted to get my money back under the guarantee but considering I was unable to get the Company to respond when I attempted to purchase another attachment I doubted I would have much success.  So save your money and don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> NO NO is a bad product.  It does not perform as described.  Does not remove stubborn thick hairs and does not make your area smooth unless you scrub with the pad and then the hair comes back.  Does not remove hair all the way.  Neet hair remover does better than this product.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed, does not work.  End up using tweezers still.  Waste of money and time. Do not recommend this product.  Like the old saying goes \\&quot;if it sounds to good to be true, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work.  I thought I had more time to return it because many videos say that but the fine print said less time so I got stuck with it.  The orderwas fine but the product in itself didn&#x27;t work.  Sorry-</li>
    <li> if you have the time an pat ience the no no works good you just have to make sure you use it almost everyday</li>
    <li> i have pretty thick hair on my legs and the no no doesnt seem to work on my legs, it does actually work on my arms and my face. as long as you keep using it when your instructed to . but its really not worth the price.</li>
    <li> It worked great! My wife loved the results and so did I! Talk about smooth leggs that last. Thank you</li>
    <li> NOT A GOOD ONE THAT I BOUGHT IM NOT SAYING THAT NO NO IS NOT GOOD. BUT THIS ONE WAS NOT WORKING WHEN I TRIED IT. SORRY GUYS HAVE TO READ ANOTHER RATE.</li>
    <li> Well this thing looks pretty good so far. My wife is following the instructions and the NoNo is doing its part.</li>
    <li> I  have used it now for almost three weeks. I have used it on arms, legs, face- chin and upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;I think I have had the best results on my arms where the hair was finer and lighter. In my legs it does an OK job so that I dont have the shave with a razor but it does take a long time to use it and if you want perfectly smooth legs right away you will be disappointed and probably end up shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to spend some time learning how to use it, best to start with arms/legs first because on the face it is a little difficult to maneuver the angles. Its important to buff after each section you nono. Even after a few uses it becomes much faster and easier to use and you can use it faster but it doesnt take off every hair it encounters right away, I usually do the same area several times then buff and may repeat again a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my chin and lip I noticed it works better if I use the larger thermicon (not the one intended for the face, I havent had any problems doing this but it is not the recommended way to do it). I usually have to pluck my stubborn and embarrassing chin hair every other day, but I have been using the NoNo and tyring to avoid any plucking (but it is hard to do!) and I have noticed results in that the hair is less and seems to be growing back slower, but I do use it every other day to every two days right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about all the negative reviews but after using the product I am glad I bought it, certainly much cheaper than waxing and convenient without mess of home waxing or creams. The burning hair smell is only a slight annoyance. It is not going to give instant results, so if that is your expectation you will be disappointed based on my expirence with the product.</li>
    <li> I like when you use this product the hair becomes less and less visable. I gave this product 4/5 stars because it works, but it acts like a sewing maching stictiching up the loose hairs. Another thing to take into consideration is when using the no!no! is need to use it in a continuous motion for it to work.</li>
    <li> It works well on really fine hair...It doesn&#x27;t word so well on coarser hair...The size makes it very time consuming</li>
    <li> works well and love not having to pluck!  it has taken using it about 3 times before learning to use it without causing slight burns from hesitation though.</li>
    <li> so far so good. wife likes it. there is some odder when you use it but not bad. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I faithfully used this for 6 months and found that I cannot get all the hair off my legs, no matter how many times I swipe. It did thin the hair on my legs somewhat but never once got all of it. I have fairly course hair but I have seen much courser hair then mine. It worked ok on my upper thighs but knees and calves? Not!&lt;br /&gt;As for my face, it works ok but if its hot enough to sweat, or if I do not use the utmost caution it will cause burns, especially on my upper lip. Its a small area and hard to keep smooth enough to be able to glide the thing without bumping it off and on. I still use it for my face but I get burned enough to hate it almost, but not quite as much as plucking or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I might recommend this for those who have very fine or sparse hair, but if you have thick or course hair forget it.</li>
    <li> All this product does is burn the hair off.  Hair then grows back.  Tried it a few times - left with a smelly house, red marks, and stubbly feeling legs.  It did not restrict the hair growth in any way or prevent it from coming back.  A total waste of money - buy a good razor or get waxed.</li>
    <li> The No!no! works great on my chin hairs.  I use to pluck everyday. Now I just use my No!No! once a month!</li>
    <li> This product does NOT work at all - no hair removal.  I tried it twice, 2 months each time, and did not have any of the promised results.  Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
    <li> too much work for little result - i actually think their ads are close to fraudulent - coplete waste of money - i feel very ripped off ! (ps i am not even a very hairy person so dont need it to be great)</li>
    <li> i purchased the NO NO not knowing what to expect.  it is the best articles ever purchased.....reduce my shaving by only once a week +/-.  it is so nice not having to shave everyday and no chance of cutting your legs by a razor.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for us.  We called the company and they would not return it and said it was defective so they sent another , which still does not take the hair off!! Save yourself the money and aggravation.  Don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
    <li> I admit I was skeptical, but I ordered my No No with high hopes.  When used at least 3 times a week, No No does slow hair growth and soften the course hair that I have been shaving for years.  When I used it on my face for the blond peach fuzz, it removed it completely!  It did grow back after a number of weeks, but I just went over it again with No No, and it was gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am noticing slower growth on my legs and underarms.  The longest to take affect is my mustache area, but it is softening and becoming less of a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been ideal, given what it does to my facial peach fuzz, to have had a No No before I ever began shaving.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use on facial hair. It has to be held at the perfect angle to work.I also developed small scabs.</li>
    <li> After following all directions to the letter, spending up to 10x longer, having to go back over and over, there is still stubble, and it did not get softer and sparser in 6 weeks. I had been epilating with an electrical appliance and I have much less hair than I used to, so this came nowhere near those results and it had to be done 2-3 times a week! How dumb can we be to get taken by those infomertials ! I gave it to a friend who was curious about it around a year ago and she still has not tried it yet... for free! And I have gone back to epilating, with much less wasted time. It is not perfect, but laser is to expensive!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted the No NO for facial hair.  I received it and started using and it worked really good for me and after using repeatedly initially,  I really didn&#x27;t seem to have to use it very often.  Within less than a year it stopped doing it&#x27;s thing and just stopped rotating as it had been... My husband who can fix anything checked it out and said that it seemed that a belt blew ....I looked everywhere for replacement parts which for the cost you&#x27;d think there would be something.  There was no information any where.  So, overall, mine had little use and didn&#x27;t even last a year.  I was dissapointed, but wouldn&#x27;t buy and take that chance again.</li>
    <li> It does not work on anything but soft hair that has not been shaved.&lt;br /&gt;If you are over the age of 10-12, it will probably not be successful for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with NoNo. For the cost, it&#x27;s a rip off. It&#x27;s burning hair off, it&#x27;s very difficult to use on the areas I&#x27;d like to use it on like upper lip and bikini. Straight areas like arms or legs are better but shaving feels better on my legs. Unhappy I spent the money.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever bought. Since I bougt it for my college age children, I waited until they were home from college to try it, so it was past the money back guarantee date.  It was totally useless and a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wife bought to use on skin next to personal areas.  She thinks it does a good job but is very time consuming.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever it did absolutely nothing is just smells like burnt hair I hate this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy wirh my No No product.  I&#x27;ve had great results without pain.  To get the best results though,&lt;br /&gt;I go over the same area several times.  I have very fair skin and dark hair so perhaps this contributes to good results.  Hair grows back eventually but there&#x27;s much less of it and it&#x27;s much finer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the nono. Hardly shaved my legs all summer because of it. Cannot wait to try it else where!</li>
    <li> I purchased the no-no package about 2 years ago for my upper lip only. I use it regularly but after using it, the next day I have to tweezer the hair coming back and do so each day for a few days to be hair free for a few more days..it seems to weaken the hair but not get rid of it. I have an Epilady for my legs and would never use the no-no for my legs or underarms.</li>
    <li> I have blonde and gray hairs and this does not work for me. It was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your money and try another way.</li>
    <li> The product is extremely expensive and doesn&#x27;t produce desired results. I saw some decreased growth after using the product as suggested, but after a month&#x27;s time it stopped working all together. It was as if my hair became immune to the treatment. I did everything the directions described -- pre, during, and post treatment and still saw no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. I wish I could get a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought the NoNo naievely believing that this product might work.  After following the instructions and guidelines to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;, I have noticed no improvement at all.  I have had it on the highest setting since the start, and now it will not stay at the highest setting but, instead, defaults to the lowest setting while I am using it.  I still have to use alternative methods to keep the hair off.  This is truly disappointing considering how much it cost.  If you like the smell of burnt hair, you will enjoy the product.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> No No is a no-no.  Very disappointed.  To see their ads you&#x27;d think the hair was being \\&quot;mowed down\\&quot; like mowing a lawn!  Not!  In fact, nothing happens immediately.  I tried to return it but the representative encouraged me to keep trying and acted SURPRISED I wasn&#x27;t getting results.  I thought I researched thoroughly but after reading these blogs I wish I&#x27;d come here first!  I bought it for my upper lip; I cannot even imagine trying to do my legs like you see in their commercials!  No way.  A waste of time and money.  There are people who are desperate for help and these No No marketing folks prey on them.  Save your money and go for electrolysis.</li>
    <li> Money thrown in trash. Tried for a year after the first 60 days. Was told because I continued to wax &amp; pluck was why it wasn&#x27;t working to me. So I strickly used nono and a razer 2 to 3 times a week and felt like a man with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow all the time unless I shaved, and that only lasted till the next morning. (I am a woman). Started back waxing. Got much better results. Hair got finer and softer and I can go almost two weeks before doing it again. DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY! Like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> Does not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;It does the front of leg o k.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work very well overall.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I never kept it, save your Money!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled about getting my nono. Then After using it a couple times, I began to blister. I was having to go over the same spot 3-4 times and the heat was causing blisters! Also, the other thing is the smell of burned hair! I had to use it out side to avoid the smell of burnt hair in the house! Over all, not happy with it so I sold it!</li>
    <li> I tried NoNo for a couple of months.  I tried over and over (after watching the video) but the No No did not take the hair away.&lt;br /&gt;All I ended up with was a burn-like feeling on my skin and the hair was still there.  I did better with a dine store razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.  It is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Total Ripoff! This product does not work as advertised. It is very hit and miss for chin hair, mostly miss. I believe it is a total rip off. One cannot get a refund after the 60 day trail period. I kept thinking that I would catch on and there was a knack to figuring out how to get results but I&#x27;ve given up and the trail period is up, dumb me....</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use.  I use it on my arms.  You can&#x27;t feel a thing when you use it and it does take a while for the hair to grow back.  My only problem is my hair in other areas are too thick to use the product such as my legs and bikini line.</li>
    <li> It makes markes on my chin that people will ask, &amp;#34; What did you do to your chin?&amp;#34; I really don&#x27;t think it is worth the money or the time it takes to get the hair to be invisible. Shaving or plucking is much faster.</li>
    <li> I too was hopeful and tried with only burnt areas around my upper lip.  At irst I thought I was doing something wrong so I would read the process again and again the same results.  I have not used the no no in some time and am still healing.  As a result I think I will have to visit the doctor to see if anything can be done to help the area heal.  Thanks no no, not!! I did not even want to rate it one star.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in my NoNO!. After all the good reviews, it really didn&#x27;t work. I am blonde and have fine hair, but the hair grew in thicker and darker, and then the NoNo did not even remove it. I was sorry to have paid this much for a product that worked no better than a razor.</li>
    <li> I smelled the burning hair, yet plenty of hair was still there. I had to end up getting a waxing. I guess it may work with thinner hair, but not sure, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though.</li>
    <li> Although I did not buy this on Amazon.  I bought it from the Company.  FOR ME - it did not work well, and places did not work EVER.  The advertisement I saw shows it being used on upper lip.  YET, the instructions say NEVER USE IT ON UPPER LIP.  If what I wanted was to use it on my upper lip... Why would I buy it - because they advertised it as working on the upper lip.  Best of luck to whomever gets it to work correctly.  Mine skipped about, and I went back over the directions and back over the directions and changed how I held it and no use... by then 60 days was up and I was out my money.  Bummer.  So Sorry it seemed such a good idea.</li>
    <li> I use the no-no and it works well. I like not having to shave as I am allergic to the blades.</li>
    <li> I bought the No No for approximately $300.00 in January 2013 and used it pretty faithfully twice per week but I have had burns and scrapes and the hair definitely grows back.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all on the course hair on my face which is mainly why I purchased it.  I am completely dissatisfied and would not recommend this product to anyone.  The only thing good about this product was for a while it wasn&#x27;t working properly and since it was within my first year of owning it they exchanged it pretty quickly too I might add.  But you cannot run a business solely on customer service.  You need to start with a good product.</li>
    <li> When I was looking into buying the nono I searched out reviews, hoping to find a review to tell me how the nono worked as the weeks progressed. I didn&#x27;t find any, so I bought the nono and decided to do a week by week review for others looking into purchasing this device. There is a 60 day money back \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot;, so here is my first week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE MEN...&lt;br /&gt; I am using this on my husband too. He is a body builder and wants a smooth chest. He has not had a full week yet, I will update when he does. Update below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I AM DOING...&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT using the lotion/buffers that come with the nono. My reasons are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The lotion has parabens in it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is a hair growth inhibitor and I want to know I am getting the results from the nono device not the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;3. I have sensitive skin and have tried hair buffers with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the nono daily, alternating body parts to every other day. The nono recommends using the nono 3-4 times a week so I am following the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my first week of the nono. Not much to tell yet, except I smell burning hair in my sleep now. LOL&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smaller thermacon attachment it feels like it gets closer to the skin and I burned my upper lip. This did not happen with the larger one. So I only use the larger one now.&lt;br /&gt;I found I have to go slow and pass over the same spot 2-3 times for the hair to burn off. It is NOT smooth after using the nono, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be, at least not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll change my rating as necessary and will update after I finish my second week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is actually my third week. I did start to notice a slight thinning of the hair after 2 weeks but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my imagination or not. Now at 3 weeks I am getting a little excited about my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is definately thinner, not as course, and lighter. The hair on my legs (in addition to lighter and thinner) seems to be beginning to become a bit more sporadic. I noticed more of a difference in the hair on my arms than legs so far. The hair on my arms are so thin and light (extremely vellus) I can barely see them. (I am assuming this is maybe due to the hair already being less course in this area.) The hair growth has slowed down too. I am now alternating body parts to every 2 days. I also noticed I have little patches here and there that have nothing, mainly in the underarm area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a loofah while showering to exfoliate the burned hair and then apply a natural moisturizer. The thermicon attachments seem to last also. I have used the same large thermicon since the beginning and the indicator shows it to still have 3 bars (measuring 3-0).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using the NONO for his chest for 2 weeks now. He does not have a very hairy chest to begin with but has noticed a slower growth and a thinning in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will update when he has more results. Also feel free to ask questions if I have not covered something you would like to know:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my 4th week and the hair seems to be getting very fine and soft. I imagine it is a much slower process due to me not using the growth inhibiting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is not using it on a regular basis, so I apoligize for not being able to give more information on his use of the nono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle of 5th week...OK so my NONO is not working correctly. I called customer service and they are sending me a new one and starting my 60 days over again. I suppose I can&#x27;t complain about that assuming this was a malfuction in the device I recieved and not that the device itself is crap. This kind of screws up my 6 week review for you so I will continue to review after I recieve my new nono. It will be interesting to see if the time lapse will effect the hair growth. I will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-4-11&lt;br /&gt;Ok I just receivedmy new NONO 12-3. I am a few days behind schedule, I have 3 days to finish my 5th week and will update on the 7th. I was without my NONO for 5 days and did not notice new hair growth or anything to make me think I was set back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-7-11&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 5&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my 5th week with the NONO and I have to say that I am happy with my results. I even changed my rating!&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my arms is almost gone. If I look closely I can see baby fine hairs. I would definitely have to say the process has been slower with my legs than other areas, but the results are coming along. The hair on my legs is very light and soft, I feel more skin than hair if I run my hand against the growth. Any vellus hair I had is gone and the hair that was course is becoming vellus. I have larger patches that have nothing. The growth is now extremely slow. I hardly had any new growth during my 5 day hiatus.&lt;br /&gt;The thermicon I was using ran out, so I would say they last about a month.&lt;br /&gt;I think it will take more than 6 weeks to get the desired results I am looking for. But I think it will be worth it. I am happy to answer any questions. I hope my review helps. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update again on the 14th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-16-11&lt;br /&gt;The NONO is on it&#x27;s last chance with me. I had to send back my 2nd NONO due it not even turning on after charging, it also blew the wire on both of my thermicon attachments. Customer service sent me a new NONO and new attachments and started my 60 day trial over. AGAIN. I asked for the Black nono this time after the representive made me aware that it is the latest to be released and they have not had the black nonos returned. So far so good but I have only had this one now for a day. I would have given up and gotten my money back if it were not for the fact that I have noticed such a difference in my hair growth. I really hope this one is not defective. My last two were pink whether this is relevent or not I can&#x27;t say but I would want to know if I was reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;AND of course due to another set back in time I am not prepared for my 6 week review. I realize my two returns may have made the decision for some but I will still post my 6th week to complete my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-2-12&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that my new nono has been working great. Actually better than I imagined. I ordered the Black NONO on my second return and I feel it is more powerful. I can&#x27;t say if it is due to finally having one that works or because it is marketed toward the male consumer. With the black nono 1 pass and the hair burns off.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my results after 6 weeks. Any hair that was on my upper lip is gone. My chin (my problem area) has a few sporatic hairs that are not noticable. My arms are hairless, underarms have a few that I need to use the nono a couple times a week. My legs, (which have seemed to take the longest to see results) are showing progressively less regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share a few tips for the upper lip I have learned through my use of the NONO device. (it took me awhile to get this one)&lt;br /&gt;For upper lip: Again the larger thermicon the smaller one burns me. You can move the nono in toward the nose or outward toward the jawline (as the directions tell you to). But lets be honest that is not how the hair grows. I pull my lips in (as if evening out lipstick) and I stick my toung under my upper lip (depending on the area I am trying to reach) to make a smooth even surface for gliding the nono and not to get burned. And move in an upward motion. Start off on the lowest setting work from there to see what works for you. Do not tip the nono forward, more than a 90 degree angle, this always burned me in the beginning. It is ok to tip it back toward the roller a little. The NONO works best on short stubble. I made the mistake of letting my hair grow out before getting the NONO (used to having to do so for waxing) and it took me longer to use it and more passes to burn the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that is all for my review. I appreicate all your responses and I will be following any comments for questions. I hope my review helped in your decision to buy this device:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-19-12&lt;br /&gt;Well today my new NONO (the black one) stopped working, it sounds like the motor on it is going. It seems like these things are designed to work for 30-50 days and break in some way. So I have a choice to make... get a new nono every 50 days or so (as they keep starting over my 60 days) or just get my money back and search out the next best way for hair removal. I&#x27;m very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-21-12&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give a little update... I did receive another replacement nono. This one has been working fine with no problems. I am still using my nono and remain happy with my results. It is not a device that will make you \\&quot;completely hairless\\&quot; in my opinion, but the difference is enough for me to find it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to clear up some confusion, I have been questioned about my four star rating then me saying that I am disappointed... I was disappointed about the devices malfunctioning on me, but not the results I got using the nono. My rating it based on my results as I can not honestly say that my experience in receiving malfunctioning devices is typical or not. However, it is only fair to let any other consumer make the choice to purchase one for themselves by me simply sharing my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melin</li>
    <li> Takes to long razer is faster</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t do waxing this is the product to use.  I love mine and can&#x27;t do without it. Just be careful and don&#x27;t use around blimishes.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but with patience and consistency, the No No actually does work. I have PCOS and one of the conditions is that you get facial hair. I have coarse black hairs on my chin and neck, and by hairs I mean A LOT of hair. I typically shave every morning. After using the No No a few times, the hair does come back but it&#x27;s softer and there is less of it. Now, I can use the No No on a Saturday after letting the hair grow out a bit and pluck the remaining hairs that were too short and I&#x27;m good to go. For my circumstance, it works fine!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t invest in this product.  It is not worth the time or money.  I called the company to return it on the 27th day and could not get a number from them which is required to return the product.  They talked me into using it through the whole 60-day trial period.  I was still dissatisfied for various reasons.  It won&#x27;t turn off, it is not removing hair, and it is a big waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Although this hasn&#x27;t made the world a perfect place.  Nono does help retard the growth of unwanted hair.  It&#x27;s a better product than most things I have tried.</li>
    <li> It is expensive and not really worth it.  NoNo will give you a small discount but you will waive your right to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to use on the face.  But the time the machine engages I have ran out of area to remove hair on.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work so well on my legs, and I have normal hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;It worked OK the first time on my forearm, not so well the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got board with it pretty fast and put it away.  Just last week I brought it back out of the closet and tried it again...it would not work.  As I am getting madder and madder for paying so awful much for it...my husband said, \\&quot;Let me see it.\\&quot;  The belt was stuck in place and would not move.  He was able to get the belt moving again so it would engage the laser/light...whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy it again and get mad at myself for getting caught up in the hype about it.</li>
    <li> I am an older person so I dread the growth of hair on my face from hormonal changes. The No-no prevents that and that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  They tell you to shave and several other steps in addition to using this. However it still does nothing. BIG Waste of money</li>
    <li> I was taken in by the tv ads. They promised more than could be delivered. I have coarse hair and have tried every kind of hair remover on the market. This did not work as advertised. It took 30 minutes per leg and I had to go over the same area 6 to 10 times. By the next day the hair was back. I tried it for several weeks. Did not notice any change. Shaving takes 5 minutes a day. So in total one week of shaving every day is more effective and less time consuming.</li>
    <li> I am feeling very sorry I wasted my money on this junk. Not worth the money. Cheap and does not work well. I can shave faster than&lt;br /&gt;this thing.  What could take an hour with the NO No I can do in 5 minutes. Now I know why they named it NO No. It is no no good. Do not waste your money, overpriced and overrated. I give it 1/2 a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dgar</li>
    <li> I see absolutely no hair removal with this product.  I&#x27;ve tried it many times, following the instructions and using different parts of the body, hair lengths, etc.  I should have researched more before wasting my money on this!</li>
    <li> I purchased my no non for men to manage my hair. I have found it is partly effective not has not eliminated the need to shave</li>
    <li> I am so sorry I wasted my money on this. I am usually cautious and look at reveiews all over before making an expensive purchase.  This barely removes hair from areas you need it to. The rubber roller on it sticks causing the unit to continuously run and still does not work right. It is a scam to say that this works as good as they claim. Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I first saw it on Dr. Oz and on THE DOCTORS show and thought they would not give faulty recommendations. I was wrong.  I have been using it 3 times a week for over a year, trying desparately not to have gotten ripped off.  But, after using it for over a year on my face, there is absolutely NO difference in the hair growth. NONE!  It simply does not work. Period. I didn&#x27;t even try to send it back,  I just kept thinking it needed more time.  Wrong. It just does not work.  Plus, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get it to work on your upper lip. Just can&#x27;t get good contact.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It is junk.</li>
    <li> I purchase the No No Radiency with good faith.  After two weeks I was wondering what I was doing wrong. When I contacted No No, they explained that it some times works longer on others and gave me helpful tips. None of them worked. I requested 4 (four) times for return labels. On the last time, they explained that I was past the deadline for a return. BIG SCAM if this product does not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time &#x3D; directly after they would not send me the return labels. I sent it back Canada Post. Visa would not credit me. No No would not credit me. So I am out the money and the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendy Newton</li>
    <li> I found that it didn&#x27;t burn the hair all the way down by the follicle like it claimed. Left me feeling like I had razor stubble all the time. Would not recommend it to anyone, complete waste of money!!! Do not waste your money or your time with this product, does not do what it claims!!!!!</li>
    <li> Found out after I bought it that it doesn&#x27;t work on blondes.  They should state that in their ads on on their website.</li>
    <li> I received my NoNo and it worked great for the first 8 weeks, however when it was too late to return for a full refund it would not work properly to cut the hair.  It does not work on the under arms at all with out leave chaffing when I contact customer service they did have me return it for a warranty exchange.  The second NoNo worked great again for about 8 weeks and stopped working,  I&#x27;ve changed the tips and it doesn&#x27;t matter it doesn not do what it claims to do.  I do not recommend it stick with a standard razor at lease you&#x27;ll have smooth legs without all the effort that goes into the NoNo systems.  I am disappointed that I am stuck with a product that does not work any longer and I can&#x27;t return it for my money back. Too much money for it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have had little success with other hair products and waxing is just too painful. This product after use makes my skin feel very smooth, without bumps or painful cuts you receive from razors. Thank you no! no!</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine hair and the NoNo works well IF U HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.  If I could still return it for a full refund&lt;br /&gt;I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORKS WELL ON FINE HAIR IF U HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;TIME CONSUMING&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL ON COARSE HAIR (NO IDEA ABOUT OTHER HAIR TYPES NOT MENTIONED)</li>
    <li> I love my nono it is great and easy The only thing it needs is a charger for the car.</li>
    <li> Any words are a waste like the NoNo. This product does not work. I tried patiently for months to no avail.</li>
    <li> the product is real good ! my wife loves it.only 4 stars because package was all disassembled and in a mess when I received it! the company needs to secure their product a lot better .almost $300.00 worth of merchandise should be in stronger more secure packaging.nuff said!</li>
    <li> My sister just called to tell me her No! No! Hair Removal System burned her skin. She is in terrible pain.</li>
    <li> ive been struggling with facial hair for a long time now and there has been nothing that i have found to work for me!!!! so when my husband and i saw the nono we thought &#x27;well it cant hurt to try&#x27; but once again im back at square one cuz the nono didnt work iether... not only did it hurt like the commercials say it wouldnt but it also burnt my skin pretty bad.. so unless you have money to just throw away on something so exspensive i wouldnt waste my time..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. Doesn&#x27;t work worth crap</li>
    <li> Anyone who doesn&#x27;t give this product a good review either isn&#x27;t following the instructions or is just plain impatient or both.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.  It works.  It takes some practice to perfect the technique when you start, because when you first start out you&#x27;re probably going too slow or getting stuck.  And going too slow makes it jump. So once you figure out the optimal technique to make it flow smoothly over your skin, which will probably be by 2nd use, 3rd at the latest, then you&#x27;re coasting.  Also, if you use proper technique, it will never burn.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  It feels warm against your skin.  If you get burned then you are going too slow and the device will be jumping around because it is designed for your safety and the developers don&#x27;t want you to give third degree burns to your skin.  It&#x27;s very hot.  Burns are extremely minor though and don&#x27;t really hurt and just make your skin red for a little while thanks to the jumping safety feature where if you go too slow or get stuck it disengages.  You&#x27;ll see.  You need to be thankful for the jumping.  It&#x27;s saving your skin.  Again, once you get the technique down, you&#x27;ll be gliding and don&#x27;t have to worry about the jumping and the burning at all.&lt;br /&gt;  Okay, now that you actually practiced getting the technique down and didn&#x27;t send it back in disgust because you couldn&#x27;t get it to work right first or second try, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!  Use it 2-3 times a week for the first 6-8 weeks or so.  Then you won&#x27;t have much hair left at that point so once a week or less is fine. Probably much less. I did twice a week for 6 weeks. Don&#x27;t use it everyday.  Don&#x27;t use it once a week.  Don&#x27;t use it once every 2 weeks.  Do as they suggest.  And use the buffer and the skin cream.  Just do it.  It helps.  It astonishes me reading the reviews from all these idiots who give it one star and say it doesn&#x27;t work, yet they aren&#x27;t following the instructions.  What are you stupid?!  Also you can&#x27;t shave and then use theproduct.  The product is designed not to burn your skin.  So guess what?  You need to have a little hair there so the heat can actually zap the hair and not your skin.  If you don&#x27;t have any hair then the device can&#x27;t reach the hair.  You don&#x27;t want it to burn the entire surface of your skin as well do you? Nobody should be complaining about that.  The hair needs to be 1-3mm long for the heat to reach it and zap it.  That&#x27;s stubble length. So let it grow out a couple of days, then do your treatment.  Geesh. I laughed at some guy&#x27;s review where he said he used it everyday and it didn&#x27;t work.  Well, you didn&#x27;t have any hair that could be reached at any time, bozo!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Okay, now that you&#x27;re following the instructions unlike most of the imbeciles on here, my last piece of advice is BE PATIENT.  It doesn&#x27;t remove the hairs like you imagine it would when you start out.  It is not a razor.  It singes the hairs.  Some of the hairs will get cut a bit from the singes, others won&#x27;t, and some will get kinda curly cued from getting zapped by the heat.  So it leaves alot of stubbly hair when you do a treatment.  It doesn&#x27;t remove it.  You&#x27;ll probably even have to shave afterwards if you&#x27;re doing a place that has lots of hair.  So what?  After awhile you&#x27;ll no longer need to shave. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s doing a thing after the first week or two of treatment.  It looks like it&#x27;s doing nothing.  BUT you&#x27;ll notice if you look closely some of the hairs will start falling off.  Then you&#x27;ll notice patches of hair not growing back at all or growing in thinner.  Sure, the hair next to it will be growing like normal, but the longer you do the treatments according to instructions, the more patches of no hair growth you will get.  I noticed after about 2 weeks that a little hair started falling out and my hair started to get slightly patchy and clearly some of the hair was not growing back.  By 6 weeks, 60% or so was gone and what was growing back AT ALL was mighty thin and itwas growing in very slowly.  And I&#x27;m a man.  So all you women out there, I&#x27;m sure results will be better for you because your hair is not as coarse.  I hope I&#x27;ve helped some people who are listening to all these dopey comments.  It works.  Get it.  Get your technique down and don&#x27;t give up in disgust, follow the instructions, and be patient.  It&#x27;s that simple. :)</li>
    <li> I brought this for my mother for her Birthday. Since she&#x27;s been bothering me about it. It came in excellent time and the packaging was great but this advertises that the hair removal is painless when in actuality there is no such thing. My mom complained the next day about how painful it was. And it would burn and and she hasn&#x27;t used it since. It was a complete waste of money..</li>
    <li> After contacting Radiancy about their NO NO on a number of occasions  I still cannot get this product to remove any hair whatsoever.  I have never used a hair removal product or machine on my face so my facial hair is mostly blonde and very fine.  I tried the NO NO on my upper legs first.  I am not a hairy person.  I have never needed to shave my upper legs (basically little to no hair there) so I thought I would experiment with the NoNo  there first before taking the chance of using this on my face.  IT DID NOT WORK.  After contacting Radiancy again, they convinced me to try the NoNo product on my upper lip which is what I had bought this product for in the first place.  I did and I am sorry because now I have more hair on my upper lip than I did before I used the NoNo.  THIS WAS DEFINITELY AN EXPENSIVE BAD LESSON AND A TOTAL WASTE OF GOOD MONEY LET ALONE THE TIME AND EFFORT I EXPENDED FOR NO RESULTS.  I AM MORE THAN DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I found this device extremely difficult to use.  Perhaps the unit I had did not work properly but I could not get it to work correctly gliding it over my skin.  I read through the directions several times, read through the website and just could not get it work right. For me at least, it was not as simple as the commercials make it out to be.  I tried for 2 weeks to get the thing to work since I wanted to give it a fair try.  When it did work the smell of burning hair was simply more than I could stand.  If it had worked I had already been planning on perhaps using it outside or by an open window.</li>
    <li> If you lack patience don&#x27;t buy this product.  It is not an instant result and for long terms hair removal your talking many moons.  Also it will not leave skin feeling instantly smooth, it will actually feel like sand paper.</li>
    <li> This device is basically just a fancy cigarette lighter; it burns hair off. Only, for reasons of safety, it&#x27;s not a close shave, nor a smooth one. It does NOT inhibit or prevent regrowth. The lotion they send with it does that. The same kind of inhibitor you will find at a local store. A bic lighter and a bottle of lotion costs $7.50. A No-NO costs $270. Either route produces the same results and lasts roughly the same period of time. My No-No made it 8 weeks before it stopped functioning. My bic lasted a week less before running out of fuel. So, to recap, that&#x27;s $33 a day to burn away hair with No-No, or 4 cents a day for the Walmart method. Do the math, and don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.</li>
    <li> Only removes the finest, peach-fuzz.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. I&#x27;ve used it for months and the hair keeps coming in the same thickness and at the same frequency. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I as an Anniversary present.  I tried it once on him and it didn&#x27;t work at all. It said give it 3 tries and you&#x27;ll be an expert!  Well I waited and let my hair grow a little and tried it that second time - and it didn&#x27;t work for me either!  And by then we had had it for a while ( between purchase, Anniversary and second attempt) and it was past return date.  Don&#x27;t even bother with this...a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a year ago and haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work yet. $299 down the drain. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Shave instead.</li>
    <li> I got this after this infomercials. It acts as though you use it once and you have no hair but this does not happen; Unless you have time to do it slowly over and over it really doens&#x27;t fulfill the ad&#x27;s claims. I see new commercials and infomercials in malls and they acts as though it does it the first time. If the new one is better than my 2 year old one, I wish someone would tell me.</li>
    <li> No, with me, dark blonde and hairy didn&#x60;t work, after 1 year of regular attentive job, I quit! And I buy an epilator, painful but efficient.....</li>
    <li> Complete waste of time and money! Painless? In my case, only until it was actually used a little bit.  Both original and replacement units failed quickly, and the electricity goes from an on/off blue light w/zapping sound and burning hair smell to an eye-opening, constant, intense fire-orange right where you&#x27;re supposed to touch your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t stop without force.  The head&#x27;s supposed to move up/down or back/forth as you move it over area being treated, with the blue light indicating normal operation. But the heads wear out super fast and cost a lot to replace. Your notice that it&#x27;s time to replace a head seems to only be the scary, unrelenting fiery orange light (which is the head&#x27;s current-conducting, using something nearby to anxiously fling the head off the unit to make it stop glowing fire at you. And its purpose-hair removal? Not here. Feel my almost $300 was wasted on this experiment. When original unit zapped me right next to my lip, it stung a lot. Company said they&#x27;d replace unit. I sent it back. When I called them about 2 months after they got it, only then did they send the replacement! After about 2 attempts with both new heads barely used, the 2nd unit did the same thing. Product costs too much to require new heads so very often, especially with no results to show for any of the effort or cost! Product was a total disappointment. No No? Absolutely NO! NO!</li>
    <li> After reading some negative reviews, I felt I HAD to comment. I love my NoNo.  It works perfectly.  I cant say enough good things about the NoNo. Apparently those who think it doesnt work, arent using the product correctly.  It is definetely not a SCAM. If it&#x27;s not working, re-read the directions! My NoNo works perfectly and most, of all delivers on its claims!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. My mom and I received one for each of us as gifts from our husbands, and were excited to use the product. It burned our skin and didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair. I wish I would&#x27;ve read the reviews BEFORE I asked for this! Instead I fell for the stupid infomercial. I am going to do everything it takes to sue this company! I think LOTS of consumers who&#x27;ve used this product and have received burn marks deserve to be compensated! My mom has a deep burn on her upper lip. I have burn marks on my legs. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Don&#x27;t buy it. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it 1 star. It deserves negative 10 stars. AND  they DID NOT give us our money back for the product. Don&#x27;t purchase this! Not even worth them giving it to you for free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use on my chin and other facial hairs. I am 67 and have been dealing with chin hairs for years. I can&#x27;t laser since the hair is light or white.  It was a daily constant battle to keep ahead of the game. My poor chin was constantly mangled from all the constant plucking. The facial hairs were getting fuzzier and longer as I got older and plucking just makes them grow faster and be more coarse. I used the No No and I could tell the very next morning that it was sooooo much better. I use it several times a day and my chin is finally healing and the scarring is going away from the the daily plucking. I am so thankful I have this product and highly recommend it for those in my situation.  I wish I had had it years ago. I use the small tip for the task.  Thanks, NO NO</li>
    <li> Burned my grandpas skin. Hate this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because they salesman said that my fair skin and hair made me the perfect person to use this product. I followed the instructions perfectly (which was tedious) and it didn&#x27;t help at all! It wasn&#x27;t easy to return but they eventually repaid me. I had to call several times for them to finally pay me and I had to be very forceful. They kept trying to put me off by telling me to give it about 5 more days; after the third time I said no since I would go over my 60 day trial. I know one thing is that even when a company says you can go over the trial period, they will forget somehow that they ever agreed to the extension!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to see so many negative reviews for this product. Amazon is doing the world a fabulous service by allowing us all to post quickly our experiences with various consumer items. And No!No! promises way more than it can deliver. I&#x27;ve only held onto my No!No! because it does help with the light, thin hairs around my chin &amp; lip areas. (I still have to pluck there, however.)&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the silver No!No! over a year ago, and did the 6-week trial carefully/thoroughly. But my hair came back just like it usually does. After the 6-week period, I stopped using the lotion they send &amp; recommend, since it contains the metal aluminum, which is not a super-safe substance, especially on skin that has just been heated with special lasers or whatever is in the device. (Note: I realize aluminum is pretty critical to anti-perspirants, which I do use every morning - but not directly after shaving [once a week ... now that I&#x27;ve had to give up on my No!No! for everything but my chin &amp; lip areas.)&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of whether I continued that somewhat unsafe lotion, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have any difference in the long term.  Perhaps it&#x27;s partly because I have been shaving (just once a week ... I have light-colored hair) for the past 25 years, so my hair is tougher than someone who wants it for a new site (e.g., a man&#x27;s back or a young gal&#x27;s bikini line?).  Anyhow, after months of using the No!No! on legs, underarms, bikini area, and chin area, I had to limit it to just my chin. I&#x27;m back to shaving once a week, which is a LOT less time consuming &amp; better at hair removal than using a No!No!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this device, except perhaps for the face (if you don&#x27;t have better options).  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my arms, but hair there doesn&#x27;t trouble me. (I&#x27;m surprised people mind hair on their arms.  It&#x27;s a lot of work to remove hair all over! ;-) )&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this opportunity to share my experience.</li>
    <li> Okay I am not sure if this product will work because I believe it takes a while to see great results, but watch out for burns because it can hurt and leave cuts/burns.  After emailing back and forth for a while I ended up calling the actual nono company who told me I could create an account with them and pay 19.99 for a 2 year warranty so I did that.  Besides nesstech telling me to call nono customer service (the brush off) they didn&#x27;t really help me at all. They need better customer service, but now I have a 2 year warranty so if I have any more problems I can actually get the help I need.</li>
    <li> I thought it would do a better job but I still like it just takes more time to do then I thought</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t stay on, hair is not thinned or shaved or lessened. What a waste of money! Maybe it is broken, maybe it is a scam.</li>
    <li> because I have used it 3 times a week since I got it, which should be about 6 weeks now, and I have not had one change in the hair problem.</li>
    <li> it takes a long time for hair to be slower in growth.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely a waste of money.  I was very excited about receiving it since I had seen the infomercials on how great it is.  This product is useless unless you have 24 hours a day devoted to removing hair.  Even then, the hair still remains.  At least with my epilator it hurts like crazy, but the hair is gone!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my wife, It is exactly what she was looking for, as she was surprised of the results, it works perfect as its name no hair no pain.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever bought! It looked brand new when I took it out, however following the instructions and trying the product it did not work! When looking at what reasons could be it said it is a bad wire! I just bought it, never again will I purchase this product</li>
    <li> i bought the nono last yr. it work ok on my part for the first 60 days. i was like ok so ill keep it. then the rubber band that makes it work didnt want to stay on that well. it stayed on when ever it wants to. . so i called them back and they like sorry we cant give you the money back but we can give you a new one. im like i dont even want it any more. plus the blades keep braking after like a month of use. so i have a 200 object that sits on my drawer and barely even works. just dont buy it.</li>
    <li> i purchased this as a gift and it did not work out of the box.  The heating coil did not get hot at all. I contacted Radiancy about the warranty policy and was told that because i purchased it through Amazon they could not do anything even though it was a defective product. Because it was a gift it passed the 30 days to return the no no. I was fortunate that Amazon was helpful and willing to make an exception for me. Would i recommend this product absolutely not the company does not stand by their 1 year manufacturer warranty and does not care about a customer. I am definitely making sure that I use Amazon from now on</li>
    <li> Seriously, this thing is a POS. Do not buy it. All it does is make the air around you stinky with the smell of burnt hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing basically burns your hair off with a wire. Yes, the wire has safety guides to keep you from hurting yoursef but because of those guides you can&#x27;t get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like it and tried it over and over but it never got a close enough shave and always left tons of hair behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the buffer pad is where the real hair removal happens but they wear out quickly and need replacing after going over HALF a leg. So you have to replace those buffer pads all the time and there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the \\&quot;thermocon tips?\\&quot; Those are the things with the wire that burns your hair off. They wear out and need to be replaced regularly--so there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the product reviews before spending $250 bucks on a POS this weekend on HSN.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with high hopes, but it fell far short of my expectations. I started on my arm, where most instructionals said was the easiest place to begin. It smelled HORRIBLE and did nothing for 2 or 3 passes. I kept on going, thinking that I must be doing something wrong. I watched more tutuorials and learned that, lo and behold, I was doing everything right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I was left with coarse, singed, rancid-smelling hairs on my arm. I used my trusty epilator on that arm and the other one. The pain is worth the baby-soft skin it leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this item. I really regret purchasing it and I&#x27;m in the process of returning it now.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 4 weeks and all I had was constant &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; leg hair stubble. I needed to return it after using it for 4 weeks due to the return policy time frame. It might have worked after another 4 weeks however with zero results after the first 4 weeks I didn&#x27;t see the point in trying again for another 4 weeks with a second order. Although it is true that it does not hurt, all it seemed to do was burn the hair above the skin. I saw no diminishing of the hair at all. I switched to an epilator and, although it hurts just a little bit and I do have constant leg hair stubble, the stubble is diminishing and what little stubble there is, is ok (in my opinion) for at least a week. It is no worse than the &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; stubble you get with a regular razor. I can&#x27;t say that about the no!no!. An epilator once every 7 to 10 days is the best solution for me as opposed to using a razor every day.</li>
    <li> I got this and noticed right away that it sucks. it DOES NOT give you smooth silky skin, just stuble ( and may i note..the buffer it comes with does not get rid of the stuble). i get better results when i shave with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so overall, my consideration is...do not make the mistake of wasting time and money on this ridiculous thing. totally not worth it.</li>
    <li> I payed for a expensive hair burner er that does not remove the hare at skin level or root .</li>
    <li> What a piece of s***.  It burns your hair off.  So if you have dark hair.  It sucks, I would love to get my money back.  But no answers when you call......Pissed</li>
    <li> I would give zero stars if it was an option. This product does not remove the hair, the hair does not stay gone, and to add insult to injury - you have to throw away more money to buy the thermacon tips. This is an extremely expensive lesson I made. Please avoid making the same mistake. Nair or similar works 300% better and at mush less cost. I&#x27;m fair skinned and never needed to use the lotion because the system is so faulty.</li>
    <li> I ordered No!No! by Radiancy in December 2013.  The product carried a 60 day unconditional return.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived with a broken screen.  The device was usable, I guess, but  I did not like the product and had to call the company to get &amp;#34;permission&amp;#34; to return it.  The representative was nasty and argued with me at length but finally agreed to send me a return label via email.  The label did not arrive until I had called them three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product to Radiancy, with all its accessories, charger, instructions, etc., including a note stating that I did not like the product and did not want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short time later, I received another No! No! by Radiancy in the mail.  The device was in an envelope.  It was not in a box, nor did it contain any of the accessories, charger, instructions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once again called Radiancy to beg for &amp;#34;permission&amp;#34; to return the device.  At that point, they told me that it was past the warranty period, and I could not return it.  After talking to numerous uncooperative, nasty representatives, including a supervisor, they finally agreed to accept the device back, and sent me another return label via email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the device, but immediately noted that Radiancy had charged my card for the &amp;#34;first payment,&amp;#34; which I disputed, and the charge was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then started receiving collection emails and telephone calls.  Radiancy representatives stated they had never received either device.  They stated they had no record that any return labels had been sent to me.  They stated had no record that a second No!No! had been sent to me.  They had no record that the second No!No! had been returned to them.  They stated the second No!No! was returned after the warranty period had expired, etc.  They are now threatening collection action.  Basically, whenever I fielded one of their claims, they changed their story to something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then proceeded toUPS, where I was provided with proof that both devices had been returned to:  Radiancy Returns Customer, 150 Stewart Parkway, Greensboro, Georgia  30642.  The documents UPS provided indicated that the first device had arrived at their location on 02/21/2014 at 10:39, at the dock, and had been signed for by a Radiancy representative by the name of Dannon; the second device, which, again, I had not ordered and did not arrive with any accessories, arrived at the location, same address, on 03/14/2014, at 10:45, by &amp;#34;receiver&amp;#34;, and was signed I ordered No!No! by Radiancy in December 2013.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well at all. The only thing it does is burn your hair and stink up the room</li>
    <li> You may have noticed looking through all of these reviews that people are pretty vague when it comes to the true result of long term use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That, I think, is because the results themselves are pretty vague. After about a year of regular use, I notice my facial hair isn&#x27;t as bad as it used to be, though it is certainly is still there and it is still a problem albeit less of a problem. I don&#x27;t have to spend 30 minutes every 5 days yanking hairs out of my face. My leg hair is a lot easier to shave now, it is more sparse, but I still have to shave it. I was weary about using this on my armpit areas but I started to recently and I&#x27;ll have to get back to you on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned, I&#x27;ve never seen a shade of make-up too light for my skin, but my hair is practically black. My facial hair is too. So maybe hair is just very noticeable on me because of the contrast. Maybe that&#x27;s why I am not as pleased with the result as I possibly could be. It is my thought that this NONO obliterates your wispy, tiny hairs in no time so your skin DOES feel \\&quot;smoother,\\&quot; but the coarser, larger hairs aren&#x27;t going away. Perhaps it&#x27;s just going to take very long-term use of this product to get rid of them completely, I don&#x27;t know. In other words, you are going to have to use this thing for a long time, so you better get a color you like. You and NoNo are going to be spending more time together than you&#x27;d probably like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing creates a disturbing smell of burnt hair. You&#x27;re not going to want to use it at your in-laws or anything unless you all are very close. I hated using this thing when my husband was home: \\&quot;Agh! What&#x27;s that SMELL?!\\&quot; Oh nothing, dear. Just trying to burn all of the unsightly hair off of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? If I lost my luggage and NoNo was in it, I would be needing a replacement. But I&#x27;d be mad about paying for it. It&#x27;s not a problem solver, but it minimizes the unwanted hair issue, making it easier to pluck and shave. I like that I can use it out of the bath, too. And it does minimize the time you spend in the bath shaving, which is always good. You do have to use it regularly to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the charge on this the unit is nothing short of impressive. I&#x27;ve been using it for four months on this last charge and I still have two bars left! That is a major plus for me! One less charger to pack on vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the buffers are helpful! I&#x27;d get some extras! The cartridges come in two sizes, and I find the large one works fine for all of my parts. I used the little one on my face for a while but I just don&#x27;t have all day to be doing this so I&#x27;ve just been using the same one all over and even with sensitive skin there&#x27;s been no adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My baby is absolutely terrified of it. She thinks it is hurting me. But it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all. Sometimes there will be a pinch, like once every five minutes or so, but nothing that you can&#x27;t tolerate if you shave and tweeze. Nothing hurts more than those two! Sometimes wists of smoke come off of it while you are using it and that is a little scary for me. But it rarely hurts and it&#x27;s an improvement so I have to admit I like it. If you have fine hair, you are going to love it.k and shave. I like that I can use it out of the bath, too. And it does minimize the time you spend in the bath shaving, which is always good.

    <li> I am so unhappy with this product. Worst investment ever. Wish I could get my money back!! I will be contacting the manufacture.</li>
    <li> No-no does work but there is a problem with defective No-no&#x27;s.  My first No-no&#x27;s had problems but I returned them and they listened to me about problems with the rollers and the later models have changed the rollers and they do not break down and I love my No-no.  I suggest that you have 2 so that when a bad model is being shipped to you that you have another one to use.  Things will get better for you!!</li>
    <li> For us over 50 crowd that now have to deal with facial hair like never before, it works wonders! There are a few hairs I still have to pluck but my facial hair, especially around my mouth doesn&#x27;t grow as fast or as thick as it did. It was well worth the price to avoid the painful waxing that didn&#x27;t last but just a few days. I only use it on my face but still well worth the price.</li>
    <li> For me the process takes longer than expected, but the results are advertised correctly.  If you have the time to set aside for this grooming procedure it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used the NO NO for over 2 years on the fine hair on my face, at least 3 times a week.  It did not reduce or change the hair growth in any way. It does singe the hair and with the buffer make it look less noticable. But if I don&#x27;t use it constantly the hair grows back exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on the blonde hair on my arms with the same short lasting results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a heated element hair removal system, worked average on forearms. Leg hair that was coarser, not so much. Tried to return it, they didn&#x27;t honor it. Also the attachment with the wire that heats, breaks a lot. It&#x27;s not a good investment, IMO.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a year now - my biggest problem is the inconsistency in the hair removal and it ALWAYS grows back. You have to REALLY follow the growth patterns of the hair to be successful and that can be difficult to do. Forget about using it on your underarms! A few months back it quit working - I had to buy replacement \\&quot;thermicon tips\\&quot; (which I knew nothing about at the time of purchase) and will have to continue replacing these at $50 (or more) a couple of times a year. Not a good buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Embarrassed to tell anyone that I bought this.  What a waste of money! First time I used it I got burned and had the smell of burning hair.  \\&quot;Great!\\&quot;, I thought \\&quot;it might work.\\&quot;  After that, nothing.  You&#x27;re better off rubbing the hair off your skin with a brillo pad because that buffer doesn&#x27;t do much of anything either.</li>
    <li> The unit would only burn one or two hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;At that rate it would have taken years to burn all my chest hair. My razer did the job in thirty minutes. Save your money and wax your legs.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. Save your money and buy something that really works. When it didn&#x27;t work for me I had my wife try it. Guess what, it didn&#x27;t work for her. So save your money don&#x27;t buy any NoNo product.</li>
    <li> This product is a total waste of money if you have blond hair. The product does not work and the company does not want to disclose this critical detail. It peeled my skin off instead of removing hair. I failed to return the product within the company&#x27;s timeline and was not able to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two years.  It will not stop hair from growing!  When you first start the hair starts to thin but with time it returns even with ongoing use.I have had over five units fail and replaced.  The company is best at replacement.  The last time I called I asked for a supervisor for a call back and that was over eight months ago.  They want to get your money knowing you will never have success.  Any offers for a used black No No?</li>
    <li> I use NoNo on my face.  The hair is finer, lighter or gone in some instances.  If you are looking&lt;br /&gt;for a short term immediate result use wax or a depilatory.  I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year and&lt;br /&gt;still try to use it once or twice a week.  Hair is almost entirely gone.</li>
    <li> This product is the worse thing on the market for it states it does.  Watch the video, it doesn&#x27;t remove hair like it says it does and it grows back like normal.  I would give 0 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a shot but unfortunately I too waited too long for the 60 warranty.</li>
    <li> I fell for the trial period! I thought i was smart enough to remember to send it back if I didn&#x27;t like it. Well apparently not. You keep thinking it will get better and you will see the advertised results. Don&#x27;t fall for it. It doesn&#x27;t work. Hate it. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. Yes it will burn off a few hairs, but nothing close to what you see on tv. Buy at your own risk, you have been warned. And it&#x27;s not as easy to get a refund as they say.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work had to replace the small head in a short period of time. also the one I have already broke down.  Poor quality!&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend it</li>
    <li> It has not worked from the first day that I got it! Did not do anything it was advertised to do! And, because I didn&#x27;t send it back in enough time, I&#x27;m stuck with the piece of junk! A lot of money is being made off of us suckers!</li>
    <li> Tedious to use. Used it over and over for months. Doesn&#x27;t help at all. As I saw no difference I gave up and am sorry I wasted money for this expensive no good item.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I do not feel it was as good as it was claimed to be.  I have tried to use it several times.  Very slow going.  Have to continuously pass over the same area in order to see any results.  For the quality of the product I feel this product is WAY over priced.  I was very hopefully it would be a good product but was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like other users I tried to find product reviews before I purchased my no no. However, there were none to be found, so I thought I would give it a try. I didn&#x27;t use any of the creams provided, as the smelt like they have some nasty chemicals that would eventually be absorbed by my skin and enter the blood stream and have to be processed by the organs. The unit itself was designed well but overall was very disappointing. The wire on the head doesn&#x27;t last very long and does not burn the hair off well. The buffer does help remove the hair left behind that isn&#x27;t quite burnt off. The amount of time it takes to do your legs is ridiculous. Over an hour to have the lower legs complete. It was a waste of time. Re-ordered the heads after 1st set burnt out very quickly. Customer sales service is very good. So, just say NO to the clever marketing schemes and spend your money somewhere else.</li>
    <li> After years of watching the TV infomercials I finally was lured into buying a NO NO, which turned out to be a very time consuming product. I could have shaved my legs 3x in the time it took me to No No 1 of my legs (&amp; i&#x27;m not that hairy). My high hopes of never having to shave again were dashed! Wishful thinking on my part. After 6 months of use &amp; following the directions faithfully, there was little change to the hair growth. I even went so far as to buy replacement wide thericon tips thinking the original tip had worn out. Unfortunately there was no difference with the news tips. To say I am not impressed with this product is an understatement! This device is not worth the outrageous price it sells for. Save your hard earned money, have your hair removed any other way, you&#x27;ll be happier in the long run you weren&#x27;t scammed buy this worthless product. Not as advertised. JUST SAY NO TO NO NO!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Only burns off fine hair.  Does not slow hair growth.  If anything, my facial peach fuzz seems longer and thicker than ever before.  I haven&#x27;t used the lotion.  If anything will slow hair growth, it is the chemicals in the lotion, not the no!no!.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Oh man I saved for this stupid thing. It&#x27;s a cheap product. I thought it was a laser not a hot wire that burns you with a fancy blue light. Burnt the hair and a little skin. Extremely Pissed</li>
    <li> i was very disapointed  i had better results with a product called epilady. i thought nono would work better for me.sorry but tried</li>
    <li> It is Ok, but does not remove coarse facial hair. I still need to use a tweezer for that.&lt;br /&gt;It is also hard to use on the upper lip.</li>
    <li> I hate to say that I fell for this gimmick! It does not have any magic coils as the infomercial suggests, it merely burns the hair off of your skin (yes, this does smell as bad as it sounds!). It caused burns when I used it around curved areas of my body such as my knees and upper lip because the straight coils make contact with the skin. I had blisters on both areas for several days after using this product! It also did not slow hair growth. Even worse, my hair grew back darker than before. I have fair skin and my hair grew back dark brown/black...very embarrassing! I returned the product after one use.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using the product but right out of the box, after a full charge per instructions, it didn&#x27;t even turn on.  I reread the instructions and repeated the process all to no avail.  It actually never turned on.  I received a full refund and I appreciate Amazon&#x27;s great customer service.</li>
    <li> It did fine for upper lip hair, but crapped out on the chin hairs. Had it only 3 weeks and one of the elements went out in it. don&#x27;t waste your money on it. just keep doing your hair removal the way you did before if it works.</li>
    <li> This product was not for me. The person it was for won&#x27;t know if it works for another 3-6 months. It arrived on time, and seems to do something. Can&#x27;t say more than that for sure at this time.</li>
    <li> The Item was delivered in a speedily and it was in excellent condition and working great, I was hesitant to give a 5 star rating because I am still testing it out, but other that that... great buy!</li>
    <li> Did not work and is a basically is like taking a lighter and burning your hair off. Does not even remove facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, sending back to Amazon today</li>
    <li> The product does not work as advertized. Turns skin red, but does not remove any hair as advertizements or enclosed brochure claim.</li>
    <li> they say how good this product is and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.It is not worth the amount of money it is worth .</li>
    <li> Advertising can make anything look great. I decided to get No! No! because I have very sensitive skin and most hair removal methods will really irritate my skin and cause me to break out. I have only had it for two weeks, but it is turning out to be more trouble than it is worth. The small wire does not work for me at all, so I use the large one even on my face. I have had some good results with the fuzz along my jaw bone and side burns, but my legs are a different story. What the advertisement doesn&#x27;t show is just how many times you have to go over the same area. After using No!No! on my legs, I end up having to shave them anyway if I am not wearing long pants the next day. I will continue with the trial period, but it is not looking like a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money. Not only did it not remove hair as shown, but both of the larger heads burned out in the first week. I wish I had purchased from the product site because I would have been able to return it. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. I&#x27;ll be surprised if you don&#x27;t hear of a class action suit in the future. Not anything as advertised.</li>
    <li> It did not work, couldn&#x27;t return it and got messed up without using it. Called back to have it fixed and couldn&#x27;t. Worst costumer service ever. And for the record, it is overpriced.</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, I wish I could get my money back!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item with hopes it would truly remove hair just like all the infomercials said.  What a disappointment. Essentially this gadget shaves and burns your hair, then you buff it off so when you finish, the hair is gone.  But it&#x27;s back the next day.  I gave it a good try; used it for a few months and still the same result.  Please do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me the NO NO for Christmas and we both tried it,we followed the directions to a tee, however the product failed to deliver. We returned the product and to our surprise their money back guarentee claim is false, they made us pay to return it as well as pay for the original shipping to my home which was suppose to be free.I am very disappointed not only with their product but also the manner in which the company deceived my husband and myself with their money back guarentee.</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work, I used for about 5 weeks and didnt notice a difference on the hair growth, still had to shave everyday. Also, when you try to return, I purchased through TV with the 60 day warranty, they will try to give you an extra 60 days and post pone your payment and I was dumb enough to accept that and when it was time to send it back I was in the middle of moving and missed the deadline and got stuck with this $300 device that doesnt work! Do not waste your money on this garbage!</li>
    <li> I could not let this go any longer. I had to review this product. This is undoubtedly the worst product I have ever wasted money on. Not just some money but this thing is fairly expensive. It simply does not work...at all! I received one, used it, thought that it might be defective. So I bought another one. It didn&#x27;t work either - that one I returned. It was too late to return the first one. I kept using it thinking it might work. I thought that perhaps the negative reviews were from people who may not be using it correctly - perhaps I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly. Note the negative reviews vs the positive ones and don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. Just a hunk of junk wrapped in a totally bogus informercial. What a waste.</li>
    <li> This product is a fault adverstisment.  I was very disappointed with the product and the company.  I tried using the product for a week on my armpit and legs.  It was completely useless.  I decided to return the product to NO!NO!. The customer service rep advised that I MUST keep the product for 60 days.  Early return will not cover the original and return shipping fee.  What if I keep the product for 61 days and they won&#x27;t let me return so I decided to pay $20 - $30 total S&amp;H fee to return it before the 60 days trial period.  My advice: DO NOT try this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star. I couldn&#x27;t get my money back in tears by the disappointment. I should known. This is a useless toy!! It does nothing at all! I thought &amp;#34;maybe it&#x27;ll work if I keep using it.&amp;#34; Nothing!  Waste of time. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim and it&#x27;s just ok...doesn&#x27;t work exactly how they say and takes a long time to complete.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get rid of hair as noted.  Just gets hair down to razor stuble and no further.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that I had to let my hair for about 6 weeks.  I was using it on my face, did not shave hair at all</li>
    <li> My girlfriend seems to enjoy the way the system works and saves the shower legs shaves and no bloody slips!</li>
    <li> This is the biggest waste of your money can&#x27;t even shave the fuzz off of a peach</li>
    <li> I have tried for years to find something to get rid of my beard.  I am a woman and have always had a lot of fuzz on my entire face.  But as I got older the hair started getting thicker and turning black, what an embarrassment!  I could compete with my husband!  I was actually having to shave my neck and lower face about 3 times a week.  So I bought this product directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week I used it almost everyday and to my amazement by the 2nd week I was already seeing results!  The hair does grow back thinner and slower!  I am now in my 6th week, only having to shave up under my chin once a week, there are areas that still seem to be as thick but not growing back too fast, areas that are thinner and areas where it is not growing back at all.  The long fuzz (we&#x27;re talking over an inch!) on the rest of my face is just about completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an overnight and it&#x27;s gone product, you have to invest the time and keep at it.  I am very pleased with the results and will keep using No! No!.  After my face is completely under control I will start working on my legs!</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars only because it is so time consuming and it take such a commitment. I wish it were a little bit easier to use! I bought the most powerful version, the silver one which I believe is marketed typically for men or for course hair because I have VERY CORSE facial hair :(. It started growing when I was about 12 and never stopped. I have tried every thing. At age 40 now I&#x27;ve had to resort to shaving and tweezing just about every day. As a result I get scaring and the five o&#x27;clock shadow. I have dark hair and I have moderately dark skin (I&#x27;m Caribbean, African American). Using this product is similar to shaving. YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTION and it will work. Using the buffer is also a critical step. The buffer has improved the appearance of my skin and my scarring has already started to diminish ;D. The fact that this device makes a sound and has a light to let you know that you are using it right is a huge help! It took me about 4 days to get the hang of it so DON&#x27;T GIVE UP. The facial are is the hardest area to do. I started on my arm just to get the feel of it. Then I moved to my neck. You need to pull your skin tight/taught. Again, please follow the instructions in the box and go to the website and watch the videos. After about 4 weeks of use I am starting to see a difference. The hair is coming back more slowly and more sparsely. I&#x27;m happy with these result because I don&#x27;t have to shave every day, my skin looks better and I can&#x27;t afford laser treatment. Plus I&#x27;ve heard laser treatment isn&#x27;t appropriate for my skin color. Having dark facial hair has left me so sad and embarrassed for sooo long. This produce has given me hope! People are complementing my skin. It looks so much better I am using the right color foundation because my skin looks brighter. I am very happy with my investment. Oh yes, I also wanted to say, I need to use the highest setting, so the experience feels like heat on the skin. Again follow the directions about this. Don&#x27;t start onthe highest setting. Work your way up to it. Another reason I give 4 stars and not five is because of the fact that using this produce burn the hair and the smell is awful!!! I prefer to use my tried and true Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion which is my pre make up moisturize. So it covers the smell pretty well. But if you are not careful, you can smell the smell all day. I kiss people a lot in my culture and I often wonder if people smell it. :P Conclusion: Give this product a chance. You deserve to be happy. I am!</li>
    <li> So, I was so excited to get this product and its nothing like it is advertised.  It&#x27;s hard to work around your upper lip (mustache area.)  The hair doesn&#x27;t come right off like the commercials say they do.  You have to go over and over one area just to get the area removed, and at times it doesn&#x27;t even get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave daily your hair is of course a little tougher, and this no no doesn&#x27;t even work on tough hair.  I let is grow out really long and it still didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this no no is for young girls or women who have very fine hair or haven&#x27;t shaved/waxed in the past.</li>
    <li> This product is not at all what I thought it would be, I am sorry I spent the HIGH price to purchase it. After using it faithfully for about six weeks I saw no slow down of hair re-growth.  It takes FOREVER to actually remove any hair with this device.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a long time to re-charge and it is very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it zero stars if it allowed me. This is a complete waste of money. My wife bought me on and it did not work, especially in tighter areas, as you have to go a certain speed for the heat to engage. well, by the time the heat engages, you are already past the place you were trying to get. Also, you have to go pretty fast or it cuts out or clicks on and off rapidly. So you can&#x27;t go slow enough to actually burn the hair, and that&#x27;s another story, because this thing bypasses most of the hair. after going over places 10-15 times, less than half the hair was actually reduced. Most of it was untouched. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product having tried many things over the years, but...&lt;br /&gt;It does not matter how I hold the product or how many times I set the power switch, it reverts to full power as soon as I start to use it and because of that it continues to cause burns to my upper lip and chin.  Works great on my legs, but I am really disappointed that I can not use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this device about a year ago and used it as directed for about 3 months. It is difficult and time consuming to use but, I persisted hoping to get results. It worked to remove the hair on my arms but did not work at all on my legs where I have coarser hair. As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue. The same amount of hair remains on my arms. The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns. The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks and I had to send it back for replacement. They made me pay for shipping their defective product back to them. The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to a year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> IT IS A TOY THAT TRY TO CUT HAIR. USE, SLOW AND MORE SLOW IT DOSE CUT HIRE TOO MANY PASSES TO DO THE JOB</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me. I saw  the product advertised on a home shopping network with endorsement from an African American female doctor. My hair is too course for this product and after three tries I did not get the expected results. Also I could not stand the smell of burning hair. I used this product on my face and thought I burned my upper lip, it stung so bad. I just couldn&#x27;t get that burnt smell out of my nostrils even into the next day!</li>
    <li> I received this item in decent time. It is in exact condition that was described.I love this product and would recommend to anyone that is tired of the expensive razor blades.</li>
