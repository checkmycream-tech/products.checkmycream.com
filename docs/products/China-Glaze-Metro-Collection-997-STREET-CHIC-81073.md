      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>LOVE, love, love China Glaze, but the shade is quite a bit darker than what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
      <li>I love the browns</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a grey-brown color while I&#x27;m looking for something</li>
      <li>I wish china glaze was more to the colors posted.</li>
      <li>color was off as well, much more &amp;#34;muddier&amp;#34; color then it looked to be.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s the issue with buying nail polish online :]</li>
      <li>Got it today, nice smooth glow.</li>
      <li>When i received this polish-I love it.....</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>I was excited to try this on!</li>
      <li>It was a good price and shipped fast. :))</li>
      <li>so I can touch up and the salons love the brush for fine detailing and coverage.</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to this nail polish because of the light brown color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an experienced nail polish purchaser and paint my nails constantly -</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and evenly without having to go over it to make it even.</li>
      <li>I was so excited until I opened the packaged and it look like a ashy grey/brown.</li>
      <li>Not totally disappointed in the shade, but I thought it&#x27;d be a lighter shade of cocoa brown.</li>
      <li>I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
      <li>Its still an awesome deep chocolate brown polish that last.</li>
      <li>thank you so  very much for everything!</li>
      <li>This product covers very well without dripping, and the color is nicely opaque with a high gloss.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color!</li>
      <li>it looks hot for this summer!</li>
      <li>I was originally wanting the lighter cafe colored brown, but it does look more like the 2nd photo.</li>
      <li>I love the dark sexy chocolate color and got a lot of compliments</li>
      <li>China glaze is usually a lose or win</li>
      <li>The delivery was super fast.</li>
      <li>It arrived fast and wasnt old and clumpy:)</li>
      <li>This color is darker than it looks in the first picture or in the bottle.</li>
      <li>This is the first brown nail polish I have ever bought</li>
      <li>However, it actually looks more like melted milk chocolate when I am applying it, and I do like the end result.  </li>
      <li>What a pretty color.</li>
      <li>I like China Glaze polis as it goes on so nice and smooth and last a long time without chipping.  </li>
      <li>Darker and not true to color, still a nice darker shade goes with everything.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more like grey!!</li>
      <li>It matches the online color very well.</li>
      <li>Much darker and no &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34; to the chocolate.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, too.</li>
      <li>I really wanted the color in the picture.</li>
      <li>It is much prettier than in the pictures.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much darker than pictured.  </li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>So this one I received was much darker than the picture portrays.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really know what to do to make it lighter</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more caramel color, this is a dark brown.  </li>
      <li>The polish was totally different from what was on the picture,, Totally dissatisfied will not be ordering any more now polish from online website.</li>
      <li>This China Glaze nail polish is really high quality.</li>
      <li>I love  dark chocolate!</li>
      <li>The other reviews are accurate in saying that this product is darker in person than in the picture.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, be aware that the color of the picture does not match the actual color of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I am 59 years old, and I thought it was a bit \\&quot;Goth looking\\&quot; on me.</li>
      <li>I apply a second coat to make sure all of the nail is covered (no light spots).  </li>
      <li>Absolutely not like the picture, but really can you even buy a can of paint by the chip?</li>
      <li>It last a couple days without chipping I really like China products they last a long time</li>
      <li>I have purchased other nail polish by Chyna Glaze and the pictures are very decieving.</li>
      <li>Cheaper than Opi which I used for years and with my &amp;#34;Rush&amp;#34; speed dry bought at Sallys, manicures last two weeks on my natural nails.</li>

<li> Does not easily chip and lasts pretty long.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about it for a week, then do minor touch-ups for the next week.  </li>
<li> Only need about two coats of it and it lasts for a long time without chipping!</li>
<li> havent&#x27; used the China glaze collection before, so maybe its supposed to be this formula, but it is very watery and hard to apply as it really drips and runs, even after putting very little on the brush.</li>
<li> but this one was really not the same, but I like the brown I got so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking forward to this nail polish because of the light brown color. But it doesn&#x27;t look like the color in the picture. Its darker and it has purple in it. I have purchased other nail polish by Chyna Glaze and the pictures are very decieving.</li>
    <li> The picture  on the website show exactly how the color in your nails... beautiful and clean... please order this color! it looks hot for this summer!</li>
    <li> The polish was totally different from what was on the picture,, Totally dissatisfied will not be ordering any more now polish from online website. Already have a color that&#x27;s very similar to this .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color! It&#x27;s a very nice fall color, and it&#x27;s not too girly. This China Glaze nail polish is really high quality.</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer who said the color is darker than it appears on the screen.  However, it actually looks more like melted milk chocolate when I am applying it, and I do like the end result.  It goes on creamy.  I apply a second coat to make sure all of the nail is covered (no light spots).  I don&#x27;t have to worry about it for a week, then do minor touch-ups for the next week.  It is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much darker than pictured.  I was looking for a more caramel color, this is a dark brown.  It&#x27;s a nice color just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> LOVE, love, love China Glaze, but the shade is quite a bit darker than what&#x27;s pictured. Not totally disappointed in the shade, but I thought it&#x27;d be a lighter shade of cocoa brown. Still happy with it, though. Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> I like China Glaze polis as it goes on so nice and smooth and last a long time without chipping.  Every color I&#x27;ve ordered has been great and vibrant, will be ordering even more colors.</li>
    <li> What a pretty color. Earthy and warm; beautiful. A compliment to every skin tone. Very happy with this purchase. Cheers!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great fall color!  Love the chocolate kiss color!! China Glaze is also a great line of nail polish because its durable.</li>
    <li> I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast. It last a couple days without chipping I really like China products they last a long time and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and they’re still going.</li>
    <li> Beautiful polish! Only need about two coats of it and it lasts for a long time without chipping! China glaze is usually a lose or win but this is a win!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the color in the photo. Its 3 shades darker. Its still an awesome deep chocolate brown polish that last. Great color for work or out.</li>
    <li> I love the browns but this one was really not the same, but I like the brown I got so no complaints. I wish china glaze was more to the colors posted. Guess I will return to OPI sorry</li>
    <li> This product covers very well without dripping, and the color is nicely opaque with a high gloss. It matches the online color very well.</li>
    <li> When i received this polish-I love it..... Just wish I could find it ugh. It arrived fast and wasnt old and clumpy:)</li>
    <li> This polish is great, looks fantastic and the color goes with so much! thank you so  very much for everything!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and evenly without having to go over it to make it even. No second coat needed. Love it.</li>
    <li> Totally different from the picture. Don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for a brown nail polish. It&#x27;s not that brown at all!!! it&#x27;s more like grey!! I don&#x27;t konw if the seller sent me the wrong color or what. It&#x27;s just too complicated to change so I didn&#x27;t. I want a Brown nail polish!!!! [crying]</li>
    <li> The other reviews are accurate in saying that this product is darker in person than in the picture. It&#x27;s a good color and I bought it knowing it was darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, be aware that the color of the picture does not match the actual color of the bottle. I guess it&#x27;s the issue with buying nail polish online :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah well, i like the color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color! It is much prettier than in the pictures. It was a good price and shipped fast. :))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented on this color quite a bit. It does well for designs on nails like wood/brown. Goes on smoothly and usually done in 1-2 coats, typical China Glaze</li>
    <li> So this one I received was much darker than the picture portrays. I wouldn&#x27;t really know what to do to make it lighter but it sucks. I really wanted the color in the picture.</li>
    <li> ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT DEAR  I WILL DEAL WITH U GUYS LATER&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS THANKS A LOT AGAIN  .</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this on! This is the first brown nail polish I have ever bought and I&#x27;m very happy with the results!! Perfect fall color!!</li>
    <li> love it! nice creamy brown, i have probably 12-14 different browns and this one is my favourite of them all.</li>
    <li> I was so excited until I opened the packaged and it look like a ashy grey/brown. I only used it once just because I had it. The item did arrive on time so that&#x27;s the reason for the two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> I can never find polish that dries good and smooth on my nails, well I have now, this stuff is awesome.  I love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely not like the picture, but really can you even buy a can of paint by the chip? Much darker and no &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34; to the chocolate. But me? I love  dark chocolate! As some said, there is some gray to it so it makes it a neutral which goes with anything. I take my own polish to manicures so I can touch up and the salons love the brush for fine detailing and coverage. Cheaper than Opi which I used for years and with my &amp;#34;Rush&amp;#34; speed dry bought at Sallys, manicures last two weeks on my natural nails.</li>
    <li> The product was good and got to me in a timley manner. There were no issues with how it was shipped</li>
    <li> I was originally wanting the lighter cafe colored brown, but it does look more like the 2nd photo. I&#x27;d call it a dark chocolate but I don&#x27;t mind at all. I love the dark sexy chocolate color and got a lot of compliments and I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> This nail polish has already gotten me countless compliments. The shipping was fast and easy. I RECOMMEND for the trendy nail polish seekers! The color is like milk chocolate and goes great with my olive skin tone. Does not easily chip and lasts pretty long. I&#x27;m an experienced nail polish purchaser and paint my nails constantly - so - I know what makes a good nail polish good...and this is it!</li>
    <li> When I put it on... it appeared darker on me than in the bottle and online picture. I am 59 years old, and I thought it was a bit \\&quot;Goth looking\\&quot; on me. However, my daughter loved it, so I gave it to her. This is great nail polish at a great price. The delivery was super fast. I plan on ordering another shade of color soon.</li>
    <li> My wife has been studying different ways of doing her nails on youtube.  She has come up with ways of mixing the colors for strips, swierls, add beads etc.  She buys a lot of China Glaze, so she must like this brand.  Me?  Her nails are beautiful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda thin and looks dull on my nails. It&#x27;s more like a grey-brown color while I&#x27;m looking for something can remind me of warm chocolate in the picture. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Got it today, nice smooth glow. Darker and not true to color, still a nice darker shade goes with everything. I have all colors and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Would love this company to get a line of gloss to match.  Perhaps this company should work on a brick color as pictured. Awesome nevertheless.</li>
    <li> havent&#x27; used the China glaze collection before, so maybe its supposed to be this formula, but it is very watery and hard to apply as it really drips and runs, even after putting very little on the brush. color was off as well, much more &amp;#34;muddier&amp;#34; color then it looked to be.</li>
    <li> This color is darker than it looks in the first picture or in the bottle. The 2nd picture is closer to the color.  If you like the darker color then I would buy this. I happen to like the color. Looks very nice on.</li>
