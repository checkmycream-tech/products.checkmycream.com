<li> No more underarm funk!</li>
<li> It smells bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Champion is my favorite scent and I can never find it in stores.</li>
    <li> The scent is good, but the clear types of Old spice make me itch from the alcohol or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the white solids aren&#x27;t perfect, they&#x27;re better.</li>
    <li> Great smell and does it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> Amazing product and great smell. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to smell manly while keeping the ladies wanting more!</li>
    <li> It smells bad.  It is so strong that the odor does not wash out of shirts when you launder them.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Long lasting protection. It isn&#x27;t the girlfriend&#x27;s favorite, but still smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female firefighter and those ladies deodorant sticks just don&#x27;t cut it for me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love leaving a scene smelling like house fire or car accident and drenched in sweat, to me it&#x27;s the sign of a job well done. But the people around me don&#x27;t appreciate the other odors that come with it, namely underarm funk. Those puny lady deodorants just don&#x27;t cut it, I don&#x27;t care how big the lettering on the container is that says &amp;#34;all day freshness&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new deodorant because those dainty women&#x27;s scents didn&#x27;t cut it so I decided to give a men&#x27;s scent a try and see if that cut the stink. My husband suggested Old Spice since it works so well for him (he&#x27;s also a firefighter) so I started using it. It works GREAT! No more underarm funk! It gives me all day freshness that doesn&#x27;t give up before I do!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was quite pleased to get it. Nice fragrance that lasts through the day.</li>
    <li> My husband and two sons all used this scent and all three complained about how strong it was--in the bad way!  To me, it amplified body odor and the scent is so hard to get out of their shirts. Won&#x27;t be buying this scent again. I&#x27;ll stick to Fiji, Swagger and Wolfthorn!</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant!  Ignore other negative comments, as effectiveness of deodorants is very individual.  For me it works very well, but  other people may need something much stronger, probably antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you think you&#x27;re getting when you order it.</li>
    <li> It smells nice. It lasts fairly long. I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for quite a while now and I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Personal preference really, but this deodorant smells great.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t like the scent.  Smells like some new kind of cleaning product:).</li>
    <li> I really like the strong musck smell, it covers my natural odor, which I guess is good. BUT, I was in the shower this morning and my wife immediately made me dispose of the body soap sampler that came with the deodorant. I was kind of bummed, since the deodorant has the same scent, and she has commented on it before. I will have to keep trying other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; until we both agree on one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this deodorant. I have been using Old Spice since I was about 13 (24 now) due to other brands not even coming close to working for me. Not to mention that every single girl that I&#x27;ve been with says they absolutely love the smell of it. Haven&#x27;t had to use cologne my entire time dating. Even now, my wife loves the smell and I get the benefit of smelling good and keeping dry. Also, the bonus of the absolutely awesome ad&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, smells great almost as if I&#x27;ve sprayed on cologne. Wish they had these at the store. I think they&#x27;re about to be discontinued.</li>
    <li> A better price point than local stores. A very good product.</li>
    <li> Good product, I like it as expected. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s just something about Old Spice that makes getting ready in the morning great! I picked Champion honestly out of need since my original Subscribe &amp; Save order ran out, but it didn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s not too over bearing nor does it make me smell like a gym rat either! [Old Spice Whistle]</li>
    <li> The product is great and the protection is lengthy and smells nice. I would recommend this to any one to buy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. I do not.  Obviously it does what it says - to cover up the B.O. But after he uses this product and then I wash his tee shirts in the laundry, the smell lingers, and after a repeated washing and even a soaking (!), the smell continues!!!  The deodorant smell transfers to the rest of the laundry, too.  ARG!</li>
