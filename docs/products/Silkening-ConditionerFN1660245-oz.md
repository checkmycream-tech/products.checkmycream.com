      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aquage off and on for years and found this the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Aquage has the best products.</li>

      <li>it, love it!</li>
      <li>Thrilled with the results of this product.</li>
      <li>BUT WORKS NICE</li>
      <li>In all honestly it was so \\&quot;light\\</li>
      <li>makes my colored and highlighted hair very smooth</li>
      <li>I absolutely love aquage products</li>
      <li>Aquage makes my course wavy hair managible and alows me to be able to curl my hair.</li>
      <li>so I know I&#x27;m going to love t before I even use it.</li>
      <li>I just used this for the first time, along with the shampoo, and although I cannot attest to its ability to preserve color, it conditions quite effectively.</li>
      <li>Just what I wanted and it was quick!</li>
      <li>I will point out that the consistency is a bit unique.</li>
      <li>Softens, detnagles and smells great on my dry, curly hair.</li>
      <li>I can get more silkening and smoothness for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Hair feels and looks 10 times better and is very shiny.</li>
      <li>Very good product, only need to use a little bit of shampoo and it leaves the hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>It certainly did.</li>
      <li>No sulfates and very pricey, but found it at a reasonable price here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have coarse, thick, naturally curly hair, and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried for getting it under control.</li>
      <li>so I was anxious to try this and am pleased with all products I&#x27;ve used from Aquage.</li>
      <li>By far.  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair but not real thick</li>
      <li>My bleached out, frizzy, super dry hair came back to life with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>When first applying in the shower I wondered if it was a leave-in conditioner or treatment for dry hair because it was so different than what I was used to.</li>
      <li>but it rinsed clear and left no greasy residue.</li>
      <li>I have very thin hair, and this is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like most products do.</li>
      <li>Though a little pricey, a small amount goes a long way and it conditions really well, so it makes it worth the money.</li>

<li> It may have been the shampoo, the conditioner, or the combination of the two, but my dry, frizzy, color treated red hair has not been so silky and shiny since I was in my teens.</li>
<li> Although I thought it was pricey, it lasted a long time</li>
<li> I have enough wave in my hair to make curls possible but hard to do.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m hooked and if it ends up not able to preserve my red as I would like (being unsure of this is the only reson I gave it less than 5 stars)</li>
<li> I use other products from this line</li>
<li> Not worth the price.  </li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
<li> I ordered the product less then 4-5 days ago</li>
<li> Makes my thick hair lay down well.</li>

    <li> I just used this for the first time, along with the shampoo, and although I cannot attest to its ability to preserve color, it conditions quite effectively. It may have been the shampoo, the conditioner, or the combination of the two, but my dry, frizzy, color treated red hair has not been so silky and shiny since I was in my teens. Even after one washing I was amazed and my red color appears to have not been stripped, as some shampoos and conditioners do. I will point out that the consistency is a bit unique. When first applying in the shower I wondered if it was a leave-in conditioner or treatment for dry hair because it was so different than what I was used to. I ended up reading the directions for use several times while applying and rinsing but it rinsed clear and left no greasy residue. In all honestly it was so \\&quot;light\\&quot; I wondered if it was going to do anything, but it did. It certainly did. I&#x27;m hooked and if it ends up not able to preserve my red as I would like (being unsure of this is the only reson I gave it less than 5 stars) I will seek another color preserving product and alternate it with this, which is a product I would recommend, along with the shampoo, for anyone with dry, frizzy hair whatever the color, even if not color treated.</li>
    <li> A+++ Great Seller...Love it! Prompt delivery..</li>
    <li> My bleached out, frizzy, super dry hair came back to life with this shampoo and conditioner. I have very thin hair, and this is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like most products do. My hair is sleek and shiny after every use.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aquage products for years. My hairdresser introduced me to them. I have coarse, thick, naturally curly hair, and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried for getting it under control.</li>
    <li> Favourite conditioner to date. Thrilled with the results of this product. I would definitely recommend this line of Aquage hair products</li>
    <li> IT IS PRICY BUT WORKS NICE</li>
    <li> I absolutely love aquage products so I know I&#x27;m going to love t before I even use it. I ordered the product less then 4-5 days ago and I&#x27;ve already received my product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquage off and on for years and found this the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  By far.  Hair feels and looks 10 times better and is very shiny.</li>
    <li> Very good product, only need to use a little bit of shampoo and it leaves the hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, love it!</li>
    <li> this product worked well with the Aquage Silkening Shampoo. Although I thought it was pricey, it lasted a long time and I could tell a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have enough wave in my hair to make curls possible but hard to do. Aquage makes my course wavy hair managible and alows me to be able to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> makes my colored and highlighted hair very smooth</li>
    <li> Cheaper than purchasing from the salon. Makes my thick hair lay down well.</li>
    <li> No sulfates and very pricey, but found it at a reasonable price here on Amazon. Aquage has the best products. I have curly hair but not real thick and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
    <li> no problems with this product</li>
