      <li>It&#x27;s great, but just a tad too small.  </li>

      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s bigger in person, it&#x27;s more for a travel bag than make-up</li>
      <li>It is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly what i needed.</li>
      <li>The photos aren&#x27;t as pretty as this really is.</li>

      <li>its soft with a printed design on the material (cheetah)</li>
      <li>/&gt;i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice small bag for make up or other products.</li>
      <li>Only downside is the coloring in person is a little cheap looking - orangeish.</li>
      <li>While I plan to continue to use it until I need a new one, I gave it only three points, as I will never buy a bag like this again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big enough for a little extra space, and it fits little small stuff good.</li>

    <li> This is a very nice, attractive and cost effective cosmetic bag.  I&#x27;m not one to spend $50 on a mere cosmetic bag.  Until I had thrown away my older one and used this for a few days, however, I didn&#x27;t realize that it didn&#x27;t stand up on its own.  It often flops over on its side and my mascara, lipstick, pencils etc go rolling across the counter, or worse -  fall on the floor.  I do miss this feature in a bag.  While I plan to continue to use it until I need a new one, I gave it only three points, as I will never buy a bag like this again.</li>
    <li> The item was slightly larger than was anticipated. Nevertheless, my daughter liked it  and took it back with her to college..</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, carry all my makeup in this bag, place it in my back pack, now there&#x27;s no need for a purse, when I have a class. very convenient.</li>
    <li> Love the bag. Can fit all my makeup that i need</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my handbag, cute leopard design too--very affordable.  You can store a lot of items in this cosmetic pouch.</li>
    <li> The photos aren&#x27;t as pretty as this really is. Great for a little visual tickle at the bottom of the tote bag.</li>
    <li> Great item. It is exactly what i was looking for. The item was exactly what i needed. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, she loves animal print, and she uses it for her makeup when she is out or to store in her purse. Still intact and doesnt seem like it will fail anytime soon. had it for about 11 months now.</li>
    <li> Made a nice gift for my boss&#x27;s birthday. She loved it and it&#x27;s right up her alley.</li>
    <li> i keep this in my purse absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> its a fine makeup bag. bought as a gift by request. its narrow not wide but tall. its soft with a printed design on the material (cheetah) i think I paid $8 which is fine...its a decent size I just don&#x27;t think its the best price. I think ulta or target even could sell a nice makeup bag with some make up included for a better deal. But if you don&#x27;t like  to shop around I do recommend it. It seems sturdy, easy to clean, lightweight, big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impartial because its not my favorite but I also didn&#x27;t pick it out nor will I be using it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and service and love it, again thanks...</li>

    <li> I rated it 4 stars, because I love animal print.  But it&#x27;s bigger in person, it&#x27;s more for a travel bag than make-up</li>
