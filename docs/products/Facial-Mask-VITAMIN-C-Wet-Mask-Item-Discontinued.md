      <li>I have tried many.  </li>
      <li>I think my skin will improve more after using the masque for a longer period of time.  </li>
      <li>It is working for me, better than most</li>
      <li>My skin looks healthier, more refreshed.</li>

      <li>If your skin is mucked up from a bunch of free radicals, yea...</li>
      <li>After 10 minutes, most of the mask will be absorbed into your skin.</li>
      <li>It made my face feel smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>Use a warm cloth or gentle sponge to remove.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
      <li>I love this whole line of products as I have the serum as well!</li>
      <li>Sooo lightweight and clean of any smell.</li>
      <li>The scent is so light and refreshing, and I love how just 5-10 minutes twice a week deeply cleans any clogged pores and makes my face just glow!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this facial mask in conjunction with the camucomplex moisturizing cream and absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>This mask is different than most I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>Relax and let it sit for ten minutes, then wipe off with warm water and a damp cloth.  </li>
      <li>My face felt so soft and smooth after using for one day!</li>
      <li>Made my face feel fresh.</li>
      <li>I left in on for longer than the directions called for and it became invisible... until I used a warm washcloth to take it off.</li>
      <li>This is perfect for premature skin aging due to smoking, sun damage, and for those that live in high pollution areas.</li>
      <li>The zeolite is listed right after the kaolin.</li>
      <li>Because the product is white, I&#x27;m assuming that it may be the white kaolin, which is really best for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are designed to help promote cell renewal and detoxification, which in turn leaves you with healthy, vibrant, new skin cells</li>
      <li>my face feels smoother, its fuller, i have more even tone and its younger looking</li>
      <li>Will be back for more.</li>
      <li>love this camu superberry facial mask!</li>
      <li>After the first use, skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s not a clay mask, it does have Kaolin clay &amp; Zeolite listed in the first 10 ingredients.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week and just love what it does for my overall skin tone.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a light facial mask that does EXACTLY what it claims to, THIS is the one you need to purchase!</li>
      <li>This mask goes on really easy then after taking it off it left my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>First, I think it&#x27;s important to mention what this facial mask IS NOT.</li>
      <li>She was looking for a good quality mask for a long time and this mask is definitely the one she going to use again.</li>
      <li>So this mask is really meant to help restore skin that&#x27;s messed up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it as a mask.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t feel any difference after rinsing off my face.</li>
      <li>The texture is creamy and I love how soft it left my face feeling!</li>
      <li>love that this facial mask uses natural antioxidants.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, some scents in other products triggered migraines.</li>
      <li>Am 63 with decent skin.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a few days now, and have noticed a huge change!</li>
      <li>i like how i am getting all the benefits of its VITAMIN C from CAMU CAMU, COCONUT OIL, Micronized ZEOLITE from Serbia,INFUSED WITH EXOTIC EXTRACTS GOJI, ACAI, NONI, POMEGRANATE, GREEN TEA, ALOE and MANGOSTEEN,</li>
      <li>My boyfriend was sniffing my face all night asking if I bought a new perfume</li>
      <li>and I found it made my skin very soft and supple.  </li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>I love the little container it came in, once you open it</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a natural scent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s sensitive.</li>
      <li>do not waste your money on this product..</li>
      <li>iT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND MOISTURIZED.  </li>
      <li>I could use this gentle solution rather than a rough exfoliator or a peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this wet mask, have bought two bottles, it is really smoothie</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is working for me, better than most I have tried.  I am using all 3 cream, vitamin c and mask.  I have tried many.  I may stick with this one.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MASK.  iT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND MOISTURIZED.  I AGREE WITH ALL THE REVIEWS</li>
    <li> I have used this product a couple of weeks now and I found it made my skin very soft and supple.  I don&#x27;t really use it as a mask.  I have VERY dry skin so I apply it after my bath at night and sleep with it on.  In the morning I am good to go.  Can only speak to how it makes my skin feel as I just started using it.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Am 63 with decent skin. For days after use this mask makes my skin softer and smoother and brighter. A little goes a long way. It will last awhile.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product...rejuvenates skin well.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating without being greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks amazing after mask.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. I really didn&#x27;t feel any difference after rinsing off my face.</li>
    <li> not sure if this is over hyped or whatever, but i didn&#x27;t get this oh wow, ur complexion looks great kind of complement.  But i think if  you put a face lotion on that top of this makes a better result</li>
    <li> lovw this stufff my face feels smoother, its fuller, i have more even tone and its younger looking it doesnt feel nasty or leave a film behind either and I have yet to break out from using it</li>
    <li> This mask is easily absorbed and it makes the skin feel wonderful .most impressed with it .  Jensoraya</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that just has so many things your skin needs to stay super soft.  I use it once a week and just love what it does for my overall skin tone.</li>
    <li> First, I think it&#x27;s important to mention what this facial mask IS NOT. This is not a clay or mud mask. This is not an extreme pore reducing mask or one that sucks out nasty blackheads. So, this will not help with acne, zits, or anything of that variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clarifying mask that helps RESTORE softness and luster in the skin. This is perfect for premature skin aging due to smoking, sun damage, and for those that live in high pollution areas. Even though it&#x27;s not a clay mask, it does have Kaolin clay &amp; Zeolite listed in the first 10 ingredients. Because the product is white, I&#x27;m assuming that it may be the white kaolin, which is really best for sensitive skin. If your skin is mucked up from a bunch of free radicals, yea...it&#x27;s sensitive. The zeolite is listed right after the kaolin. This is a mineral used to remove toxins but not those of the blackhead variety. It&#x27;s all the yucky stuff we can&#x27;t see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything after that is a ton anti-oxidants... Camu Camu, Goji, Noni, Acai, Pomegranate, etc. So this mask is really meant to help restore skin that&#x27;s messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On application, the mask goes on really smooth and creamy. If you use masks a lot, you&#x27;ll want to try and put it on heavy. DON&#x27;T. Just apply a thin layer. After 10 minutes, most of the mask will be absorbed into your skin. Yeah...this literally disappears. Use a warm cloth or gentle sponge to remove. After the first use, skin is so soft and smooth. There is a small dark spot on chin that feels  like sand paper. This mask worked extremely well on that area. I like that I could use this gentle solution rather than a rough exfoliator or a peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use this 1-2 times a week in the evening after a deep cleansing  until this product runs out. I&#x27;ll be back to update this review if anything weird starts to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a natural scent. No added fragrances.</li>
    <li> I was very anxious to try this mask because of very good reviews, but I was realty disappointed. do not waste your money on this product.. I wasted over fifty dollars for nothing.</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel great</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my sister. She was looking for a good quality mask for a long time and this mask is definitely the one she going to use again. This mask helped her skin to feel refreshed. She noticed amazing change of her skin tone. I am glad I could make her happy.  I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This product works! I have been using it for a few days now, and have noticed a huge change! My skin looks healthier, more refreshed. It appears to have fewer fine lines and my complexion also appears to be a tad brighter! Definitely recommending this product to my friends and family!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Camusuperberry is very nicely packaged and applies and removes very easily. The had a tingle on my skin and that let me know the product was working. I think my skin will improve more after using the masque for a longer period of time.  I received in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>

    <li> I love it. Made my face feel fresh. My daughter keeps taken from me she likes it too.</li>
    <li> As a woman who has a two year old son and one on the way I appreciate the small things in life that allow me to pamper myself, even if it is just for a few minutes.  I absolutely *LOVE* this mask.  I’m not a fan of clay or mud masks so this was absolutely perfect for me.  The mask go on very smooth and soft; almost like a moisturizer – I love this!  Relax and let it sit for ten minutes, then wipe off with warm water and a damp cloth.  This mask has been wonderful to my face and I look forward to my weekly face mask from here on out.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  My thoughts and opinions are mine and mine alone.</li>

    <li> wife loves it already buying the second bottle</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, some scents in other products triggered migraines. It made my face feel smooth and silky.  It is a good value for $29.95.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product through a promotion for my honest review, but all opinions expressed are solely my own. I respect the importance of honest reviewing, and I hope that you to too.</li>
    <li> Sooo lightweight and clean of any smell. I love this product! I typically have an oily T zone, and dry cheeks, but this doesn&#x27;t over oil my skin, and leaves it hydrated. I love this whole line of products as I have the serum as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this facial mask in conjunction with the camucomplex moisturizing cream and absolutely love it! The scent is so light and refreshing, and I love how just 5-10 minutes twice a week deeply cleans any clogged pores and makes my face just glow!

I left in on for longer than the directions called for and it became invisible... until I used a warm washcloth to take it off. The texture is creamy and I love how soft it left my face feeling! It drenches your skin with moisture! Loved it! I can&#x27;t wait to try other facial products from this line.</li>
    <li> love this camu superberry facial mask! my skin looks so much more supple and soft, and more toned now even after just a couple uses! i like how this is a wet mask since my skin is a little prone to drying. i like how i am getting all the benefits of its VITAMIN C from CAMU CAMU, COCONUT OIL, Micronized ZEOLITE from Serbia,INFUSED WITH EXOTIC EXTRACTS GOJI, ACAI, NONI, POMEGRANATE, GREEN TEA, ALOE and MANGOSTEEN, wow! so my skin has drank this up! and i am very happy with the results. so happy i got to review this for free for testing and review purposes.</li>
