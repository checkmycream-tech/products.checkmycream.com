      <li>but this one is good to me.</li>
      <li>This is really good as a brow gel.</li>

      <li>And, of course, the price is good.</li>
      <li>The wand makes it very easy to apply and it makes my eyelashes look great.</li>
      <li>Love the stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It works nice if you do not want color or any type of irritation.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and in good order.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for many many years.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure but</li>
      <li>Since it came in a three - pack I sent one to each of my daughters who love it for brows.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily without soap.</li>
      <li>Quality is normal quality, but i think it runs out fast although price was very good when i bought it.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic and delivered on time</li>
      <li>Most of the people recommending this product both here on Amazon and on other store sites say its a great product for eyebrows.</li>
      <li>/&gt;be sure to brush your brows first.</li>
      <li>The gel is smooth and holds pretty well.</li>
      <li>No messy eyelashes, and easy clean</li>
      <li>This is great to tame eyebrows and those pesky</li>
      <li>Just the right texture.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for quick, simple look. :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 3 years now - I&#x27;ve quit using actual mascara completely because I was always getting flakes in my eyes, and am convinced that can&#x27;t be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but this is exactly what I needed to have my lashes look good without worrying about black mascara.</li>
      <li>Even though I have tried other products that I think work better, I will say that this product is very consistent.</li>
      <li>Dries pretty fast too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for your eyelashes</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my lashes.</li>
      <li>and I was really hoping this would help, but</li>
      <li>I would recommend it and absolutely would purchase it again.</li>
      <li>The photo of the gray wand is oriented in a position as to appear straight.  </li>
      <li>wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love someone to make a mascara that was clear that actually did help lengthen and thicken eyelashes</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause any itch or other reaction that I have found, usied this for many years..</li>
      <li>luckily, I also have dark eyebrows that tend to get a little unruly, so I use the clear mascara on them each morning to keep them in a nice smooth line.</li>
      <li>I curl my lashes first, then use the clear mascara.</li>
      <li>Then I apply a black mascara on top of that.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had THAT much experience with clear gel mascaras</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy it though if you think its going to give you long full eyelashes because it won&#x27;t do anything except make your eyelashes look</li>
      <li>Clear mascara means no raccoon eyes!</li>
      <li>I use this as a brow-grooming gel, NOT as clear mascara.</li>
      <li>I use clear mascara to groom brows so prefer a straight brush as appears in the photo of the blue wand mascara.  </li>
      <li>I have never tried it as clear mascara.  </li>
      <li>I use mascara and blink on a tissue, then I use this as a clear coating.  </li>
      <li>I actually apply this onto clean lashes, let it dry and then curl my lashes.</li>
      <li>, it wasn&#x27;t advertised as a clear brow</li>
      <li>While this is clearly a no-color product, the advertising for it indicates that it gives a shine.  </li>
      <li>After applying my brow color powder with a brush, I remove the excess, and then &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; with the clear mascara.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Luckily, my eyelashes are fairly long and dark to begin with - and this clear mascara seems to give them a little extra length (a very little extra length), but mostly just fans them out in a nice way.</li>
      <li>You can use it instead of regular color mascara (that always smears) to darken eyelashes even though it is clear it makes your eyelashes stand out.</li>
      <li>I think the price is decent and though one shouldn&#x27;t use a beauty product for too long, I feel like this pack of 3 will last quite a while.</li>
      <li>I tried applying this to my eyelashes and it was a waste of time, it&#x27;s not thick enough to really do much, everything just clumped together.</li>
      <li>Pretty firm hold once you apply.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my husband because his eyebrows tend to be a little out of whack sometimes, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to hold anything in place.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure how the results would be if your lashes weren&#x27;t long or dark to begin</li>
<li> so we wouldn&#x27;t always have to deal with the dark mascara.</li>
<li> On dark brown or black lashes, this mascara lengthens and thickens, but doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
<li> Also may be used to protect eyelashes that already have brown or black mascara on them.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little less shiny then the Maybeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> have also tried it on my eyebrows and it seems to work just for a little while after putting it on</li>

<li> I bought this mascara to tame my eyelashes without looking done up.</li>
<li> I use this for my eyebrows to tame and keep them in place.  </li>
<li> Disappointed as it is difficult to find a straight brush.</li>
<li> for brows its just slightly annoying, nothing really hard to get over though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> On dark brown or black lashes, this mascara lengthens and thickens, but doesn&#x27;t smudge.  Clear mascara means no raccoon eyes!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband because his eyebrows tend to be a little out of whack sometimes, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to hold anything in place. He has a stray hair or two that tends to fall out of line with the others and I was really hoping this would help, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried it on my eyebrows and it seems to work just for a little while after putting it on and then it wears off. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara to tame my eyelashes without looking done up. The wand makes it very easy to apply and it makes my eyelashes look great. I wear clear mascara because I unknowingly touch my eyes a lot, and didn&#x27;t want to have to worry about my makeup smudging like with dark mascara.</li>
    <li> I wear this daily since I dont like to wear the thicker colored mascara daily since it stunts the growth of your lashes...I have long, thick lashes and this just gives it the natural polished look...and it is tear proof, sweat proof...great for day use!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had THAT much experience with clear gel mascaras but this one is good to me. I think the price is decent and though one shouldn&#x27;t use a beauty product for too long, I feel like this pack of 3 will last quite a while. The gel is smooth and holds pretty well. I actually apply this onto clean lashes, let it dry and then curl my lashes. Then I apply a black mascara on top of that. I find that lashes are easier to curl with the clear mascara already applied (and it doesn&#x27;t mess up your curler like black mascara would).</li>
    <li> cant beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to keep my brows in place.  It&#x27;s a little less shiny then the Maybeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved applicator brush is good for lashes I&#x27;m sure but for brows its just slightly annoying, nothing really hard to get over though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be sure to brush your brows first.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic and delivered on time</li>
    <li> I use this as eyebrow gel and have for years.  I have never tried it as clear mascara.  Love the stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara since I was a teenager for a daily use. It is one of my favorites products. It gives my lashes this natural look without looking the messy look. It also length your lashes a little bit. I can&#x27;t give it five because it irritates my eyes after two months of opening the tube even that the label says that  i is hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> It works nice if you do not want color or any type of irritation.  And, of course, the price is good.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many many years. I use it for my brows, not lashes. After applying my brow color powder with a brush, I remove the excess, and then &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; with the clear mascara. Both the color and the lashes stay in place all day.</li>
    <li> I use this for my eyebrows to tame and keep them in place.  Very good product even though I dont use as it was intended.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You can use it instead of regular color mascara (that always smears) to darken eyelashes even though it is clear it makes your eyelashes stand out. It washes off easily without soap. Also may be used to protect eyelashes that already have brown or black mascara on them. It seems to keep the mascara from flaking on your cheek and keeps eyelashes separated and looking good! It doesn&#x27;t cause any itch or other reaction that I have found, usied this for many years..</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my lashes. It seems to take forever to dry too. I tried it because I wear contacts and I get tired of always wearing regular mascara because I think it irritates my eyes. This doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes but just doesnt do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected.  Just the right texture.  No messy eyelashes, and easy clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would  recommend to anyone that does not need extra color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 3 years now - I&#x27;ve quit using actual mascara completely because I was always getting flakes in my eyes, and am convinced that can&#x27;t be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, my eyelashes are fairly long and dark to begin with - and this clear mascara seems to give them a little extra length (a very little extra length), but mostly just fans them out in a nice way. I curl my lashes first, then use the clear mascara. I&#x27;m not sure how the results would be if your lashes weren&#x27;t long or dark to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less luckily, I also have dark eyebrows that tend to get a little unruly, so I use the clear mascara on them each morning to keep them in a nice smooth line. (I apply the mascara with the brush provided, then wipe off the excess with my fingers, or it would look damp/clumped.) This seems to work great for the day, without it feeling like I have goop on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried any other type of clear mascara or eyebrow mousse, so I don&#x27;t know how this compares.</li>
    <li> I actually use this over my regular mascara.  I use mascara and blink on a tissue, then I use this as a clear coating.  Way less left over mascara on my lower eye area.</li>
    <li> Quality is normal quality, but i think it runs out fast although price was very good when i bought it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in good order.  I struggle to find this in the stores these days, so this was perfect to get three in one package.  This is great to tame eyebrows and those pesky fly away hairs!</li>
    <li> Most of the people recommending this product both here on Amazon and on other store sites say its a great product for eyebrows. Well, I bought it for my eyelashes because it was supposed to be a no color/clear mascara, it wasn&#x27;t advertised as a clear brow gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for your eyelashes but if you have thicker eyebrows and want a gel to keep them in place then maybe this product is for you. Don&#x27;t buy it though if you think its going to give you long full eyelashes because it won&#x27;t do anything except make your eyelashes look wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love someone to make a mascara that was clear that actually did help lengthen and thicken eyelashes so we wouldn&#x27;t always have to deal with the dark mascara.</li>
    <li> I use this as a brow-grooming gel, NOT as clear mascara. I tried applying this to my eyelashes and it was a waste of time, it&#x27;s not thick enough to really do much, everything just clumped together. I&#x27;ll stick to my LashBlast, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a brow gel, it does decently enough! Pretty firm hold once you apply. Pleasantly contoured brush and there&#x27;s plenty of product. I got ARDELL before this because it was high rated on Amazon - stay away from that stuff, it&#x27;s crap (runny, gets dirty way more easily than CG).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a mascara but rather as an eyebrow gel and it is terrific.  I would recommend it and absolutely would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Curls my eyelashes just like regular mascara. Also makes them longer. Love it! Dries pretty fast too. I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for quick, simple look. :)</li>
    <li> This is really good as a brow gel. I didn&#x27;t like it as a mascara - don&#x27;t know what I was expecting. As a brow gel it is absolutely  wonderful though. Since it came in a three - pack I sent one to each of my daughters who love it for brows.</li>
    <li> I use clear mascara to groom brows so prefer a straight brush as appears in the photo of the blue wand mascara.  However, I was sent the gray wand mascara which has a curved brush. The blue wand and the gray wand are different products and should be sold separately.  The brush style needs to appear in the product description.  The photo of the gray wand is oriented in a position as to appear straight.  Will be returning items.  Disappointed as it is difficult to find a straight brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for probably over five years. Even though I have tried other products that I think work better, I will say that this product is very consistent. Other products I have tried tend to stop being made, but like I said this one has been around for years. I use it for my eyebrows and I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make them feel like they are glued to my face and they aren&#x27;t felt looking shiny. The only thing is that sometimes can be a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but this is exactly what I needed to have my lashes look good without worrying about black mascara.</li>
    <li> While this is clearly a no-color product, the advertising for it indicates that it gives a shine.  It actually does nothing.</li>
