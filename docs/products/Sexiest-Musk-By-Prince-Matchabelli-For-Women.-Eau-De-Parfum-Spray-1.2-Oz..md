    <li> I tried this because I was looking for something to replace Aviance Night Musk and thought this would be close.  No go.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with perfume&#x27;s etc on my skin and some of their smells.  This one smells nice and I never have any type of reaction to it.  Also you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I use this one all of the time, but sometimes hard to find in stores.  That&#x27;s why I buy it from Amazon.  I always get what I want and get it pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> The perfume that I ordered for my wife was awesome.</li>
    <li> This is the parfum my wife &amp; I preferre. I did buy it at a local businesses, but they decided not stock this perfume anymore. So the first place I look is at Amazon and you have it.</li>
    <li> no my favorite but its ok</li>
    <li> This is my sisters favorite cologne and it is usually hard to find so it was a great gift at a good price.</li>
    <li> Why did they ever discontinue avaiance night musk it was the best....</li>
    <li> I continue to buy this product as I can&#x27;t find it in stores and love it.</li>
    <li> Walmart quit selling this product and my husband was so bummed because this is the one perfume that he likes on me. It has a strong yet soft smell if that makes any sense. Another words you notice it but you don&#x27;t get sick from smelling it. I get compliments all the time when I wear this perfume. The price was a little more but well worth it!</li>
    <li> If you like musk, you&#x27;ll love this one! Fast shipping, good price, great product.I was given this frangrance as a gift and am so glad I was able to find another. Finding this on Amazon at a reasonable price (lower than anywhere else) was helpful.</li>
    <li> I like this scent, but it does sometimes smell kinda cheap. Its strong and kinda smells like a mens cologne. But still kinda like vanilla</li>
    <li> i love this scent it smells so good.  used to get at walmart but they dont sell it anymore...too bad for them.</li>
    <li> I read a a review about this and was not expecting much given the LOW cost ( can also be purchased at many bargain places ) and the fact that it ihttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LY0meRJqL._SS300_.jpgs not a \\&quot;designer \\&quot;product . To my amazement this smells heavenly - similar to an Egyptian musk , soft , but has GREAT staying power . It is not a weak fragrance , nor is it overwhelming . It is a lovely feminine formulation that lasts all day for a bargain ! I adore the fragarance and have wanted something like it . I usually wear pricier fragrances , but am not a snob and appreciate a quality product like this yummy spray . Another perfume that is a fantastic buy for the money is an old Dana fragrance called \\&quot; Tojours Moi \\&quot; . It is TIMELESS  and I even have young girls stop and ask what I am wearing when I use it .      There are some beautiful fragrances that rival the  over hyped and over priced designer creations that are rather ho hum .</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I purchased this when they discontinued the body spray you would find at the drug stores. I have to say...it smells just like the body spray and as usual amazon delivered fast with no worries</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance but do not like your price as it is twice what the stores were selling it for!</li>
    <li> sexiest musk by prince matchabelli. This scent did not go with my chemistry. It was too strong,and gave me a headache, i gave it away.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my wife as a Christmas present and we both really like the &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; smell it has. I think we will be ordering more when this is about gone.</li>
    <li> Women said it should be a man spray, they said you would wear it. I wear it now ladies love it.</li>
