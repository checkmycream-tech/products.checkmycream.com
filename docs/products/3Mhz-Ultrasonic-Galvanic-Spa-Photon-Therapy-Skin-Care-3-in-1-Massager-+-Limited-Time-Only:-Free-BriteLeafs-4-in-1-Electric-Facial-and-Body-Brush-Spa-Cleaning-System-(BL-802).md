      <li>doesn&#x27;t tell you too much about over use and what would happen or skin warnings, mostly operation of the device that isn&#x27;t detailed enough...</li>
      <li>I had a rather spectacular breakout on my chin (more like my entire lower face) and after using the blue light, + ion, sonic massage and - ion settings, it&#x27;s nearly healed after a week.</li>
      <li>Anywho, My son bought this for me as a Birthday gift, i just used it for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>I can post more later after about a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re interested in, this item may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first i couldn&#x27;t decide to get a device that had the microcurrent and the photon lights work simutaneously or separately.</li>
      <li>The package arrived quickly but the directions aren&#x27;t detailed enough.</li>
      <li>I work in the health field and am very familiar with proper usage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes, when gripping the handle, I feel very minor electrical shocks.</li>
      <li>I actually have seen great results on clients dark spots and spider veins with this product.</li>
      <li>I have to hold it a certain way because it will begin to hurt at times.&lt;br</li>
      <li>which really is unheard-</li>
      <li>NOT even cheap picture instructructions, They would be a big help.</li>
      <li>but, i can tell that it really works.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and offers multiple options: acne control (blue light), collagen formation (red light, ultrasound), skin cleaning (ultrasound and + ion) and product enhancement (ultrasound and - ion).</li>
      <li>My intention with the purchase was mainly for collagen formation, but I still get breakouts and congestion.  </li>
      <li>use it 2-3 times a week, on high setting (always use some ultrasonic creme).</li>
      <li>-- I use it on High ALL THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>After using the ultrasound massage 3 times, it came to the surface and was easily removed--the only possible reasons being that newly created cells were pushing it from underneath, and, the + ion setting really does work for clearing debris.</li>
      <li>, the only thing i don&#x27;t like with this machine its the beep sound every 5 seconds they say its because every 5 seconds u need to move it to a different spot, it may be helpful</li>
      <li>white streak exactly where i usedit.  </li>
      <li>used the 3mz ultrasound, and first time i dropped it (from a low bed, maybe 2-3 feet)</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It may be too early to tell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read, microcurrent needs to be used consistently and later will last longer .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Level - Low, Medium and High</li>
      <li>but u can not do your treatment while watching TV and your parthner beside you and or with your parthner around its kind disturbing beep.....</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s too early to tell about the collagen production, I had a deeply set, small milia on my right cheek that would never have come out without being lanced and removed, something I would not do at home.</li>
      <li>My regular zits that usually show from time to time in same places are gone and I can even use the red light as a hair treatment (not mentioned in manual either)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This home Ultrasonic Galvanic Spa Photon Therapy Skin Care 3-in-1 Massager is actually pretty good!  for a unit this small and putting out 3Mhz which really is unheard-of is not only inexpensive, it does  firm the skin. I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician and I&#x27;m  impressed.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this one and i&#x27;m glad i did. At first i couldn&#x27;t decide to get a device that had the microcurrent and the photon lights work simutaneously or separately. This one works separately , i think giving you a stronger photon. I&#x27;ve used it about 6 or 7 times, i think it works...... subtle, nothing drastic, but, i can tell that it really works.  I&#x27;ve read, microcurrent needs to be used consistently and later will last longer .&lt;br /&gt;So,now i&#x27;m in search for more of a professional strength/level.</li>
    <li> I think is a good product . the istructions need to have more information and be more clear, but the product itself works fine.</li>
    <li> I agree with this other person about Jennifer and Michelle, i went and checked it out lol...Anywho, My son bought this for me as a Birthday gift, i just used it for the first time tonight. There is a difference right away! The only thing that bothers me is the small amount of info it came with. It does show you how to use it and all.. But it seem vague, no number or company address.. doesn&#x27;t tell you too much about over use and what would happen or skin warnings, mostly operation of the device that isn&#x27;t detailed enough... But however it does work :) just gotta read it over and over and use your brain a bit. You can go online and look for it and a company name does come up with number and address. But if you anything like me, i want to know everything. I can post more later after about a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> If I could figure out to use the device, it would help. The instructions that come with are not very helpful. Do you put the metal part on your face or the light end ????</li>
    <li> ...but I would like to have some more info. Like it doesn&#x27;t say in the manual when to use it with setting on \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; (you can do \\&quot;+\\&quot; and \\&quot;-\\&quot; with or without \\&quot;sonic\\&quot;, and that is not mentioned in manual).&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2-3 times a week, on high setting (always use some ultrasonic creme). My regular zits that usually show from time to time in same places are gone and I can even use the red light as a hair treatment (not mentioned in manual either)...So if anyone knows if I should have it set on \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; or not and what the difference it makes, please let me know. Thanks:)</li>
    <li> I must say I&#x27;m impressed with this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and offers multiple options: acne control (blue light), collagen formation (red light, ultrasound), skin cleaning (ultrasound and + ion) and product enhancement (ultrasound and - ion). I had a rather spectacular breakout on my chin (more like my entire lower face) and after using the blue light, + ion, sonic massage and - ion settings, it&#x27;s nearly healed after a week. My intention with the purchase was mainly for collagen formation, but I still get breakouts and congestion.  While it&#x27;s too early to tell about the collagen production, I had a deeply set, small milia on my right cheek that would never have come out without being lanced and removed, something I would not do at home. It didn&#x27;t trouble me at all, as it was small and not noticeable without a magnifying mirror.

I&#x27;d had it for a few years, so this was the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently that brought it to the surface.  I think I will enjoy this machine in the long term and am favorably impressed after just a week of use.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and was in a box that keeps the product secure and good for storage. It works beautifully</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the other 2 reviews (Jennifer &amp; Michelle) are fake. I received my Ultrasonic yesterday and I&#x27;ve used it once maybe I&#x27;m crazy but I already see some results. The package arrived quickly but the directions aren&#x27;t detailed enough. I bought this massager because of the price all of other ultrasonic massagers range from $150-$400 and all claim to use the same technology and achieve the same results. It may be too early to tell but so far I&#x27;m pretty happy &amp; hopeful.</li>
    <li> I recommend it 100% IS VERY EASY TO USE GOOD, LIKE HE IS SMALL AND IS GOOD FOR THOSE PLACES IN THE FACE.</li>
    <li> I have used it 3 times ad i can notice a significant chance all over my face, tonning and brighter. Friends have comment that my face looks different, i havent told the about using the massager. Thank you</li>
    <li> Wow! Great pick me up for my skin and my eye area looks rested and refreshed. I&#x27;ve been in the Beauty Business for 30 years and tried many different procedures, this is best bang for the buck for home use.</li>
    <li> This is a must have! I took off a canceres lesion from a dog! it was about one and half inches and quite deep! I also used moringa oil while I massaged it in and then use the light! I also bought one for all my family members,take control of your skin and order one!</li>
    <li> This Little Machine works, I have been using it for 3 days and I Already can Notice some results, Pimples are completely dry and the galvanic treatment definitely works helping creams go deeper, the only thing i don&#x27;t like with this machine its the beep sound every 5 seconds they say its because every 5 seconds u need to move it to a different spot, it may be helpful but u can not do your treatment while watching TV and your parthner beside you and or with your parthner around its kind disturbing beep..... beep..... beep otherwise price its worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a runner and I have had matatarsalgia for more than a year, I was told by a trainer that I need it ultrasonic therapy.  I bought this item and it has been a great big difference with my foot.</li>
    <li> Who knows what where which??? useless $$$$ down drain....NOT even cheap picture instructructions, They would be a big help. .Because as is .THERE IS No sense TO IT.. Disgruntled  with device</li>
    <li> I bought this unit primarily to use on a sports injury (my wrist). I advise anyone who buys this product to do extensive research on ultrasound machines -- it&#x27;s benefits and how it works. If it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re interested in, this item may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, this doesn&#x27;t come with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 buttons&lt;br /&gt;1) power&lt;br /&gt;2) one that selects either \\&quot;ion-,\\&quot; \\&quot;ion+,\\&quot; or \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; (to be honest, I have no idea what these are for, I switch between them and find that ion+/ion- seem to work best for me&lt;br /&gt;3) Level - Low, Medium and High -- I use it on High ALL THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;4) Photon -- I never use this. Supposedly, it has some special effect that helps with facials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, please be advised that this is a pretty cheap item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, when gripping the handle, I feel very minor electrical shocks. I have to hold it a certain way because it will begin to hurt at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;water drop test\\&quot; will not prove successful -- water will not pulse. When I asked customer service about it, they just said to listen for a humming. This humming is supposed to signify that it is working properly. Again, this seems a bit sketchy! But I went with it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this. It&#x27;s cheaply made and could prove to be dangerous. I work in the health field and am very familiar with proper usage. I&#x27;m willing to take the risk with this product but do have buyer&#x27;s remorse and wish I had invested more money into a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3mHz is ideal for the type of injury I had. With the above said, it&#x27;s best to approach with caution. Before you make the purchase, understand that this item isn&#x27;t FDA approved, medical grade at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I used the ultrasonund per the direction and found that it works but I also found that it did not penatrate deep enough to get to the joint problem I am having so I will request a 1MHz vesus a 3mhz I was using.</li>
    <li> -----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:  looks like white streak is going to be a permanent discoloration / scar on my skin.  and to think this is a beauty product!  failed terribly. :(  I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t use it on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a 1mhz portable ultrasound that i use for sports-related injuries. does the job. not as good as the ones at PT&#x27;s or chiropractors, but works well. have had it / have used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;decided to get this one for collagen - body, not face.  used the 3mz ultrasound, and first time i dropped it (from a low bed, maybe 2-3 feet) it broke. cheap plastic around the metal piece that touches the skin.  decided to use it anyhow... and noticed that it discolored my skin... white streak exactly where i usedit.  this is after a single application.. not sure that hard plastic around it was supposed to protect the skin in anyway, (doesn&#x27;t make sense... and i wasn&#x27;t using any of the lighting options) -- either way, will never use it again. and do no recommend it!</li>
    <li> 3Mhz Ultrasonico, es un excelente producto, ha sido efectivo en el rostro y espalda, se pueden ver los resultados inmediatamente.</li>
    <li> the instuctions were not clear and i dont think its working properly. I t says a drop of water should pulse on it (the metal head and it doesnt</li>
    <li> I still would like to know how to use this product. Do I use the metal part or the light side. No helpful information what&#x27;s so ever! Can somebody please help. This product is so far a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I actually have seen great results on clients dark spots and spider veins with this product. We were actually able to make a new service just from the light.</li>
