      <li>Am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this as well as the maintenence product andit works great!</li>

      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>All in all great product and gave me the results I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find it at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff  no streaks and tan in a day!!</li>
      <li>But it washes off in the shower, and you can offset the tanner smell with a good smelling moisturizing soap, lotion, or perfume of your choosing.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and this self-tanner turned my legs orange not to mention that it smells.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and got the fair/medium</li>
      <li>I have the kind of fair skin that doesn&#x27;t hold a tan at all and likes to burn.</li>

      <li>Love this lotion!  </li>
      <li>So happy that this was available thru your website..</li>

      <li>Its a nice tanner..</li>
      <li>It makes me feel sexy and confident!</li>
      <li>This product is great if you use it consistently and apply it correctly.</li>
      <li>a lot - works well, doesn&#x27;t turn orange and just gives a nice tan very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It looked kind of orangy, and it had that strong DHA smell that most self-tanners have after it develops.</li>
      <li>I am very fair and when I used this product, it did not produce a natural glow.</li>
      <li>glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>I knew I would love this product before I ordered it, because I had used it before.</li>
      <li>Sure will use this product from now on...</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I thought I would try this latest formula.</li>
      <li>I am blessed to have smooth skin, and I achieved a nice glow.</li>
      <li>It is streak free and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell though, which is also why I put lotion on before.</li>
      <li>It is really amazing how this product changes the color of your skin in a gentle way.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product line.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t the best at actually moisturizing, but that isn&#x27;t what I really bought it for.</li>
      <li>I did not notice a significant change of skin color after using it for 3 days.</li>
      <li>I have used other Jergens fair to medium tanning products and was pleased.</li>
      <li>but just enough to where I can get a pretty great tan.</li>
      <li>Make sure to not put much if any on knees and elbows</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>You can apply the second coat and be good to go.</li>
      <li>You really want to make sure you RUB it in though</li>
      <li>They were supposed to reduce the scent of the lotion, however this stuff is still pretty strong.</li>
      <li>but it leaves me looking super orange.</li>
      <li>This definitely works faster and smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a healthy looking glow of a tan fast.</li>
      <li>love it..very natural looking</li>
      <li>This is the most natural looking self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>so I thought that it&#x27;d be worth a try.</li>
      <li>The express form of this product is superior to other forms.  </li>
      <li>I am naturally fair skinned and don&#x27;t get to enjoy the sun as much as I&#x27;d like (two small children at home).  </li>
      <li>It really gave good tanning, and dried quickly.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really pretty fool proof.</li>
      <li>I did find more acne on my back and figured it is because of this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I put it on at night after a shower and exfoliating with a washcloth first.</li>
      <li>and that looks funny</li>
      <li>Gives my fair skin an even long-lasting glow within a few hours.  </li>
      <li>I do apply lotion on my skin first and the put this stuff on, just in case parts of my skin are dry and absorb more (splotchy).</li>
      <li>I do this every day until it is time to shave my legs and start the whole process over again.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll have very natural-looking color.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>It made me blotchy no matter how much I tried rubbing it in evenly.</li>
      <li>Went back to my original formula.</li>
      <li>small price to pay for the nice glow.</li>
      <li>This lotion works better than I ever could have expected; it leaves no sticky residue feeling and looks completely natural.</li>
      <li>You have to use it daily to see any color, and it wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>I am about 1/8th native american and the rest german/irish (light skinned) so not too much native american in me..</li>
      <li>This product will certainly give you color--though that is a very broad statement.</li>
      <li>I am VERY fair and this one didn&#x27;t apply as evenly and left me looking to fake.</li>
      <li>The tan it produces is very natural.  </li>
      <li>It goes on like lotion, but my legs are left very streaky.</li>
      <li>This lotion makes my skin look like I&#x27;m naturally sun kissed.  </li>
      <li>However, once the color shows up, it&#x27;s natural and lasts a while.  </li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to scents, don&#x27;t use this.</li>
      <li>I usually apply it right after a shower after drying off it seems to soak in better within the first few minutes while your pores are still open.</li>
      <li>I love the idea, but have yet to find anything that works well enough, easy enough to go cold turkey on the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>It does take a few hours to dry completely and will rub off some onto clothing but washes out easily.</li>
      <li>So fast that you need to be sure to wash your hands or you will have weird stains.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something more subtle than a yellow or yellow-brownish (bruise looking) color or splotches on me.</li>
      <li>I would totally and completely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It works quicker than regular tanners, so you have an idea of what needs to be fixed if there is any streaking.</li>
      <li>I used to use the regular Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow</li>
      <li>Smells a little bit funny</li>
      <li>My only qualm is a little blotchiness at first around my wrists and ankles.</li>

<li> Smells a little bit funny</li>
<li> My only qualm is a little blotchiness at first around my wrists and ankles.</li>
<li> Two tips for use: 1. Be careful around the wrists as if you are not careful there can be a line at the hands.</li>
<li> May not be as dramatic as other self tanners, but it&#x27;s never orangy and  is pretty much mistake-proof as it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
<li> let it dry for several minutes before dressing, and apply sparingly to ankles/knees)</li>
<li> After 2 days of applying this lotion I feel confident that my legs won&#x27;t blind people when I wear skirts!</li>
<li> It really does wreak havoc on the color of your joints, but that&#x27;s not really surprising.</li>
<li> Not a good plan if you have to get ready for work</li>
<li> Third application I was almost too dark for my liking, my legs were the darkest they have ever been..and</li>
<li> My husband says I look like a burn victim.</li>
<li> I only had to use it every other day to accomplish the tan I wanted!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t wear anything tight such as a bra after application.</li>
<li> In other words, there is a lot you can&#x27;t get out of the bottle</li>
<li> The only thing I dislike is that there isn&#x27;t a lot in the bottle and a because it is thick, a lot of it doesn&#x27;t come when it&#x27;s getting close to being empty.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Am very happy with this product. Change in skin tone was subtle but increased with multiple applications. I feel in control of the amount of \\&quot;tanning\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot - works well, doesn&#x27;t turn orange and just gives a nice tan very quickly.  The only thing I dislike is that there isn&#x27;t a lot in the bottle and a because it is thick, a lot of it doesn&#x27;t come when it&#x27;s getting close to being empty.  Maybe make a larger bottle with easier dispensing??</li>
    <li> I have been using this as well as the maintenence product andit works great! After two uses, i have a nice tan. I really enjoy this product line. I am blessed to have smooth skin, and I achieved a nice glow. My friends asked why I had started tanning and they couldn&#x27;t believe it was a lotion! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me personally...small price to pay for the nice glow. Two tips for use: 1. Be careful around the wrists as if you are not careful there can be a line at the hands. 2. Don&#x27;t wear anything tight such as a bra after application. I did this and ended up with a dark line where the bra straps are. I put it on at night after a shower and exfoliating with a washcloth first.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, buying this product at Target, but after the first day, all my doubts disappeared. This lotion works better than I ever could have expected; it leaves no sticky residue feeling and looks completely natural. My only qualm is a little blotchiness at first around my wrists and ankles. I would totally and completely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff  no streaks and tan in a day!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  I am naturally fair skinned and don&#x27;t get to enjoy the sun as much as I&#x27;d like (two small children at home).  This lotion makes my skin look like I&#x27;m naturally sun kissed.  It does take a few applications before seeing any substantial difference (I do back-to-back prior to going to bed).  However, once the color shows up, it&#x27;s natural and lasts a while.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and this self-tanner turned my legs orange not to mention that it smells. I will not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I buy this product so I can have bare legs before breaking out the tights when cold weather comes.  This summer I have found it works best when I mix it with moisterizer in the palm of my hand.  Then I rub my hands together and apply.  I do this every day until it is time to shave my legs and start the whole process over again.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a small bottle (only four ounces) and even though it&#x27;s designed to stand upside down, there is still a lot of waste at the end.  In other words, there is a lot you can&#x27;t get out of the bottle so you end up throwing away about a fifth of the product.</li>
    <li> This product will certainly give you color--though that is a very broad statement. It really does wreak havoc on the color of your joints, but that&#x27;s not really surprising. It made me blotchy no matter how much I tried rubbing it in evenly. But worst of all, it just turned me yellow. I was looking for something more subtle than a yellow or yellow-brownish (bruise looking) color or splotches on me. I&#x27;m fair skinned and got the fair/medium so I thought that it&#x27;d be worth a try. I just hope all this disgusting color wears off in the next week so that I won&#x27;t look like I suffer from jaundice in my wedding gown.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have the kind of fair skin that doesn&#x27;t hold a tan at all and likes to burn. After 2 days of applying this lotion I feel confident that my legs won&#x27;t blind people when I wear skirts! If you follow the directions (esp. let it dry for several minutes before dressing, and apply sparingly to ankles/knees) you&#x27;ll have very natural-looking color.</li>
    <li> Does just as it says. I used for quite a while and did not experience any &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; issues with my skin.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews before I made my purchase....glad that I did.  This stuff is really pretty fool proof.</li>
    <li> They were supposed to reduce the scent of the lotion, however this stuff is still pretty strong. You have to use it daily to see any color, and it wears off quickly. The scent and the time it takes to apply sunless tanner overall is what time and time again sends me back to a tanning bed over sunless tanning. I love the idea, but have yet to find anything that works well enough, easy enough to go cold turkey on the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> The express form of this product is superior to other forms.  The tan it produces is very natural.  No orange.  I live in the North and it is impossible to find the express during the colder months.  I hate the pasty white skin of the winter and use this product on my face, neck and arms to give me a slight tan.  I was happy to find it at Amazon.  i ordered a quanity and will order again if I run out.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I used to use the regular Jergen&#x27;s Natural Glow and I liked it but it was slower than I wanted.  This definitely works faster and smells pretty good.  It isn&#x27;t the best at actually moisturizing, but that isn&#x27;t what I really bought it for.</li>
    <li> I like to use this when I start tanning each Spring and Summer, but it&#x27;s not carried in stores anymore?  It works quicker than regular tanners, so you have an idea of what needs to be fixed if there is any streaking. You can apply the second coat and be good to go. With regular tanners, you apply a coat and won&#x27;t see the results until the next morning. Not a good plan if you have to get ready for work and you have streaks. It lasts longer than regular tanners if you care for your tan and keep your skin moisturized. I would give it 5 stars except the fragrance is stronger than I like. But it washes off in the shower, and you can offset the tanner smell with a good smelling moisturizing soap, lotion, or perfume of your choosing. All tanners have that smell that comes from the chemical reaction of DHA, but some are worse than others. This one is not as bad as the old Jergen&#x27;s tan formula, holy moly that stuff was raw, but I wish they used a different fragrance.  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I have used other Jergens fair to medium tanning products and was pleased. I thought I would try this latest formula. However, this one is still a little too dark for me. I am VERY fair and this one didn&#x27;t apply as evenly and left me looking to fake. Went back to my original formula. I suggest this formula for someone more medium than fair.</li>
    <li> I am very fair and when I used this product, it did not produce a natural glow. It looked kind of orangy, and it had that strong DHA smell that most self-tanners have after it develops. I haven&#x27;t found one self-tanner that doesn&#x27;t smell like that yet, I wish they would come out with something.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a significant change of skin color after using it for 3 days. I did find more acne on my back and figured it is because of this moisturizer. The consistency was too thick to spread and it felt heavy on my skin. I decided to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Product was out dated. I threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to scents, don&#x27;t use this. The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; is somewhere between dime-store perfume and harsh chemicals. Worse, I&#x27;m having a hard time getting rid of the smell! Ick!</li>
    <li> This is the most natural looking self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It lasts several days after one application and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
    <li> love it..very natural looking</li>
    <li> WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT!</li>
    <li> It is really amazing how this product changes the color of your skin in a gentle way. Sure will use this product from now on...</li>
    <li> I knew I would love this product before I ordered it, because I had used it before. I bought it at my local Walmart store until they stopped carrying it. It is streak free and easy to apply. You get nice results in a one day application. It does take a few hours to dry completely and will rub off some onto clothing but washes out easily. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a healthy looking glow of a tan fast.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. Fasting acting! So fast that you need to be sure to wash your hands or you will have weird stains. Smells a little bit funny but I mix it with my vanilla lotion and the tanning smell is masked.</li>
    <li> Gives my fair skin an even long-lasting glow within a few hours.  Unfortunately, I believe this product has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you use it consistently and apply it correctly. Make sure to not put much if any on knees and elbows cause then you will have dark spots. I usually apply it right after a shower after drying off it seems to soak in better within the first few minutes while your pores are still open. It has a slight odor but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and my husband hasn&#x27;t mentioned it so it must not be enough to bother others. I never tan I only burn, so this has been a life saver. It makes me feel sexy and confident! Oh yeah and dont forget to wash your hands after applying cause then your palms will be tan haha and that looks funny, I also made the mistake of when washing letting the water drip a little down my forearm and I had areas on my forearm that didn&#x27;t tan because the water washed it off before it soaked in. All in all great product and gave me the results I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Those of us who are pastey whites need a solution....but this isn&#x27;t the answer. I have used it numerous times. It goes on like lotion, but my legs are left very streaky. My husband says I look like a burn victim. They need some sort of drying agent to make it set up faster. I mean, who has 8 hours they can stand on their feet without anything coming into contact with their legs?! I&#x27;ve bought my last bit of this until they can figure out a way to minimize the streaking. I look like a freak!</li>
    <li> Because the Summer is over, I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere.  So happy that this was available thru your website..</li>
    <li> I am about 1/8th native american and the rest german/irish (light skinned) so not too much native american in me..but just enough to where I can get a pretty great tan. I did already have a little base tan going on from the summer, but still looked rather pale (to me at least). After one application I was dramatically darker. The second application I was BROWN. Third application I was almost too dark for my liking, my legs were the darkest they have ever been..and the native american in me has always given me a reddish undertone so I didn&#x27;t want to look orange. This stuff works. I do apply lotion on my skin first and the put this stuff on, just in case parts of my skin are dry and absorb more (splotchy). It works great, I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell though, which is also why I put lotion on before. You really want to make sure you RUB it in though or it will look streaked if you don&#x27;t rub it all the way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and am very mad Jergens has taken it off the market.  It really gave good tanning, and dried quickly.</li>
    <li> This product actually works as it says it does. I only had to use it every other day to accomplish the tan I wanted!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I also mix it with reg lotion for and even glow</li>
    <li> I apply the product immediately after shower/towel drying. Overnight, I get results. Used two or three days consecutively, deeper color evolves. May not be as dramatic as other self tanners, but it&#x27;s never orangy and  is pretty much mistake-proof as it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. No orange at all.</li>
    <li> Its a nice tanner..but it leaves me looking super orange. It smells terrible and if you dont even it out enough it geta darker in certain areas.</li>
