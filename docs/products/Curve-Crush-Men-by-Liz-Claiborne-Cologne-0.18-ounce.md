      <li>My son was happy and at twelve he doesn&#x27;t require or need much cologne.</li>
      <li>It was a perfect size and lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>I now like it better than Curve original.</li>
      <li>To be honest, it is a very feminine fragrance.  </li>
      <li>different decanter is a good fit.</li>
      <li>This is pretty much an exact copy of  L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey Pour Homme by Issey Miyake  (amazon #B000C214CO).  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and last a long time.</li>
      <li>Smells great, small size is good for it your not sure if you like it</li>
      <li>The smell lingers like real cologne does.</li>
      <li>Spicy, woodsy, a bit fruity, very well balanced.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really see a women smelling this on a man and thinking, now that is a masculine man.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of our first date mid winter.</li>
      <li>Smells exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>I still have about half of this little bottle and will most likely get more once I do finally go through it.</li>
      <li>For how much you pay for this, you are getting a half decent deal.</li>
