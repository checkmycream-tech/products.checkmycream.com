      <li>These razors are amazing !  </li>
      <li>Good razors, I&#x27;ve used these for years...</li>
      <li>These are surprisingly good.</li>
      <li>Good for shaping my beard.</li>
      <li>It takes 4 swipes in every direction to get a good shave on my underarms.  </li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t believer any of the disposable razors are as good as they once were including this one, it&#x27;s my opinion</li>
      <li>So in order to be compliant and still achieve a good shave without being considered a threat to maritime security, I ordered these.  </li>
      <li>Good razors and you get thirty of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would always get a good close shave and never have a problem with them.  </li>
      <li>so I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>They are good razors, but they certainly aren&#x27;t as perfect as the reviews may lead you to believe.  </li>
      <li>Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered so darn many!</li>
      <li>I was happy to see them available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>or whatever the number of blades is on Gillette&#x27;s latest product to get a good shave.  </li>
      <li>Multi-blade novelties are for trendy weenies.</li>
      <li>but now I use the Bic Metal Shaver instead since they are more efficient and the shave is just as good as a safety razor.</li>
      <li>it is great for shaving and clean shaving bald heads.</li>
      <li>good buy, can not find in stores anymore, does a good job shaving and is easy to clean out when finished</li>
      <li>Now I probably have a lifetime supply of great quality travel razors thanks to Amazon!</li>
      <li>reinforced my new Amazon philosophy - &#x27;Whenever buying something you haven&#x27;t used before - no matter how awesome the reviews - buy it in the smallest quantity available.&#x27;</li>
      <li>Better then spending $20+ bucks for a pack of three razor heads.</li>
      <li>Much better than the crappy disposables i bought at Costco.</li>
      <li>My husband and I haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally in a while, so it was great to find them on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Because stores believe the more blades the better.  </li>
      <li>and the one razor got through most of my face.</li>
      <li>Better then multiblade monsters.</li>
      <li>Outstanding value when you can find one pack at around $2.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found them on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>It is a testament to the marketing genius of Gillette, and to a lesser extent Schick, that these are not the best selling razors on the market.</li>
      <li>I like getting this many razors for this price.</li>
      <li>Buying on Amazon is way better than driving all over town trying to find razors.  </li>
      <li>and i love them</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe the 5-minutes will come off with more practice</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t need to order more.</li>
      <li>So glad I found them for my husband.</li>
      <li>but I found that I get a better shave when using gel-type shaving cream.</li>
      <li>These razors are a perfect solution for me as there&#x27;s probably enough here for months of shaving.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find these in stores any more</li>
      <li>Most of you&#x27;re life you&#x27;ve probably used razors that shave for you, just place on face and pull, these won&#x27;t compensate for your lack of skill with technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, why pay more for those over-priced, multi-blade razors?  </li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a much better product based upon all the rave reviews.  </li>
      <li>more more</li>
      <li>Those simple shavers are great indeed!</li>
      <li>I would gladly give them to someone else who wanted to try them out.</li>
      <li>My favorite shaver, of course i like it.</li>
      <li>This design, which no longer seems to be available in stores, gives the best overall shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of disposable and refillable razors in my time and this is without a doubt the best single blade disposable ever made.</li>
      <li>Better than cheap stuff</li>
      <li>Like many others I have not been happy with the razor offerings in the Big Box stores in my area, as \\&quot;everybody\\&quot; has gone to 4 stacked blades and up, with costs on the order of $5 or more per razor, etc.  </li>
      <li>It was just like I remembered, a smooth shaver that produces better results than the multiblade things batteries and gel strips.  </li>
      <li>These were recommended to my husband as a good alternative to shaving with a straight razor when traveling, but he HATES them.  </li>
      <li>Best razor ever used, would not use any other.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found them easily in stores , but these are the ones.</li>
      <li>They are very sharp and give an excellent shave.</li>
      <li>a great product,gets the job done and above all CHEAP</li>
      <li>After these I bought a double edged safety razor (Merkur) and that has been working out great.</li>
      <li>Great value, especially compared to those multi-blade refills.</li>
      <li>&quot; These razors do not glide smoothly, chatter over the face, and do cut you.</li>
      <li>the way, it is also easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This will force you to make light strokes.</li>
      <li>But it, enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I used these when they were readily available in stores here, and their scarcity is what began my quest for a viable replacement which led me to DE</li>
      <li>also, the metal bar is genius, for a smooth even shave.</li>
      <li>Still available on eBay under bic metal.</li>
      <li>They are simply the best razor i have ever used as they are very precise and above all, cheap to purchase.  </li>
      <li>The blade usually lasts for about three or more shaves so that makes it an incredible value.</li>
      <li>Fast service, best single blade razor out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using BIC 2-blade disposables for a long time, and been happy with them.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no lubrication strip and, stroke for stroke, they will not get you as clean as a (for instance) a Mach3.  </li>
      <li>the clean up pass</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s always clean and lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>The metal frame edge seems to give a more positive feel of control on the skin than the plastic ones.</li>
      <li>One good blade always beats many average blades in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>so you can use them to their full potential:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they work just a good now as they did way back</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has a large gap between the blade and the safety bar that NEVER clogs up. You can shave several days worth of growth and all of the hair just washes right through. You will need a very gentle hand due to the exposure of the blade, but that is just a small learning curve. Simple, cheap, doesn&#x27;t clog. I love them.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes but am disappointed.  They pull, cut and don&#x27;t shave very closely at all.  I use them on my legs and underarms.  It takes 4 swipes in every direction to get a good shave on my underarms.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered so darn many!</li>
    <li> Those simple shavers are great indeed! Got them on ebay recently. The point is to pick a right blade anlgle while shaving.&lt;br /&gt; Better then multiblade monsters.</li>
    <li> Finally, a single blade razor that perform as well as the multi-blade, expensive brands.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different types of razors, including double-edge safety razors, and, of course, the costly Gillette-types.  For 50 cents, this is a great shave.  If you want to break away from paying $3 for a disposable multi-blade, then this is the razor for you.  But it, enjoy it.</li>
    <li> These are not very good. While they can maneuver in some tight spots, they pull my hair and I always end up in a lot of pain after shaving with these. I was trying to save some money from buying all those multi blade razors that cost $3 a cartridge. I have a heavy beard, so I was flying through those, these were just not the solution. After these I bought a double edged safety razor (Merkur) and that has been working out great.</li>
    <li> These were recommended to my husband as a good alternative to shaving with a straight razor when traveling, but he HATES them.  Tried it once, and threw out everything. We&#x27;re back to checking bags with razor blades.</li>
    <li> I cannot find these anymore in stores around my area.  Everyone stopped carrying them.  WHY?  Because stores believe the more blades the better.  So, my solution is to order them through Amazon.  Not everyone needs 3, 4, 5 blades to get a close shave.  These BIC Metal razors give me the close shave I want without the cuts.  Also, they don&#x27;t scrape my skin off like multi-blades.  I prefer these over any of the other more expensive razors.  I give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Pap&#x27;s go-to razors! Will order again soon!</li>
    <li> pros:cheap,gets the job done,no green smearing on face after shave&lt;br /&gt;cons:does not shave tough beard closely,bleeds skin esp below chin&lt;br /&gt;overall:a great product,gets the job done and above all CHEAP</li>
    <li> Razor never will never get clogged.  Your wife will never use it. They last forever. And this is the only place I found to buy them.</li>
    <li> hard to find these now and i love them</li>
    <li> good buy, can not find in stores anymore, does a good job shaving and is easy to clean out when finished</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a budget oriented college student. These razors are a perfect solution for me as there&#x27;s probably enough here for months of shaving. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between these and the more expensive multi blade razors, so thats an added bonus. I&#x27;m also someone that tends to lose things, so I don&#x27;t feel bad at all when and if I lose one of these. They are just so cheap that I wouldn&#x27;t mind handing them out to my fellow dorm mates, in the weird event that I were to hand out razors to...yeah.....they&#x27;re great. Buy them.</li>
    <li> Good razors and you get thirty of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to last several shaves before you need to trash em&#x27;. Better then spending $20+ bucks for a pack of three razor heads.</li>
    <li> Shaves well in the area between my nose and upper lip, which can be hard to reach with an electric or larger razor. Lasts for weeks.</li>
    <li> My husband and I haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally in a while, so it was great to find them on Amazon!  Made him and me both a happy camper!!</li>
    <li> These were just not for me.  The blades seemed to be poor quality.  The shave was uncomfortable and irritated my face.</li>
    <li> Sharp razor which is sturdy for a disposable. Seems to be helping me prevent ingrown hairs as opposed to the 15 blade razors</li>
    <li> Preparing to go on a cruise, I found many online references that stated razors with removable blades such as a double edge are not allowed- it&#x27;s the times we&#x27;re living in I guess.  So in order to be compliant and still achieve a good shave without being considered a threat to maritime security, I ordered these.  I used these when they were readily available in stores here, and their scarcity is what began my quest for a viable replacement which led me to DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;When these arrived I pulled one out of the package and shaved with it.  It was just like I remembered, a smooth shaver that produces better results than the multiblade things batteries and gel strips.  One good blade always beats many average blades in my opinion.  Now I probably have a lifetime supply of great quality travel razors thanks to Amazon!</li>
    <li> These razors are about as simple as you can get.  No pivoting head.  No pricey, multiple blades.  And no slimey strips of whatever.  What you do get is a simple razor that is well constructed and a razor that shaves without nicking (hardly ever).  I have tried many other brands and styles of disposable razors over the years.  This one Is reasonably priced and it gets the job done just as well as the others.  So, why pay more for those over-priced, multi-blade razors?  It&#x27;s a waste.</li>
    <li> I like getting this many razors for this price. Overall, I would recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for disposable razors that are economical and work well.</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing !  They are super sharp and the smart design reduces my morning shave time by 50%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a Safety razor but now I use the Bic Metal Shaver instead since they are more efficient and the shave is just as good as a safety razor.</li>
    <li> These are surprisingly good. Very good, too. They are very sharp and care should be used the first time or two you use them. But they seem to last a long time two. For this price it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> My husband will only use these razors and I just couldn&#x27;t find them any more. I am so glad I found them on Amazon.com.  My husband says these are the best, this makes me happy too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t buy in to the &amp;#34;one million blades (said with pinkie next to mouth) are better than one&amp;#34; gimmick, these are the blades for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the TSA doesn&#x27;t like me taking my safety razor in my carry on, these are a great option. Apparently, because the blade is fixed into a handle and there is a metal &amp;#34;guard,&amp;#34; they are safer than those scary safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used -- and they should be for the premium price. For me, they are worth it so I&#x27;m not using crappy razors while I travel.</li>
    <li> I use these as travel razors.  They are very sharp and give an excellent shave. Hard to beat the price.</li>
    <li> You know how a blade gets after a few too many times using it&lt;br /&gt;That is the way these blades feel new out of the bag&lt;br /&gt;I tried two and each of my son&#x27;s tried one, all of us had cuts on our faces to prove it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is just the angle of the blade, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them after that.</li>
    <li> I only recieved one pac! I ordered and paid for six pacs! Spoke with a customer service rep the day I recieved the short-changed&lt;br /&gt;shipment. Not sure if I was reimbursed or not.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend only likes these razors because they are 1 of the few that does not have any kind of &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; which only causes him to breakout.  I snatch these up wherever I can find them.  Great Buy</li>
    <li> I have used these for years, hope they never stop making them, very close shave with no cuts. more more</li>
    <li> I have used this brand and model of shaver since the mid-90s to take my time and get a close shave without irritating my skin nor causing hair bumps. The metal bar in front of the razorblade holds the skin just taut enough to cut the whisker without harming the skin. It does require care, it&#x27;s still a very sharp blade, but no more than any other blade-shaver out there. They aren&#x27;t worth more than maybe two shaves per razor, which is fine because they are disposable and this is a very economical price compared to the crazy prices of the multi-blade shavers out there.</li>
    <li> Grateful to find the Bic Metal at Amazon...great razor at a great price.  Far superior to the high priced multi-blades!</li>
    <li> If you DON&#x27;T like the crazy multi-blade razors commonly found today, but wish to use a really excellent single blade shaver that seems to last longer than all the rest, try the Bic Metal Shaver.</li>
    <li> Hope they never stop production! for sensitive skin, single blade razors are excellent. also, the metal bar is genius, for a smooth even shave.</li>
    <li> Outstanding value when you can find one pack at around $2.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts as close as traditional wet shaver and much safer than double edge blades like feathers, etc.</li>
    <li> Depending on the exact package, some shavers can only be used for once. The next time you try it, it may hurt you but give you a clean shave.</li>
    <li> These shavers do an adequate job, I expected to get a littl bit closer shave than what I actually get.</li>
    <li> Good razors, I&#x27;ve used these for years...</li>
    <li> I have used since they were introduced years ago. The simple design is, a textured bar drags across your face lifting the hair and a single sharp blade removes the hair at the surface. The razor designs that use a second, third or fourth blade make the head too big and cause more nicks (in my experience). If it adds better qualification, I have fair skin and medium coarse hair, blonde to copper (now white ).</li>
    <li> I prefer the single razor over the double razor because its easier to clean</li>
    <li> Product Great!&lt;br /&gt;Price Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;could not find them in store! looked everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;these blades work best for me! be back!</li>
    <li> If you like nicks and total discomfort while shaving, this product is for you. Now what to do with twenty eight shavers I will never use.</li>
    <li> Best disposable razor ever made for trimming beards goatees and sideburns.  Still available on eBay under bic metal.</li>
    <li> So glad I found them for my husband.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t believer any of the disposable razors are as good as they once were including this one, it&#x27;s my opinion the Bic metal shaver still out performs all others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Fast service, best single blade razor out there.</li>
    <li> Some will find it hard to understand why I continue to use a disposable razor with one blade.  The answer is really quite simple....this is the best disposable razor I have ever used.  It has become difficult to find this razor at local retailers so I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  As far as performance, the blade is very sharp and stays that way if you take the time to remove moisture after every shave.  The shave itself is excellent...I don&#x27;t need 5...6...7...or whatever the number of blades is on Gillette&#x27;s latest product to get a good shave.  Try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used Bic Metals back in the 80s for a while and couldn&#x27;t find them in stores after the mid 90s.  I was happy to see them available on Amazon.  The metal bar really helps you get a close shave without any pressure.  The blade usually lasts for about three or more shaves so that makes it an incredible value. It&#x27;s hard to get that many shaves from a lot of the cartridge razors. The design doesn&#x27;t clog like stacked razors either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BIC 2-blade disposables for a long time, and been happy with them. Because of the low price and many glowing reviews, I decided to try these. I have to agree with the review titled \\&quot;Ouch.\\&quot; These razors do not glide smoothly, chatter over the face, and do cut you. They do not produce a smooth shave even with repeated passes over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had not purchased the large quantity, as I am now simply going to throw them away. My advice - if you have not used these before, stick with what you know.</li>
    <li> This design, which no longer seems to be available in stores, gives the best overall shave. The beard is raised by a single bar, then closely cut. Yes they are sharp but that&#x27;s what you want in a shave. One razor lasts up to a month, especially if you dry it after use. After all, these are steel blades, they won&#x27;t wear out from rubbing against your skin, it is actually oxidation that pits away at a razor to make it dull.  Keeping it dry makes it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it is also easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall for the gimmick of multiblades - just get the one and save $ and time.</li>
    <li> Give up your seven blade Gillette and get real. Use with old school cream like colonel conk. Works wonders on my white trash Joe Dirt scrubble. Last forever.</li>
    <li> The metal frame edge seems to give a more positive feel of control on the skin than the plastic ones. Gives a od shave, but like the regular Bics, not good for more than 2 or 3 shaves before you &#x3D;really&#x3D; feel it.</li>
    <li> i guess bic stopped selling this.... the best disposable shaver made.  except in europe they still sell them.  go figure?</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I was tired of spending $40 on an eight pack of 5 bladed razor heads. What if I just bought a bunch of disposable ones and changed them out every shave? Well I had to find out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE. I did a half face shave, one with these razors, other side with old gilette fusion (i was ready to throw out btw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things tear your skin up! My old fusion did a better job (to my dismay), now I have a bunch of these laying around that I don&#x27;t know what to do with (maybe give them to someone I hate). I would gladly give them to someone else who wanted to try them out. i think my next move will be trying disposable 2 bladed razors (maybe I read the description of these wrong).</li>
    <li> I was expecting a much better product based upon all the rave reviews.  It ended up that they nick me as much as all the other disposables I have tried.  They are good razors, but they certainly aren&#x27;t as perfect as the reviews may lead you to believe.  To each his own, as shaving is a very personal thing.</li>
    <li> Just like they&#x27;ve been making for 20+Years. I haven&#x27;t found them easily in stores , but these are the ones.</li>
    <li> Like many others I have not been happy with the razor offerings in the Big Box stores in my area, as \\&quot;everybody\\&quot; has gone to 4 stacked blades and up, with costs on the order of $5 or more per razor, etc.  And, to top it off, these 4 stack, 5 stack, 6 stack razors do not perform as well as a single blade razor when it comes to closeness.  Actually, I do think that a 2 stack razor might be the sweet spot for performance, but I&#x27;m not absolutely sure about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product, the cost was in the pennies per razor and the suckers really are sharp, which is almost a complaint... I have managed to cut myself a couple of times with these, so user beware and be careful... pay attention when you&#x27;re using them.  (especially around the lips, as it&#x27;s pretty easy to clip off a little folded lip skin if you&#x27;re not careful)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, they work well, and seem to last a long time... My beard must not be very tough because I can make one of these blades last me for weeks (the instructions say they should be excellent for 3-4 shaves... I&#x27;m at 20+ and counting!)  They also give a far closer cut than I can get with anything but a brand new 5 stack razor, which will only give that equivalent cut for the first few shaves with it.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for quality shavers.  Better than cheap stuff u get at the big box store.  Happy husband face.  Happy wife&#x27;s legs.</li>
    <li> It is a testament to the marketing genius of Gillette, and to a lesser extent Schick, that these are not the best selling razors on the market. Very smooth shave and unlike other razors (both disposables and \\&quot;systems\\&quot; like Mach 3) they don&#x27;t get clogged up with hair. There&#x27;s a reason these things are so highly rated on shaving fanatic sites like Badger and Blade and are often compared favorably to double edged razors. A tip for those having a hard time with nicks: try shaving whilst holding the base of the handle with two or three fingers. This will force you to make light strokes. You can&#x27;t just chop away at your beard with these like you can with a Fusion, they require some finesse.</li>
    <li> Only place to find this type.  They need to bring them back to the stores. Best razor ever used, would not use any other.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m in the camp of those who have ended up slicing their faces to shreds trying to shave with the Bic Metal shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the *idea* of a simple one-blade razor. But in practice, this is really really painful and does not give me as comfortable or as close a shave as a 3-blade Gilette.</li>
    <li> I used these shavers back in the 90&#x27;s but hadn&#x27;t been able to find them in any store for years. They are great but I found that I get a better shave when using gel-type shaving cream. Foamy shaving cream seems too dry. Great value, especially compared to those multi-blade refills. For $10, I&#x27;m set for at least a year.</li>
    <li> ONE BLADE RAZOR.  NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER BIC 2 OR 3 BLADES.  PAINFUL IF NOT CAREFUL. NOT AS LONG LASTING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of disposable and refillable razors in my time and this is without a doubt the best single blade disposable ever made. I personally believe this is because of one little feature that Bic added that was commonplace on vintage Double Edge and Injector razors; the little metal guard bar that smooths down your skin just before the blade passes over it. No other modern razor currently in production implements this simple and effective improvement devised almost 90 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, these are also a fair bit more aggressive than the yellow handle sensitive Bics, probably just a little more aggressive than the original white handle Bics, which means you can actually get a baby butt smooth shave instead of just a presentable shave out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before you jump in and buy these you need to know a couple of things so you can use them to their full potential:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t press down and apply pressure, these are essentially a disposable Injector razor and they will cut you if you press down, try holding further down on the handle to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t try and just make one pass against the grain and call it done. These aren&#x27;t five blade WunderKind razors, so you&#x27;ll have to shave with a minimum of two passes; one with the grain and one against the grain plus touch up. If you do try the one and done ATG pass you&#x27;ll just irritate your skin and cut yourself. Consequently you&#x27;ll end up writing a bad review saying these razors cut you, when the reality is you cut yourself because you don&#x27;t know how to shave. Most of you&#x27;re life you&#x27;ve probably used razors that shave for you, just place on face and pull, these won&#x27;t compensate for your lack of skill with technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Go slow at first until you&#x27;re used to them and then speed up, after a while you&#x27;ll be up to five minute shaves again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow these guidelines and stick with them any shaving problems you previously had like razor bumps or razor burn will disappear, and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with irritation free smooth shaves. Plus you won&#x27;t pay a ridiculous amount of money for razors.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors I have ever used.  I have no idea why they stopped carrying them at my local store.  Multi-blade novelties are for trendy weenies.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, very happy.&lt;br /&gt;These are hard to find and I am glad I found them from your source.&lt;br /&gt;Steve.</li>
    <li> I used to buy and use these razors when they first came out and showed up on the store shelfs.  I would always get a good close shave and never have a problem with them.  Nothing fancy about them, single blade and no moisturizing strip.  Unlike the razors with multi-blades, they don&#x27;t get clogged leaving them useless.  They are inexpensive as compared to some of the razors out there today.  I had sticker shock one day when I was in the store shopping for razors.&lt;br /&gt;Over time I would have a hard time trying to find these in the store, until finally they seemed to disappear completely.  I thought they had stopped making them.  One day I decided to try searching for them on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I saw them.&lt;br /&gt;I am back to using them again and they work just a good now as they did way back when.&lt;br /&gt;As to what type of razor you use and works best depends on your face and beard type.  These may be the best razors you ever tried or the worse.  However for the price they are definitely worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> My favorite shaver, of course i like it. Can&#x27;t find these in stores any more and I suspect they are going to be discontinued. anyway I&#x27;ve stocked up. I don&#x27;t like the multi blade razors.</li>
    <li> Good for shaping my beard. Helps me lining my beard and shaping it. I bought them in a bunch so don&#x27;t need to order more. One razor lasts for at least 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these under his nose and over his mustache... a very tricky, tiny spot to shave.  He prefers these to the battery operated trimmers. They are fairly reasonably priced, so we keep ordering them.</li>
    <li> This razor cut the heck out of me and I ended up throwing them away, disappointing because of all the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reinforced my new Amazon philosophy - &#x27;Whenever buying something you haven&#x27;t used before - no matter how awesome the reviews - buy it in the smallest quantity available.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have my Edwin Jagger for home, but if I have to get on an airplane it&#x27;s the BIC Metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each razor weighs a nothing 4 grams, lasts several shaves, and teamed up with a brushless shave cream like Trader Joes Honey Mango leaves me with a DFS shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a 3 pass shave, with the grain, across the grain and against the grain.  No need to be aggressive with it and cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the nose and around the lips performed better than the orange bic sensitive that oddly left me with a few unappreciated weepers on the second and third shave with the same razor. I think it&#x27;s because the metal&#x27;s a little sharper and cuts nicely instead of \\&quot;tearing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, there is not a better disposable razor to be found.  One blade, a thin metal bar in front, and a small gap between the two so as to not clog up, nothing more is needed.  I mean, honestly, how many more blades are they going to try and cram into the space available?</li>
    <li> i am very happy with the razors. reasonably sharp and last a while. I dry shave typically and the one razor got through most of my face. the second razor did the clean up and it is still sharp enough to continue  to use. Much better than the crappy disposables i bought at Costco. I have only used them once so far. So i might upgrade these razors to 5 star. I think having the two razors makes it a tad more unpleasant, since the first razor holds the whisker and the lower one cuts. Therefore it probably lasts longer because one razor isn&#x27;t doing double duty. The razors seemed plenty sharp, so take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the clean up pass i used a fresh razor and it cut clean with no stubble and close.</li>
    <li> These razor really reduce the amount of ingrown &amp;#34;Pseudofolliculitis barbae&amp;#34;.  I have less itch, ingrown hair and irritation when using this classic razor.  Buying on Amazon is way better than driving all over town trying to find razors.  I would recommend this product, because it is closer shave than a single blade, but not as irritatining as a double.  If you have sensitve skin it is great for shaving and clean shaving bald heads.</li>
    <li> I discovered this razor 20+ years ago in college.  Then the local store stopped carrying them.  I&#x27;ve spent most of my adult life trying to find this razor again.  Finally, I&#x27;ve found it!  Best razors ever.  I get a week or two out of each razor.  Single blade.  Wide area between blade and housing so your beard trimmings don&#x27;t clog up and it&#x27;s always clean and lasts longer.  If you prefer a 7 blade razor, just run this one over your face 7x.  Impossible to find in stores but far and away the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used in 25 years of daily shaving.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com is the only place I can purchase these razors.  I have been using them for at least the past 10 years and recently couldn&#x27;t find them in any chain drugstores or big box shopping icons.  They are simply the best razor i have ever used as they are very precise and above all, cheap to purchase.  I will continue to buy this item from Amazon therefore no longer needing to travel all over the countryside looking for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com for making my life easier!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was a great gift for my father. I had no idea they sold these on Amazon.  BIC makes great products. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used disposable razors on a consistent basis but I did use the Mach3 and other razors marketed for men for several years, owing to their sharpness. Still, not quite close enough for the underarms. Been using this little razor for a week and I think I&#x27;m getting the hang of it. Added 4-5 minutes to my shaving time because I have to go slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewers are right, the blades are very sharp. Whatever its appearance this is definitely sharper than many plastic body razors. Anything other than light pressure on the blade will likely result in nicks and blood. Also advise against overly-emollient creams or oils that could cause this razor to glide along too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the 5-minutes will come off with more practice but I find residual stubble after a fresh shave much more annoying.</li>
    <li> I agree that these are terrific razors, for the right person/facial hair.  Personally, I find these to exceptional at shaving around a beard.  They don&#x27;t clog up like multiple blade razors tend to, and the narrow-profile head makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re shaving off (or not).  From a comfort perspective for a clean-shaven man, I&#x27;d rate these fairly low.  There&#x27;s no lubrication strip and, stroke for stroke, they will not get you as clean as a (for instance) a Mach3.  But, when I have my beard on, this is the only razor I&#x27;ll use.</li>
