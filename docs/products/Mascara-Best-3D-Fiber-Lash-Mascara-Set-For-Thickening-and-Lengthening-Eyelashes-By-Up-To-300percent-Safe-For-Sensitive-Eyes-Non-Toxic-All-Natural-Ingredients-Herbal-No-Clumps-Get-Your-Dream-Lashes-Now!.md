      <li>I have used many mascaras before as I am very much into make up, but I have never seen anything as good as this before.  </li>
      <li>and they aren&#x27;t cute, or easy to get off, without getting rid of the rest of your makeup.</li>

      <li>I was delighted to find out it is easy to apply and comes off easier than regular</li>
      <li>I was excited to try out this product but after using it once, I had fibers in my eyes all day.</li>
      <li>It look really clean with no clumps.</li>
      <li>I noticed mild eye irritation with this product</li>
      <li>but now I can see why it&#x27;s so popular big difference maker really gave my lashes greater volume.</li>
      <li>But the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess or smear when it is removed just a little splash of warm water and boom</li>
      <li>That was super helpful since this was the first time I bought Fiber/Gel mascara.</li>
      <li>This is a very unique mascara that really makes the lashes look very natural.  </li>
      <li>mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very important tip: it is critical to follow the directions exactly as stated.  </li>
      <li>I found this out first hand.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes them look not only longer, but so much fuller and fluffier!</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my short eyelashes with length and volume.  </li>
      <li>I reccommend for any1 who wants fuller lashes!</li>
      <li>Really makes my eyes pop!</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes them look not only longer, but so much fuller and fluffier!</li>
      <li>I totally recommend!  :)</li>
      <li>It really lengthens, lasts, and does not flake!  </li>
      <li>Either way, my lashes really transformed!</li>
      <li>Then you can&#x27;t repeat the process as many times as you want, you can get them really quite big, but make sure you seal the fibers in with a final coat of the gel mascara</li>
      <li>I tried to get good pictures of my lashes, before, after the gel, then after gel, fiber, gel, fiber, gel, but turns out taking a picture of your eye close up is kinda hard, so I&#x27;ll take more next time</li>

      <li>Excuse my language, but before this one, one of my favorite mascaras was a line that rhythms with &amp;#</li>
      <li>I have used everything from Benefit to Yves St Laurent to Urban Decay and other high end brand mascaras and nothing has held up quite as beautifully as Mystere 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.</li>
      <li>It comes in two parts, the gel and the fibers, so you have the ability to make your lashes as clean and casual, or as sensational and bold as you want.</li>
      <li>To give you a little background on myself, I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist who worked for sephora for 5 years, and on my own for an additional 5.</li>
      <li>Now I loved this mascara, it gives the biggest longest lashes I had ever gotten, not wearing fake lashes, but my issue was it was a huge pain in butt to take off</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really 100 % satisfy</li>
      <li>This product really does what it says</li>
      <li>It is a little more work than just putting mascara on but it is worth the little more time when I want fuller lashes.</li>
      <li>; and it was their two part mascara, with the first one being a normal mascara, and the second being a bottle of white fibers you stacked on top.</li>
      <li>Having short eyelashes that stick straight out this product helps actually curve lashes upward so as to open up the eyes more and give a fuller sexier look well worth the price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all the mascaras sephora carries, and then also shop at department stores, ulta, and occasionally a drugstore</li>
      <li>My lashes were full and extremely long.</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy to remove with your usual facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I have Asian lashes...as in poker straight and not too long and full.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not as easy to apply as regular mascara, it can replace the fake lashes that take a lot more of effort.  </li>
      <li>My husband surprised me with this gift</li>
      <li>It takes a lot more effort than regular mascara but less effort than fake lashes and it looks a lot more natural.  </li>
      <li>I like how you can make your lashes look long and natural for anytime or extra long and full for going out at night.  </li>
      <li>There is a learning curve to get it just right, but that just takes a little practice.</li>
      <li>I even included a pic of the current mascaras I&#x27;m using, I normally switch back and forth, or use a combo of two or three, this is my current batch.</li>
      <li>So this 3d fiber mascara is a little tricky to put on at first (</li>
      <li>you first put on a layer of the regular black mascara</li>

    <li> Excellent mascara!  It really lengthens, lasts, and does not flake!  I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really 100 % satisfy</li>
    <li> Just bought this product a few days ago!  I love it! I reccommend for any1 who wants fuller lashes!</li>
    <li> My husband surprised me with this gift and I absolutely loved it..

    <li> This product really does what it says it will do if applied as instructed.  I found using a very light hand to apply both the gel color and the fibers is the best way so it does not clump up.  I have worn artificial eyelashes until recent years and due to the hassle of such I gave up on having full-looking lashes until I read about this product and decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday now that I am retired but when I do leave the house I will definitely use this to enhance the lashes I have.  It is quick and easy to remove with your usual facial cleanser.  Just follow the instructions as this is paramount to the application and incidentally, no eye irritation for me at all.  Try it, I think you will like having full-looking lashes if you are not blessed with them already.</li>
    <li> This mascara is absolutely incredible. I have used everything from Benefit to Yves St Laurent to Urban Decay and other high end brand mascaras and nothing has held up quite as beautifully as Mystere 3D Fiber Lash Mascara. The minute I put this on, it looked like I was wearing fake lashes. My lashes were full and extremely long. This is the perfect mascara to give your eyes an extra pop of glamour. Best of all this did not irritate my contacts and was extremely easy to take off. This is a holy grail makeup product and one I will be sure to repurchase!</li>

    <li> OMG!!! I LOVE this mascara! Makes my eyelashes look way longer and thicker.   It look really clean with no clumps. Comes off super easy too. When I fall asleep with my makeup it doesn&#x27;t smear or get messy like regular mascara. I totally recommend!  :)</li>

    <li> This is an excellent product!  I have used many mascaras before as I am very much into make up, but I have never seen anything as good as this before.  I put this mascara on before going out with some friends and they all thought I had falsies on!  I was delighted to find out it is easy to apply and comes off easier than regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very important tip: it is critical to follow the directions exactly as stated.  Otherwise it will not work properly.  I found this out first hand.</li>
    <li> Great mascara but takes a little getting used to applying because it is a 2 part mascara. The seller was awesome and sent an email on how to apply it, including tips. That was super helpful since this was the first time I bought Fiber/Gel mascara. If I didn&#x27;t recieve the email I would have been confused on how to use it. The mascara will dramatize your lashes with a nice volume and length. I recommend it. Customer service is great too!</li>
    <li> Easy to use love my lashes again!!</li>
    <li> Mystere 3D Fiber Lash Mascara&#x27;s effects are Stunning, Gorgeous, and Elegant!!  If you are looking for a mascara that has dramatic, yet tasteful, results this is SO worth the price.  My lashes looked full and beautiful, without being clumpy and chunky like the cheaper mascaras.  It comes in two parts, the gel and the fibers, so you have the ability to make your lashes as clean and casual, or as sensational and bold as you want. This mascara gives you the capacity for Movie Star lashes!  So excited to wear this casual, day to day, as well as to upcoming events, weddings and partys.  OH- and the best part is that is comes off super easy with warm water or make-up remover cloth!</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve to get it just right, but that just takes a little practice.</li>
    <li> Works great .need to practice first</li>
    <li> First time using Mystere and i am really impressed. Love the way it makes my short eyelashes with length and volume.  It&#x27;s  quick and easy to use, i will be repurchasing!!  :)</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve tried 100s of mascaras and none of them where as easy to use or as effective as this one. My eyelashes look amazing and it lasts all day plus some! But the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess or smear when it is removed just a little splash of warm water and boom the mascara comes of with ease and no makeup stains on your cheeks. Bottom line Five stars and I will never use any other brand.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!! Really makes my eyes pop!</li>
    <li> I noticed mild eye irritation with this product but I still love this stuff and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try out this product but after using it once, I had fibers in my eyes all day. Felt very uncomfortable! This morning I woke up with both of my eyes swollen. This product is going in the trash! I would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Having short eyelashes that stick straight out this product helps actually curve lashes upward so as to open up the eyes more and give a fuller sexier look well worth the price&lt;br /&gt;Who need falsies when you have this!</li>
    <li> Best Mascara ever!!!! I&#x27;m getting compliments on my eyelashes all the time since using this product.  Definitely purchasing again and getting all mt friends to use it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the flakes all over my skin and cheeks.  Gave it away to a friend.</li>
