      <li>Also perfect for people healing a piercing and needing a cut or color.</li>

      <li>All in all, a very good product.  </li>
      <li>Brilliant idea</li>
      <li>Good buy!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>They work great -</li>
      <li>Great concept though.</li>
      <li>The ear caps are a great idea  - i get water in my ears when I get a shower.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them and they work great.</li>
      <li>These are great.  </li>
      <li>I am a satisfied client with this awesome purchase.</li>
      <li>On time and perfect for ear no discomfort :-)</li>
      <li>Theses seem like a good product, but they didn&#x27;t work for my need.</li>
      <li>and you should still be good to go.</li>
      <li>so I needed something to good to cover them.  </li>
      <li>I thought these were a really good idea, but they didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.  </li>
      <li>Good product, good pricing....great for the shower with &amp;#34;in</li>
      <li>Great product, could not be happier and satisfied.</li>
      <li>and yes, it got a bit warm after awhile because of the chemical heating up under the cap.  </li>
      <li>It needs to have a better elastic band.  </li>
      <li>Wish they were more then one time use.</li>
      <li>Still better than a shower</li>
      <li>Would like to exchange for better quality, Will be returning.</li>
      <li>I had better luck having my husband wash my hair over a sink, while I held a Tupperwear plastic child&#x27;s cup over my ear.  </li>
      <li>My clients are going to like me even more.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>I gave them 4 stars because the elastic is not quite as strong as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>But within a minute of wearing them under a strong stream of water or when I shampood my hair, the \\&quot;caps\\&quot; would come off from the water stream or my hands rubbing the shampoo in my scalp.</li>
      <li>Came with a nice note on my invoice and pretty packaging.</li>
      <li>But, maybe if watertight is not what you need, they would work fine.  </li>
      <li>These might be fine for doing color on your hair to protect your ears.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re huge</li>
      <li>They get sprayed and my ears stay free of hairspray.</li>
      <li>Good for coloring your hair especially if you use henna.</li>
      <li>they are soft and pliable and fit easily under a plastic cap or dryer hood.</li>
      <li>These are great, they are like little shower caps for your ears.  </li>
      <li>If you look at my other reviews you&#x27;ll find that I rarely take the time to post good reviews because if the product performs as advertised then I&#x27;m happy with its previous ratings.</li>
      <li>I liked that they were elastic enough to keep them, but not binding at all.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t keep water out of the ears even with the use of cotton balls and then the Clear Silicon Ear Cover on top.  </li>
      <li>This will only fit men with huge ears.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re in a similar situation to me and looking to use these, know that they can be made a lot more useful by rolling some cotton into your ears/using earplugs along with them, and even if you want, some paper medical tape to be sure.</li>
      <li>the ear canal&amp;#34; Lyric hearing aids.</li>
      <li>Worth it to spend a few bucks to avoid that kind of pain.</li>
      <li>However,  they smelled really bad--an overpowering mothball smell.  </li>
      <li>They do the job very well for me and would work for anyone who needs water protection for the ear.  </li>
      <li>which really doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stay on the ears very well.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of earrings and it is too much of a bother to take them all out before I go to the salon.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak as to whether they work for their original purpose, only for how I used them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Recommend them highly.</li>
      <li>I bought the product to protect my daughter&#x27;s heat sensitive ear lobes from the intense heat of the hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>You can reuse them so these will last a long time which makes the price even better.  </li>
      <li>I love these little ear protector caps!  </li>
      <li>I keep my hair short and spent a whole lot of my life having to clean my ears after spraying my hair.  </li>
      <li>They product didn&#x27;t work for my 10 year old daughter for that.</li>
      <li>These really help to keep the ear dry (for extra protection, put a cotton ball in your ear first and seal the edges with vaseline, then put the ear protector over that).</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really loose, so your ears are pretty unprotected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing these every day for the past year and my ears have been fine.</li>
      <li>These are a life-saver if you absolutely must keep your ears dry.</li>
      <li>So apparently this is a beauty product, not a &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; one?</li>

<li> These are a life-saver if you absolutely must keep your ears dry.</li>
<li> So apparently this is a beauty product, not a &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; one?</li>
<li> They are very large and not effective at all.</li>
<li> They are not tight enough around the edges and are not very secure.</li>
<li> I only take the time to alert fellow shoppers when I find a product does NOT live up to the description</li>
<li> With bleaching, I also used Diane&#x27;s clear plastic processing shower caps to contain the mess</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had them on for as long as 3 hours</li>
<li> but it stretched out the elastic</li>
<li> I actually had to take them off &amp; empty the water out of them.</li>
<li> They are too loose, and one of the bags had a hole in it.  </li>
<li> They are way too loose.</li>
<li> and they performed exactly as I expected them to do.  </li>
<li> I could not get my ear wet after surgery, which presents a problem when you need to wash your hair.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t found any other ear cover with which to compare.  </li>
<li> And well, they&#x27;re definitely not for that kinda purpose, unfortunately - the band is not elastic enough to actually tighten around your ears at any point.</li>
<li> other reviewers&#x27; gave it.</li>
<li> so I read reviews from other people about these protectors and decided to give them a try.  </li>
<li> The result was that I DID get water in my ear, inspite of other reviewers&#x27; claims to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> did not stay on my ear so was not useful.</li>
<li> These are great, I got a really bad ear infection last year and it was horrible, I don&#x27;t go anywhere near water except in the shower.</li>
<li> Quality is not very good.the elastic band is of poor construction and in some places it is not stitched properly</li>
<li> (They can also be used to keep water from going in the ears of the little ones)</li>
<li> waste of time..buy ear wax.  </li>
<li> No more crying and complains, now she read or play on her DSI LX, instead.  </li>
<li> These little ear caps are quite nifty!  </li>
<li> Put &#x27;em on and put a small strip or two over the edges/onto your face</li>
<li> elastic too weak.</li>
<li> Not happy with product.  </li>
<li> and they&#x27;re certainly not ideal for me, they&#x27;re still helpful.</li>
<li> useless.</li>
<li> Sorry about the 2-stars</li>
<li> They didn&#x27;t stay over my ears when using them, thus rendering them useless.</li>
<li> /&gt;However that doesn&#x27;t make them useless.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars because, while I got the wrong thing for this situation</li>
<li> That helped with the bad odor</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gives me an extra bit of protection following a stapedectomy. I use the Vaseline coated cotton ball in the ear during a shower. These have worked well as an additional layer of protection.</li>
    <li> I bought these ear protectors to keep water from getting in my ear canals as I am prone to ear infections.They are not tight enough around the edges and are not very secure.They don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Yes they work wonders when hair perming or coloring.</li>
    <li> very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> These little ear caps are quite nifty!  I use them when I die my hair with Henna and they work perfectly!  My ears stay the same color as my skin and not my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could probably serve an alternate purpose as a cover for a soda can- to keep bees out.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stay on the ears, just keep falling off which really doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
    <li> it does not fit as much as I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> Quality is not very good.the elastic band is of poor construction and in some places it is not stitched properly</li>
    <li> I should have known that water can just zip through anything and everything.</li>
    <li> I bought the product to protect my daughter&#x27;s heat sensitive ear lobes from the intense heat of the hair dryer.  No more crying and complains, now she read or play on her DSI LX, instead.  Great product, could not be happier and satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am a satisfied client with this awesome purchase. My clients are going to like me even more. Thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of earrings and it is too much of a bother to take them all out before I go to the salon.  These are great, they are like little shower caps for your ears.  I never will get an earring yanked on while getting my hair cut and colored.  I even rinse them off and use the again.  Brilliant idea and I&#x27;m stunned salons don&#x27;t have these.  Also perfect for people healing a piercing and needing a cut or color.</li>
    <li> Finally, I found something to protect my ears when I spray my hair.  I keep my hair short and spent a whole lot of my life having to clean my ears after spraying my hair.  These are great.  They get sprayed and my ears stay free of hairspray.</li>
    <li> These ear protectors do not work at all. They don&#x27;t keep water out of the ears even with the use of cotton balls and then the Clear Silicon Ear Cover on top.  I WOULD LIKE A REFUND FOR THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> useless. does not stay around the ears. elastic too weak.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay on the ears very well.  They are too loose, and one of the bags had a hole in it.  It needs to have a better elastic band.  They&#x27;re huge so you have to hold them against your ear, which is pretty pointless.  Not happy with product.  Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Came with a nice note on my invoice and pretty packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife to try to keep water out of her ears when she showers.  They are very large and not effective at all.</li>
    <li> I thought these were a really good idea, but they didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.  They are not watertight - which you often need after an ear operation.  I had better luck having my husband wash my hair over a sink, while I held a Tupperwear plastic child&#x27;s cup over my ear.  But, maybe if watertight is not what you need, they would work fine.  I would augment these covers with a cotton ball dipped in vaseline, inserted into the ear canal.</li>
    <li> These ear protector caps are used for perms and hair coloring.  They work great - they are soft and pliable and fit easily under a plastic cap or dryer hood. (They can also be used to keep water from going in the ears of the little ones)</li>
    <li> These are great, I got a really bad ear infection last year and it was horrible, I don&#x27;t go anywhere near water except in the shower. I&#x27;ve been wearing these every day for the past year and my ears have been fine. Worth it to spend a few bucks to avoid that kind of pain.</li>
    <li> I recently had a surgical procedure called  tympanoplasty to repair a ruptured eardrum. I could not get my ear wet after surgery, which presents a problem when you need to wash your hair. These really help to keep the ear dry (for extra protection, put a cotton ball in your ear first and seal the edges with vaseline, then put the ear protector over that). Great product.</li>
    <li> It works. Covers the ears. That&#x27;s all it needs to do.</li>
    <li> I love these. I use them with I color my hair with henna. I have washed then out and used them&lt;br /&gt;more then once. Will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand getting water in my ears when taking a shower.  Tried ear plugs but they weren&#x27;t working.  If only I could find something that went over my ear instead of in it and that&#x27;s when I foundthese ear protector caps.  I&#x27;ve used them and they work great.</li>
    <li> Work well when my daughter had a ruptured ear drum.</li>
    <li> The ear protectors arrived on time.  However,  they smelled really bad--an overpowering mothball smell.  There was no way I was putting them on my ears. So I washed them all in soapy water twice.  That helped with the bad odor but it stretched out the elastic so they didn&#x27;t stay on my ears as well as they should have.</li>
    <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> I wear an inside the ear hearing aid and these are needed to protect it when I wash my hair.  They do the job very well for me and would work for anyone who needs water protection for the ear.  I don&#x27;t think they would heat-protect, though.</li>
    <li> The ear caps are a great idea  - i get water in my ears when I get a shower.  However, the caps were way too big and would not stay snug on my ears.</li>
    <li> Sorry about the 2-stars but with several 5-star reviews for using these \\&quot;caps\\&quot; in the shower I felt compelled to alert future buyers that these caps did NOT work in my showering experience. I bought two of these packages of 24 caps each. Not a big investment at $6 each. These caps WILL cover your ears perfectly when used for coloring hair etc. But within a minute of wearing them under a strong stream of water or when I shampood my hair, the \\&quot;caps\\&quot; would come off from the water stream or my hands rubbing the shampoo in my scalp. The result was that I DID get water in my ear, inspite of other reviewers&#x27; claims to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I buy oodles of things on Amazon each week. Several $1,000s a year. If you look at my other reviews you&#x27;ll find that I rarely take the time to post good reviews because if the product performs as advertised then I&#x27;m happy with its previous ratings. I only take the time to alert fellow shoppers when I find a product does NOT live up to the description other reviewers&#x27; gave it.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay on...I have to hold them and try to shampoo.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep water from getting in ears at all. They are way too loose. I actually had to take them off &amp; empty the water out of them.</li>
    <li> They do keep water out of the ear.  Wish they were more then one time use. If you need to keep the water out, this is your product! Recommend them highly. Haven&#x27;t found any other ear cover with which to compare.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Use these with the silicone gel type plugs, keeps water out when showering or jogging in the pool, cannot dip your head under water of course but protective of the ear.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my elderly mother who hates getting water in her ears when she get showers.  She lovers them and uses each pair several times before replacing them.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy. Wish I would have ordered stronger ones. Would like to exchange for better quality, Will be returning.</li>
    <li> I love these little ear protector caps!  I have used them for processing hair with bleach, toners, and hair coloring products.  With bleaching, I also used Diane&#x27;s clear plastic processing shower caps to contain the mess and yes, it got a bit warm after awhile because of the chemical heating up under the cap.  I simply popped the plastic shower cap back up so that my ears were not always under the plastic shower cap. Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t reuse them simply because I do not want any chemicals left in them for the next time, and they are inexpensively priced.  I liked that they were elastic enough to keep them, but not binding at all. I&#x27;ve had them on for as long as 3 hours and they performed exactly as I expected them to do.  I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t left them on while shampooing or rinsing the product off in the shower, so can&#x27;t comment on their &amp;#34;water proofing&amp;#34; quality as some reviewers have mentioned, but I can see where they would work well for this purpose if used under a shower cap.</li>
    <li> very good and right,,,good price</li>
    <li> These might be fine for doing color on your hair to protect your ears.  Don&#x27;t even think about using them to keep water out of your ears when washing your hair.  They will not work for that.</li>
    <li> me gusta el producto muy bueno, es un excelente producto que acabo de comprar. y me llego a tiempo. lo esperaba</li>
    <li> Theses seem like a good product, but they didn&#x27;t work for my need. I saw in the reviews that they had been used to keep water out of your ear during a shower after ear surgery. They product didn&#x27;t work for my 10 year old daughter for that.</li>
    <li> Wish I could return these, a bit pricey for $5 a pair. They didn&#x27;t stay over my ears when using them, thus rendering them useless. Great concept though.</li>
    <li> On time and perfect for ear no discomfort :-)</li>
    <li> This is way too big for my ear. This will only fit men with huge ears.</li>
    <li> did not stay on my ear so was not useful.</li>
    <li> waste of time..buy ear wax.  they do not keep water out of my ears and they fall off in the shower.</li>
    <li> So apparently this is a beauty product, not a &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; one? Well, I got it because I just had ear surgery and I can&#x27;t get water in my ears, and don&#x27;t want to wear a shower cap. I can&#x27;t speak as to whether they work for their original purpose, only for how I used them. And well, they&#x27;re definitely not for that kinda purpose, unfortunately - the band is not elastic enough to actually tighten around your ears at any point. They&#x27;re really loose, so your ears are pretty unprotected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However that doesn&#x27;t make them useless. So if you&#x27;re in a similar situation to me and looking to use these, know that they can be made a lot more useful by rolling some cotton into your ears/using earplugs along with them, and even if you want, some paper medical tape to be sure. Put &#x27;em on and put a small strip or two over the edges/onto your face and you should still be good to go. Still better than a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars because, while I got the wrong thing for this situation and they&#x27;re certainly not ideal for me, they&#x27;re still helpful. But yeah, this is not for keeping water out of your ears. Heads up to future buyers.</li>
    <li> Actually worked! Good product, good pricing....great for the shower with &amp;#34;in the ear canal&amp;#34; Lyric hearing aids.</li>
    <li> These are a life-saver if you absolutely must keep your ears dry. A cotton ball soaked in petroleum jelly doubles the safety value after surgery or when you have a perforated ear drum. I gave them 4 stars because the elastic is not quite as strong as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I can&#x27;t stand to have water in my ears when I take a shower/wash my hair so I needed something to good to cover them.  I tried ear plugs but that didn&#x27;t work so I read reviews from other people about these protectors and decided to give them a try.  All in all, a very good product.  I no longer have water in my ears and they do stay and you get a lot in the package.  You can reuse them so these will last a long time which makes the price even better.  I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good for coloring your hair especially if you use henna. Also for not getting water in your ears when showering or washing hair.</li>
