### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is awesome but just not this product.</li>
      <li>Great product, but a bit pricey!  </li>
      <li>THIS WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, PERIOD!!!!!</li>
      <li>Best hive anti-itch cream</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Its a great product to toss into your purse.</li>
      <li>It reduces itching quite effectively.</li>
      <li>It&#x60;s very small,l use it very good .</li>
      <li>Our favorite thing for removing the sting and itch from mosquito bites.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s bees bug bite remedy works better and faster than anything I have ever used .</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it also.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, their Chapstick is my go-to lip product but this bug bite relief doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
      <li>That relieved it a lot more than the Burt&#x27;s Bees product had to this point.</li>
      <li>Kills the itch every time :)</li>
      <li>but this one is so potent I had to wipe it off for fear of offending people around me.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off rubbing some lime on the bite, trust.</li>
      <li>Good product and just the right size to take</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seureounde comes to using just a very satisfied feeling is rather hard, I kind product, except it is very very good.</li>
      <li>It smells like citronella, which is not bad, but that&#x27;s more for preventing mosquito attraction than healing once you&#x27;ve been bitten.  </li>
      <li>This Bug Bite Relief is a great product, and like all the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, it works.</li>
      <li>I love this as a natural alternative to benadryl or cortisone</li>
      <li>Products now accustomed unique flavor was very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>To be fair, OTC hydrocortisone has not helped with previous bites either; sigh....</li>
      <li>does exactly that.</li>
      <li>I am one of those people who gets more mosquito bites than most, and swells up big with itchy bites that last a week.  </li>
      <li>If you have similar problems, I recommend the Desert Essence relief spray, which you can put on as many times during the day as you want, and it provides a cooling relief.</li>
      <li>It stopped the itching feeling at the moment, but it makes the bite more swollen later on.</li>
      <li>It works, but also smells funny.</li>
      <li>but apparently theres nothing fantastic yet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other &amp;#34;itch remedies&amp;#34; but the Burt&#x27;s Bees product appears to work immediately.</li>
      <li>For those of you in the same situation, Ammonia based products (such as AfterBite) seem to be a better bet</li>
      <li>actually one of those lucky people who either does not get bit, or does not itch.</li>
      <li>My son very love it ,but it&#x60;s very small .</li>
      <li>Since I live alone, I had no one to check it for me.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this being extremely satisfied with the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products (such as their sunburn cream)</li>
      <li>My girlfriend however is the exact opposite!</li>
      <li>The stick is rather dry and doesn&#x27;t go on big bite easily.</li>
      <li>I like it&#x27;s 100 percent natural</li>
      <li>Was bitten by something after mowing grass early this morning.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for natural products for bug bites that work.</li>
      <li>Mosquito bites really irritate my granddaughter and I; we always end up bitten and with big bumps and this bug bite relief</li>
      <li>I love their other products but highly do not recommend this one.</li>
      <li>, I know some natural products have a different smell</li>
      <li>First Burt&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve purchased that has let me down.  </li>

<li> I love their other products but highly do not recommend this one.</li>
<li> , I know some natural products have a different smell</li>
<li> First Burt&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve purchased that has let me down.  </li>
<li> I am extremely bothered by bug bites, especially mosquito bites.  </li>
<li> the glow is to some extent dry.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s the only reason for the bump down to 4 stars.</li>
<li> No more wondering if you&#x27;ve got enough ointment on a bite.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t like how expensive it is though and kind of difficult to find.</li>
<li> Convenient,  easy to use sick.  </li>
<li> This thing worked wonders for us and our son (who used to get huge, painful welts from every bite).</li>
<li> This seems to work to stop the itch and make the swelling go down faster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This beats Benadryl and Cortisone hands down for us.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The first thing I noticed is it STINKS</li>
<li> The consistency is a gel stick type formula that is dry and hard to apply.</li>
<li> It gave little to no relief.  </li>
<li> A waste.</li>
<li> Healing time is cut in half if not more.</li>
<li> Not easy to use.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m not sure if it helps to relief the bug bites.</li>
<li> so having to press down to try to get the hard stick material to rub off onto my bite was not good.    </li>
<li> Had the unfortunate excuse to use it the day it arrived.</li>
<li> I hated giving this two stars because I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and any all-natural product, but it was totally ineffective with some bug bites I got (from the hospital, yikes!)</li>
<li> The product is very dry and very difficult to apply.</li>
<li> So, i&#x27;ve bought an assortment of anti-itch remedies in an attempt to reduce the uncomfortable swelling.</li>
<li> I also found that rubbing the stick on the bite was uncomfortable--my bites are so bad that even wind on them or the slightest touch is irritating--</li>
<li> and I am still itching like crazy.</li>
<li> No more annoying, scratching bug bites!  </li>
<li> I would itch so badly that I would scratch the bite until I drew blood.  </li>
<li> The drive home was terrible.  </li>

    <li> Products now accustomed unique flavor was very good.&lt;br /&gt;Seureounde comes to using just a very satisfied feeling is rather hard, I kind product, except it is very very good.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been tortured by gnats and mosquitoes all summer. This thing worked wonders for us and our son (who used to get huge, painful welts from every bite). IT&#x27;s great and I&#x27;ll use it again and again.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Had no relief at all. Pricy for something that doesn&#x27;t work at all. You&#x27;re better off rubbing some lime on the bite, trust.</li>
    <li> I love their other products but highly do not recommend this one. The stick is rather dry and doesn&#x27;t go on big bite easily. There is no relief once applied. A waste.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who gets more mosquito bites than most, and swells up big with itchy bites that last a week.  This relief stick did nothing for me.  It smells like citronella, which is not bad, but that&#x27;s more for preventing mosquito attraction than healing once you&#x27;ve been bitten.  I also found that rubbing the stick on the bite was uncomfortable--my bites are so bad that even wind on them or the slightest touch is irritating-- so having to press down to try to get the hard stick material to rub off onto my bite was not good.    If you have similar problems, I recommend the Desert Essence relief spray, which you can put on as many times during the day as you want, and it provides a cooling relief.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite like it. It stopped the itching feeling at the moment, but it makes the bite more swollen later on. The bite will last for 3 - 4 days instead of 1 -2 days if I don&#x27;t use anything.</li>
    <li> It works, but also smells funny.</li>
    <li> the glow is to some extent dry. Not easy to use.</li>
    <li> Mosquito bites really irritate my granddaughter and I; we always end up bitten and with big bumps and this bug bite relief does exactly that. It relieves the bug bites.  Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> The product is very dry and very difficult to apply. i&#x27;m not sure if it helps to relief the bug bites.</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s 100 percent natural so I used it for my daughter often when she has bug bites.  It reduces itching quite effectively.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, their Chapstick is my go-to lip product but this bug bite relief doesn&#x27;t do the job. The first thing I noticed is it STINKS, I know some natural products have a different smell but this one is so potent I had to wipe it off for fear of offending people around me. The consistency is a gel stick type formula that is dry and hard to apply. Burt&#x27;s Bees is awesome but just not this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The entire family loves it!  No more annoying, scratching bug bites!  It takes that all away.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for natural products for bug bites that work. This one takes not only the itch away, but the bite itself. Healing time is cut in half if not more.</li>
    <li> I hated giving this two stars because I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and any all-natural product, but it was totally ineffective with some bug bites I got (from the hospital, yikes!) It has been days and I am still itching like crazy. To be fair, OTC hydrocortisone has not helped with previous bites either; sigh....</li>
    <li> Our favorite thing for removing the sting and itch from mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Great product, but a bit pricey!  That&#x27;s the only reason for the bump down to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> First Burt&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve purchased that has let me down.  I got a bee sting on the back on my neck while in a grocery store.  When I tried to wave it away it also stung my hand.  I carried the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Outdoor Bug Relief in my purse and put in on as soon as I got to my car. The drive home was terrible.  When I got home I placed ice on it.  Since I live alone, I had no one to check it for me.  So after the ice, I but the Burt Bees products on again.  It gave little to no relief.  After work the next day I asked a friend to stop by so that she could look at it.  At this point it was swollen with the stinger still in tack.  She removed the stinger, put ice on is, went on the computer and was told to put toothpaste on it. That relieved it a lot more than the Burt&#x27;s Bees product had to this point.</li>
    <li> This seems to work to stop the itch and make the swelling go down faster.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is the peppermint in it. Good product and just the right size to take&lt;br /&gt;with you.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s very small,l use it very good . My son very love it ,but it&#x60;s very small . l&#x60;ll go back again.</li>
    <li> It works! Its a great product to toss into your purse. I love this as a natural alternative to benadryl or cortisone</li>
    <li> Best hive anti-itch cream/stick out there. My son and I get hives from nervous reactions and such. This beats Benadryl and Cortisone hands down for us.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how expensive it is though and kind of difficult to find.</li>
    <li> ummm. kinda works, helps, and the kids seem to like it, and i don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m putting poisonous something on my, or my kids body to heal something</li>
    <li> I am extremely bothered by bug bites, especially mosquito bites.  I would itch so badly that I would scratch the bite until I drew blood.  I&#x27;ve tried many other &amp;#34;itch remedies&amp;#34; but the Burt&#x27;s Bees product appears to work immediately.</li>
    <li> Had the unfortunate excuse to use it the day it arrived. Was bitten by something after mowing grass early this morning. It provided relief from itching. I love the smell of it also.</li>
    <li> Kills the itch every time :)</li>
    <li> This Bug Bite Relief is a great product, and like all the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, it works. I also recommend Res-Q Ointment.</li>
    <li> Convenient,  easy to use sick.  No more wondering if you&#x27;ve got enough ointment on a bite.</li>
    <li> earlier review was incorrect...wrong product</li>
    <li> So im actually one of those lucky people who either does not get bit, or does not itch. My girlfriend however is the exact opposite! Unfortunately \\&quot;hanging out\\&quot; outside means she inevitably comes home looking like she&#x27;s been attacked by cats with BB guns and proceeds to itch the top layer of skin off any bug bite. So, i&#x27;ve bought an assortment of anti-itch remedies in an attempt to reduce the uncomfortable swelling. I had high hopes for this being extremely satisfied with the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products (such as their sunburn cream) but this one fell short. It does not work at all she says, no relief whatsoever even with multiple applications. For those of you in the same situation, Ammonia based products (such as AfterBite) seem to be a better bet but apparently theres nothing fantastic yet.</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, PERIOD!!!!!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s bees bug bite remedy works better and faster than anything I have ever used . I don&#x27;t leave the house without it .</li>
