<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> WOW!!! i orderd mine from uniwigs :) its beautiful and i even got a loop brush as a free gift i will post a pic after its installed. its so soft and natural looking even in this length im sure 3 bundles will be enough and im doing a leave out .. btw i ordered on april 9th and just got it today april 13th :) and amazon said it would come on april 22nd and so i asked the seller if they could ship faster and they did</li>
    <li> This hair is fabulous!!!!! Thank you Mr. Ben...its coming from china so expedite the delivery.</li>
    <li> Such a rip off! I think these people pay persons to write good reviews. Because of these people seriously double I&#x27;ll buy anything else on here. Received 4 small n short bundles of hair. Nothing like the pics I saw persons posted.</li>
    <li> The bundles of hair that I ordered were supposed to be 20, 22, and 24 inches. I placed a double order. None of the bundles were labeled but they appear to be 14, 16, and 18 inches at the longest. I made a hair appointment prior to my order being delivered and I didn&#x27;t have a plan B so unfortunately I had to go ahead with the install. Besides the fact that I&#x27;m unsatisfied with the length and the fact that the bundles were not labeled, the ends are untamed and extremely thin. I &#x27;m on day two of my install and the hair sheds a great deal. I have 4 bundles installed. On a positive note the hair does not have an unpleasant smell and it curls very nicely.</li>
    <li> Is it enough for a full head?</li>
    <li> The hair was good. It curled great, the only thing was the ends were weird looking and it shedds sooooo much</li>
    <li> The hair is great, came as described and on schedule, I recommend buyers who would want to get this hair to go ahead. U won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Very dissappointed . The bundles were very thin.  I expected too much and got very little</li>
    <li> Hair was soft and thick. Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with the hair. Quick shipping, came as it was and last but not least will be ordering again very soon for my mother!!!!</li>
    <li> The hair texture looked nice but it was nothing like the display picture. The bundles I received were very very thin, not enough for a full head. Other than that the shipping was fast. Overall I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever order hair from this company again.</li>
    <li> Horrible hair sheds like crazy! So disappointed</li>
    <li> The hair is so thin and short. It is not 20,22,24 as showed on the picture. It feels like each bundle is only 50g. I ordered 2 packs for my sister and I but I think I am going to use all 6 bundles for a full head. It sheds and tangles so bad. This is the worst hair ever. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected! Could have went to the local hair store and purchased.a lot of loose hair tangled quick.not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Do Not Purchase this hair. It is no where near 300 grams and the seller will not return messages in regards to this problem. The hair sheds entirely to much and it smells terrible. Save your money and choose someone better, because this is a waist of time and money. I will never purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> So far I love the hair! Very to no shedding. Havent installed it yet but I have washed it and so far its great! Wave stayed with the hair thru the wash, will give update after installation. And shipping was very fast, received within 2 days. Thanks!</li>
    <li> this hair sheds and it thins out from root to tip. also the color was a very light brown color which I was not expecting , I had to dye it. like very damage weak human hair, it brakes so beware .</li>
    <li> The hair looks great in the package. I liked it the first few days in my hair. But there is on major problem this hair sheds like crazy. Not good quality hair at all.</li>
    <li> Product shipped fast, hair quality was great. minimal shedding, not true to length. The longest which was a 24 inch was more like an 18 inch. blends very well not too much tangle.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the hair. Great quality. True to length. The only problem I have is the bundles are a  little small. I haven&#x27;t installed it yet but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to be enough for a whole head.</li>
    <li> Love the hair...will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> my hair was shipped, very soft I love it little shade in and I was able to color it....</li>
    <li> This hair was NOT the GRADE AAAAAAAA hair as promised....&lt;br /&gt;It arrived pretty fast and i was very excited when i opened the packages... i did notice a kinda funny smell only on one bundle thou.&lt;br /&gt;i had to dye the hair as i wear my own hair jet or blue black. THE HAIR DID NOT and STILL WILL NOT TAKE THE HAIR DYE (Sadtown) it did get a shade darker. Overall it tangles very easy and just isnt what was promised. That being said.... if ur tight on cash ,your not going to wear the hair for it for a long time or you simply dont mind having to drag your fingers thru the hair a million times a day.  I give this hair a C....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get all the hair and it wasn&#x27;t the they said it would be Dont buy this</li>
    <li> With all the bad reviews, I have to rewrite a good review?  Ok! The hair is Ok</li>
    <li> This hair was sooo soft and silky, i couldnt believe it, you can use heat on it and dye it too! i loveeeee this hair</li>
    <li> The hair is very good its as it was describred, the quality is very good. I will surely buy from you soon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Satisfied customer best hair I ever buy online very nice am so inlove with it arrive earlier than I expected I will be buying again thank u</li>
    <li> If I could give this a 0 star rating, I would. I never do reviews but I feel like this needs to be said. I have never received such poor quality product  than I have ordering this and I order hair online quite often and have NO problems. The hair is very thin and it is not 24 inches, it&#x27;s more like 16. Also, it looks like this hair is not even new. It wears as if it&#x27;s about a month and a half old. If there is anyway to get my money back, I would in a heartbeat. Definitely not worth the money and whoever is selling this product should really try and find new product to sell or stop selling altogether.</li>
    <li> when I took it out the package I thought it was amazing. Washed it because of the smell &amp; curl pattern never came back. Let air dry &amp; hair was frizzy &amp; tangled terribly. Tried to straighten &amp; it just looked like cheap synthetic hair. Going to do my best with it until Friday &amp; then I&#x27;m going to take hair out &amp;I put it in the trash. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This hair is very thin at the ends it sheds Easley and tangles often.</li>
    <li> did not like it at all was a waist of money would never buy again</li>
    <li> Love the hair it look natural and I had a great experience with the seller will buy more in the future</li>
    <li> Perhaps not the wore ever, but definitely had to give this a bleach bath and condition before install. Client complained about the hair sticking together and tangling. Hair is very thin but is long, Had to cut off about 3 inches as the ends were super thin and useless. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> This is some good hair !!!!😍😍😍 I promise you it&#x27;s worth the money because I absolutely love this hair 🙌🏽 I got my hair July 2 &amp; I put it in July 3 &amp; it&#x27;s currently in my head now😍😍 i got so many complaints on it .</li>
    <li> Received hair quicker than expected.  Gorgeous hair!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Its soft to the touch &amp; no shedding so far.. but it does have a funny smell to it.</li>
    <li> Love this hair washed 3times dyed 2 times and hair is still in great condition love love love about to reorder</li>
    <li> This hair sucked ass I will never buy again it tangels it sheds like crazy worst hair I ever purchased in my life I give this hair no starts and 3 thumbs down... booooooo</li>
    <li> I received my hair and am so excited about styling it for my wedding. Thank you Amazon...:-)</li>
    <li> So soft an bouncey i love it i haven&#x27;t installed it yet</li>
    <li> The hair looked beautiful when it was recd. My only problem was it was differnt lenghs within the bundles but I was going to make due. I went to my hair stylist to hve it striked to blend with my hair and the hair started shedding like crazy and the texture changed big time. The hair became more course and hard to mange. I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product and wouldn&#x27;t order more hair in the future. I emd up buying more hair because it was being installed for my wedding on 7.11.2015. Thanks and God bless. Good luck shopping...</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews...&lt;br /&gt;1- Very very very thin!!!&lt;br /&gt;2- I had to leave a lot of my hair out to give it volume.&lt;br /&gt;3- Horrible quality.&lt;br /&gt;4 - Sheds.&lt;br /&gt;5- I basically got what I paid for... cheap! so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;6- First and LAST time.</li>
    <li> ok if you only plan on wearing this hair for a week or two. Otherwise spend a little more money and get quality.</li>
    <li> This Hair Is Absolutely Gorgeous!!!!!! My First Time Ordering From Here &amp;&amp; Its Beautiful. The Lengths Are Long I Got 20,22 &amp;&amp; 24. It Has Minimum Shedding , Hair Curls Easily , I Highly Reccommend This Hair!!!!!! Very Impressed</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I received the hair. I know you get what you pay for but this was horrible. I guess I should&#x27;ve threw in another $5 to pay for the truth😒 The hair was soft, but extremely thin. It came with 3 bundles, but because of how thin they are, I have to order 3 more from somewhere else. PLEASE do not expect thick full bundles as advertised in the picture, it&#x27;s very far from it.</li>
    <li> I AM SOOOOO IMPRESSED BY THIS HAIR FIRST OF ALL IT CAME SUPER QUICK NEXT THIS HAIR IS DEFIANTLY IN THE&lt;br /&gt;SAME GROUP WITH THE 200-300$ HAIR ITS SOFT SILKY, TRUE TO LENGTH, MOST OF ALL IT DOESNT SHEDD ALL OVER&lt;br /&gt;WHICH IS A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME... I HAD THIS IN FOR 2 MONTHS (WHICH IS LONG FOR ME) IM SERIOUS GUYS IM&lt;br /&gt;A BELIEVER.</li>
    <li> So far I Iove this hair, shipped quick and feels really silky and soft. My stylist will install it this week after bleaching it. Good price and well worth it. will add a photo once installed.</li>
    <li> For the price this hair is ok. Although the bundles came very stiff, I deep conditioned it and sealed my wefts. The hair straightens and curls but it dropped fast due to humidity. The hair did tangle and snag a lot while shedding was minimal. If you&#x27;re looking for a in between  protective style, this is hair is good for a 1-3 weeks NOT more.</li>
    <li> Hair is terrrrrrrrrible soon as I washed it it matted up n it stink didn&#x27;t even get a chance to wear it</li>
    <li> I bought this hair and I loved it.  It was thick and full.  No shedding :) I can&#x27;t wait to color it!!!  Thank you so mmuch</li>
    <li> Received The Hair Today So Far The Hair Seems Like Some Good Quality Hair, No Funny Smell , And Very Soft Although The Bundles Are Not That Big As I Thought They Would Be</li>
    <li> The hair is NOT 300g. It&#x27;s more of 130g. It&#x27;s so thin but the lengths are true 20.22.24, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 and it stops almost to my butt, so it&#x27;s pretty long. Can&#x27;t say this is the best hair but it&#x27;s not the worst, you get what you pay for I guess. Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again though, simply because of the density.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ve had better hair, I wouldn&#x27;t get this again</li>
    <li> Bundles are thin (especially at the ends), hair is not Brazilian, more like yaki hair molded into a body wave, sheds like crazy, lost curl upon installation,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair in for a week so far and it&#x27;s still beautiful. It was well worth the price. Very little shedding. No tangles. I have gotten a lot of compliments on this hair. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Ordered my hair 4/29/15 received it today 5/9/15 omg I&#x27;m loving this hair 3 full bundles soft and beautiful haven&#x27;t installed yet but will definitely order from that company again thanks 😊😊</li>
    <li> This hair is amazing . I love it</li>
    <li> The hair had the most horrible odor I had ever smelt! They are also very very thin bundles. If you should do a full head weave you will need at least 9 bundles. On the positive side they do feel soft, I haven&#x27;t put them in yet so can&#x27;t say if they shed...I have to figure out how to get rid of the scent....let me know if any one has tips...</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first about buying hair online because I NEVER ordered hair before but now this company has erased the doubt I had. The hair is so soft and bouncy with little to no tangling. I ordered this hair on 4/28 (Monday night) and received it on 5/2 (Friday). Can&#x27;t wait to install into a U part wig. Bundles are not thin at the ends and are very full.</li>
    <li> Really good by the price.</li>
    <li> Is this really pure hair? I am interested in purchasing this hair I just want to make sure. Also, when this hair is straighten when it is wet does it go back to its natural curl? Please feel free to let me know thank you so much</li>
    <li> Not sure about this hair. Bundles are small and hair is shedding already. My daughter eorr it for a weekend and the shedding was bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my hair.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beyond satisfied at the quality of the hair I received.  Didn&#x27;t expect it to be so nice.  When I first received the bundles, I thought there wouldn&#x27;t be enough hair, but actually had hair left over.</li>
    <li> Hair is not worth the money!!!!! Ends are very very thin and even with 3 bundles you still don&#x27;t have enough hair to do a whole head. Had to end up buying more hair. Looks nothing like the picture and shed very bad</li>
    <li> Made my hair itch min shedding tangles easily</li>
    <li> Just ordered it , it&#x27;s supposed to be here feb 25 &amp; I go on Americas got talent feb 9th I wish it would come sooner but the reviews really sounding wonderful 💯👌😏 can&#x27;t wait till it comes 😩😩👏👏😘</li>
    <li> Love this hair!!! It looks so natural and it&#x27;s really soft. Also, no shedding. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> Hi I am from Costa Rica. Buy hair that seemed good price. Upon receiving my order hair felt soft with a rare smellI have the hair placed ten days ago and already lost the waves and brightness. I would not recommend this hair beber. I feel cheated is not what i expect.But that was expected my friend told me that the hair of this site is poor. It was my first time and never bought or would do at least in these products</li>
    <li> Just got the 20,22,24 and i love it. Only problem is that it has some short hairs. But either than tht its full and soft !! Shipping was fast also. I&#x27;m a happy camper</li>
    <li> Great at first, but after a week it Is the worst hair ever</li>
    <li> i have just installed the hair 20,22,24 but i also purchased the Peruvian in 14,16,18 i installed the 18-24 and hair looks very full and beautiful it does tangle but nothing major i have only had it in for 3 days so i will leave more feedback and each bundle is thick at the top but thins out except the shorter lengths but i would advise you to get all 6 bundles like i did you wont use them all but you can use the extra to get your desired thickness the sellers feedback is great ellen always answers promptly .</li>
    <li> This hair was not as the reviews stated! It look great when i took it out the pack but once installed it tangle to no end!</li>
    <li> Love it feels and look great. .although is to a min to get it...well worth the wait</li>
</ol>
