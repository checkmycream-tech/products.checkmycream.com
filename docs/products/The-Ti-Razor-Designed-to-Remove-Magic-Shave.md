### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Ti Razor is a excellent depilatory shaver.</li>
      <li>but it works absolutely perfect to pull the hair off the face, even the course gray hair come of easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>A good replacement for the legendary Palmer&#x27;s no-blade.  </li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>LOL.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this razor both on my face &amp; head, and I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation, scraping, burning, etc.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a very effective product.</li>
      <li>Good device.</li>
      <li>This is good.  </li>
      <li>The ideal of this blade-less shaver is excellent but it&#x27;s metal is still to sharp.</li>
      <li>, it is very easy to &#x27;overdo&#x27; it, and</li>
      <li>However, it is the best product I have found so far.</li>
      <li>plan to get 2-3 more just in case they happen to vanish too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Magic Shave for 20 + years and always looking for a way to make things easier.  </li>
      <li>I have been using magic shave for almost 40 years.  </li>
      <li>Could be better but for what it does it is fine.</li>
      <li>To get 5 stars and best use, manufacturing needs to round the edges on the blade a bit.</li>
      <li>Made cheap but does the job.</li>
      <li>Would love it even better if it were in the design of a straight razor that folded.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, it definitely works a lot better than using a knife/spoon/washcloth when used in conjunction with Magic Shave.</li>
      <li>When using it make sure that you use the depilatory for the right amount of time and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to end-up pulling a good chunk of skin while trying to get to those hard places like the jaw bone area.  </li>
      <li>You have a recipe for success.</li>
      <li>, it didn&#x27;t help at all and broke the very next day, the seller shipped it fast and it came as described,just not as good as it sounded.</li>
      <li>I like to close shave, but I do believe that the right and left edge of the blade should be curved for a more comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>After my first shave, i went ahead and rounded the corners with a file</li>
      <li>I was kind of shock how sharp the blade is.</li>
      <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone looking for a possibly better solution than using the edge of a spoon, dull knife, credit card, spatula, etc.</li>
      <li>Bottom line: If you use Magic Shave then you should have the Black Ti Razor as well.</li>
      <li>Decent quality product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>just wish razor was a little longer to cover more area during the hair removal stage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this in conjunction with the Ti Razor aftershave and moisturizer, it works very well to alleviate the slight irritation you tend to get from using Magic Shave.</li>
      <li>I have been using a teaspoon to remove magic shave in the past, and that seemed to not irratate my skin when shaving.  </li>
      <li>Mine isn&#x27;t sharp enough to slice through a piece of paper (like a razor blade would), but it is just sharp enough to give you a clean, smooth removal of the depilatory.</li>
      <li>Lastly, I didn&#x27;t find the closeness of the shave to be particularly optimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another reviewer wrote that the metal blade attached to the shaver is too sharp, but in my opinion, it is just right.</li>
      <li>I know that a plastic blade will not drag across and \\&quot;burn\\&quot; my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The Black Ti Razor is very useful and cuts close, in a society that is driven by instant gratification, this product delivers.</li>
      <li>When you combine African American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, with a well defined need, and a high quality product.</li>
      <li>You have to be careful to not use too much pressure though</li>
      <li>The razor was not very sharp and the cream clogged when using.  </li>
      <li>The Ti Razor is small, and easy to use, but just too sharp for my taste.  </li>

<li> The Ti Razor has a sharp metal blade, which is almost like using a regular razor in removing the paste.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;re like me, you will be surprise that the blade is actually a metal like aluminum and quite sharp</li>
<li> The only issue is the blade is very sharp.</li>
<li> And that&#x27;s what has driven me to write a second review, after purchasing the Black Ti Razor kit for some family members.</li>
<li> I would have given 5 stars except for the sharp edges.</li>
<li> I have used a platic spatula-like blade in the past and have been trying to find a similar product somewhere.  </li>
<li> Way too sharp.</li>
<li> /&gt;The one thing to pay attention to is the corners of the blade, they are very sharp and pointed.  </li>
<li> I think it could be a little duller, but that would not stop me from giving it 5 stars.</li>
<li> The blade head for this shaver is too small for my liking.  </li>
<li> This shaver is useless,  it was not smooth around the edges and scratched my face during shaving, I thought you got to be kidding me.  </li>
<li> she didn&#x27;t invent it,but i find it to be over hyped and unnecessary</li>
<li> Its not too bad, feels close to a razor but manageable, It does give a close shave result but its very sharp</li>
<li> Additionally, the shave cream that accumulates on the blade is difficult to remove.</li>
<li> Bad design and bad product don&#x27;t even bother, not worth it at all.</li>
<li> Which can lead to a very uncomfortable shave.</li>
<li> I hated the item,its not the seller&#x27;s fault since he/</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Magic Shave for 20 + years and always looking for a way to make things easier.  The ideal of this blade-less shaver is excellent but it&#x27;s metal is still to sharp.</li>

    <li> I would have give these guys a 5, but I received part of my order in damaged condition and did not send out a replacement.</li>
    <li> Its not too bad, feels close to a razor but manageable, It does give a close shave result but its very sharp</li>
    <li> Decent quality product. My husband doesn&#x27;t use it much. Made cheap but does the job. Could be better but for what it does it is fine. Nothing fancy though.</li>
    <li> The razor was not very sharp and the cream clogged when using.  I did not like the shave it gave me.</li>
    <li> Good device. I would have given 5 stars except for the sharp edges. To get 5 stars and best use, manufacturing needs to round the edges on the blade a bit. Way too sharp.</li>
    <li> The only issue is the blade is very sharp. Which can lead to a very uncomfortable shave. Otherwise it&#x27;s a very effective product.</li>
    <li> The Ti Razor is a excellent depilatory shaver. I was kind of shock how sharp the blade is. I think it could be a little duller, but that would not stop me from giving it 5 stars. When using it make sure that you use the depilatory for the right amount of time and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure. Great product!</li>
    <li> Finally!  A good replacement for the legendary Palmer&#x27;s no-blade.  This is the closest shave i&#x27;ve had in almost a year.  If you&#x27;re like me, you will be surprise that the blade is actually a metal like aluminum and quite sharp but it works absolutely perfect to pull the hair off the face, even the course gray hair come of easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing to pay attention to is the corners of the blade, they are very sharp and pointed.  It is very easy to end-up pulling a good chunk of skin while trying to get to those hard places like the jaw bone area.  After my first shave, i went ahead and rounded the corners with a file and now there is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to get 2-3 more just in case they happen to vanish too.  LOL.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I hated the item,its not the seller&#x27;s fault since he/she didn&#x27;t invent it,but i find it to be over hyped and unnecessary, it didn&#x27;t help at all and broke the very next day, the seller shipped it fast and it came as described,just not as good as it sounded.</li>
    <li> This is good.  I have been looking for this a while.</li>
    <li> The blade head for this shaver is too small for my liking.  Additionally, the shave cream that accumulates on the blade is difficult to remove. Lastly, I didn&#x27;t find the closeness of the shave to be particularly optimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palmers, I&#x27;m begging you, PLEASE BRING BACK THE &amp;#34;NO BLADE&amp;#34; SHAVER.</li>
    <li> I like to close shave, but I do believe that the right and left edge of the blade should be curved for a more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This gets the job done.  Would love it even better if it were in the design of a straight razor that folded.  It was shipped in a timely manner and reached my mail box on time.</li>
    <li> great product. just wish razor was a little longer to cover more area during the hair removal stage. Only thing I could find to replace the palmer&#x27;s plastic razor</li>
    <li> This shaver is useless,  it was not smooth around the edges and scratched my face during shaving, I thought you got to be kidding me.  Bad design and bad product don&#x27;t even bother, not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> When you combine African American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, with a well defined need, and a high quality product. You have a recipe for success. And that&#x27;s what has driven me to write a second review, after purchasing the Black Ti Razor kit for some family members. The Black Ti Razor is very useful and cuts close, in a society that is driven by instant gratification, this product delivers. Bottom line: If you use Magic Shave then you should have the Black Ti Razor as well. Because there is not product that even comes close.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, it definitely works a lot better than using a knife/spoon/washcloth when used in conjunction with Magic Shave. You have to be careful to not use too much pressure though, it is very easy to &#x27;overdo&#x27; it, and then next thing you know you&#x27;ve gone and scratched up your face. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this in conjunction with the Ti Razor aftershave and moisturizer, it works very well to alleviate the slight irritation you tend to get from using Magic Shave.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer wrote that the metal blade attached to the shaver is too sharp, but in my opinion, it is just right. Mine isn&#x27;t sharp enough to slice through a piece of paper (like a razor blade would), but it is just sharp enough to give you a clean, smooth removal of the depilatory. I&#x27;ve used this razor both on my face &amp; head, and I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation, scraping, burning, etc. I think it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone looking for a possibly better solution than using the edge of a spoon, dull knife, credit card, spatula, etc.</li>
