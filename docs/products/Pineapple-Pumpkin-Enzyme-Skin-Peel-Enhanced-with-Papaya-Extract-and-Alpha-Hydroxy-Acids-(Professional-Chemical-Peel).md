### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was concerned that it would be too \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; for me, as I also use Perfect Image&#x27;s Salicylic and Lactic Peels, but I find it to be a wonderful addition.</li>
      <li>This seems to be the perfect threshold for me, so if you decide to try it, and I recommend that you do, experiment with the timing based on how the product feels on your skin and how your skin looks after the treatment.</li>

      <li>and I do recommend this particular product from Perfect Image.  </li>
      <li>Product is easy to apply, smells good and has a nice consistency.</li>
      <li>Also, I noticed my pores appear more smaller, and I couple this with the Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) by Perfect Image, and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>I experienced mild stinging.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly I now get compliments on my skin and feel very comfortable going without makeup.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipping was fine, seller was good but the product doesn&#x27;t deliver results for my skin.</li>
      <li>I feel like this one is more effective and stronger then the level 2 tea tree gel peel.</li>
      <li>I love this peel, it is sincerely amazing.</li>

      <li>Most importantly  , ones you start doing peel you MUST  always apply UV  protection !</li>
      <li>I tried them on myself and some friends, and fell in love.</li>
      <li>The day after using it, I make sure to use plenty of moisturizer in case there is peeling.</li>
      <li>My skin is softer and smoother after using the peel, and I feel like it allows for better absorption of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I began using this peel about one year ago.  I used it about once a month for the first 3 or 4 months and now use it about once a quarter for maintenance with an occasional use in prep for some special event I have to attend.  I&#x27;m 58 and have a pretty youthful complexion and Perfect Image peels and cleanser have become a big part of skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once a week (5 min. intervals) for 4 weeks.  I have seen an improvement with my skin texture and improvement on some dark spots and one freckle on my cheek has been completed removed. I have not been able to work up to and additional 5 minutes on top of the first, because this mask does sting. I have pretty strong skin, too.  I will continue to use on a weekly peel basis and see how much improvement I have when the bottle is gone, but I feel I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a very good peel. I enjoyed my results very much and the application process was very simple. Thank you</li>
    <li> Usually this product is only available through the aesthetician in an office setting but being able to use it at home is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Make sure to wash your face with a cleanser that does not have exfoliating qualities in it, use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol on your face and then apply the product.  Keep it on for 1 or 2 minutes to start.  It will feel like it&#x27;s burning. That is normal.  Rinse your face off with cold water.  Product is great.</li>
    <li> I only used the product once (to date) but was pleased with the directions cautioning not to over use and the results were good.</li>
    <li> I am 43 and have acne prone skin.  A terrible combination!  I have used the peel once a week for 4 weeks.  I applied the peel the first 2 weeks for only five minutes, so my skin could adjust gradually to a peel.  The third and fourth weeks I was more aggressive and applied it for ten minutes (the first layer for five minutes; the second layer over the first for another five minutes).  Each time after I removed the peel, I applied a gentle sulfur mask for ten minutes.  At first, my skin was purging the black heads and white heads, so I had some break outs, but it is okay because that is something that happens at first.  Overall, my skin has greatly improved - the white heads and black heads on my nose and chin are almost gone; my pores are much smaller; and overall my skin is much less oily.  I recommend this peel!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for a month now. Haven&#x27;t notice any change at all. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but seller was good and on time</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this peel. This same company has other peels that are amazing, but this one doesn&#x27;t deliever any results and it smells like cough medicine.</li>
    <li> This Glycolic Acid Peel has really helped to clear up my face and give it a nice glow. It went on nicely and didn&#x27;t burn too badly. I didn&#x27;t actually peel, but I did see results. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and am now taking a break to let my face breathe.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Love that I can do it myself without the high end cost of a spa. Looks great, feels great!</li>
    <li> No down time, light burn sensation, fabulous glow afterwards!! I  usually leave on for 5-8 minutes and follow with a heavy moisturizer. LOVE the smell of this one!!!</li>
    <li> I love this peel, it is sincerely amazing. I want to &#x27;second&#x27; the other reviewer who says this is a SERIOUS peel even though you may be thrown off by the fact that it is derived from fruits. (well, weren&#x27;t we all ;0).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently did a \\&quot;buffered 70% glycolic\\&quot; at a spa and I find this to be far more effective for far less money. I used the Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Peel for UNDER two minutes and WOWZERS, this bad boy works! I am a veteran of skin peels, microdermabrasion, and multitudes of other treatments and this is one of the best. I STRONGLY encourage you to try this peel and to NOT leave it on longer then TWO minutes the first time. I&#x27;m tough when it comes to peels and this would have done some damage if I would have left it on for over 5 minutes - just try it in increments. I&#x27;m so thankful I limited myself to this because when I &#x27;washed&#x27; the peel off my face SKIN (old dead skin mind you!) was coming off too and not in miniscule amounts- this is no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was feeling like just about every pore on my face was congested and only one use of this product has made my pores look smaller. I&#x27;m hopeful that with weekly use my skin will start getting that beautiful porcelain glow I see on some women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding it VERY difficult to believe anyone who says they had no results - I just cannot imagine it.</li>
    <li> LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this product,leaves your skin looking 10years younger. I do 2 passes and leave on 5 min each, once a week ,my skin has a healthy glow and a noticably smoother texture.</li>
    <li> The results from using this peel are very comparable to those I got from professional peels from my dermatologist (for a fraction of the cost).  I usually use two layers, about 3 - 5 minutes each layer, about every 2 or 3 weeks.  I experience a fairly mild sting with each layer, but it&#x27;s very tolerable.  My skin is softer and smoother after using the peel, and I feel like it allows for better absorption of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Age 38, caucasian, fair skin)</li>
    <li> This peel is very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;.  If you&#x27;re new to chemical peels, this may a good starting point.  However, if you have ever had a professional peel, this just isn&#x27;t going to cut it, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other skin peels but they were too harsh for me.  This is something I can apply before I get in the shower, let it set for several minutes and wash it off when I get in the shower.  Skin is refreshed and not dry when I get out of the shower.  I plan to keep this in my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for those who can not handle the burn of some of the other peels.</li>
    <li> I bought a package for a PCA peel a year ago through groupon and was hooked - completely amazed with the results.  Unfortunately, as a starving law student I can&#x27;t afford to make it a regular thing and Amazon always has great deals, so I decided to check to see what was available in the \\&quot;In home\\&quot; peel department.  After reading reviews I settled on this product.  Amazing.  I made the right choice.  I followed all of the instructions and honestly, even after the first use I was kind of shocked when I looked in the mirror.  My skin felt super smooth and soft, it looked more even...it was crazy.  About a week or two later my mom came to visit and as soon as she saw me her face kind of brightened and she said \\&quot;oh my goodness you look beautiful!\\&quot;  Even she could see the difference.  That was about two months ago.  A few weeks ago I went to an event and decided to put on makeup for the first time in a while and was surprised to find out how little concealer I needed.  I ran out about a month ago and even now my skin is still ridiculously soft and smooth and it still looks amazing.  Most importantly, my face hasn&#x27;t broken out nearly as much as it used to and the blackheads seem to be in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACNE:  I will say that when I first started using it I got a few more whiteheads than usual, but I remember that when I went in for the PCA peel a year ago, the Aesthetician told me that its normal to see increased whitehead activity when first starting a peel, and it has something to do with the fact that since you&#x27;re removing a layer of skin, and it has more room to breathe, the skin takes advantage of the opportunity to purge some of the toxins that have been hiding in there.  And she was right.  So I was sort of expecting it.  It did go away after a while.  I would say that if you&#x27;re having this problem, give your skin a chance to settle down and see how it all shakes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEELING:  It took a few uses for me to see some actual peeling occur, but it was pretty minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really great product and I&#x27;m in love with it.  I think its a must have if you really want to try a peel but don&#x27;t have the $$ to get it done.</li>
    <li> I have seen drying for the most part and I believe that might be from the alcohol they keep pushing for you to wipe on your face beforehand.  In my estimation, a salon is ALWAYS the way to go.  The VI Peel is the best I&#x27;ve EVER had.  So, I bought this, thinking it might be my home-version lower priced alternate.  No comparison to a spa peel.  It does tingle and I&#x27;ve seen smoothing, but certainly not what is claimed.  I will finish my bottle and will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of peels over the years, and this is my favorite!  Not too much stinging as your skin adjusts to it.  It smells great!  And it does work -- very smoothing effects.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. No results,  actually checked to see if product was expired. No tingling, or sensation from product at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the nice ingredients fool you-this is a strong peel.  I have only used it twice..I did peel a little after-so if you use it a lot or put a lot on your face-just cautious you might peel.</li>
    <li> I expected a more strong peeling feeling, but maybe it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s more comfortable and doesn&#x27;t burn as much.  I do notice that my skin feels firmer and clearer with weekly use.</li>
    <li> I had never done a peel on myself before this experience although I have had several professionally administered. They can be rather pricey so I really wanted to try one and see how effective it could be. I carefully read the instructions and followed them to the T. I&#x27;m happy to report that the results just keep getting more and more awesome and I am now a seasoned pro at providing myself this service at a quarter of the price I&#x27;ve paid others to do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first two peels were rather quick and done very cautiously since the process and the product was new to me. They were more for practice to get a feel for the product and how it reacted with my skin. The detailed instructions really helped to prepare and guide me. The first time I only allowed the product on for about 3 minutes. It felt very tingly as three minutes came around so I was prudent to follow the directions and rinse my face with cool water after just a couple of minutes of sensation. The results of that session were not visibly obvious to me but my skin felt refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;As recommended I waited a week exactly and did another peel of which I extended the time to almost 6 minutes. The tingling got pretty intense but it stopped as soon as the cool water easily rinsed the product off. This time I noticed that my face was a little blotchy red in several areas which lasted for about 3 days but when it cleared, my skin looked bright and clear, my pours greatly reduced, and my skin felt very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to do peels about once a month since, usually allowing the product on for between 6 - 8 minutes. This seems to be the perfect threshold for me, so if you decide to try it, and I recommend that you do, experiment with the timing based on how the product feels on your skin and how your skin looks after the treatment. It doesn&#x27;t take much time nor much product, only 3/4 of the dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it starts getting really tingly at about 3 minutes and increases in intensity until around 6.5 to 7 minutes, then it starts to level off a bit so I just give it another minute and rinse.  I recommend you prepare for your skin to be slightly to moderately blotchy for up to 3 days after the treatment. It&#x27;s mostly around my lips, nose, and chin areas with a little around the outside corners of my eyes. I haven&#x27;t noticed any actual peeling other than an occasional flake of dry skin here and there, but my skin feels a little tender for a couple days after the process. I schedule my peels for periods when I have a couple - few days of being at home or low key publically and definitely a week away of any type of social occasion where I might have to be in the public eye. Of course a little makeup could hide the blotchiness if needed but I try to give my skin a chance to heal and rejuvinate itself before applying too many other chemicals. I just gently cleanse, tone, and use plenty of vitamin C serum and sunscreen while the blotches disappear and then my skin looks perfectly revived, plumped and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased to report that I continue to receive an abundant amount of compliments about how good my skin looks since using this product so that is proof enough for me to be able to confidently share my experience with you. I will definitely purchase again and continue to treat myself to this peel as part of my beauty ritual for as long as I keep having such good results.nsity until around 6.5 to 7 minutes, then it starts to level off a bit so I just give it another minute and rinse.

    <li> This is a great light peel.  I love that you can use this one everyday. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this peel.</li>
    <li> I like this peel, but I love their TCA peel (15%).  The pineapple peel has a pleasant smell and you can feel it working right away.  It makes my skin smoother and very soft.  My skin is very used to peels, so I do no actually get peeling with this one like I did with the TCA.  I thought this peel would be great for winter when my skin is a bit drier.  I use it once a week on my face, neck, chest, and hands.  Skin is really smooth after the peel and I immediately apply some Borage oil...a VERY nice combo!!!</li>
    <li> this did nothing for my skin i probably need a higher level. I rather have a peel done at doctors office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking it!  I had been having daily acne and I&#x27;m 42.  I&#x27;ve been doing this about once a week and also have incorporated Kate Somerville&#x27;s antibac as well.  Over the last two months, I think I&#x27;ve only had two small pimples.  I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help speed up the fading of scars. I have quite a few scars on my legs and was trying my best to stay moisturized and exfoliate all the dead skin away to fade the marks. I decided to give this peel a try to further speed up the process since it had good reviews. However I think it&#x27;s just too gentle for my skin. I left it on for maybe 5 minute sessions, adding a 2nd layer as I went (sometimes longer if I had time) and would feel it tingle and sort of burn but never saw any visible difference. My skin is rather unsensitive to things though so perhaps I just need to try one of the harsher peels and maybe use this for my face instead. It does smell very nice though; sort of like candy.</li>
    <li> It stings if you leave it on for too long but that is to be expected and was noted in the directions. Made my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne on my back, arms, and chest for a while now. Usually once a week I&#x27;ll take a cotton pad and soak it with this peel and spread it all over the affected area. Not only has my skin improved considerably it also maintains it. I also like the consistency the fact that its a liquid and not gel. Ive tried the tea tree gel formula and I think its harder to use. This also works well on my face. My skin on my body and face doesn&#x27;t exfoliate properly and this helps it immensely. The day after using it, I make sure to use plenty of moisturizer in case there is peeling. But then for the next few days my skin in beautiful and doesn&#x27;t have bumpiness or patchiness. I feel like this one is more effective and stronger then the level 2 tea tree gel peel. It actually makes my skin tingly and I feel like its working. The tea tree peel did not work for me like this one did.</li>
    <li> This Pineapple Enzyme skin peel,which I bought from amazon, is so amazing!  I did not quite believe the results of other people, so I had to see for myself.  It really is the best the best thing I ever did for my skin!! I use it about once a week for 10 minutes to make my skin glow and look much younger.  Get compliments all the time about how beautiful my skin looks. Thank you so much.  My skin is pretty sensitive but had no problems leaving  it on for 10 min -- and WOW! has my skin changed. No more crows feet and wrinkles are going.  Thanks  Chris T</li>
    <li> I read the intimidating  instructions, however, I have used it twice so far and I see some results. I plan to use it many more times!&lt;br /&gt;If I see more and better results, which will take time, I would rate it 5</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PEEL!!!  I was hesitant to purchase and use this product, but after reading the reviews, I decided to try it.  I love/heart this peel better than the lemon peel I purchased made by Ole Henriksen.  This peel doesnt burn, and if you&#x27;re skin can tolerate mild peels, keep it on longer, like 5 mins. more to get more of the exfolioating effect and you will see the difference with your skin just after a few uses.  IBeing an African-American woman with combination/hyperpigmented skin and large pores,  this product is helping me to achieve an even skintone, with that glowing look.  Also, I noticed my pores appear more smaller, and I couple this with the Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) by Perfect Image, and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week. I was concerned that it would be too \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; for me, as I also use Perfect Image&#x27;s Salicylic and Lactic Peels, but I find it to be a wonderful addition. The salicylic does produce a peel. However, a lot of the time, I don&#x27;t want to have down time after a peel. So this one is just great for that. No down time, and not a lot of redness, but definite results. I am 34 yrs old and still struggle with oily/acne/rough skin. So the peels are vital to keeping my skin somewhat under control. I have basically stopped using retin-a and instead use the 3 peels regularly to help improve my skin renewal/turnover. I consider myself picky. I have done LOTS of peels at the dermatologist and at esthetician office&#x27;s, but these are (in my humble opinion) just as good and much much more affordable. I am just so glad they are available on amazon. 10 years ago, I could not order an over-the-counter peel like this online. Hope they help others.</li>
    <li> Im a professional esthetician, and purchased these products on a whim. I tried them on myself and some friends, and fell in love. Ive been incorporating these peels in with my facial treatments, that I perform in my office. Im very happy with this line of products, and will continue to use them personally and professionally!</li>
    <li> My bf purchased this for me as a gift. This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve used this only once and can already tell a difference. I have oily skin and acne caused from blackheads. This stuff works!!! I used witch hazel to prep my face and neck. I used a fan brush to apply the product. I put 1 ml into a glass bowl and dipped the fan brush into the product and applied it quickly. I sat in front of a fan for 2 minutes, to calm the burning sensation, and then washed the peel of with cold water for 5 minutes. My face was pink but SMOOTH. I then applied a very moisturizing cream with argon oil all over my face and neck. The second day my face was glowing and the blackheads I had were almost gone. The acne scars were faded and my skin was NOT oily the next day.  This stuff is amazing and works VERY well.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have used all the acids on he market. I have skilled esthetician who worked with me. for spots and scaring.&lt;br /&gt;I found this products to just as if not more and helpful than salicylic, glycolic, tca. Be careful as it is strong.&lt;br /&gt;My first couple of uses I little red spots, but when the skin gradually started to peel, I got so many compliments&lt;br /&gt;on how my skin had a glow.</li>
    <li> This peel works great. You can immediately see a difference in your skin. I am an aesthetician and I love trying new products. This one is good.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Makes your skin look poreless at least for a couple days afterward. Minor peeling on third and forth day but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it once per week to maintain.  Keeps my skin in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have been recomended to buy pampkin peel  and I have to say what a treasure ! I never had peel before start from this one,  after I applied I had a beat tinkly sensation my skin was a bit pinky after 3 min  I rinse and apply rich moisturizer , my skin was so smooth and glowing , a keep doing it ones in a week , and can see significant improvement . Most importantly  , ones you start doing peel you MUST  always apply UV  protection ! I will definatly buy again))</li>
    <li> just started using the product a second time, it&#x60;s felt stinging and still waiting for the exfoliation. So far so good.</li>
    <li> the smell of it is amazing! love the way it made my skin feel. it&#x27; sa great product and my skin feels so soft! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Ahem!!! I&#x27;m a bit on the older side, so anything that improves my skin&#x27;s texture, and appearance is a plus for me!  This product was easy to apply--kind of fun to use. I am impressed with the result.  My skin has a softer, smoother glow. After use, I apply skin moistureizer, and the improvement lasts for awhile!!!! For me, I need to use it about once every other week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with this peel.  Don&#x27;t let the &#x27;feel good&#x27; ingredients fool you.  This is a real peel. Do follow the instructions and apply a second coat for maximum effectiveness.  I alternate this with glycolic and lactic acid peels and have been really pleased with the results.  Firming, pore reduction and overall tone improvement.  If I use the same peel repeatedly the law of diminishing returns seems to kick in but by alternating I continue to get positive results.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do I am very satisfied with it</li>
    <li> First off, it does work. I have used it 4 times for 4 weeks. It is extremely gentle (my skin is very sensitive), I only had very slight tingling feeling a couple of minutes after application. It does lighten my sunspots, however very very lightly, maybe prolonged use is needed to treat these areas more effectively. Maybe my sunspots are tough. Overall it does minimize the pores and my face looks brighter, works well with my Lancome protocol and there definitely is a difference, albeit subtle. I would have to do a follow up ewview in a month or so - I never had it on for more then 5 minutes so maybe longer application times work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get instant results, although I am realistic and understand that I need a much harsher peel to get the sunspots to go away. But I am happy to use it - it&#x27;s natural, it works, I like the scent. Hope this helps. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this product, leaves my skin glowing and healthy looking in a matter of minutes. I use it every two weeks as a supplement to my regular skin care routine. It leaves skin soft and smooth without peeling or irritation. A must have for my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> it didnt work for me my skin got burned! the skin on my cheeks are red and raw and i could see right thru to the other layer of skin. i am not too sure if its an allergic reaction...ive did a couple of chemical peels in the past, and none of this happened.  its pretty bad now and i am at a lost of what to do.  won&#x27;t get this ever again</li>
    <li> I really really thought i had hopes in disappearing pores and clearer skin, but between this and the cleanser alls i get is super irritated dry skin...my pores look the same. i do not recommend this at all. :/</li>
    <li> I have been using peels (glycolic and lactic) for some time but began worrying that i may be harming my skin as i use them every week or two. I like that this peel has the mixture of pineapple, pumpkin and papaya, which are all good skincare ingredients. I&#x27;ve used it only once so far and was surprised to see an immediate lightening of sun spots on my face. I recommend also using on your neck and chest. There is an unusual scent but not terribly unpleasant and the overall effect outweighs that slight inconvenience. I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars at the moment because I want to see what this product can do after a month or so of use.</li>
    <li> Works so well! Smells great, easy to use and very versatile! Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works with all skin types , I am an esthetician.</li>
    <li> In the past, I paid $150/chemical peel at a medi-derma and was beet-red for days -- I&#x27;ve been looking for a more gentle product that I can do more cost-effectively at home.  I really like that this product is based on natural enzymes.  It still tingles upon application, but it&#x27;s not unnecessarily abrasive.  While you can use this weekly, I just use this product as a \\&quot;pamper me\\&quot; at home spa treatment -- even with spiratic use, my pores look better. This product gives me a fresh look.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 30s and have started to experience dullness and dark spots.  I was looking for something that emulated the results of the salon peels that I had received at a more economical price.  This peel achieved that goal.  The peel is very gentle to it can be used for shorter or longer durations depending on your sensitivity.  My skin was definitely brighter and the dark spots are starting to diminish (second use).  I also liked how easy it was to use.  Simply apply with a cotton pad and rinse with water.  Easy.&lt;br /&gt;I would happily purchase again and am looking at other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Use almost every morning for about 5 min. Does not leave the face too red (I have sensitive skin) and slowly gets rid of dead skin etc. Love the peels.</li>
    <li> I think I had higher hopes for this product based on other reviews, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and all it really seems to do is make my skin softer and smoother. I was hoping it would even out my skin tone more and get rid of blackheads but it just seems to get rid of dead skin and make my skin softer and smoother after each use. Not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing either, but I was hoping for more results. It&#x27;s a gentle peel, only stings a bit at times and only caused me to peel after the second use. Overall, it was okay for the price but not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I tried this the first night I received it. I admit I did not have the correct items needed to apply to my face but because I was so anxious to try  it I applied with fingers! And wowzers is right. I love this peel and I will continue to use once I run out. I love the smell of it which smells fruity. I did experiece dryness where I applied it but I&#x27;m certain now it was because my skin was about to peel.</li>
    <li> Yes this will make you break out at first, but that is because it brings all the bad stuff to the surface of your skin so you can get rid of it and be on your way. This does not make you peel like a sunburn it just slightly lifts the first 1 or 2 layers of skin away so you can reveal your freshest skin. I usually do this peel once every 2 weeks just to keep renewing my skin cells. I love that you only have to leave it on for less than 5 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. This product is worth the price just make sure you use it with gentle cleansers and lotions.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for starting out in your own peels.  It is not so strong to burn your face as long as you are following directions.  It will certainly help diminish the fine lines and bring back a glow for your face.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fine, seller was good but the product doesn&#x27;t deliver results for my skin. Product is easy to apply, smells good and has a nice consistency. I was very excited to try this but after 4 uses, I have no changes in my skin whatsoever. I&#x27;ve used the alcohol prep. I&#x27;ve used 2 layers and left it on 10 minutes (hoping to get something) but I haven&#x27;t peeled or noticed any difference. My skin was a little red, it stung a little bit, face looked shiny and that is about it. My lines, large pores, freckles and age spots are still here. I&#x27;ll keep trying until the product is gone but I feel like I&#x27;m out $25 on another product that promised something too good to be true. To be fair, I have used Retin A so maybe my skin is not as receptive or sensitive to peeling, but even without peeling, I would have liked to see something change for the better.</li>
    <li> I Love this peel, it\\&quot;s just right, not too harsh and perfect for just to get a glowing complexion.I&#x27;ve been out of this product for a week and can tell a big difference.Can&#x27;t wait for my order to get here!</li>
    <li> Re: Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Skin Peel- Enhanced with Papaya Extract &amp; AHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping &amp; Service: This peel arrived fast, and in great packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Use and Effectiveness: Overall Rating - Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Use Overall: I used the product and my skin was noticeably refined, enhanced and un-injured after the initial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin Type: My skin is caucasian, in relatively good shape, with some issues from past &amp; present sun and some continuing acne issues. I have usual aging skin.  At the time of the application, I did not have any injuries/wounds/inflammation/unusual dryness.  I have employed an anti-aging/anti acne daily regimen for years. Immediately after peel, I could see a difference - skin was smoother, and refined.  This peel resulted in a porcelain like hue to the skin. That hue continued into day 2 (today), after the shower, etc. The result is similar to that which I recall when I received a skin treatment in a spa.  Today, my boyfriend, without my inquiry, complimented me on how my skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self Application: I read &amp; followed all enclosed directions (including as to pre-peel prep with alcohol - easy), I did an initial spot test (no issue) and then I applied the peel (over face) as directed (in terms of time and amount)  Except, I chose not to apply between upper cheek bone and eye area.  There was a slight skin sting on the second pass (i.e after 5 minutes you can re-cover the skin for another 5 minutes); if a rating of 5 is significant, the sting would be a 1.5. Rinses off easy with copius cool water.  Although you do not use a significant amount of the product, I found my skin to be refined, smooth, with a hint of a porcelain shine, but not injured. To the touch, I can feel a smooth difference. Use as directed (not more than 10 minutes) and I would imagine that you will be pleasantly surprised.  I feel confident that future applications will continue to reveal good results.  Additionally, this type of mild peel is likely to make your skin more susceptible to the beneficial properties in your daily skin regimen.  I have used this peel three times over the course of months, since purchase.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Application: Also, I invited my friend to try this product, following the same procedures above. She experienced less of a sting.  I would say that the condition/appearance of her skin is relatively poor, from sun, smoking and age and she admitted that she has no present/history of a skin regimen.  I did notice that the peel revealed skin that was obviously subject to a recent treatment, revealing refinement and again a porcelain like shine in the light.  To the touch, she could feel a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sting, Pain or other issues? - No, not really: As noted above - There was a slight skin sting on the second pass (i.e after 5 minutes  you can recover the skin for another 5 minutes) if a rating of 5 is significant, the sting would be a 1.5.; Use of a paper/magazine to fan does soothe the sting.  Also, I did see a very slight redness 1 hour post-peel.  24 hours post-treatment, there is no noticeable negative issue. 24 hours after peel, there is no indication that the peel brought on acne, lasting redness or dryness/dry patches. I did avoid any lotion with aha/retinol in the 24 hours post-peel and I did use an SPF.  [Update: After a recent use, I did have a dry patch on one cheek, which I should have better concealed/protected with more applications of sunblock or staying out of the sun during the healing process; so be mindful of how the sun can damage/discolor freshly treated skin.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words of Wisdom or something like that: It can be precarious to try out a professional peel, bought on line, and caution should be the foundation of any approach to the use of any product on your body; That said, I find this to be  a great, MILD product and I do recommend this particular product from Perfect Image.  Be sure to follow directions, do not let desperation, anxiousness or impatience be your guide - therefore, do not use other than as directed (i.e. not longer, stronger or more frequently) - its just not worth it - ever.  Also, take the time to wear sunblock, especially with AHA&#x27;s, peels or other skin refining treatments; not using a high spf can damage recently treated skin. I would recommend a mild product, like this one, for consistent at home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I am not affiliated with this company, whatsoever. I do trust this product, found it to be a great investment and  l like what I see.  I wrote this review, to possibly be of assistance to someone like myself, who wants to have great skin, who doesn&#x27;t have the time or money to go to the spa, again and again, and who is looking for an at home peel that has good, safe results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this helps someone.

    <li> This is a gentle peel, but I still see good results. I like to use this peel when I don&#x27;t want my skin to have a lot of flaking and redness like with stronger peels. I alternate with stronger peels depending on the time of year and whether or not I want to have deal with a stronger peel. I only do peels about once a month, but I bet that you could do this one once a week and have very nice results.</li>
    <li> Not too harsh.  Immediate results.  Use it 2x per month.  Would recommend it for skin care use on your face.</li>
    <li> This peel works really well and really fast!  dont let  the word enzyme in the name mislead you it is potent.  And just happens to be the best smelling peel  i have ever used.  i highly recommend it1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;esthetician maria</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time and my skin is lighter, the pores are invisible and the skin is glowing. I am impressed and will continue using this peel! This peel made my problem skin (pores, freckles) look much better than 6 microdermabrasions!</li>
    <li> I will buy it again.  It definitely smooths the skin and (although I&#x27;ve only used it for 6 weeks) appears to make my skin look better, and has reduced a little pigmentation from acne scars.</li>
    <li> I love professional peels, but I am so busy it&#x27;s hard to fit them in my schedule.  I read the reviews and decided to place an order.  I used it the same night it arrived.  I also purchased the Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream and used that after my peel.  So far, I think I&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the peel I felt no stinging, but my face did get red.  After I washed the product off my skin and applied the cream my skin felt incredibly soft and looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will buy again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pineapple Pumpkin Peel is described as Level 1.  I also bought the Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel.  I will work my way up to that peel which is considered Level 2.</li>
    <li> didnt really see much of a difference in anything, and I followed the directions to a T. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a very mild peel so the results are minimal and take longer but omg, does it smell good! No kidding, you won&#x27;t believe it is a peel because of how delicious it smells. If you have sensitive skin, this is for you for sure!</li>
    <li> I loved the scent and this peel will subtly clear skin to leave a clear complexion. I would try a stronger peel for heavy acne scarring</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE PEEL OF ALL GLYCOLIC, LACTIC ACID AND THC PEELS.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PINEAPPLE SMELL AND FEEL OF MY SKIN AFTER I USE IT.</li>
    <li> I love this peel!!! It worked fast and was so easy to use. The top layer on my face was painlessly removed and I actually look much younger.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin but not terribly sensitive.  It stung a little but not much.  My face started peeling after a couple of days.  After my face peels, it looks much brighter!  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an easy peeling to apply  in clients. it&#x27;s light and improve the skin, without down sides , renewing the skin ! Great choice ! I do recommend !</li>
    <li> I have used this several times now.  I followed the directions the first time.  Clean skin, prepped with alcohol etc.  I left it on for about one minute and rinsed with copies amounts of cold water.  I experienced mild stinging.  There was never any frosting or peeling(waited 3 days).  I tried again and left it on a little longer the second time.  Again mild stinging, no frosting or peeling.  My skin became very dry and red.  The results are similar to the Peter Thomas Roth pads (but delivered much quicker).</li>
    <li> Love the brand , it delivers and the value is great. Im 40 and i always take care of my skin and now it shows,  no body thinks im 40 they always asking me what i do to maintain my skin so clear and no wrinkles . i use this products i love them , and after all my expensive products in the past with this one i have results and i safe thanks for a good product</li>
    <li> I love this peel! Great treatment addition to dermaplaning or alone. I  will definitely buy it again...my clients dig it too!</li>
    <li> Im a licensed Esthetician always searching for the best products. Products that I think are effective and yield the kind of results I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I loved PERFECT IMAGE peels from the moments I tested them and I feel the results were very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I not only used them on clients but I have used them on myself.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these peels 100%!&lt;br /&gt;READ the instructions carefully, they are strong.&lt;br /&gt;Jo&lt;br /&gt;SkinbyJo :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gel-like consistency, easy to put on, easy to wash off. It doesn&#x27;t really burn (but I have thick skin and a high pain tolerance) but it is very very effective. It really clears out tons of black heads and refreshes and renews my skin. I love it. It does exactly what enzyme are supposed to do, eat away at dead tissue, dirt and debris. I will be ordering this again. (I am a full time student in Aesthetics, and was a sales rep for a couple of Sephora/Nordstrom brands of skincare)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic and affordable product! I&#x27;ve used this once a week for almost a year and it has helped my skin dramatically, I would definitely recommend this product and will continue to use it in the future!</li>
    <li> Used this based on all the positive reviews. It is very mild, but effective at diminishing dark spots and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Was very impressed. Not complicated to use, minimal burn, more of a tingling.  A little goes a very long way. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered the Lactic Acid &amp; Salycillic peels. I&#x27;ve had acne since my 20s and these peels have been very effective in smoothing out my skin. The pineapple pumpkin peel smells great and is great if you&#x27;re not ready to try something stronger like the TCA, Salyicilic &amp; Lactic Acid peels. I was using this since I figured I don&#x27;t need something too strong now that my face is getting clearer and the blemishes have reduced significantly. I&#x27;ve been letting my mom use this peel too (she&#x27;s in her late 50s) since she&#x27;s never done a peel on her face and it has helped soften up and reduce discoloration on her face.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the same brand of 30% glycolic at the same time.  The pineapple pumpkin feels less harsh on the skin than the glycolic - less tingling during use and less dryness afterwards - but my husband immediately noticed the results.  My face felt firmer and smoother after just the first use.  I did follow the instructions exactly and left it on for only 3 minutes the first time and have been increasing a minute a week until I hit a maintenance point, at which time I&#x27;ll be switching to a monthly peel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19 years old but I&#x27;m using this to improve my complexion plus get rid of some acne spots. So far my spots have reduced so much more than with every other cream or acne treatment I&#x27;ve bought. While you might get some white heads right after using it the first times, I have less breakouts now, and I have even taken to going out without my foundation!  It does take a while to see the results(for me about 1-2 weeks). On a pain scale for me this is a 3-4 sometimes 5 if I have some tender areas. I tried this on my mom  and she dramatically said it was an 8-9, mind you she has very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have age spots plus some redness on cheeks and this peel works just great.  I leave it on for 5-6 minutes and no burn issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this to avoid making a $50 copayment each time I go for a chemical peel at the dermatologist.  My sister in law is an esthetician/skin care specialist and recommended it.  It is much less caustic than the glycolic peel my dermatologist used.  I put it on for the full 5 minutes recommended in the instructions, and it still is less harsh than the glycolic peel used for 3 minutes.  If you are super serious about an aggressive skin peel, you may want to go with a stronger peel.  I am happy with this one, though.</li>
    <li> This products definitely does some work. It&#x27;s not as effective as I would like, but I can feel it at work!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this peel because it is light but does give great results.  It has helped reduce acne and improve the overall look of my skin.</li>
    <li> Great mild peel!!! I will be purchasing again when I run out. Also this is a great price. Thank you</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle of this peel and was very happy with the results after having used it regularly. I have fair skin that has seen a lot of sun over the years (+50), and was in need of help. This product was great, it really refreshed the overall appearance of my skin. I love it, I will continue to use it and am looking forward to trying some of the other peels in this product line as well. I found it to be quick and simple to use, truly - so easy to incorporate into your beauty regimen. I also love that it has a nice light, very pleasant scent. I feel the value is great for a product of this quality.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with acne on and off for quite a while and this (and other) peels have really saved me.  I use this pumpkin enzyme peel alternated with the BPA+ peel and the acne is virtually gone.  If I start to notice a breakout I try and do a peel right away and the breakout usually disappears within a day or so.  Amazingly I now get compliments on my skin and feel very comfortable going without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The Enzyme peel seems gentler than the other peel that I use, there is not a lot of stinging and I can leave it on for a couple of minutes.  Usually I don&#x27;t get a lot of &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; on my skin, just where there are the beginnings of a breakout where.  I&#x27;d recommend it, especially for people just starting out with peels, or have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect Image Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Peel is a great peel for anyones skin care regimen. It&#x27;s gentle enough to be used more frequently than say the deeper TCA peels. But, it does rejuvenate the skin amazingly!! I highly recommend. I routinely have done Blue Peels, Vitalize,  RetinA, Botox, and other skin rejuvenating regimens on my face to keep myself youthful.</li>
    <li> In spite of the fluffy, fruity name this is a serious peel. I did not &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; but the results from this product are dramatic and phenomenal. I recently saw a friend whom I haven&#x27;t seen for a while, and she noticed how young and smooth I now look. My husband also made a big deal about how much younger my skin looks and feels. I am a very fair strawberry blonde with extremely sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate this once every two weeks without a problem. My skin looks even more porcelain and fair than before, but in a good way. The clarity has improved tremendously and my skin simply appears younger. I&#x27;m not sure about the lines yet, but they do appear softer at the very least. I highly recommend this product, but if your skin is sensitive I would only use it as much as you can tolerate it.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I use it alone or as a base under whatever I want...I think it softens my skins and lets other things work better. I love the smell and it&#x27;s strong enough to work and gentle enough to use anytime.  My skin is pretty sensitive but I never had any trouble with this...always play safe with anything on your face.</li>
