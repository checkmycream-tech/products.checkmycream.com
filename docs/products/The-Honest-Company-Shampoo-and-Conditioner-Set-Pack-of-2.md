    <li> We love these shampoo and conditioner, can&#x27;t say enough good things about them! Creamsicle smell and truly the only tear-free product that doesn&#x27;t make my children cry when I do their hair. NoW, they just introduced new scents! Calming Lavender and invigorating Apricot.  I can&#x27;t wait to try those aromas, here&#x27;s a tip..save $10 from the company with this code 856396</li>
    <li> I like both shampoo and conditioner. I don&#x27;t use the shampoo as body wash but only for my hair. The conditioner really helps me comb thru the tangles  while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I really liked this combo, I just think it&#x27;s a bit too expensive. Hope they give a code, or some kind of sale soon</li>

    <li> I loved the scent of this shampoo &amp; conditioner and my hair was soft and manageable after using it but I gave it away to my niece because I had an allergic rash on my hands after using it.  That happens to me in 9 out of 10 shampoos or lotions I try but I was disappointed because this was such a lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent to these. Not too strong. Unfortunately my daughters have extremely sensitive skin and this wash and conditioner irritates their skin so I can&#x27;t use it with them.</li>
