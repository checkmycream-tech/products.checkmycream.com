      <li>Love the shades.</li>
      <li>I love the colors and I love the mirror inside with the brush included.</li>

      <li>I am so pleased with this palit.</li>
      <li>I love the colors, but I wish they would be more pigmented.</li>
      <li>thanks a lot i receive this item and its very very nice</li>
      <li>love Physician&#x27;s Formula products -- their shimmer strips are so soft in color and shimmer -- beautiful</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a nice all-in-one product, I highly recommend this!!!</li>
      <li>Accurate delivery and packaged well for delivery. :)</li>
      <li>Great product, love that it can be used in many different ways (eyeshadow, face contouring, blush, etc..).</li>
      <li>I think this will accommodate a range of skin tones, from fair to deep, as you can customize your own shade.</li>
      <li>I tend to wear extremely light makeup, so</li>
      <li>My favorite sources for cosmetic safety are Skin Deep by EWG and Good Guide.</li>
      <li>Colors are very soft and the shimmer is light and leaves nice glow.</li>
      <li>The other two rows of brown/golds can be used beautifully as eye shadows as well bronzers</li>
      <li>Love product will re-order again received quickly thanks</li>
      <li>The powders are smooth, easy to apply, and blend very well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really disguise much - so you will have to wear some kind of cover up or concealer underneath if you have any problem areas.</li>
      <li>The colors are very pretty.</li>
      <li>The compact is sturdy, has a beautiful lace pattern, and contains a nice little sponge applicator (that I actually like &amp; use -</li>
      <li>These are really pretty colors!&lt;br /&gt;Great palette for the money!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have this exact item but similar products and most from physicians formula have safe ingredients.</li>
      <li>Awww pretty colors ;-)</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of shimmer without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>Just sweep your brush over the entire palette and you get a great light pink, shimmery color.</li>
      <li>Very high quality colors!</li>
      <li>I like the product very much.</li>
      <li>No really dark or really light with just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
      <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>Many options for different looks.</li>
      <li>A pretty sheen</li>
      <li>I use this product on a daily basis because it is so convenient and has so many uses.</li>
      <li>I have used it as shadow, but I absolutely love using the lighter colors as an inner corner highlight or even a brow bone highlight.</li>
      <li>The colors are easy to mix or use individually for eye shadow, blush, bronzer, or all over powder.</li>
      <li>I was looking for light colors to wear on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not so much that you can&#x27;t wear it to work.</li>
      <li>First of all, I really appreciate Physicians Formula products for their quality ingredients as I have very sensitive skin and eyes.</li>
      <li>Have tried many other brands before and this one really works well on me.  </li>
      <li>Great little set for everyday wear when you don&#x27;t want bold colors looking unprofessional.  </li>
      <li>Full range of highlighters for multiple use.</li>
      <li>I just think eyes look so pretty when there&#x27;s natural colors to showcase them.</li>
      <li>They are made of high quality material and work perfectly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>They are all very light and work well for my pale complexion.</li>
      <li>My one complaint is it comes in a super cheap cardboard container that started ripping after one use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product, love that it can be used in many different ways (eyeshadow, face contouring, blush, etc..). It really brightens up your face without glitter or it being obvious that makeup is doing the trick. It just makes your skin look like it&#x27;s glowing naturally! It also comes with a brush and small angled sponge applicator. The price on Amazon is almost half the price of my local retail stores!!</li>
    <li> I love the colors, but I wish they would be more pigmented.</li>
    <li> This colors are absolutely beautiful. It come with brushes which is a great bonus . The value is also great. I am really enjoying wearing these eye shadows.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this palit. Just amazing I am blonde and it suits me wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Will buy again. I only got 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t actually stay on very long.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and I love the mirror inside with the brush included. very nice</li>
    <li> The brush is terrible, but the product itself is beautiful and goes well with any skintone.</li>
    <li> Great little set for everyday wear when you don&#x27;t want bold colors looking unprofessional.  The little box with applicators in the back will be handy for travel - especially since it can be used as blush, eyeshadow, and bronzer.  I&#x27;m not sure how much of makeup shade is actually present, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find out eventually. Compact and cute</li>
    <li> Nice quality. A pretty sheen but it&#x27;s not so much that you can&#x27;t wear it to work.</li>
    <li> Best mixture of nude skin tones ever! No really dark or really light with just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty. However, I did not realize that they are not &amp;#34;separated&amp;#34; in the box. Therfore, it is very hard to just get one color on an eyeshadow applicator brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim and am so happy that I did. It is a great highlight for the face. Just sweep your brush over the entire palette and you get a great light pink, shimmery color. You can also use these individual as eyeshadows. They have great pigment, a beautiful shimmer and give your eyelid a great, light color. Its amazing for a neutral, yet elegant look. I love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an essential part of my daily makeup bag because of its versatility. First of all, I really appreciate Physicians Formula products for their quality ingredients as I have very sensitive skin and eyes. Many products cause an allergic reaction, but I have had no problems wearing this product on my eyes or skin. I use this product on a daily basis because it is so convenient and has so many uses. I have used it as shadow, but I absolutely love using the lighter colors as an inner corner highlight or even a brow bone highlight. I also use it to highlight my face. Because of the range of shades, you can customize a white, pink, gold, etc. highlight to coordinate with your skin tone or the shades of makeup you are wearing. I love a shimmery highlight, but I don&#x27;t like big chunks of glitter, so this formula is perfect. The powders are smooth, easy to apply, and blend very well. I love to use the row of brown and gold shades as a bronzer for that gorgeous glow. Sometimes I just swirl all the colors together to get a bronze/blush/highlight all in one! The packaging of this product is the icing on the cake! The compact is sturdy, has a beautiful lace pattern, and contains a nice little sponge applicator (that I actually like &amp; use - normally I hate sponge tips), a decent face brush (works in a pinch), a decent sized mirror (I love having mirrors in my compacts!!!), and also directions/ideas on how to use the products on the opposing side of the mirror. I think this will accommodate a range of skin tones, from fair to deep, as you can customize your own shade. If you are looking for a nice all-in-one product, I highly recommend this!!! I truly don&#x27;t have a negative thing to say about it.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Shimmer Strips All-In-1 as a bronzer. It was too &amp;#34;shimmery&amp;#34; for me. I have, though, fallen in love with it as eyeshadow, and use it quite often.</li>
    <li> Amazing pigmentation. However, doesn&#x27;t last too long. That doesn&#x27;t stop me from loving it. Accurate delivery and packaged well for delivery. :)</li>
    <li> thanks a lot i receive this item and its very very nice</li>
    <li> I like the product very much.</li>
    <li> I like this palet - I can use it as a highlighter and as eye shadow.  Nice variety of tones and good coverage.</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented. Works wonders on tan skin!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I was looking for light colors to wear on a daily basis. The powder stays put all day long.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL for highlighting with shimmer, I also use as eyeshadow and sometimes to do a shimmer contour on my cheeks!</li>
    <li> Physicians doesn&#x27;t let me down! Great product.</li>
    <li> Colors are very soft and the shimmer is light and leaves nice glow.</li>
    <li> It came  Damage very disappointed</li>
    <li> What a beautiful palette with so many uses for such a great price! I use this every single day! Sometimes I highlight with it, other days I add it to brighten my blush, and I also find times to use it as an eyeshadow. It is shimmery without being over the top. Such a fun item to add to my daily routine!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and highly pigmented.  Applies very smoothly and looks gorgeous. Excellent for fair to medium skin tone. Natural Nude has almost half of the colors as variants of highlighters as well as pinkish glow powder.  The other two rows of brown/golds can be used beautifully as eye shadows as well bronzers</li>
    <li> I am big on nude and/or neutral colors. I just think eyes look so pretty when there&#x27;s natural colors to showcase them. I have some pretty vivid green eyes, and nude colors just seem to make them pop.&lt;br /&gt;This palette has 12 colors in the pink, peach, tan/brown color range. All of them have shimmer in them, which frankly I would have loved matte, but shimmer isn&#x27;t too bad. I just don&#x27;t really like big sparkle. These are really pretty colors!&lt;br /&gt;Great palette for the money!</li>
    <li> Nice sheen ...no glitter .lovely soft highlight</li>
    <li> The color palette was more sparkly than I was expecting. I was hoping for more of an &amp;#34;ambient glow&amp;#34;. I gave it to a friend .</li>
    <li> My favorite eye shadow of all time!!I use it every day for eyes and also my cheeks to add some highlight</li>
    <li> love Physician&#x27;s Formula products -- their shimmer strips are so soft in color and shimmer -- beautiful</li>
    <li> I love the colors. They are all very light and work well for my pale complexion. There is enough difference in the shades to be noticeable. I&#x27;ve been using it as eye shadow. My one complaint is it comes in a super cheap cardboard container that started ripping after one use. It&#x27;s also a magnetic closure so not very secure for traveling.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the shimmer!</li>
    <li> This is the all over color in one compact. Blush and bronzer with a slight sheen that everyone notices, just don&#x27;t go overboard. A little powder goes a long way which make product last longer. I have had many complements on my skin since using.</li>
    <li> These are really nice to have around.  They are made of high quality material and work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something that shimmers give them a try!</li>
    <li> I am from Florida, and there are a lot of kinds of makeup that I simply can&#x27;t keep in my purse since they melt all over the place because of heat! The highlighter, in particular, has the perfect amount of shimmer to look dewy without being too overdone, while I think I would save the bottom two strips for eyeshadow or bronzer at the beach. I just bought this, but I put all of my other makeup except mascara away inside because it is so simple and doesn&#x27;t take up a bunch of room in my purse.</li>
    <li> Nice all around makeup that is non-toxic. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Love product will re-order again received quickly thanks</li>
    <li> Very high quality colors! I used it as a highlighter and it stay all day!</li>
    <li> Great price here, better than in the stores. BUT its a little TOO shimmery for my liking. Was hoping it would also add some coverage while adding a little shimmer. But no coverage at all. It doesn&#x27;t really disguise much - so you will have to wear some kind of cover up or concealer underneath if you have any problem areas.</li>
    <li> Just as I was hoping. Full range of highlighters for multiple use. Perfect for travel when you don&#x27;t want to bring a bronzer, highlighter, ect with you. Good value. Can cake in creases (I&#x27;m 42), but I have to be careful in general.</li>
    <li> Very nice colors, it wears and looks great in cheeks n eyes!👍</li>
    <li> Nice Pallet of Shimmer...Great that you can use it on your face and eyes....Cute packaging....I&#x27;m very happy with it...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!  Have tried many other brands before and this one really works well on me.  It adds a very nice touch of color without overdoing it.  I use this product on a daily basis now for work!</li>
    <li> My favorite sources for cosmetic safety are Skin Deep by EWG and Good Guide. They don&#x27;t have this exact item but similar products and most from physicians formula have safe ingredients. Also, Physicians Formula doesn&#x27;t test on animals. I wish all the ingredients in this product were vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been keeping this palette in my purse for touchups, etc. The colors are easy to mix or use individually for eye shadow, blush, bronzer, or all over powder. There is a mirror in the back with a little brush and eye shadow applicator with a recommended mix chart for these different uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shimmer effect, while great for eye shadow, minimizes its usefulness when it comes to the rest of the face. It can easily just look bad. I am not likely to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Awww pretty colors ;-)</li>
    <li> Paid more for this elsewhere; should have gotten it here. Got it to use on the fly for refreshing my face. Good size and has all the colors I need. I tend to wear extremely light makeup, so this works well. Just the right amount of shimmer without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very compact little box with a variety of shades that make my skin glow. I use this almost every day!</li>
    <li> Love the shades. It can be used as a bronzer, blush, eye shadow, or all! I usually go with all 3. It also comes with a brush for the face and for the eyes, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. There is a guide to how to use as a bronzer and blush, which may be helpful as well!</li>
    <li> Color is great.  Many options for different looks.</li>
