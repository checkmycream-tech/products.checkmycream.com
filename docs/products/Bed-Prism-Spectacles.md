<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these are just the best -- now I can lie down in bed and watch TV without getting a pain in my neck</li>
    <li> These spectacles hurt my eyes a little while wearing, but they do exactly what they promise- they give you a perpendicular visual of wherever your head is facing.  I use it for reading books in bed, watching movies from my laptop, and sometimes just to be goofy.  If you&#x27;re one who can spend hours in bed, these are an excellent investment for your neck.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! So innovative and useful for when I have an aching neck. Have told my friends and family about this one.</li>
    <li> This product simply isn&#x27;t usable. The lenses aren&#x27;t properly aligned and you see 2-3 blurry images when wearing them. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these glasses as to how well they would work....etc....but finally bought them and I am so please...once of the nicest things I have given myself...I have a bad back and neck....so watching tv was miserable each night....now I just lay flat on my bed with a pillow...put on my glasses....and watch tv....will never be without them...THEY ARE WONDERFUL!!  HAPPY IN OKLAHOMA!! OHH  yes....I do wear them over my reg glasses...if you glasses are real big...might not work....I have the about 10 year old oval glasses...works fine!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I want. The glasses has a good quality, the lens are clear and it fits my head very well. Although it is a little heavy but it doesn&#x27;t matter. I still love it!</li>
    <li> It changed the way I read and watched TV. Just great.&lt;br /&gt;Cambio mi forma de leer y mirar television. Simplemente genial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It&#x27;s a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Advertencia: Son un poco pesados.</li>
    <li> My husband saw bed specs in a movie and wanted them.  I ordered these glasses for him for Christmas and it is his favorite gift.  They are sturdy, not too heavy and the images are crystal clear.  Also, they come in a nice protective case for when you are not using them.  I highly recommend these glasses!</li>
    <li> I bought these glasses on the recommendation of my chiropractor.  I read alot and like to watch TV in bed before I go to sleep.  These are amazing.  I&#x27;d wear them at work if I could just close my office door.  I can lay flat on my back and watch TV without bending my neck.  Same for reading.  If you have neck issues (working on a computer all day and/or leaning over a desk) these glasses provide a nice respite.</li>
    <li> Awesome retailer. The first pair arrived with a crack in the glass. I called and they immediately sent out a new pair. The glasses do work to watch tv laying down.</li>
    <li> I have back problems and my back hurts if I sit down for a long time.  Now I can lay on the carpet, resting my head on a pillow and enjoy TV and films comfortably without putting strain on my back.  I liked these so much that I bought another pair as a present for my dad.  He loved them too.</li>
    <li> purchased this for a friend after a bad accident, allows him to lay in bed and read/watch TV/laptop/ipad/etc without having to sit up/create neck strain...    You look stupid wearing them, but they work really really well...    (Wish they were sized)...</li>
    <li> Great invention from the WWI, Must buy to experience the TV shows in bed !!</li>
    <li> These work really well and make you look ridiculous. The tiger print really makes you seem like a delusional foxy librarian, but they are comfortable and work well.</li>
    <li> Great Idea,  Trouble is the prism fell out onto our floor right away and chipped. Not usable now, so threw away. Loved them for 1/2 a night, but made with good frames and very little holding the prisms in place. It looks like quality control failed on this product.  Would not buy again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Delivered in a most timely manner.. Product was exactly as described... Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great glasses that are built tougher than I thought the would be! Not only kind of fun but actually a &#x27;useable&#x27; product too!</li>
    <li> These are heavier than they look, and ding my nose, but they are still so awesome!</li>
    <li> These things actually work! Takes a while to get used to them and get the book and my tummy in the right place. They reduce the light you see quite a bit. Refraction and all that but not a big problem - use a brighter bulb.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my son in a body cast after back surgery. They take all the strain off his neck from trying to look down while using his laptop and phone.</li>
    <li> Grandsons loved them!  Husband uses them to watch football lying down on the bed.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re going to be a Christmas gift to my dad who watches a lot of tv in bed, so I&#x27;m really excited to give them to him. I think he&#x27;s gonna love them.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom for her spinal fusion recovery, where she needs to lay on her back for 2 weeks. She loves them, great quality and can see perfect out of them.</li>
    <li> the space between the two lenses is too wide for my face! I still use them, but they its an ill fit.</li>
    <li> I have exercises I do most night for physical therapy that require me to lie flat on my back. Staring at the ceiling gets boring. These glasses are great! They are sturdy and clear and I now have no excuse not to exercise.</li>
    <li> The image you see is so distorted you cannot read or watch tv or use them for anything. Both lenses affected, whole image out of focus. Having to lie flat with a prolapsed disc in neck and was needing to use these to read etc. Very very disappointed. Manufacture quality the worst I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE as per item description, no good even as a toy.</li>
    <li> A lovely nurse helped me to get an Rx for one of these after I had neck surgery. I was able to look at the news broadcast for about 45 mins. I was also able to see the door and window and it helped me to feel more secure. My personal care attendant would help me to get into a zero gravity chair then he would put the glasses on me and move the tv around until I could see it. It worked and it was the best part of the evening. Eventually I could look at tv for longer. I looked at all the episodes of a show on How The Universe was created and learned quite a lot about astrophysics. Then I ordered some history dvds from amazon.com. It was better than spending the whole day staring at the ceiling. I could not move my neck for 3 months. If you have a friend or family member who ever gets into a car accident like I did or if someone has neck surgery this would be a great gift. My insurance company paid for it so your friend may even be able to get an Rx for it.</li>
    <li> Made in China.  They feel like they&#x27;re well made and they sort of work, but also have a strong chemical odor and the rubbery plastic feels slightly tacky.  I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable falling asleep with them touching my skin.</li>
    <li> My wife has a problem holding up heavy objects, including books. She loves to read but was not able to read a hardback book while lying down. The glasses enable her to rest the book on her chest an lie completely flat in order to read. When sitting up she leaves it in her lab, look s straight ahead and reads. What a wonderful idea. These glasses are absolutely fantastic. A must for ANYONE with neck or back problems and not really very expensive</li>
    <li> I use these so i can lay in bed and work on my laptop.  Works even better with my wireless keyboard and mouse, as i can move the laptop close to me and my arms out straight.  Much more comfortable than a desk.  I have no physical limitations, its just more comforatable.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 star is the lens poped out and i had to glue it back in.  not a big deal, but the seller should do a bit of quality testing.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use these to read and use a laptop in bed without torquing my neck.  Unfortunately they have two major defects:    1: The prisms were not pointing in the same direction.  This made a double-vision effect looking through them.  2:  The same day I received them a lens fell out and shattered on the floor.    I&#x27;m bummed out these didn&#x27;t work and will try to return them and rate the vendor accordingly.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to but if you&#x27;re getting device related neck pain in bed then this is for you.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Mine came in perfect condition and early. It&#x27;s slightly heavier than I expected (but what can you expect -- it has a bunch of little glass plates in it). The plastic is sturdy and won&#x27;t break easily. The image comes in crystal clear, but is a little smaller than reality (not a biggg deal). The product is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good if you have cervical spine issues.</li>
    <li> I bought these glasses because I have nerve damage in my neck, and need to wear a c-collar when I sleep.  (no pillow)  These glasses allow me to watch TV in bed again, without the drawback of the pain that typically followed when I used a pillow to prop my head.  They did take a bit of getting used to, but I love them.  The one thing that I will say, is \\&quot;Keep them Clean\\&quot;.  Any small smudge will make the your vision almost completely obscure.</li>
    <li> The glasses I received looked nothing like the ones in the photo. They are heavy and look terrible.  Sorry I bought this product.  I should have sent them back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure these glasses will be helpful to those who have to lay in bed to read, but normally I sit and read.... and it&#x27;s a little difficult to stay focused on the words through the prisms. I will not be using them on a continual basis, but I am glad I have then for the occasional times I will read in bed. I&#x27;m thinking that they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> These worked better than I expected. I was concerned about reports here that they are sometimes out of alignment, but mine appear to be perfect. They also feel much sturdier than I expected. They are still just plastic frames, but the weight of the prisms make them feel substantial. Of course if you tried sitting up the weight might be a problem, but that would be a little weird anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal clear view of the TV from laying on my back. Neat.</li>
    <li> These glasses definitely work, but are better suited for reading rather than watching TV because they shrink the size of whatever you watch.  thus, if you&#x27;re more than a couple feet from a TV (and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend lying closer), the tV is too small to see.  As for books and/or a laptop, the product needs to be right up near your chin.  The glasses are soundly made and even look good, but the viewing mirrors are just a little too small and you have to tilt your head up/down/left/right depending on where you are on the page.  Still, if you have a bad neck, these are a good alternative, although lying down for too long makes me sleepy.</li>
    <li> The frame is nice and strong and the prisms line up perfectly, helps me from getting neck pains while studying etc.</li>
    <li> I have used a pair of Bed Prism Specs just like the ones shown in the ad. The pair I received were not the same as those pictured. They were made of a much cheaper plastic and the fit was uncomfortably tight. The lenses were flawed by black marks. I found them to be unusable and returned them immediately.</li>
    <li> My mom got cataract surgery and had to lay on her back for 24 hours.  I bought her these so she could watch TV at least.  She loved em.  They work well for what they are used for.</li>
    <li> I gave these to two friends while they were recuperating from surgery. They loved them as they could read their iPad and books without having to hold them over their head.</li>
    <li> Being a chiropractor, I really love the idea of these prism glasses where you can keep proper posture whilst reading a book sitting, laying down or watching t.v. The only issue is that the temples (the part that wraps around the side of your skull - over the temporal bone) does not open wide enough to fit an adults head. Now, I by no means have what would be considered a large head (at least not in the literal sense). I&#x27;ve tried to modify the hinges by melting the plastic part to allow for it to open wider but to no avail. With it being tight around the head, this causes the lenses to bow inward,distorting the field of vision (almost like a fish eye lens) leading to eye strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend has a different pair that fits just fine and does not distort the lenses giving you eye strain. So, unless you&#x27;re a child, shop elsewhere.</li>
    <li> These are of good enough quality, both in build and optical quality of the prisms seems fine.  They do make reading in bed easier on your neck, but there is an odd sensation in your depth perception, and I think if the prisms were larger, mainly wider, and overlapped between each eye more and gave better peripheral vision, this weird, headache-inducing-after-15-minutes sensation would be minimized.  For the price it was okay to gamble, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless they could reduce that eye strain through a redesign.</li>
    <li> My brother asked for a pair of these for Christmas. I haven&#x27;t given them to him yet of course but I did have to try them out for myself. They actually work really well!! You can lay down flat and still easily and clearly see the TV or a book. They feel comfortable on your face. They are pretty heavy (I&#x27;m assuming because of the mirrors inside) and they feel very solid. I guess I was expecting something a little more cheap feeling so I am impressed! I hope my bro likes them!</li>
    <li> These glasses work fine for reading in bed, since your vision target is 1 foot away from the prisms.  Watching TV (or something else 8+ feet away) is unplesant though... because the prisms are not aimed properly.  They force your eyes to diverge slightly, or else you see double images of everything on-screen.  You can&#x27;t just forget about the glasses and enjoy television, and you can&#x27;t adjust or re-aim the prisms.</li>
    <li> My neck was hurting from watching TV from the bed...  I know you&#x27;re not supposed to do it but when I want to, I want to!  After a while, the propping of pillows was hurting my neck like no one&#x27;s business.  I saw these on a movie, &amp;#34;The Bucket List&amp;#34; and thought how neat it would be to have a pair and try them out.  These things are magnificent!  My head and neck are where they are supposed to be - I&#x27;m starring up at the ceiling watching TV - GENIUS!!!</li>
    <li> When you feel really lazy, it just seems like a great idea to just down flat and either watch TV or read a book.  At first it took a bit to get your eye adjusted to it and to fix your eyes to what you want to look at.  I am unsure about how to rate this product.  It all kind of depends on how you lay in bed and if you wear glasses or not.  If you eyesight isn&#x27;t horrible this would be a fun product to test out.  But, the things is that I just felt lazy.  The spectacles is definitely collecting dust on the side table.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived bent, causing the prisms to be misaligned, once fixed (Hair dryer heat, per reviewers suggestion) they work great.   Using it for iPhone bed reading.</li>
    <li> I like to lie on my back and read in bed. My arms get tired holding my Kindle or book overhead. These are nearly perfect for&lt;br /&gt;reading in this position or watching TV. My only complaint is that they are a little heavy but that&#x27;s because the prisms are made of glass rather than plastic. Using glass is a plus, however, because the view is crystal clear. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied product, price and shipping&lt;br /&gt;would most certainly this again from this company</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband and he loves them! He uses them to read, so can&#x27;t comment on using them for TV. They arrived in perfect alignment, and are well made. He uses reading glasses, so to avoid the need to wear both the bed specs and reading glasses we came up with a solution others might want to use. We bought \\&quot;stick ons\\&quot; that change any pair of glasses into bi-focal reading glasses. They fill the lenses/prisms and work great; you can always remove them if someone else will be using them and doesn&#x27;t need magnification.    At the time I bought them, Scientific&#x27;s Online had the best price and quality for this item on Amazon. I see that someone else now has a better price by about $2.00, but don&#x27;t know if it is worth the risk. I can say I had a perfect experience as far as price, quality, and service from S.O./Edmund&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Very cool idea! I use them watching tv when I am too tired to sit up!</li>
    <li> These are a total waste of money !  They are very uncomfortable and they don&#x27;t work. Like I said a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> My lenses were parallel so there is no double image that i&#x27;ve seen others complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the handles snapped off because it&#x27;s made from stiff plastic. I assume it&#x27;s made of this plastic to stop the lenses not being parallel, but they should change the bits that go over the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are now unusable</li>
    <li> I had to return them because I could not see clearly with them. Poor quality. The concept is great but the execution is poor.</li>
    <li> I now use these babies every night! I like to read in bed, so these are a real life saver for my back and neck. They are a little heavy on the bridge of your nose, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to not use them.</li>
    <li> The product was not damaged upon arrival, just so poorly made that it might as well have been. There is a large mark inside the right lens that cannot be removed, rendering the product useless. I was not given any method of returning the product so it now sits in a drawer where it shall remain due to its structural flaw. I would not recommend this product to anyone due to lack of quality control leading to the shipment of a useless product, bulky and heavy design, and uncomfortable fit.</li>
    <li> While the box was intact and unblemished, the frames were broken right at the bridge. The materials are not very good, so maybe this isn&#x27;t surprising...</li>
    <li> I have had a pinched nerve for about three months. I had to lay flat on my back a lot. I watched \\&quot;The Bucket List\\&quot; and saw Jack Nichelson wearing similar glasses in bed, so I looked for them on Amazon.  I was able to watch tv and my iPad while laying flat.  They are large, so they fit over my glasses enabling me to see better.  I have recommended them to friends who also have to spend some time in bed.  I don&#x27;t consider them a toy, although you could use them to teach about light and refractions.  They are slightly heavy over my glasses, but would still consider purchasing them for anyone who has to spend some time in bed. They saved me from boredom.</li>
    <li> I did NOT receive the product in the photograph...subsequently returned....</li>
    <li> It has changed my out look on passing the time of day.  I have a hard time sitting so I can rest and watch tv in confort.</li>
    <li> These are great for watching tv while laying down.  I wear them when I am doing my Egoscue exercises, which are very time consuming .</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace our old one from Hammler Schlemmer. The gap between the eyes on this pair is a lot wider than my old pair, making it quite hard to see/read comfortably.</li>
    <li> The glasses I got were all black, which makes the main description picture very deceptive. That aside, they do work. I really do love no longer getting cricks in my neck from sitting up in bed for too long. Sometimes however, they confuse my eyes so I have to squint to focus clearly on one thing only. I don&#x27;t use them as much bc they tend to give me a headache or worse, an eye ache.</li>
    <li> ..she loves to read and she definitely uses these, but mostly for fun.  They do work well though :)  Very nice!</li>
    <li> This product was nothing like the picture showed, very misleading and disappointing when you get what you didn&#x27;t order. This is the second time this has happened, please remove  the image of a tourtoise pair and show the real one that you send to your clients, which is a cheaper version made out of black plastic.</li>
    <li> These are crystal clear and work very well, however, when laying flat, they touch my eyelashes. The arms are a bit long. The weight makes them painful (for me) to wear.</li>
    <li> These are five star if they had more padding for nose and face. If you wear them long, they will leave a mark. Otherwise, fantastic! I may try some mole skin.</li>
    <li> I had great hopes for these glasses because I have a bad neck.    The part that works is great! The prism makes the text very bright &amp; clear &amp; I can keep my head flat.  BUT, I can only read the bottom half of the page unless I hold the glasses &amp; tip them, &amp; tilt my head farther back, etc.  These would be perfect if I could read the whole page.</li>
    <li> Design could point the prisms in more, instead of being perfectly parallel. With parallel placement, while reading up close, there&#x27;s some interference from the edge of the prisms and sometimes only one eye is doing the work. They&#x27;re also pretty heavy, and after a couple of hours I start to have some eye fatigue. I think the amount of time you can tolerate the glasses will vary depending on the user. My brother put them on and immediately got disoriented and nauseous. Then, again, maybe he was moving his head too much, rather than sitting stationary and reading...which is what these should primarily be used for.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. I use it to watch tv or use my tablet while laying down. It&#x27;s just heavier than I would like. But it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. I knocked one star off for it being too heavy on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my brother-in-law but my sister loves it too, so I ordered another one for her.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really convenient for people laying down and watching either TV or iPad, and gradually falling into sleep. :-)</li>
    <li> I rated high because i get strain bending my neck at a 45 or something angle when on my laptop or watching a movie at my bed and the next day Im really sore. SO i got these glasses and if you lay back and keep the laptop or tv in front of you and lay your back full 180 degrees and open your eyes , you can watch it clearly through the glasses. Its a great buy.</li>
    <li> It works quite well for reading or watching TV while laying on your back. Not often I do that though, but if you must..</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for these despite mediocre reviews, and was really disappointed when they arrived. The lenses aren&#x27;t aligned so I see double and get a headache rather quickly after putting them on. Some other reviewers mentioned bending them to fix them, but in my case the problem is with the lenses themselves and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to fix the problem without tearing them apart. Maybe the pair I got was a dud, but if you decide to take a chance and pick these up be prepared to return or toss them.</li>
    <li> I got these for my girlfriend for her Birthday, she reads a lot. She instantly loved them and shows everyone she knows about them. They all love them too. Super good quality and durable.</li>
    <li> I loved the glasses so much I showed them to everyone in our family.  Now they all want them.</li>
    <li> Mostly just confused.  I ordered this product twice and got 2 different items.  Both are similar but not exactly the same.  Both sets of glasses serve their purpose.  I can read in bed while maintaining better neck posture.  I&#x27;m focused on reversing forward head posture and this was one of my tools to reach that goal.  I don&#x27;t read without them anymore</li>
    <li> I assumed that for ten bucks, these would be cheap and flimsy; however, they are terrific! The frames are heavy and sturdy, the optics are very good and crystal clear, and it came with two protective cases: a drawstring pouch and soft faux-leather sleeve. These are on the bedside table, where I enjoy using them to read and watch television without bending my head forward and creating neck strain. For reading traditional paper books, be sure you have a good lamp. It does take some extra light to reflect a sufficiently bright image with the extra optics built into these spectacles. This won&#x27;t be noticeable with devices that produce their own light source (i.e. e-readers and televisions), though.</li>
    <li> This item arrived and was in good condition.  The description was accurate.  I would shop from this vendor again. Flipped temples to use for belaying people while rock climbing-saved a fortune.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars as my son-in-law requested them for his b&#x27;day. He loves them. Having much fun with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also bought black versions of these, and the black material is less slippery / stays on my nose better.</li>
    <li> These glasses are great for reducing stress on your neck while reading.  It allows you to keep better posture or to rest easier.  It has been especially helpful with my arthritis, allowing me to read comfortably without any straining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these prism glasses so I can read in bed while laying on my back. I can rest my book on my abdomen and just relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that they are great for reading while sitting upright.  If I am sitting I can rest a book (or Kindle) in my lap and continue looking forward without straining my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: They are tight across my face (I&#x27;m a male and I may have a large head). They are dorky looking so my wife laughs often.</li>
    <li> Major and persistent neck problems do not allow me to sit for any extended period. These glasses work perfectly for laying down and reading. Not the most attractive glasses, but very functional.</li>
    <li> I had cataract surgeries and I have floaters in right eye and I need coorective glasses. Therefore the prism glasses are not for me.</li>
    <li> This glass help me a lot; I need to read or watch TV before fall in sleep, with this glass I can lie down to watch TV and won&#x27;t  bend my neck. This glass is not feel heavy on my face.</li>
    <li> No stiff neck, so stiff back. Lots cheaper than an adjustable bed!</li>
    <li> I love these!! They work perfectly for me. No problem with the image. Not too heavy. The glasses came in a nice carrying pouch which was a nice bonus. Great for any avid  reader!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good idea. I don&#x27;t use them as much as I thought I might and the amber color is very dorky, but overall the do what they say.</li>
    <li> When my wife had trouble sitting for extended periods, I mounted a flat screen TV on the bedroom wall.  When she is resting her back by lying flat on the bed, she sometimes uses these.  We have no complaints except that they become heavy on the bridge of the nose after 1/2 hr to 1 hour.  They also seem to make the TV picture a little smaller (that may be simply perception), however I wear them with glasses and have no problem doing so.  The picture is crystal clear.  I&#x27;ve not had the problem some report of double vision.  In general, I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and the functionality of these glasses.  I would gladly have given them 5 stars if they were a little lighter.  Having said that, I think the fact that the optics are real glass is the reason the view is so clear when you look through them.</li>
    <li> Clear. Fog up a bit when I lay down though. But I love them.</li>
    <li> Gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;Image clarity was good.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to give these a five-star rating. Such a cool idea, and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the specs are just TOO DAMN HEAVY. After a few minutes, the weight becomes an annoyance. A few minutes later, it&#x27;s intolerable. I hope you guys come up with a model 2.0, at about a fifth the weight. Until then, my wife&#x27;s pair (I bought them as a gift) just sits on the night stand gathering dust.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for! Love it!</li>
    <li> These glasses do what they are supposed to do, but the awesome part is the prominent tortoise frames.  Way better than the plain gray!  Cute, but also funny all at once.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Product works better than I expected. I was skeptical but for just under $9 I figured it was worth a try. The quality of the frames was a lot better than I expected for the price. They work great and I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was a cool product I bought for my mom because she likes to read in bed. I have a sensitive stomach to motion sickness and these do not make me feel nauseous. It is a fun buy, so if you&#x27;re thinking you want this, go for it. The mirrored image takes up about 95% of what you see, so there aren&#x27;t major gaps.</li>
    <li> These are ideal and allow me to do my exercises while watching TV.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of these (what is pictured, a tortoise shell pair of glasses) for the past 7 years and they not only worked well, the  vision was clear and they were very comfortable, however these are not what I was shipped. What I received was a cheap pair of black plastic prism glasses which were never very clear and broke (the cheap plastic just snapped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept them hoping they would work, assumed the other kind that I liked weren&#x27;t made any longer  and then realized the month long time frame Amazon gives you to return purchases had expired.</li>
    <li> Lying flat in bed to watch TV on top of dresser at foot of California King. Before I got these, I needed lots of pillows - but when I fell asleep watching TV, I&#x27;d wake up with a stiff neck.&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the earpieces were adjustable/flexible. These are not. For the price I am very happy.</li>
    <li> The glasses are not anywhere near 0.3 ounces. I would believe 3 ounces.</li>
    <li> Inferior product, there are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these, I was expecting some cheap overpriced piece of plastic that the blue photo implies. What I got was much better. It is a heavy and durable pair of glasses with a slight black felt (matte?) feel to it. Unlike the negative reviews here, mine was aligned perfectly. The prisms are clear and were just what I needed.</li>
    <li> A not-so-close friend dragging out an already boring anecdote about their daughter&#x27;s graduation&#x27;s fishing trip&#x27;s cat&#x27;s- you stopped listening long ago- and you simply have to see if your Facebook status hit any likes yet? Easy with the Bed Prism Spectacles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the age old dilemna: Your back hurts, you need to lay down, but Grey&#x27;s Anatomy just came on. What can you do?! The answer is very close, my friends. Bed Prism Spectacles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bed Prism Spectacles are perfect for restless souls who desire nothing more than to gaze into the depths of the night sky with all the longings of their heart and still score points on Flappy Bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, your friends will notice that you are wearing incredibly bulky glasses that don&#x27;t seem to look straight ahead. Of course. But they&#x27;re fantastic glasses, and they&#x27;ll immediately want their own pair, and no one will know that no one is paying attention to anyone.</li>
    <li> These glasses arrived smashed. They were shipped flat packed in an envelope, so I&#x27;m not surprised. Nobody should have been surprised, considering the extremely flimsy quality of the cheap plastic. One star.</li>
    <li> This is not a toy, but can be very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it at the suggestion of my Physical Therapist. Was having neck&lt;br /&gt;and pinched nerve problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asked if I watch TV in bed with my head propped up with a pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUILTY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to lie flat on your back and watch TV or read a book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks and feels a bit strange but will fit over glasses and gives you such a&lt;br /&gt;focus you think you are seeing more clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little heavy but can be adjusted since you are on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be invaluable for an extended hospital stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with a sleep apnea mask you could do a great Hannibal Lechter impression !  :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased mine from MyEyewear2Go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glasses were much heavier than I imagined and than I thought should be necessary.  I wore them over my glasses and they pressed my glasses&#x27; nosepads into my face, so they were uncomfortable to use for more than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were also bent/misaligned in two axes - there was overlap in my vision and lines on the computer screen wouldn&#x27;t line up, but instead intersect in an &#x27;X&#x27; shape.  From reading other reviews, I could&#x27;ve tried heating them up and bending them myself, but I didn&#x27;t want to take that risk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bent problem may be the seller&#x27;s fault, but the weight is a fault of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is a good idea but execution wasn&#x27;t good.  I ended up returning them (the return went smoothly) and will try another model from here or ebay.</li>
    <li> I was very sceptical about these glasses. Right after I ordered I almost cancelled my order but I got them today and I am glad that I did. The box that they came in is all in Japanese or Chinese idk bcz I cannot read it but who cares! They work! No mo neck pain!!! 😄</li>
    <li> Note: THIS IS NOT A TOY though it is classified as such when you try to review it. For purposes of reviewing it, I consider it a real and quite helpful assistive device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran across these while looking at health care items for people with back/neck problems, of which I am one. I have myofascial pain syndrome, TMJ and bruxism, plus I wear a size 46 DDD bra -- all of which sometimes bring on horrific back spasms or tension migraines. MPS is like fibromyalgia but not as chronic; it waxes and wanes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my bf/fiancee bought these prism glasses for me for my birthday. Laying flat on my back on the floor or couch or in bed is my favorite position to watch videos or go online, at home. With the laptop or netbook on my stomach in front of me, and using some kind of ergonomic mouse rather than the touchpad of my netbook/laptop, I can go for a couple of hours without needing a break -- long enough to watch a standard length movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, that position required one or two pillows to prop my head up. That, in turn, would stretch my neck and make it stiff if done for long periods of time with no break. Then I&#x27;d be in pain for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with these!! I can now lay flat on my back, with no pillow, and watch vids from the hard drive of my netbook or streaming via Netflix. I can also read laying flat on my back, if I hold the book on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To illustrate, imagine that you see me laying flat on my back in bed. My eyes are pointed at and facing the horizontal plane of the ceiling. Yet with the glasses on, I can see a vertical laptop screen or book held open on my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only a couple issues with these glasses. For me, the pupil to pupil distance isn&#x27;t quite right. So there is a noticeable area of lack of overlap between the visual field of my right eye vs. the visual field of my left eye. However, this is not a deal breaker -- I can put up with it if it means no strain on my neck or back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because of the prisms, these glasses are quite heavy. I have to wear them over my regular glasses. This is normally not that big of a deal. However, the last week I have been sick with quite a bad sinus infection. Earlier today when I was using these prism glasses over my regular glasses, the combined weight of them on the bridge of my nose was rather painful because of the sinus infection and pressure behind my nose. I eventually had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just be aware of the issues of the pupil-to-pupil distance and the heaviness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the prisms aren&#x27;t actually prisms per se. It&#x27;s more accurate to say they&#x27;re prism-shaped mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With real prisms, the light and images would go right through them, although they&#x27;d be diffused and blurred. It&#x27;s because these prisms are mirrored that it is possible to lie flat, face the ceiling, and watch something that is vertical in front of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad my bf/fiancee bought me these.</li>
    <li> I was worried about this item not matching the description on the website so I depended on the other spectacles review before I took the risk to purchase it. The result was I&#x27;m glad to have this Bed Prism Spectacles. The material wasn&#x27;t a cheap plastic glasses frame with sticker like mirror on it. The spectacle felt a bit heavier than my regular glasses which didn&#x27;t really made a different to wear it. I got used to the Bed Prism Spectacles which let me read as I lay completely on my back and I don&#x27;t bend my neck when I sit up. However, it&#x27;s hard to use the spectacle if you already wear glasses which I can only use when I wear my contact lens. Happy to read more books without getting worry about my neck or arm getting sore. That is my personal review for the Bed Prism Spectacles.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well these do work.  They are a bit too heavy for me to wear for a long time, though.</li>
    <li> Needed this for only 3 days and nights after surgery. But it permitted me to see a TV screen during recovery lying flat on my back.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of these things. I always hurt my neck sitting up in bed at night. The only problem is that they are very heavy to have sitting on your head and that really affects their functionality. Also, the box that these came in was all in Chinese. I gave them to a friend as a gift, but she didn&#x27;t even know what they were because the box wasn&#x27;t in English. We all tried them out and they are very fun and practical when using for a few minutes, but I think that sustained use would be very difficult because of the weight of them on your face. It might be better just to buy something to prop up your back (unless you suffer from a medical issue).</li>
    <li> This pair of bed glasses are super great. These fit over my regular glasses. What a plus. My others didn&#x27;t work that way. These are wonderful and comfortable, too.</li>
    <li> There is grease and scrum with fingerprints inside the lenses. This makes the lenses blurry and it is difficult to see anything through them. There is no way to open the lenses to clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is frustrating and I am sending these back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I love the concept, it really takes the strain off my neck when reading in bed, but here are two issues I had using it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1: the lens are not properly aligned, it will take a few minutes for your brain to naturally compensate so you can focus and read properly without double vision. It&#x27;ll also take a minute to adjust every time you remove the glasses, you&#x27;ll feel slightly crosseyed. Maybe a precise alignment can only be done with an optometrist and it&#x27;s not the manufacturer&#x27;s fault, either way, it&#x27;s something worth knowing before you buy these glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2: if you&#x27;re reading something glowing, like the screen of a Kindle, or watching TV in the dark, you&#x27;ll get more light in your field of view (FOV), because you&#x27;ll be able to see the TV on the lower edge of your eye (where the TV actually is), through the prism lens in front of you, and also a bit more on a prism reflection on the upper edge of your FOV. It can be a bit distracting.</li>
    <li> These work amazing. I got them for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They can be a little disorienting but the work exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Wanted them since I saw Bucket List. They are fantastic. Perfect right out of the box. Sit back in my reclined or lay in bed reading. Love them</li>
    <li> I paid extra to have 2day shipping.  I know they said it wouldn&#x27;t be available for shipping until Monday,but I didn&#x27;t receive it until Friday!  As far as the glasses, they are amazing.  Very sturdy frames with plenty of room for a good fit.  Previous ones I have had were quite flimsy and very tight fitting. So good glasses, not so good shipping experience.</li>
    <li> The prisms have to converge on the book you are holding, or the TV you are watching, in order for this gadget to work.. They do not. You cannot adjust them either.  Worthless.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic quality, and so useful! Whenever the family comes over, they all fight over who gets to wear them to watch movies. :P  These are great and work SO well!</li>
    <li> I got a pair of glasses just like this as a gift, and they amount to one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve ever received. Unfortunately, my daughter bent one of the arms. So, I found these and ordered a pair. After using them for 10 minutes, I realized that the angle of the mirrors, which is supposed to be 90 degrees, were off in one eye, making things blurry and giving me a headache. I returned them and ordered a second pair, with the same problem. I&#x27;m back to using my original pair, despite the bent arm...</li>
    <li> fun, not really used often</li>
    <li> I wanted the glasses that give you a view of the back of the room while you are in an MRI.  These do not do that.  No good for claustrophobia people. I ended up buying a $10 eye mask, that did the trick just fine.  What you can&#x27;t see, sometimes you can&#x27;t fear.  Mind over matter.</li>
    <li> I requested  two pairs ; one for me and other for my sister. They worked good for her but for me did not. Maybe because the distance between  my pupils are too close. So they did not work so weel . My sister is pleased with them when she watches tv. I must look for someone who wants to buy them becuase I&#x27;m in Costa Rica and return them is more expensive for me .&lt;br /&gt;When I saw them in the photo, they seemed to have the prisms not too centered  in the middle of the frame as the ones I recieved. So that is why they did not work for me. I wish I could post a picture of the ones I recieved to compare them with the picture posted  on Amazon so you can see the difference.</li>
    <li> This helped my neck pain better than ANY other product I tried.  I wish they would improve the glasses though - the window is too small, they get smudged easily, and they are bulky.  I would prefer a larger, single prism across both eyes for better sight range, even if it did make them bulkier.</li>
    <li> has good field of vission&lt;br /&gt;has dark sides of prism so its easy to focus forward&lt;br /&gt;i will order more</li>
    <li> These glasses are of a higher quality than I anticipated! I bought them for my high school age kids so they could get their reading homework done while doing static e-cises. What an outstanding time management tool! Thank you DynamicLiving.com!</li>
    <li> I HAD A OPERATION THAT I HAD TO KEEP MY HEAD DOWN 24/7 THE GLASSES I HAD LOOKED LIKE THEM BUT I COULD VIEW TELEVISION WHILE SEATING NOT THESE YOU HAVE TO BE LYING DOWN</li>
    <li> The product and seller were PERFECT. The item was on it&#x27;s way before I woke up the next day. It was delivered on Friday instead of the next Monday as projected on the tracking site. The product had not one flaw. It was perfectly focused, perfectly clean, and the quality was outstanding. My neck no longer hurts.&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand why this is classified as a toy. I consider it a medical device. A hospital stay and prolonged recovery is in my future. These prism specs will be within arms reach for the entire time. I know the reading and tv time will be much healthier and more pleasant because of them.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say? Oh yes, the price was entirely reasonable.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time and it&#x27;s really useful. I would recommend these to anyone plus they&#x27;re a fun conversation starter.</li>
    <li> My partner wears these every night while we are watching TV in bed.  They are amazing work just like advertised.</li>
    <li> There are many types of prism glasses out there&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased other 2 pairs of adjustable reversible prism glasses&lt;br /&gt;for $89 a couple of months ago. they both broke because they were&lt;br /&gt;made of very fragile plastic and the design was very poor with weak&lt;br /&gt;spots easy to brake even if you just hold them by handle. Besides they were&lt;br /&gt;very heavy. This ones which I bought to replace the broken ones not only&lt;br /&gt;that are at a fraction of the cost of the fragile ones but are much&lt;br /&gt;sturdier and light, and pretty and much better.&lt;br /&gt;Marian, Burbank</li>
    <li> I gave these 4 only &#x27;cause they&#x27;re a little heavy on the bridge of my nose but a little padding underneath is just fine and they truly meet my needs. My small tv sits on top of my dresser so I keep having to keep my lids very low and that causes me to become sleepy faster.I prop up on my side trying to compensate and that bothers my neck &amp; shoulders eventually. The bed prism specs lets me avoid that. Happy to have them!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used these, I feel like there should be some made, not at 45 angles, but maybe 30, because you have to lay literally flat on your back to watch television, and can&#x27;t be elevated really at all.</li>
    <li> Allows me to lay flat in bed and watch some TV before falling asleep.  The quality of the picture is awesome.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy on the nose. After a while you want to quit. But works ok. I guess there must be lighter ones on the market, though.</li>
    <li> My eyes fatigue much faster with these - saves the neck though. My friends and family got a great laugh when we all tried these on. The image quality was surprisingly sharp and stunning to me.</li>
    <li> I recently had back surgery and spent a lot of time in bed.  These are the perfect glasses for watching TV while on your back.  I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> The field of vision leaves much to be desired, there is also a ghosted image that is very annoying but can be tuned out. I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> These are great sturdy glasses that work real well.  I love being able to lay flat in the bed and watch television without having to prop myself up on pillows as before.</li>
    <li> Loved them! The image is crystal clear and they&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for someone who had a corneal transplant with some follow up procedures which required him to to lay flat on his back facing the ceiling for extended hours. With these glasses he was able to watch t.v., read, etc. His surgeon was even impressed with them &amp; is thinking about ordering a pair for her office! Nice frames too.  They look like tortoise shell.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a suggestion from my physical therapist. I do an exercise where I lay down on the ground for an hour. I like to watch tv or read, this allows that. Truly a quality piece. Note it smells weird but that will go away. Its made in china but is well made.</li>
    <li> useful for reading or watching</li>
    <li> These work great buy are very heavy on the bridge of my nose...</li>
    <li> this is by far one of the best things to buy, i have neck problems and this makes it so much better</li>
    <li> I love watching about an hour of TV in bed before I go to sleep.  Sitting against the headboard is not comfortable and these spectacles are the perfect answer.  Although having to wear glasses makes for problem.  I ended up buying a pair of small reading glasses at the dollar store, and Viola, problem solved.  Now I can watch for as long as I can stand to lay in one position.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I use these spectacles with my net book on my belly at night in bed . What I need is a steady surface to put the net book like a lap -breakfast table or something . Every time I breathe my belly goes up and down ,but that&#x27;s another story . As far as the duration of wearing them over my bi-focals ,a hour is the limit . They seem to be good and also somewhat heavy items. Glass prism and good plastic frames. They are not perfect nor are we . I have to invent something better , but this is a good start .</li>
    <li> the prisms were misaligned</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gimmick gift for my brother, ended up buying some for myself. these things rock! I can lay in bed comfortably without straining my neck and work on my laptop or read a book. They&#x27;re a little heavy, but you get use to it, no headaches, or strains that I&#x27;ve experienced. If I needed a job I&#x27;d go rep for these guys! lol.</li>
    <li> Great for reading in bed without a pillow.</li>
    <li> They are not straight, so they give me a headache.</li>
    <li> These prism glasses are perfect in bed for watching TV or reading without any neck strain whatsoever (because the neck is on the same flat plane as the body). It does create problems for anyone who normally has to wear bifocals to see a seven to ten foot distance clearly and sharply, because the prisms can&#x27;t be arranged to cover only the distance part of the glasses. There is also a slight rainbow effect, but not disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;The glasses are well-made and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The prism glasses from this manufacturer were perfect. I can easily read a book or watch TV lying down in bed. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;(PS Don&#x27;t know why the review for these prism glasses includes questions like \\&quot;How much fun is this Toy?\\&quot;) since they are not toys &amp; similar glasses aren&#x27;t in toy category.</li>
    <li> These work as advertised, with the little annoyance that part of the reflection will be inverted near the top of the viewing position. They&#x27;re great for reading on your back while on your bed or even browsing the internet on a laptop. I wish there were more options for the color patterns but other than that it functions very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 3 pairs of these to save my neck while watching TV. I use them daily. But the first set I got was smaller and would balance on my glasses perfectly. The second set is too large, and the third set won&#x27;t fit over my glasses. These vary greatly and should be advertised by width so a person can get the right size.</li>
    <li> I swear this is the best thing ever for lazy people who wants to watch tv or shows on their ipad while lying down. Or read books. Srsly, get one.</li>
    <li> Excellent gift. works fine for me. Supplier is glad to aid if problems arise.</li>
    <li> The plastic frame is somewhat misaligned, so the views from each eye will not be parallel, thereby straining your vision&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick way to fix this is to cook rice using a rice cooker or boil water using a whistling kettle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it over the steam to heat up the middle of the frame and gently bend it to shape. Be careful not to break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the glass prisms are not glued strongly enough and might fall spontaneously on your eyeballs. I suggest popping them out and crazy-glue them back on for assurance.</li>
    <li> High quality mirrors but would be better if you could adjust the angle of the mirrors.</li>
    <li> I think this is such a cool idea and although the product I received has a couple of flaws, I still love them and ignore the imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The glasses are a bit heavy which is understandable but you have to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;-There is a double reflection at times but the second image is much more faint and easy to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;-There is a small semi circle spot at the very bottom of my line of vision (could be my nose though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had these about a week and have gotten over the initial urge to return because they weren&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; and I LOVE them otherwise. My neck doesn&#x27;t hurt when reading and it helps me be and stay comfortable when I&#x27;m watching something to go to sleep! So glad I got these :)</li>
    <li> These things are awesome! The pair I received are not like the pair in the picture. They are made from sturdy plastic and are shaped like classic cheap sunglasses (that is just their SHAPE, not construction). As I said, they are very sturdy and do not slide off of your face (assuming you are laying down on your back). They&#x27;re a great buy, but be prepared to have to readjust your depth perception once you put them on.</li>
    <li> I love these things -- they very well made and they really do work!  No more neckaches from laying on the couch or in the bed trying to read or watch t.v.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of the product and it works well enough but there is a gap in between the lenses that causes a blurred patch in the center of the field of view. A bit disappointing, but if you don&#x27;t mind, FANTASTIC.</li>
    <li> I have back problems. Lying flat on my back helps. I was one weekend project away from installing a TV on the ceiling when I saw these. For the price, I figured they&#x27;d be flimsy, hazy, and basically disposable, but I tried them because it was easier than mounting a TC on the ceiling. WOW! These are solid, durable glasses that are very clear to look through. My back loves me again. I think I am an inch taller because of these glasses. Buy them. Actually, buy two. Someone you know needs these.</li>
    <li> I use them to read while siting up straight or when laying in bed (because I have a bad back). But the prisms aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned so it might bother some people. Very Unique product, everyone I showed them too was astonished.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be cheap flimsy material. No they aren&#x27;t. They look nice too and very very functional. I got them for my husband as he wants to lay down and study, but the positions strain him and he has neck problems. Now he can study in comfort. I want a pair now too. He&#x27;s hoarding his lol.</li>
    <li> It works better than I thought it would. The optics are coated and I could easily wear my glasses under them.  I highly recommend these, a great price for a high quality and functional device.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day.  He tried using them but the eyes were too close together so it made him cross eyed.  They work fine for my younger siblings, though.  I wish they would have worked.  It&#x27;s such a neat idea.</li>
    <li> These really work. Simple, but very cool!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband as a funny stocking stuffer and he actually likes wearing these in bed!  No more neck strain and discomfort.</li>
    <li> These are so cool. They really work!</li>
    <li> they worked out  great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé who has neck issues and now reading books and watching tv while in bed just got a whole lot easier for him!</li>
    <li> These specs are very well made and attracvtive. However, the plastic closed in frame, makes my  eyes burn from the heat. Also, you really should get adjustable lenses. I was pleased at the selection and price, and would buy other items from this dealer.</li>
