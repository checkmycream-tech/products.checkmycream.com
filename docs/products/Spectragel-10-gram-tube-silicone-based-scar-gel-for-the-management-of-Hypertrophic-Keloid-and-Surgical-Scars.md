      <li>i just like to think that its the magic taking over and making is invisible,</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I think these product is not the top scar gel but</li>
      <li>I know its early to see the effectiveness of the gel, happy with the results though.</li>
      <li>Since then, I have tried Curad Advanced Scar Therapy Advanced Gel Discs and Cica Care Silicone Gel Sheets.</li>

      <li>olive oil kind of did the same thing</li>
      <li>However, I am sure it will take a while to completely flatten this stubborn scar.</li>
      <li>For all the effort I spent dealing with the product I would have loved for it to work.  </li>
      <li>But the price is right</li>
      <li>Be sure to use it everyday for greater improvement.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very regret, because I could have buy something useful.</li>
      <li>The scarring is more flat than it was months before.</li>
      <li>the company says it works pretty much just for keloid scars...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much to mitigate the scar.</li>
      <li>The one on my arm diminished but is still there, just much improved.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works; it works faster if you follow the application directions.  </li>
      <li>I tried using makeup to cover my scars but they were still very visible because they were so raised and puffy.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend thanks again .. . . .</li>
      <li>Super glue and honey mixed up together - that&#x27;s what it   feels like on your skin</li>
      <li>thinking i was older because the scars had changed the way my face looked..</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t purchase this again after using scar gels that actually get absorbed.</li>
      <li>I am only applying it once a day, and still see very positive results after 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>I have been using the gel everyday for just over a month and the scar is very much diminished...and most likely after 1 year</li>
      <li>that was supposed to get rid of scars like Palmers Cocoa Butter Scar Serum and New Skin Scar Fade</li>
      <li>I developed Keloid Scarring along with hypertrophic scarring.</li>
      <li>It is too early to state if it works or not.</li>
      <li>But so far, it works and I&#x27;m going to order another tube.</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste your money.</li>
      <li>Wow. MUST USE FAITHFULLY EVERY DAY.</li>
      <li>This gel was sticky, tacky, and never dried on my skin.  </li>
      <li>It got to the point where the Keloid was more than an inch thick and my mom was scared and feared I might need surgery again to remove it.</li>
      <li>White lines are fading to nearly normal skin color!     </li>
      <li>Started using Spectragel 9 weeks after knee replacement surgery which left a large, red, raised scar.</li>
      <li>Dec 2010-Flat white scars became nearly unnoticeable lines.  </li>
      <li>Just after one month of using this stuff I can barely feel the scars if I run my finger across them.  </li>
      <li>I used this product everyday after breast reduction surgery and saw results right away.</li>
      <li>I have been to the dermatologist for steroid injections and tried various other gels to help minimize the scars, but this is the first product that has flattened my keloid scars.</li>
      <li>and it does NOT dry</li>
      <li>only thing thats different about this over the other scar creams i used like Palmers and New Skin is that its nothing but Dimethicone the only ingrediant..</li>

<li> only thing thats different about this over the other scar creams i used like Palmers and New Skin is that its nothing but Dimethicone the only ingrediant..</li>
<li> i used a crapload of natural oils and cocoa butter plus other stuff</li>
<li> Then the scars became flat white scars.  </li>
<li> Pretty thick</li>
<li> /&gt;i just rubbed it on the scars with a flat toothpick and put vaseline and jojoba oil on it too.. for dry skin</li>
<li> I just had surgery and have a long cut.</li>
<li> and it goes a long way!</li>
<li> but they&#x27;re mixed with other stuff..</li>
<li> In months before,the keloid was dry and raised.</li>
<li> i finally used this 6/7 months later and the small knife looking scars started to blend in and fade</li>
<li> This stuff was super expensive too.  </li>
<li> A waste of my money, and I bought the big one too.</li>
<li> But there has to be something that actually dries and isn&#x27;t as messy and noticeable as Spectragel.</li>
<li> it didn&#x27;t work, I spent my money for nothing.</li>
<li> I have a big scars and small scars used it on all</li>
<li> I had some small scars on my face from trying to get rid of some milia bumps with a needle... and finally after using this stuff for about a month my face looks like it used to look 2 years ago before i started getting the bumps...</li>
<li> This took it down to pink slightly raised scars.   </li>
<li> Only complaint is how sticky it is.</li>
<li> Both of those keep falling off, so I&#x27;m back to using this Spectra Gel because at least it seems to stay on.  </li>
<li> I have wasted time and lots of money on other products that claim to diminish the appearance of keloid scars.  </li>
<li> I was say about a half inch.</li>
<li> Now, its less than that.</li>
<li> It wouldn&#x27;t remove it, but it&#x27;ll make it less</li>
<li> The description here on Amazon says, \\&quot;dries in 5 to 10 minutes\\&quot;; not true.  </li>
<li> still not got improvement , I will wait little bit and evaluate it again .</li>
<li> Buy a little tube and see for yourself.     </li>
<li> This was a waste of money for my surgical scar.  </li>
<li> You just have to apply it everyday on your scares as instructed.</li>
<li> I have two small keloid scars from years ago.</li>
<li> PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else!</li>
<li> been getting hard stares all my life up until my skin started acting crazy a couple years ago  </li>
<li> been getting hard stares all my life up until my skin started acting crazy a couple years ago</li>
<li> I had thick keloid scars under my breast after implant surgery.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick and gooey like,</li>
<li> I waste my time to same my face from a terrible scare.</li>
<li> This product is useless on my keloid scars on chest.</li>
<li> not perfectly you have to be patient with it .</li>
<li> but my face looked so bad  </li>
<li> I was quite disappointed .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve had these raised keloids on my face for 20 years after a burn that occured when I was younger. Nothing that doctors have given me has made it go away, so i thought why not try it out? What have I got to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick and gooey like, but I swear it works. Be sure to use it everyday for greater improvement.  If you get a tingle, ignore it. i just like to think that its the magic taking over and making is invisible, haha. Must try!</li>
    <li> The description here on Amazon says, \\&quot;dries in 5 to 10 minutes\\&quot;; not true.  It  never dries, but remains sticky and shiny.  If your scars are visible, they are even more noticeable and people will ask, \\&quot;What happened?\\&quot;  Also, you will have to find a way to cover them when you sleep so this stuff does not get all over your bedding.  Does it work?  No idea.  But there has to be something that actually dries and isn&#x27;t as messy and noticeable as Spectragel.</li>
    <li> It seemed like a good product at the time, but my wife uses it and no change at all in her condition.</li>
    <li> I had some small scars on my face from trying to get rid of some milia bumps with a needle... and finally after using this stuff for about a month my face looks like it used to look 2 years ago before i started getting the bumps... i used a crapload of natural oils and cocoa butter plus other stuff i bought off of here that was supposed to get rid of scars like Palmers Cocoa Butter Scar Serum and New Skin Scar Fade and none of them worked... after using all that stuff i finally used this 6/7 months later and the small knife looking scars started to blend in and fade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wasnt sure if it would work becuz the company says it works pretty much just for keloid scars... the kind that look like a bump.... not too many scar creams say they can get rid of scars made by needles or knives...  it only took about a week to see the difference.. fist time i rubbed it in it plumped the skin around the line scar up and it stayed that way... olive oil kind of did the same thing but it would go back to looking the same after a couple days... this stuff made the scar blend in more and more everytime i used it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing thats different about this over the other scar creams i used like Palmers and New Skin is that its nothing but Dimethicone the only ingrediant.. the others have dimethicone in it but they&#x27;re mixed with other stuff.. the ingrediant in this says polysiloxane but thats just another word for dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just rubbed it on the scars with a flat toothpick and put vaseline and jojoba oil on it too.. for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and yea it does stay sticky as hell.. i let it sit for a min then rub it off with a towel and it&#x27;ll still be sticky and shiney but it gets rid of the scar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im still in my 20&#x27;s but my face looked so bad  i was wearing hats and sunglasses so ppl would quit looking at me all corny... they were actually calling me ma&#x27;am prob thinking i was older because the scars had changed the way my face looked.. after using this for a couple weeks and now a month later im getting called hon and dear again... actually liked the break form all the attention... been getting hard stares all my life up until my skin started acting crazy a couple years ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is def the best scar gel out there .. def the best on amazoncalled hon and dear again... actually liked the break form all the attention... been getting hard stares all my life up until my skin started acting crazy a couple years ago  this is def the best scar gel out there .. def the best on amazon</li>
    <li> I developed Keloid Scarring along with hypertrophic scarring. It got to the point where the Keloid was more than an inch thick and my mom was scared and feared I might need surgery again to remove it. My health insurance had just run out. I have had this produce for about almost 6months. I am a skeptic, so I documented it along taking pictures of each month by scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would say it helped, but it didn&#x27;t totally eliminate the keloid or its presence. The scarring is more flat than it was months before. In months before,the keloid was dry and raised. I was say about a half inch. Now, its less than that. It wouldn&#x27;t remove it, but it&#x27;ll make it less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works for what it tends to do. Maybe if i caught on to the scarring earlier , it would have never gotten this big. But so far, it works and I&#x27;m going to order another tube. See how it does for a longer run.</li>
    <li> I have wasted time and lots of money on other products that claim to diminish the appearance of keloid scars.  I have been using this Spectragel for about a month now and I wish I would have used it from the beginning.  My scars are nearly back to my skin color and they are almost no longer raised at all.  I tried using makeup to cover my scars but they were still very visible because they were so raised and puffy.  Just after one month of using this stuff I can barely feel the scars if I run my finger across them.  PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else!</li>
    <li> Purchased the gel in Feb...used it daily and I saw an improvement on my raised keloid scar. However, I am sure it will take a while to completely flatten this stubborn scar. When you put on that sticky gel, it tingles somewhat and it goes away after awhile. I know its early to see the effectiveness of the gel, happy with the results though.</li>
    <li> I have scar tissue and have been looking for a cost effective way to flatten them. This had some nice reviews. It is too early to state if it works or not. But the price is right and I feel it working with the tingle on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have two small keloid scars from years ago. One on my arm and one on my calf. I applied this religiously for three months. The one on my arm diminished but is still there, just much improved. The one on my calf had no change.  Since then, I have tried Curad Advanced Scar Therapy Advanced Gel Discs and Cica Care Silicone Gel Sheets. Both of those keep falling off, so I&#x27;m back to using this Spectra Gel because at least it seems to stay on.  I just had surgery and have a long cut. I will use the Spectra Gel in the day and the Cica Care Silicone Sheets at night.</li>
    <li> I used this product everyday after breast reduction surgery and saw results right away. Used twice daily and massaged over incisions. Only complaint is how sticky it is.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works; it works faster if you follow the application directions.  It diminished my port keloid in about two months...and I wasn&#x27;t as compliant on application as is recommended.  I did use it in combination with Mepitac tape.</li>
    <li> Started using Spectragel 9 weeks after knee replacement surgery which left a large, red, raised scar. I am only applying it once a day, and still see very positive results after 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is useless on my keloid scars on chest. Does not flatten it or reduce any redness at all. A waste of my money, and I bought the big one too.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work, I spent my money for nothing. I&#x27;m very regret, because I could have buy something useful. I waste my time to same my face from a terrible scare.</li>
    <li> My child&#x27;s surgeon recommended this and I found it on amazon for the cheapest price. Pretty thick and it goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was advised to use it by the Dr who performed the surgery on my face and neck in June...I have been using the gel everyday for just over a month and the scar is very much diminished...and most likely after 1 year the scar won&#x27;t even be seen.</li>
    <li> I think these product is not the top scar gel but its does the job bot not perfectly you have to be patient with it .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much to mitigate the scar. I was quite disappointed . Won&#x27;t use it again! Does nothing for the scar.</li>
    <li> still not got improvement , I will wait little bit and evaluate it again .</li>
    <li> Super glue and honey mixed up together - that&#x27;s what it   feels like on your skin and it does NOT dry BUT   IT WORKS LIKE NOTHING I&#x27;ve ever seen before with DAILY   use.    Amazing.  Buy a little tube and see for yourself.     April 2010 - Started with red raised scars.   July 2010- This took it down to pink slightly raised scars.   --------------Kept using it.   Sept 2010- Then the scars became flat white scars.  -------------Kept using it.   Dec 2010-Flat white scars became nearly unnoticeable lines.  -------------Kept using it.   Feb 2011 White lines are fading to nearly normal skin color!     Wow. MUST USE FAITHFULLY EVERY DAY.</li>
    <li> My doctor refer do not like them ,</li>
    <li> My wife had surgery 7 months ago. She applies the gel 2 times a day and it has remarkably almost vanished the scar line! One of the best products we have ever purchased! We even buy it and give it to friends and family that are having surgery!They all have used it and love it!</li>
    <li> I had thick keloid scars under my breast after implant surgery. I have been to the dermatologist for steroid injections and tried various other gels to help minimize the scars, but this is the first product that has flattened my keloid scars. I am encouraged!</li>
    <li> This gel was sticky, tacky, and never dried on my skin.  I had to cover the affected area after application and after a few weeks the scar was still very visible.  For all the effort I spent dealing with the product I would have loved for it to work.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again after using scar gels that actually get absorbed.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money for my surgical scar.  There was no improvement over the space of time of two months.  This stuff was super expensive too.  Do NOT waste your money.</li>
    <li> You just have to apply it everyday on your scares as instructed. Highly recommend thanks again .. . . .</li>
    <li> I have a big scars and small scars used it on all and it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
