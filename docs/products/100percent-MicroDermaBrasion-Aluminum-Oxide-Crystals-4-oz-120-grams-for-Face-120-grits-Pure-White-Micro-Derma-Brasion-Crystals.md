      <li>My most unfavorite thing to happen in cleansers is when the perfect one comes along</li>

      <li>After I notified (and am sure I was a pain) they were great about resolving the issue.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>My sister&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it to her, and I had tried it at her house before buying my own.</li>
      <li>I mix this in with my cleanser once a week and it exfoliates nicely.</li>

      <li>Will add more to the review after couple weeks of use.</li>
      <li>, my make-up looks better</li>
      <li>This issue may have been prevented if the jar had been shrink wrapped or encased in a zip top plastic bag.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>This product may grow on me, and if I grow to like it more, I will write a follow up review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed they were much more fine, like sand.</li>
      <li>Use this with Pretika micro-dermabrasion facial cleaner brush and you will get incredible results.  </li>
      <li>Came fast and seller had nice packaging/info included :) that said....</li>
      <li>They resent another container quickly and in better packaging.  </li>
      <li>Thus the crystal light.</li>
      <li>My skin is buffed and smooth</li>
      <li>During shipment the lid cracked and all of the powder leaked out freely into the padded shipping envelope.  </li>
      <li>This made my face feel fantastic.  </li>
      <li>When I received the crystals they where exactly what I needed to add to my own facial wash to form a light scrub, but the bubble packaging was very light and when I took it into my home it started leaking out of the package every place.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it gently exfoliates the skin.</li>
      <li>I loved that the seller added that extra TLC along with the product.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s used with a face scrub brush, your skin can get chapped, but it does reveal a new layer underneath :)  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was wise to finally wise up, this product was affordable, works well with my jojoba oil mixed in for when my face is really dry or with my milk cleanser after a hot day doing work outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works pretty well!</li>
      <li>I am a huge dermabrasion advocate and this stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>favorite scrub, same issue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an avid exfoliator</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ordered product from Karima Alarhabi&#x27;s Skin Beauty Solutions.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve had my first real microdermabrasion.</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy from them again and recommend them to my family and friends.  </li>
      <li>I only used my fingers to rub the crystals onto my face and this worked fine.  </li>
      <li>only need a little of the product to do the job, i mix a spinkle in with my lotion and this makes a great exfoliator</li>
      <li>I could really tell a difference in the softness of my skin and how well my makeup went on.  </li>
      <li>(it sinks in better, faster) after using this.</li>
      <li>It looks promising when I opened it...</li>
      <li>Used this product twice and it really smooths my skin and it feels softer.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this product in hopes to have a similar exfoliator to the one from the spa.  </li>
      <li>I feel that it truly did take away all the &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; skin and left my face feeling wonderfully soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>Great product used w/ our at home microderm machine &amp; we add some into our facial scrub for a little extra boost.  </li>
      <li>However, the third party seller  shipped the loose crystals which is a powder, in a plastic jar with a plastic screw top lid.  </li>
      <li>No fragrance, no cleanser to irritate newly exfoliated skin</li>
      <li>Removes dead cells and leaves my face very clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I use it as directed and it has helped with keeping my skin clear.</li>
      <li>Even for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Soft dewy skin.</li>
      <li>I did not notice any impurities in the product, no black spots and very uniform white</li>
      <li>This helps to clear the pores of blackheads, remove dry areas, and clear the oily areas.</li>
      <li>would have rated this product higher, but I am used the the other product that came out of a tube similar to a lotion.  </li>
      <li>and I use less of it because my skin is healthier looking and doesn&#x27;t need as much</li>
      <li>years later, I finally thought to see if I could purchase the micro dermabrasion aluminum oxide crystals without any other base formula added---that way I could choose what formula works best on MY skin type.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received the Crystals fast in a tight container, noting was spilled out.</li>

<li> The MicroDermaBrasion Crystals are enough to last for a very long time.</li>
<li> did as one reviewer suggested and mixed the dry crystals with Jojoba oil.  </li>

<li> For $14.99 it&#x27;s not worth the hassle to return the product.  </li>
<li> I feel as if the spots are being sanded down.  </li>

<li> These are a bit coarser than my previous one, but work well.</li>
<li> Also, it takes less moisturizer</li>
<li> I am not comfortable with putting it on my skin.</li>
<li> It came in a small plastic container with a screw-on lid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Crystals I received contained some small dark pieces of debris of different shapes and color, and is not a clean pure white. I question how this product is being handled. I am not comfortable with putting it on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ordered product from Karima Alarhabi&#x27;s Skin Beauty Solutions.  As Amazon promised, the product arrived in 2 days, since the seller&#x27;s business is located in Nevada.  Yes, the shipment was the product I purchased.  However, the third party seller  shipped the loose crystals which is a powder, in a plastic jar with a plastic screw top lid.  During shipment the lid cracked and all of the powder leaked out freely into the padded shipping envelope.  This issue may have been prevented if the jar had been shrink wrapped or encased in a zip top plastic bag.  For $14.99 it&#x27;s not worth the hassle to return the product.  But, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d order again, since I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll receive contaminated or damaged goods with a second order.  If the item I ordered had been in liquid form,  that would have been a bigger mess.  (I had to pour out the aluminum Oxide Crystals, the entire contents of the envelope,  into a bowl.)</li>
    <li> My most unfavorite thing to happen in cleansers is when the perfect one comes along and then it&#x27;s discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite scrub, same issue.  Avon made a wonderful scrub:  No fragrance, no cleanser to irritate newly exfoliated skin and they had a ton of the micro crystals in it and it worked so well---and for only $10!  DISCONTINUED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, I finally thought to see if I could purchase the micro dermabrasion aluminum oxide crystals without any other base formula added---that way I could choose what formula works best on MY skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wise to finally wise up, this product was affordable, works well with my jojoba oil mixed in for when my face is really dry or with my milk cleanser after a hot day doing work outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about 4 or 5 times a week and I will tell you, I look younger and fresher. My skin is buffed and smooth, my make-up looks better and I use less of it because my skin is healthier looking and doesn&#x27;t need as much cover-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Came fast and seller had nice packaging/info included :) that said....I was so excited to receive this product in hopes to have a similar exfoliator to the one from the spa.  It looks promising when I opened it... When i put it on my face, it felt like tiny shards of glass.  My face is now on fire, and feels no smoother.  I&#x27;m an avid exfoliator and I&#x27;ve never had this happen before and can&#x27;t imagine this is good for my skin.  Sadly, disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a while and I still do have age spots but not as pronounced as they were.  The sins of my youth are showing...but hopefully in time will go away.  I feel as if the spots are being sanded down.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I mix a pinch of these crystals with my evening face wash and have baby bottom skin when I rinse. These are a bit coarser than my previous one, but work well.</li>
    <li> I mix this in with my cleanser once a week and it exfoliates nicely.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about this product but I always feel skeptical about reviews b/c some might be from competing companies and some might be the product seller.  I had been using a neutrogena product for a long time but they discontinueed it and I needed a replacement.  So for this price i went ahead and took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did as one reviewer suggested and mixed the dry crystals with Jojoba oil.  I only used my fingers to rub the crystals onto my face and this worked fine.  I could really tell a difference in the softness of my skin and how well my makeup went on.  Soft dewy skin. I did not notice any impurities in the product, no black spots and very uniform white crystals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated this product higher, but I am used the the other product that came out of a tube similar to a lotion.  This product may grow on me, and if I grow to like it more, I will write a follow up review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later edit:  I would now give this 5 stars.  Nothing is as effective as these crystals in exfoliation.  Nothing.  Pretty great for the price.  It&#x27;s been over a year since I purchased this product and still have a little of it left.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well! Even for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Use this with Pretika micro-dermabrasion facial cleaner brush and you will get incredible results.  I am a huge dermabrasion advocate and this stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using these crystals as part of my shower routine for over a year and these are great! I alternate between mixing some with a little bit of honey to moisturize or mixing them with a little bit of cleanser when i&#x27;m breaking out. It is so much more cost effective to buy it like this and mix it myself and one container lasts FOREVER. Plus you can use your regular skin care products. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s amazing. I use it as directed and it has helped with keeping my skin clear. I have had acne and an awful complexion since I was 12 years old. This helps to clear the pores of blackheads, remove dry areas, and clear the oily areas. It came in a small plastic container with a screw-on lid. It was intact when I got it. The crystals are so fine,and you need such a small amount that thiis will last for a long, long time. My sister&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it to her, and I had tried it at her house before buying my own. I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!! My skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Used this product twice and it really smooths my skin and it feels softer.  Love that it&#x27;s alot of product for the price. Will use it twice a week so hopefully my tone and texture will improve alot especially before the summer.</li>
    <li> The crystals were slightly larger than what I used to getting from a finished product.  They are gritty but get the job done.  I add it to my Burts Bees face cleanser.  The cleanser is slightly moisturizing so the grits tend to stick to my face.  I would suggest using a face cleanser that isn&#x27;t moisture intensive.  I get complimented on my skin all the time and I think this is the secret!  If it&#x27;s used with a face scrub brush, your skin can get chapped, but it does reveal a new layer underneath :)  Just moisturize after if you use it more than 1 time a week.</li>
    <li> I use this product with my Neutragena microdermabrasion tool.  Removes dead cells and leaves my face very clean and soft.  Use moisturizer afterward of course!</li>
    <li> I loved this product!!! I was used to neutrogena microcrystals and when I got these I noticed they were much more fine, like sand. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work but after using the product I must say it works 100x better than anything I&#x27;ve bought in any department store. I will be purchasing this again. I feel like I&#x27;ve had my first real microdermabrasion.</li>
    <li> I received the Crystals fast in a tight container, noting was spilled out. They seem fine and uniform in color, nothing as previous reviewers complained. I will add them to my regular face fashes or use them with jojoba oil. Will add more to the review after couple weeks of use. I hope they work well.</li>
    <li> When I received the crystals they where exactly what I needed to add to my own facial wash to form a light scrub, but the bubble packaging was very light and when I took it into my home it started leaking out of the package every place.  The container had ruptured in the delivery process and punctured the packaging. Thus the crystal light. After I notified (and am sure I was a pain) they were great about resolving the issue.  They resent another container quickly and in better packaging.  I would certainly buy from them again and recommend them to my family and friends.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I actually added some exfoliating crystals to another expensive name brand scrub that didn&#x27;t have enough exfoliating ingredients and put all of it in another jar. Sometimes I just use the crystals by themselves. I love the way it gently exfoliates the skin. The seller was awesome too and added extra helpful information along with a contact card in case I had questions. I loved that the seller added that extra TLC along with the product. The MicroDermaBrasion Crystals are enough to last for a very long time. I was impressed with both the product and the seller!!!</li>
    <li> This made my face feel fantastic.  I feel that it truly did take away all the &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; skin and left my face feeling wonderfully soft and clean.  Also, it takes less moisturizer (it sinks in better, faster) after using this.</li>
    <li> I use it with Cerave cleanser, and it works great.</li>
    <li> only need a little of the product to do the job, i mix a spinkle in with my lotion and this makes a great exfoliator, i like that i dont feel like i am getting ripped off with a lot of fragrence and junk</li>
    <li> Great product used w/ our at home microderm machine &amp; we add some into our facial scrub for a little extra boost.  Arrived on time &amp; in great condition would recommend</li>
    <li> I was looking for an at home micro dermabrasion product, I tried every product under the sun until I found this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and, I can see the difference in my skin, people stopped me in the mall to ask me about my skin products.  My mom started to use it and, she loves it too.</li>
