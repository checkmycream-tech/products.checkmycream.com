### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for a close shave.</li>
      <li>Perfect replacement blade</li>
      <li>works perfect, a clean smooth cut</li>
      <li>and I have to make more passes than with this blade.  </li>
      <li>and I end up doing more passes and fine tuning</li>
      <li>i needed these and their smooth :)</li>
      <li>I find that if I use the 0000, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair as easily</li>
      <li>The size is off and it doesn&#x27;t fit snuggly to the Oster clipper so it  pulls and grabs the hair</li>
      <li>Be prepared to take it all apart to clean and lubricate if you want them to work.  </li>
      <li>I then took a closer look at the blade compared to my blade it was replacing and the text and brand identification on the blade weren&#x27;t at all close to a true Oster blade.....</li>
      <li>A new Oster Agion blade, on a Classic 76, is a dream machine that feels solid and functions perfectly.</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 more to be sure I am never without a sharp one.</li>
      <li>The new one works fine too.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite; but i will be buying hopefully different ones soon, including attachments.</li>
      <li>The product was better than I expected.</li>
      <li>and this blade has really held up.  </li>
      <li>He is very picky</li>
      <li>The  service and product description really was on point</li>
      <li>that I think any normal hair cut would entail</li>
      <li>This is my second one, as the first one is misaligned beyond my repair ability.</li>
      <li>Not the professional quality you expect from Oster.</li>

    <li> Clipper blades stick and get caught in hair even after lubrication.  Be prepared to take it all apart to clean and lubricate if you want them to work.  Even then, move slowly.  Not the professional quality you expect from Oster.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this blade because when I first used it to cut my husbands hair it did not appear to cut well and seamed dull.  I have not had problems with the same order from a previous person however so I will consider that if I order it again.</li>
    <li> I received this blade and instantly it was pulling hair when cutting my clients. I then took a closer look at the blade compared to my blade it was replacing and the text and brand identification on the blade weren&#x27;t at all close to a true Oster blade..... I don&#x27;t know how this person found packaged knock off Oster clipper blades but they did.... The size is off and it doesn&#x27;t fit snuggly to the Oster clipper so it  pulls and grabs the hair</li>
    <li> these are oem blade they are very sharp only thing u have to do is adjust the blade for close cut the factory just throws them together about 1 minute there are u tube clips on how to do it</li>
    <li> works perfect, a clean smooth cut</li>
    <li> not only i dropped my clippers it slightly bent my tension spring :/ and was getting dull..... i needed these and their smooth :)</li>
    <li> A new Oster Agion blade, on a Classic 76, is a dream machine that feels solid and functions perfectly. This is my second one, as the first one is misaligned beyond my repair ability. So: how to keep this thing working properly forever? It seems that after maybe 200 haircuts, the blade cannot be rescued by the three Oster lubrication and cleaning products I have. If there is a User Guide online, I cannot seem to find it. Probably my fault, not the blade&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I bought my Oster Classics years ago and have replaced the blade a couple of time.  This one came as expected and seems plenty sharp.  My kids aren&#x27;t complaining of it grabbing as much as the last one that was getting dull, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s doing its job.  I&#x27;d recommend these without hesitation.  I&#x27;ve ordered these from Amazon before and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> Oster and all their products are just A++++. This is my favorite; but i will be buying hopefully different ones soon, including attachments.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement blade</li>
    <li> Perfect for a close shave. The finest level of closeness. Back of neck....etc</li>
    <li> I bought this blade to replace an identical blade that lasted me six years. The new one works fine too.</li>
    <li> The product was better than I expected. The  service and product description really was on point and I will definitely recommend not only the product, but the site I purchased it from as well.</li>
    <li> I use this blade on the oster 76 to cut my husbands hair every 2 weeks.  He has course black hair with a moderate amount of grey.  I find that if I use the 0000, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair as easily and I have to make more passes than with this blade.  I use a #1 guard and a #5 guard on this blade and then a comb with no guard to help blend.  He is very picky and I end up doing more passes and fine tuning that I think any normal hair cut would entail and this blade has really held up.  I use the spray lubricant on it during and after each cut.  My last blade (same one) lasted about 1-2 years without needing to sharpen.  I purchased 2 more to be sure I am never without a sharp one.</li>
