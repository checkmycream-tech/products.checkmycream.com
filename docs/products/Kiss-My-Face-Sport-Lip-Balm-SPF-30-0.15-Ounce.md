      <li>that was a good idea, but it made the lip balm more liquid</li>
      <li>Nice smell and almost no taste at all.</li>

    <li> Perfect for that Florida sun!</li>
    <li> I bike a lot and wanted some lip balm that would provide SPF.  This was a great deal.  The lip balm tastes like peppermint when you first put it on.  The flavor does fade pretty quickly but it is nice lip balm.  Very soothing to the lips, isn&#x27;t greasy and feels nice.  It stays on well and has an SPF.  Fits all my needs!</li>
    <li> great product, moisturizes and protects from sun and wind. recommend.</li>

    <li> Very happy to find product with no ingredients that are artificial.  Lips are frequently forgotten but need attention too.  Brand name trusted.  Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - worth a little extra.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really wet.  Kinda gross.</li>
    <li> Pleasant surprise!  I like the feel on my lips, love that it is 30 SPF and no petroleum products.</li>
    <li> Most lip sunscreens taste terrible. This one does not. I need a high SPF on lips. This works well and does NOT taste bad.</li>
    <li> Offers good sun protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them all (with sunscreen) and this one is great.  It&#x27;s solid enough (and stays solid on your lips) so that it doesn&#x27;t get in your mouth or smeared around your face.  It&#x27;s got a nice \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; also.  The sunscreen level is about perfect.  I previously used a product with SPF 30 that was increased to SPF 45 - thought that was a good idea, but it made the lip balm more liquid and it flowed causing a bad taste.  This one does not do this.  It works really, really well.  Nice smell and almost no taste at all.</li>
    <li> Works well a bit waxy but the flavor or scent is very good.</li>
    <li> works great and no odd taste.</li>
    <li> In my quest for natural lip balm, I found this one and I love it! Smells good, feels good, applies nicely. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as water resistant as it claims to be. I don&#x27;t mind reapplying though. :)</li>
    <li> I was looking specifically for a lip balm with decent SPF.  This fits the bill and I make sure to have with me if I&#x27;m going to be outside for extended periods of time.  Has a slight &amp;#34;SPF&amp;#34; type taste but its not a big deal.  Will buy again when current ones run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used much lip balm in my life, but my son does and this is his favorite. I buy. He smiles. Life is good.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great ingredients, healthy for you, no chemicals and it tastes great! Besides having SPF 30! Win win for me!</li>
    <li> A great, natural lip balm! Made with coconut oil and beeswax, it smells and feels great.. softens and moistens lips well. For me, the only thing this lip balm lacks is a longer water resistance, as it is only 40min water resistant, after that you need to reapply if you want sun protection in the water.</li>
    <li> Not greasy - no waxy build up!</li>
    <li> I love this Chapstick! Smooth, minty, water resistant sun protection</li>
    <li> This stuff comes off easily.  Had to constantly re-apply.  It has a nice coat but doesn&#x27;t feel like it penetrates.  Went with the softlips watermelon instead.  SO much better.</li>
    <li> This item rated really well for safety and effectiveness on the EWG sunscreen list. We have used ti for the past two years now and love it.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm!</li>
    <li> I was attempting to replace the Kiss my Face product I purchased at a ski resort, this is close but missing the menthol. It&#x27;s just not the same without the tingling feeling!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I love it, but it does work and keeps my lips from burning in the sun.  The thing I don&#x27;t like about this lip balm is the odor; I just want a good, as close to natural/organic as possible, non-toxic balm to put on my lips that doesn&#x27;t smell.  My search will continue...  If anyone has any recommendations of such a product, please list it below for all.</li>
    <li> Having recently had skin cancer removed from my face, I am more aware of the need to protect my entire face.  I now use this every time I leave the house.  I also gave one to my granddaughter, since I got the pack of three.</li>
