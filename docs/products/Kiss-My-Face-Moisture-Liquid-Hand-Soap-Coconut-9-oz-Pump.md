      <li>Dries hands a little more than I&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this modestly priced item.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is a little thick and it really doesn&#x27;t lather well, which is why I think it is just ok.</li>
      <li>I unscrewed and poured into empty from another, much cheaper, brand rather than return.</li>
      <li>smells really good but could be too artificial smell</li>
