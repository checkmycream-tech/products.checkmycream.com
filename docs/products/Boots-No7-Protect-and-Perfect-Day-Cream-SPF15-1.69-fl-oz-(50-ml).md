      <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be a great product for my 50+ skin.</li>
      <li>good going on.</li>
      <li>My esthetician recommended this product while i was going through chemical peels, in their line w/o retinol as for the price, she said it&#x27;s just as good as department store products that are 4-10 times the price.  </li>
      <li>But love Boots&#x27; products!</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love Boots products!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>The Boots cream is silky smooth and covers up my flaky skin and makes my face feel great.</li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get oilier during the day and is a nice product.</li>
      <li>And it smells nice too.</li>
      <li>It glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best day cream on the market.  </li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t tell for sure.</li>
      <li>I love all boots 7 products...</li>
      <li>I am 46 (almost 47) and my skin hasnt looked better then now in years...</li>
      <li>Wish it had a bit more SPF.  </li>
      <li>I relly love No 7 products.  </li>
      <li>The top was not screwed on and some of the cream had leaked out.</li>
      <li>Wish it did more tho.</li>
      <li>I Highly recommand!!!!!</li>
      <li>Regarding packaging; there was a &#x27;tamper proof&#x27; sticker on the top of the box but not the bottom, meaning that the tub could be easily removed and replaced without tearing the sticker.</li>
      <li>The feeling on the skin after application is great, skin is soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Really works for fine lines!!</li>
      <li>Light and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 72, so nothing can work miracles, but it keeps my skin from drying out, and my makeup goes on smoothly over it.</li>
      <li>Wish your Royal Jelly items were available in the US.</li>
      <li>I heard it recommended by a dermatologist on TV - but if you are young and just need a good moisturizer, I&#x27;d say this fills the ticket.</li>
      <li>I began using this product and works better and looks more natural!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great day cream for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This is nothing special for me.</li>
      <li>recommend product arrived at the right time!</li>
      <li>Love this as much as the Night Cream.  </li>
      <li>Nice moisturizer - not greasy and includes protection of spf 15...  would definitely purchase again and would recommend to others</li>
      <li>Feels good on the skin but does not have the anti aging ingredients other products carry.</li>
      <li>gave one to my mother and she loved it so much that she got rid of all the other products she was using.</li>
      <li>Nice cream as expected.</li>
      <li>This is very beneficial skin care product!</li>
      <li>Actually, i don&#x27;t know if it ever felt better or my skin was clearer.</li>
      <li>I was able to get the portion that had leaked out, and put it back in the jar, but this should be noted.</li>
      <li>have no confidence in this product and as such, really don&#x27;t feel safe putting it on my skin.</li>
      <li>it smells like an intense sunscreen.</li>
      <li>My main reason for giving 4/5 stars is because of its smell--</li>
      <li>As far as making a difference, well it did nothing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell and texture of the cream is different to the most recent pot (I still have a little left), which I bought from a Boots store.</li>
      <li>major difference to assist this product...</li>
      <li>I have seen a major difference in my skin...</li>
      <li>What has also made a major difference is  </li>
      <li>as far as possible met my expectation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have seen a major difference in my skin...I have used fillers for the &#x27;marionette lines&#x27; and parentheses...I began using this product and works better and looks more natural!!! What has also made a major difference is  Biotin  major difference to assist this product...I take 2 pills 10,000 mg a day and drink lots of lemon water...I am 46 (almost 47) and my skin hasnt looked better then now in years...</li>
    <li> As far as making a difference, well it did nothing.  Waste of money..would not give as a gift to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is nothing special for me. It may even have been drying but I can&#x27;t tell for sure. I would not re-order this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 72, so nothing can work miracles, but it keeps my skin from drying out, and my makeup goes on smoothly over it.</li>
    <li> Package is open at bottom.  I don&#x27;t trust products not secure.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to use. Does not cause me to break out. I use it in the cooler months when stronger sunscreen in not required.</li>
    <li> The top was not screwed on and some of the cream had leaked out. I was able to get the portion that had leaked out, and put it back in the jar, but this should be noted.</li>
    <li> This cream works well and doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy later in the day. My main reason for giving 4/5 stars is because of its smell-- it smells like an intense sunscreen. Also it takes quite a while to soak in.</li>
    <li> Not enough moisture for me.</li>
    <li> Love this as much as the Night Cream.  Like the weight and quality of this cream and it has a little SPF protection as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this for several years - recommended by Dr. Oz - and my skin has improved immensely. No lines around my eyes or lips. Try it.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my MIL - she loves it.</li>
    <li> recommend product arrived at the right time! as far as possible met my expectation. probably go back to buy. Quality product.</li>
    <li> I was in London airport in 2010 waiting for my next flight and had some extra time. i went in to the shop and found this cream and bought it. I have been using it since as well as a lot of the other Boots No7 products.</li>
    <li> the bottle is too small but the product is well ,it also helps in eliminating marks,small ones would continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I have lots of more expensive products for my face/skin.&lt;br /&gt;But this is the only Day Cream I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be a great product for my 50+ skin. It&#x27;s creamy without being too heavy. It glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. And it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This is a great day cream for my dry skin.  Wish it had a bit more SPF.  But love Boots&#x27; products!</li>
    <li> Not the best day cream I&#x27;ve used, but a good one.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It is thick and really moisturizes like I want it to.  Received product in a timely manner.  Box cream came in was a little banged up but the container was not damaged, so no harm done.</li>
    <li> Nice cream as expected. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Its just plain day cream...does not fight wrinkles or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good going on. Wish it did more tho.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer - not greasy and includes protection of spf 15...  would definitely purchase again and would recommend to others</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cream!!! Really works for fine lines!!</li>
    <li> I am an outdoorsman with a face to show for it.  Rough, weathered, scaley, red blotches, and leathery.  This product cleared it all up.  My wife says my face is kissable now.  And not like sandpaper.  Yes!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent line of products that I have come to rely upon. nothing else on the market compares with this group.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonderfully for my combination oily/dry skin. It feels a bit greasy going on, but after it settles in for a bit and I apply my pore perfect tinted moisturizer/semi foundation, the shine goes away. The Boots cream is silky smooth and covers up my flaky skin and makes my face feel great. It doesn&#x27;t get oilier during the day and is a nice product. It is hard for me to find moisturizers to suit my difficult combination skin, but this one works wonders.</li>
    <li> Love Boots products! Wish your Royal Jelly items were available in the US.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  My esthetician recommended this product while i was going through chemical peels, in their line w/o retinol as for the price, she said it&#x27;s just as good as department store products that are 4-10 times the price.  She is a fan of this product even though my dermatologist office where she works out of, sells &amp;#34;specialized&amp;#34; products that are really expensive.  Now that peels are done, I need the retinol and this cream (along with night cream) and my serum (Skin Ceuticals Retexturing Activator) makes my skin feel 20 years younger.  I am serious.  Absolutely amazing.  Actually, i don&#x27;t know if it ever felt better or my skin was clearer.</li>
    <li> I love all boots 7 products...</li>
    <li> This is by far the best day cream on the market.  The feeling on the skin after application is great, skin is soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I gave one to my mother and she loved it so much that she got rid of all the other products she was using. I Highly recommand!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is very beneficial skin care product!</li>
    <li> I relly love No 7 products.  The only place I can find them is Target.so I order it as there is not 1 close.</li>
    <li> I have been using Boots No7 face creams for about 10 years and this one in particular for at least 3. This is not the same product that I have been buying from the Boots store.&lt;br /&gt;The smell and texture of the cream is different to the most recent pot (I still have a little left), which I bought from a Boots store. It&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s been cut with a lesser quality moisturiser, I&#x27;m guessing baby lotion judging by the smell. This cream feels heavy and makes my skin feel greasy, unlike previous creams I&#x27;ve bought (from the store). Regarding packaging; there was a &#x27;tamper proof&#x27; sticker on the top of the box but not the bottom, meaning that the tub could be easily removed and replaced without tearing the sticker. Inside the tub there is usually a white plastic internal lid, which is missing with this item.&lt;br /&gt;I have no confidence in this product and as such, really don&#x27;t feel safe putting it on my skin.</li>
