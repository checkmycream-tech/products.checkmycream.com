### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent soap.</li>
      <li>i feel  all the benefits of this soap, its great</li>
      <li>Great for clearing my acne in face and body</li>
      <li>great lather</li>
      <li>I read all reviews about how good it is and how good it smells</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like vinegar, smells so pretty.</li>
      <li>(I received this at a discount for an honest review, but I will happily pay full price when I buy again.)</li>
      <li>I breakout very easily on my neck &amp; face</li>
      <li>will have to order some more soon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to find things that really are unique and this soap fits that criteria!</li>
      <li>Very unique fragrance - smells sort of like a campfire to me</li>
      <li>this is with warm or warm hot water.  </li>
      <li>but this is actually one of the most pleasant smelling, unisex-scented body products I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this soap.  </li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s surprising at first but very earthy once you get used to it - tends more towards a man&#x27;s fragrance but after using it the aroma goes away quickly</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try this.</li>
      <li>None, just a very unusual fragrance at first but really nice once the surprise of its uniqueness wears off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it arrived on time and it gives my skin a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
      <li>really nice soap for general body cleansing.</li>
      <li>Like all the natural ingredients but the scent is not my favorite.</li>
      <li>Different than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried...but very good.</li>
      <li>The first two bars were consumed in about five weeks.</li>
      <li>I noticed increased softness of my skin immediately after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>Rinses clean and seems to help clear up my acne.</li>
      <li>Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did however leave my skin feeling clean and soft...</li>
      <li>moved past smell and used in shower and it lather nicely and left my skin feeling clean although the smell was not as strong on my skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend and will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>Really helping with acne on face &amp; neck</li>
      <li>Smells like cheap $1 soap like Lever or something similar.  </li>
      <li>I think I just spent too much money for cheap soap.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to describe but somehow this soap dries out the acne (or wicks away the toxins) but still leaves your skin soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>The shape of my soap is different and it isn&#x27;t the light blue color as the one pictured.  </li>
      <li>Product gets 5-stars for its natural deodorizing properties.  </li>
      <li>I am a fan of natural soap with no chemicals and for that reason bought this soap.</li>
      <li>Very simple and natural ingredient list - vegy oil, water, glycerin, bamboo charcoal &amp; vinegar - no toxins or chemicals&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>and last but not least the vendor sent order via standard shipping and it arrived in 2 days.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if the soap lathers  well with cool water.</li>

<li> The only downside is a bar doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
<li> it arrived right away 3 very small bars wrapped in plastic.</li>
<li> it smells exactly how its described bamboo and VINEGAR actually its worse than vinager.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It lathers well and appears to be improving my dry skin condition.  </li>
<li> Lighty scented and does not seem to irritate or dry out my skin.</li>
<li> Several hours later, I smell like a heavy smoker.  </li>
<li> I prefer the African black soap.</li>
<li> The soap pictured is green but what I received is actually an off-white color.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
<li> but as soon as i opened the package the smell is EXTREMELY PUNGENT</li>
<li> I prefer the black soap as a preventative complexion soap.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this in the bath and have noticed that my skin is not as tight and itchy as it usually is after a shower.  </li>
<li> This soap got my oily+sensitive skin very clean, without irritating it, but I really hate the smell.  </li>
<li> I am not a fan of bar soap but at least it does not leave filmy soap scum like other bar</li>
<li> there are no  harsh chemicals or artificial ingredients.</li>
<li> I was skeptical about the vinegar part</li>
<li> I will finish using since the smell does NOT stay on my skin once u rub the lotion on your body but due to the horrible smell i will never purchase again, EVER</li>

    <li> I am a fan of natural soap with no chemicals and for that reason bought this soap. I read all reviews about how good it is and how good it smells but as soon as i opened the package the smell is EXTREMELY PUNGENT it smells exactly how its described bamboo and VINEGAR actually its worse than vinager.&lt;br /&gt;I moved past smell and used in shower and it lather nicely and left my skin feeling clean although the smell was not as strong on my skin it did leave the pungent smell on my skin.....i rubbed my lotion on my skin and the smell disappear ,Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did however leave my skin feeling clean and soft...it arrived right away 3 very small bars wrapped in plastic. I will finish using since the smell does NOT stay on my skin once u rub the lotion on your body but due to the horrible smell i will never purchase again, EVER</li>
    <li> Lighty scented and does not seem to irritate or dry out my skin. Rinses clean and seems to help clear up my acne. I like that there are no  harsh chemicals or artificial ingredients.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this soap.  It lathers well and appears to be improving my dry skin condition.  The only downside is a bar doesn&#x27;t last as long I&#x27;d like.  The first two bars were consumed in about five weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in the bath and have noticed that my skin is not as tight and itchy as it usually is after a shower.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Like all the natural ingredients but the scent is not my favorite. I prefer the African black soap.</li>
    <li> will have to order some more soon.</li>
    <li> This soap got my oily+sensitive skin very clean, without irritating it, but I really hate the smell.  It&#x27;s like sulfur and ashes.  I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t cling, but it does.  Several hours later, I smell like a heavy smoker.  I don&#x27;t smoke.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap $1 soap like Lever or something similar.  Soap I received does not look like the soap pictured at all.  The shape of my soap is different and it isn&#x27;t the light blue color as the one pictured.  I think I just spent too much money for cheap soap.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> 1.  I was skeptical about the vinegar part but this is actually one of the most pleasant smelling, unisex-scented body products I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I am not a fan of bar soap but at least it does not leave filmy soap scum like other bar soaps.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The soap pictured is green but what I received is actually an off-white color.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Product gets 5-stars for its natural deodorizing properties.  It works!!!&lt;br /&gt;5.  I noticed increased softness of my skin immediately after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;......and last but not least the vendor sent order via standard shipping and it arrived in 2 days.  I highly recommend and will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> it arrived on time and it gives my skin a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Great for clearing my acne in face and body</li>
    <li> i feel  all the benefits of this soap, its great</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. Does what it says well.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like vinegar, smells so pretty.</li>
    <li> really nice soap for general body cleansing. didn&#x27;t work for my facial issues as hoped.  I prefer the black soap as a preventative complexion soap.</li>
    <li> Different than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried...but very good. It&#x27;s great to find things that really are unique and this soap fits that criteria! I breakout very easily on my neck &amp; face so I was excited to try this. I&#x27;m in the midst of a breakout now and started using the soap a couple days ago. It&#x27;s kind of hard to describe but somehow this soap dries out the acne (or wicks away the toxins) but still leaves your skin soft and hydrated. It&#x27;s definitely helping my recent breakout to heal faster than normal.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very simple and natural ingredient list - vegy oil, water, glycerin, bamboo charcoal &amp; vinegar - no toxins or chemicals&lt;br /&gt;- great lather&lt;br /&gt;- no vinegar aroma at all&lt;br /&gt;- Really helping with acne on face &amp; neck&lt;br /&gt;- Skin feels hydrated after use&lt;br /&gt;- Very unique fragrance - smells sort of like a campfire to me - it&#x27;s surprising at first but very earthy once you get used to it - tends more towards a man&#x27;s fragrance but after using it the aroma goes away quickly so I didn&#x27;t have any issues feeling like I was wearing a man&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None, just a very unusual fragrance at first but really nice once the surprise of its uniqueness wears off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend &amp; definitely will buy again! (I received this at a discount for an honest review, but I will happily pay full price when I buy again.)</li>
    <li> Lather or should I say creamy foamy lather this is with warm or warm hot water.  Not sure if the soap lathers  well with cool water. No scrubbing was necessary for me. The lather does the cleaning.</li>
