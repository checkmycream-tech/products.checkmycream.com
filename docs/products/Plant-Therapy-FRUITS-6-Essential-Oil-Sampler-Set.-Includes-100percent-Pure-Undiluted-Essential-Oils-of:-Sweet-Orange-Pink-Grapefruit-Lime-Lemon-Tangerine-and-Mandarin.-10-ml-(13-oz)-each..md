      <li>I will purchase more</li>
      <li>I am so upset, I ordered this item to make some lovely smelling bath bombs and instead I got some foul smelling senergy blends.</li>
      <li>This will be interesting...</li>
      <li>I think grapefruit maybe my favorite.</li>
      <li>ALSO I feel that I would save a lot more money by being able to use the oils appropriately.</li>

      <li>The grapefruit is my favorite.</li>
      <li>All the citrus oils I love in one convenient package.  </li>
      <li>but the grapefruit is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality essential oils.  </li>
      <li>packed cute enough for a nice little gift delicious scent and perfect array of scents-pleased with the collection and buy again</li>
      <li>Works great to make my own room deodorizer, liquid hand soap, carpet refresher (mixed with baking soda) and more.</li>
      <li>Arrived securely packaged - bottles were safe during shipment.</li>
      <li>I really like the fruit scents, and my daughter has been concocting her own synergies using these along with Love Vanilla, another Plant therapy blend.  </li>
      <li>I love these wonderfully sweet, aromatic oils.</li>
      <li>so I can see how it would dissipate more quickly.</li>
      <li>Nice for the bath, very relaxing.</li>
      <li>These oils are worth more</li>
      <li>Lovely variety - exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Very fresh scents, very useful and economical in a kit like this.</li>
      <li>just great and very very reasonably priced for essential oil.</li>
      <li>The rest of the oils were intact and full.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, they seem every bit as good as some of the higher priced oils.  </li>
      <li>I was looking forward to a nice strong smelling essential oil</li>
      <li>I thought these were nice but not as strong as other essential oils I have bought, I loved the packaging</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>They are of great quality and have quickly became a staple in my everyday life.</li>
      <li>I love every single one of the scents and am looking forward to trying more from this seller.</li>
      <li>so when everyone else wants to crank up the a/c, she can be just as comfortable with her hand warmer.</li>
      <li>so mixed w bottled water and boiled on stove and my house smelled amazing.</li>
      <li>w wasn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
      <li>All the scents were plesant and distinct.</li>
      <li>I love these natural fruit scented oils.</li>
      <li>These are not so cheap that you wonder if they are really any good, but they are considerably less than the YL or doTerra brands.  </li>
      <li>Great set in a small carrying box.</li>
      <li>exactly what  i wanted.</li>
      <li>I love to use oils but do not like the traditional oils smells like lavender.</li>
      <li>Such a cute gift.</li>
      <li>The only thing is the scent throw, because the scents themselves are outstanding.</li>
      <li>My personal favorite is lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have discovered, however that you can get special deals directly from the plant therapy website, and there is NEVER a shipping fee.</li>
      <li>the delivery was prompt ( I actually didn&#x27;t expect this till Monday) and was very happy to have it arrive now rather than have the entire bottle of Tangerine oil empty inside the box.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it &#x27;s worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for a new one to be sent.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the oil comes out very quickly when I only need a couple drops</li>
      <li>I have a feeling that these oils aren&#x27;t 100% pure.</li>
      <li>I bought these particular scents to make hand made bath scrubs for the ladies that I worked with for Christmas!</li>
      <li>As with all the Plant Therapy oils I have ordered they are top quality and were shipped and received quicker that I expected.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy these essential oils.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t really find on that was leaking.</li>
      <li>and they sent very well.</li>
      <li>From now on, the only time I will order these from Amazon is if I need to pad an order to get free shipping.</li>
      <li>I really like this company.</li>
      <li>and I really like NOW brand.</li>
      <li>Last week I got a free bottle of fractionated coconut oil with the purchase of 3 oils, and just yesterday they had a BOGO on two of their synergies.</li>
      <li>I really like these.</li>
      <li>There was a very strong citrus smell from inside the package and oil all over the lower half of the box.</li>
      <li>I particularly like their citrus fragrances.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent quality essential oils.  They are aromatic, long-lasting, and packaged nicely.  I particularly like their citrus fragrances.  I would order them again.</li>
    <li> I really like these. I make body scrubs and bath fizz and they sent very well. My one did leak after open but other than that they r worth the price.</li>
    <li> These oils are worth more then you pay! You will be very happy with the oils. They are of high quality and smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> All the citrus oils I love in one convenient package.  As with all the Plant Therapy oils I have ordered they are top quality and were shipped and received quicker that I expected.</li>
    <li> I just opened this package as soon as the delivery guy left it on my stoop and opened it. There was a very strong citrus smell from inside the package and oil all over the lower half of the box. I opened the box right away and found that the tangerine essential oil bottle had leaked about a 1/3 of its contents inside the box. The rest of the oils were intact and full. I don&#x27;t think it &#x27;s worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for a new one to be sent. I did have a whiff of the rest of the oils and think they will make a great addition to making the flavors of lip balm that I want to offer. the delivery was prompt ( I actually didn&#x27;t expect this till Monday) and was very happy to have it arrive now rather than have the entire bottle of Tangerine oil empty inside the box. The aromas are very strong and I hope they are not too overpowering for the lip balms... This will be interesting... Can&#x27;t wait to get started....</li>
    <li> These were packaged well and arrived in a timely fashion.  I have never had these oils before and expected them to have a stronger smell but they do what they are supposed to do.  The lemon is great from getting sticky residue off of jars.</li>
    <li> I love to use oils but do not like the traditional oils smells like lavender. I like the packaging, it&#x27;s natural and looks like they used recycled materials which I try to support. I use them in my bath, face steamer, and in my car. They last a long time, just a few drops go a long way.</li>
    <li> packed cute enough for a nice little gift delicious scent and perfect array of scents-pleased with the collection and buy again</li>
    <li> I have a feeling that these oils aren&#x27;t 100% pure. They are not as strong as other brands of essential oils I&#x27;ve tried and they just seem off. I&#x27;m not impressed and won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.I purchased them for use in homemade beauty and cleaning products.</li>
    <li> These oils smell amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to use them again!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these essential oils. Each one seems so nice. I use them for almost anything. Cleaning products-facial oil. I will purchase more</li>
    <li> Very fresh scents, very useful and economical in a kit like this. Enjoy making my own stuff instead of buying what is out there on the shelves-getting away from chemicals.</li>
    <li> used with aromatherapy machine..just great and very very reasonably priced for essential oil. Nice that it&#x27;s in a kit for gift giving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a tight budget, so price was as much of a consideration as quality. I&#x27;m very pleased. I will order them again.</li>
    <li> exactly what  i wanted. they all smell great. i liked being able to get the variety pack. cute little bottles, but big enough.</li>
    <li> Oils smelled great the warmer I bought to go w wasn&#x27;t worth the money so mixed w bottled water and boiled on stove and my house smelled amazing.</li>
    <li> I love citrus essential oils and frequently buy them from different vendors. However, I have only opened the tangerine and mandarin oils from this set and both of them smell nothing like quality oils! They are either diluted AND/or have gone bad! The worst part is that when I clicked on return the item it said that amazon doesn&#x27;t accept return of &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; materials, so I&#x27;ve just wasted over 20$ on this!</li>
    <li> I used this item and the holiday collection for a smell test activity at my museum. All the scents were plesant and distinct. Over the course of the day my staff became experts in finding the difference between orange, tangerine and mandarin. I  may use a couple drops in making lotion or to invigorate a long workday.</li>
    <li> Arrived securely packaged - bottles were safe during shipment. Great quality oils. Lovely variety - exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works great to make my own room deodorizer, liquid hand soap, carpet refresher (mixed with baking soda) and more. The grapefruit is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to a young lady who is always cold and uncomfortable because of it. Now she can enjoy warm hands to go with her warm heart -  and on the go. It comes with a rechargeable battery that can be plugged into your home or work computer so when everyone else wants to crank up the a/c, she can be just as comfortable with her hand warmer.</li>
    <li> These are all great scents.  Getting 6 in a sampler set is definitely the way to go. I saved quite a bit over purchasing each one individuallly.</li>
    <li> I got this fruit essential oil set to use in homemade cleaning products. They are perfect for what I wanted. I like all of them but the grapefruit is my favorite.</li>
    <li> The essential oil fruit set arrived quicker than I expected.  The quality of the oil is good and the packaging was cute.  I can&#x27;t wait to share them.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and in good condition.  The oils were everything we had thought and hoped they would be.  Perfect for making body scrubs!</li>
    <li> I thought these were nice but not as strong as other essential oils I have bought, I loved the packaging but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch of the Mandarin and Tangerine, because they smell a bit rancid. However the Lemon, Lime, Orange and Grapefruit smell great.  I wish the smell would also last a bit longer, but I am using it in the office so I can see how it would dissipate more quickly.</li>
    <li> I love these wonderfully sweet, aromatic oils. They are of great quality and have quickly became a staple in my everyday life. HOWEVER, the oil comes out very quickly when I only need a couple drops and I usually end up having to wash some off my hands because it drips onto my skin. I have read a lot of articles that state to dilute essentials before applying to skin and I would prefer to follow that advice. ALSO I feel that I would save a lot more money by being able to use the oils appropriately. In conclusion I recommend these oils but not the bottles. The package deal is wonderful but I think I may buy these oils separately from now on and I really like NOW brand.</li>
    <li> I love these natural fruit scented oils. I bought these particular scents to make hand made bath scrubs for the ladies that I worked with for Christmas!</li>
    <li> I am so upset, I ordered this item to make some lovely smelling bath bombs and instead I got some foul smelling senergy blends. I am so angry i could spit and the worst part is that I couldnt even replace it since it isnt an amazon product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great service! Amazing seller! A++++ 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Plant Therapy products for their quality and affordability. These fruit oils smell amazing. I think grapefruit maybe my favorite. Lemon and orange are awesome for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am forcecd to use these now. I realize in this set I have 3 of the same scent-orange, tangerine and mandarin all smell the same. Also the essential oil is not nearly as fragrant as aura cacia and now foods. Dont waste your money. Buy the other brands. I was looking forward to a nice strong smelling essential oil but I used it for my products and had to use double the amount I would use from the other brands. Very disappointed!!! I give it a two star instead of one because I do believe it is pure just not strong.</li>
    <li> This is the second sampler I have tried of essential oils.  The first was from a different seller.  I am much more impressed with the presentation and the quality of these essential oils.  I also like the larger size, which gives me a chance to really use the product for a while before it runs out.  I love every single one of the scents and am looking forward to trying more from this seller.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scents! I will buy again. I will experiment with their other varieties soon. Nice for the bath, very relaxing.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of very nice scents. If you are looking to use some citrus in your blends this is a good set to start with.</li>
    <li> I really like this company. Seems very professional. There was a little oily feel to these bottles but I couldn&#x27;t really find on that was leaking. Loved the selection!!</li>
    <li> I can not find them they disappeared at my Dad&#x27;s house. He tends to &amp;#34;Put&amp;#34; things away. He is home all day and enjoys receiving packages for neighbors, we live next door.</li>
    <li> I have been using essential oils for only a couple of months now, and am just getting an arsenal built up.  I really love the oils by Plant Therapy.  As far as I can tell, they seem every bit as good as some of the higher priced oils.  I have tried a couple of less expensive brands, and they do not smell as strong or last as long as these.  These are not so cheap that you wonder if they are really any good, but they are considerably less than the YL or doTerra brands.  I really like the fruit scents, and my daughter has been concocting her own synergies using these along with Love Vanilla, another Plant therapy blend.  I will definitely buy from them again.  I have discovered, however that you can get special deals directly from the plant therapy website, and there is NEVER a shipping fee. Last week I got a free bottle of fractionated coconut oil with the purchase of 3 oils, and just yesterday they had a BOGO on two of their synergies. From now on, the only time I will order these from Amazon is if I need to pad an order to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> The fragrances, while nice, are very weak. I used them to make bath bombs, and you can hardly smell them.</li>
    <li> Great set in a small carrying box.</li>
    <li> I have used other fragrances by the same company, but I haven&#x27;t tried these yet. I&#x27;m sure they will be just as wonderful.</li>
    <li> This item was just as expected. I received 6 bottles of 6 different essential oils. I have tried all the oils and they do as I expect.</li>
    <li> I like the scents, but am searching for another brand with stronger throw. The bottles are clearly marked and neatly packaged. The only thing is the scent throw, because the scents themselves are outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred PlantTherapy oils, and they did not disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;These oils smell wonderful, I use them as perfume and air fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;These are all citrus fruits.  Orange, grapefruit, mandarin, tangerine, lemon, and lime.&lt;br /&gt;They came well packaged, and each scent is very pleasant.  My personal favorite is lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love their Bug Off blend for deterring insects.  It&#x27;s a very good brand.</li>
    <li> Such a cute gift. Came perfectly packaged, so I didn&#x27;t have to do a thing.</li>
    <li> The best smelling package I&#x27;ve ever received.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Wonderful! Exactly what I needed! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I not only received the wrong product...but this item smells bad.  I tried several times to return the essential oils but the company never sent me the information on returning this product.  Very disappointed and will not purchase this brand again.</li>
