### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect match for my highlighted hair.</li>
      <li>Happy coloring, ladies!</li>
      <li>It helps me go longer between appts and my hair looks great!</li>
      <li>oh well... I am thrilled!!!!!</li>
      <li>I am impressed and very happy!</li>
      <li>results are iffy at best.</li>
      <li>The color is the lightest they offer and blends in wonderfully.</li>
      <li>wonderful color</li>
      <li>and I still have brilliant burgundy stripes along at my hairline and surrounding my face.</li>
      <li>but over all did a good job!</li>
      <li>Again: great results.</li>
      <li>My hair colorist/stylist isn&#x27;t going to be too happy that I did it myself, but</li>
      <li>this is great</li>
      <li>This product worked great for me, and I am extremely happy with the outcome.</li>
      <li>As an add-on item is great price.</li>
      <li>Fortunately that didn&#x27;t happen, the shade 9 matched perfectly without any brassiness.</li>
      <li>Color blending is good,</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>My snobby hairstylist even said I was doing a good job with these products between \\&quot;real\\&quot; highlight services with him.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today to touch up my brown roots and it worked perfectly!</li>
      <li>If you read the notation on Root Rescue box it says it is &amp;#34;Suitable for roots that are one shade lighter or darker than your colored hair.&amp;#34;  Unless you are a blond, gray hair will always be more than one shade lighter!</li>
      <li>It looks amazing-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap as heck and does an absolutely great job at root coverage and shade matching.  </li>
      <li>Does a nice job.</li>
      <li>I am kind of irritated, because I just put a plethora of chemicals in my hair and it didn&#x27;t even turn out.</li>
      <li>Maybe the reason that so many of us had good results is because we did the test strand that is recommended by Loreal.</li>
      <li>The applicator is very easy to use and does not require the mixing and continious dipping into like the Clariol.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product and Clairol&#x27;s -- both with GREAT success.  </li>
      <li>It matches my colored light blonde hair perfectly and does a great job on my grays.  </li>
      <li>Grays were colored a nice, believable shade.  </li>
      <li>I have used Nice and Easy Root</li>
      <li>It also stained my skin much more than the Nice and Easy brand.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, have been using it since it came out.  </li>
      <li>so it did the job on my roots but colored my bangs a light purple!</li>
      <li>Worked well, but like many of these products it is a one-time use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, it was too liquidy and runny;  I like the foam products better.  </li>
      <li>I was able to do my top and some of my sides before I ran out.</li>
      <li>I use two if I want to cover more.</li>
      <li>Hilariously I hear 4R colors more like a 6R.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I believe you will love it too.</li>
      <li>That is the part that scared me the most.</li>
      <li>So glad Amazon has it.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I can&#x27;t imagine any salon doing a better job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of products from many lines.  </li>
      <li>the bottle is a pain to use and, even though my hair colors easily, most of my gray was not covered  then</li>
      <li>Most \\&quot;light blonde\\&quot; haircolor winds up being way too light on my hair</li>
      <li>Was easy to use and covered well.</li>
      <li>Easy to use with their applicator.</li>
      <li>It works and is easy.  </li>
      <li>I will never be seduced by a sale again and strongly caution brunette and auburn users against the use of Root Rescue.</li>
      <li>I loved the product, easy to apply, nice scent to it, very convenient and gentle on hair.    </li>
      <li>I use the light blonde and it is great for in between touch ups.  </li>
      <li>I chose 6r because I wanted a light coppery auburn.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product for a quick touchup in between colorings to avoid over-drying/ damaging hair or if you just want it to look its best for a special occasion or such but in no way does it replace a regular re-dye in a cheaper convenient  alternative.</li>
      <li>but I found it does cover the roots and works quickly and is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>The application is quick and easy although I find I have to use my fingers to spread the solution.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to Nice and Easy for sure.</li>
      <li>Do a test first to make sure you&#x27;re getting the color you want.  </li>
      <li>Their reds are intense and incredibly fade resistant (years later I can still see that strip of R3 on my hair).</li>
      <li>She loved it, both in color matching and how it did not dry out her hair.</li>
      <li>Works really well and is quick and easy to use!</li>
      <li>though, I think, if anything, I got way too much color gobbed on in most places --</li>
      <li>Arrived second day delivery with good packaging.</li>
      <li>This product is so easy to use and rinses out very fast.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy and fast!</li>
      <li>I am soooooooo happy with myself for saving so much money, and I am thrilled with the results, especially the way it completely colored my somewhat resistant gray hair.</li>
      <li>of rinsing - rinsed out quickly, but doesn&#x27;t include conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got the hairline and top of head (where it parts) lightened but most of the back and interior growth is not affected/lightened.</li>
      <li>This was my very first attempt at coloring my hair...</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I just saved the $130.00 that I normally spend to have my hair colored at my favorite salon.</li>
      <li>It also helps that everyone that has seen me since I colored my own hair asks me what I&#x27;ve done to my hair because it looks terrific!</li>
      <li>light blonde to get me 3-4 more weeks before salon visit.</li>
      <li>And yet L&#x27;Oreal makes the claim that its product &amp;#34;will color even the most defiant grays.&amp;#34; Unfortunately, my &#x27;defiant grays&#x27; when treated with Root Rescue&#x27;s Medium Auburn turned a brilliant raspberry</li>
      <li>I think the biggest challenge for anyone is choosing the right color to use on our already colored hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to use applicator with a little plastic comb at the end - very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The coverage is good but be careful if you run it through the rest of your hair like I do because it grabs fast.  </li>
      <li>This is a very  healthy color for my hair possibly due to the rape seed oil listed in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I usually use clairol nice n easy 10 minute root touch up in #9,</li>
      <li>This was very much not an</li>
      <li>/&gt;The applicator is supposed to be quick &amp; easy to use, but the comb thing is attached to a big plastic tube.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Root Rescue</li>
      <li>I have read too many reviews of people complaining there isn&#x27;t enough product.  </li>
      <li>The applicators are real nice, though, absolutely no mess; so I washed them out and will just fill them with Preference for as long as they last.  </li>
      <li>its gonna cost me more in the long run..</li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like - begins to wash out after 2 shampoos even using color safe shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on a limited budget as most of us are, and I get my hair cut and colored about 3 times a year at a cost of $120 and in between appts</li>
      <li>I bought dark brown, which I always use in multiple brands with no issues before, but for some reason in this product it turned out chestnut or at best auburn with a red hue to it.</li>
      <li>Figuring that I&#x27;d need to give it extra time to develop, I left it on for close to 25 minutes, and when I dried my hair, was extremely pleased to find beautiful seamless color on par with what I get in the salon.  </li>
      <li>I never had a color product that did absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>and I know I did not use too much.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions too and my result was absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>Maybe others are trying to use too much on each strip?</li>
      <li>I leave the clairol one in for an hour- this one looked very red/orange after 40 minutes</li>
      <li>so I panicked and washed it out, very scared.</li>
      <li>For Men box (men&#x27;s section) that is not just for men really...</li>
      <li>Also the coloring mixture is very runny and drippy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>as women say it works very well.</li>
      <li>beware if you have light blonde hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not sure what others are doing, but if you put a streak of product on your root and go all the way around your head, you don&#x27;t run out.  Maybe others are trying to use too much on each strip? I have used this product and Clairol&#x27;s -- both with GREAT success.  My snobby hairstylist even said I was doing a good job with these products between \\&quot;real\\&quot; highlight services with him.  And my blonde (slightly strawberry blonde) hair tends to turn a bit orange from processing at the salon (much to my horror), and this does NOT.  So lately I have just been using this and buying a product for hilights, and doing it myself at home.  And getting lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Even though I bought 2 bottles to do my half inch roots, it was still only enough product to barely do the front.  The applicators are real nice, though, absolutely no mess; so I washed them out and will just fill them with Preference for as long as they last.  When they run out, I&#x27;ll get Root Rescue for the next time I need new applicators, only next time I&#x27;ll buy three.</li>
    <li> I loved the product, easy to apply, nice scent to it, very convenient and gentle on hair.    My only issue was that the colour turned out lighter and redder than I expected. I bought dark brown, which I always use in multiple brands with no issues before, but for some reason in this product it turned out chestnut or at best auburn with a red hue to it. But I&#x27;m willing to give it another shot given how convenient it is, so I will get light black next time and try</li>
    <li> I tried 4R Dark Auburn to touch up my grey roots last night and was shocked when I got out of the shower. I have used Nice and Easy Root Touch Up for years in several shades and marveled at how well the color blended. This was L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s recommended color to match the Garnier Nutrisse color Dark Mahogany Brown that I usually use. Wow. Two shampoos later and I still have brilliant burgundy stripes along at my hairline and surrounding my face. I wish I&#x27;d read the other reviews before trying this product. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with not enough product - my hair is down to my shoulder blades, but this is only for root touch-up, and I did like the applicator...but OMG the COLOR!! I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I&#x27;m going into work tomorrow looking like a teenager who tried an experiment that went oh, so very wrong!! I indeed look like a truck stop waitress. I expected a whole lot more from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I use the light blonde and it is great for in between touch ups.  My only complaint is there is not enough of the stuff to do all my hair....</li>
    <li> I have darker hair and regularly use Loreal Excellence 9 1/2 NB so was a little worried that I would get orange roots from 9. Fortunately that didn&#x27;t happen, the shade 9 matched perfectly without any brassiness. This is a good product for a quick touchup in between colorings to avoid over-drying/ damaging hair or if you just want it to look its best for a special occasion or such but in no way does it replace a regular re-dye in a cheaper convenient  alternative. The applicator was easy to use to target the new growth but even spot-targeting it was not nearly enough product to cover the entire head. I got the hairline and top of head (where it parts) lightened but most of the back and interior growth is not affected/lightened.</li>
    <li> I love my stylist, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  However, I don&#x27;t like paying high prices for increasingly frequent touch-ups to my foil highlights. I was reluctant to try Root Rescue, as my previous experience with home hair color have been nothing short of disastrous. Call me nuts, but I just don&#x27;t like my hair when I go for subtle blonde and end up with Bozo Red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Dark Blonde shade, mixed fractions of the two ingredients, and tried them on an inconspicuous spot.  About eight minutes later, I rinsed, washed and rinsed, and voila!  Grays were colored a nice, believable shade.  Next time, I tried the product where I part my hair, at the temples and around my hairline.  Again: great results. My stylist says that my hair \\&quot;grabs\\&quot; color very well, so I did not leave the product on for the recommended ten minutes.  My advice: Experiment carefully, and rinse the product a little earlier than the ten-minute mark.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use, but if you are a medium blonde, the color this shows comes out MUCH lighter than the package color (the lightest blonde really possible) and doesn&#x27;t really cover the grey in 12 minutes.  I would suggest going a darker color for grey, or trying the Clairol color one or Just For Men box (men&#x27;s section) that is not just for men really... as women say it works very well.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple root touch up! Wish there was a little more in the bottle but over all did a good job!</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me, and I am extremely happy with the outcome. In fact, I can&#x27;t imagine any salon doing a better job. I just saved the $130.00 that I normally spend to have my hair colored at my favorite salon. My hair colorist/stylist isn&#x27;t going to be too happy that I did it myself, but oh well... I am thrilled!!!!! The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that there isn&#x27;t much in one bottle. Even though I have short hair, I purchased and USED two full boxes to get all my roots covered, and I mixed most all of the rest in with my whole head of hair, so that my whole head of hair got the same new color treatment (new to me anyway). I used what little I had left over to do my eyebrows, too. Yes, I know that you aren&#x27;t supposed to do that, but somebody had to do it...my hair colorist normally does it when it&#x27;s time for my hair to be colored, so I figured why not me this time. I just went for it, and now my eyebrows look terrific, too! I think the biggest challenge for anyone is choosing the right color to use on our already colored hair. That is the part that scared me the most. Well, that and maybe my hair turning out green, pink, or purple by me doing something wrong. This was my very first attempt at coloring my hair...EVER. I am soooooooo happy with myself for saving so much money, and I am thrilled with the results, especially the way it completely colored my somewhat resistant gray hair. It also helps that everyone that has seen me since I colored my own hair asks me what I&#x27;ve done to my hair because it looks terrific! Maybe the reason that so many of us had good results is because we did the test strand that is recommended by Loreal. It&#x27;s better to mess up on a little piece of hair, rather than mess up your whole head of hair. I will ALWAYS do a test strand, even if I use the very same product again. Happy coloring, ladies!</li>
    <li> the bottle is a pain to use and, even though my hair colors easily, most of my gray was not covered  then, you can&#x27;t even send them an email to discuss the problem  loreal only wants a phone call during business hours</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a limited budget as most of us are, and I get my hair cut and colored about 3 times a year at a cost of $120 and in between appts I discovered root rescue! It helps me go longer between appts and my hair looks great! I buy 2 boxes as I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s easy and fast! Have tried other brands but the color doesn&#x27;t match or last as long. Highly recommend if you have blond hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use with their applicator. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair after 3 months of using it. It matches the shade well. Just noticed that it is only for roots not all over your head. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just used this 20 minutes ago, and my hair came out exactly the same color. I am kind of irritated, because I just put a plethora of chemicals in my hair and it didn&#x27;t even turn out. I will not buy this again. It was a waste of money. If I would have kept my receipt I would have done the money-back guarantee.</li>
    <li> It works and is easy.  Sometimes it seems like it gets a little brassy but I found it does cover the roots and works quickly and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Was easy to use and covered well. I just wish it had a separate conditioner included.</li>
    <li> Love this product, have been using it since it came out.  Panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find it on shelf at stores.  So glad Amazon has it.  It matches my colored light blonde hair perfectly and does a great job on my grays.  Find your match and I believe you will love it too.</li>
    <li> Wow. I usually use clairol nice n easy 10 minute root touch up in #9, light blonde to get me 3-4 more weeks before salon visit. I have blonde hair from my colorist and I get dark roots every 4 weeks. My local drugstore was out of clairol so I picked up this one. I am impressed and very happy! This works like a charm if used on 1-2&amp;#34; of root growth (I have dark roots, not gray). I leave the clairol one in for an hour- this one looked very red/orange after 40 minutes so I panicked and washed it out, very scared. It looks amazing- no orange or red and blends my roots right in, not even noticeable. Saved me $120 for the next couple of weeks. Stocking up on this one to get me through between colorings!</li>
    <li> I am writing this as I sit with half of my roots dyed on my head. I was able to do my top and some of my sides before I ran out. I color my hair often and I know I did not use too much. I should have just bought the box of preference to do my roots but this was cheaper &amp; I had a coupon but now that I have to get another box its gonna cost me more in the long run..UGH!</li>
    <li> Worked well, but like many of these products it is a one-time use. I much prefer the new &amp;#34;Mousse&amp;#34; which mixes as you use it, not wasting any unused portion.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! If you read the notation on Root Rescue box it says it is &amp;#34;Suitable for roots that are one shade lighter or darker than your colored hair.&amp;#34;  Unless you are a blond, gray hair will always be more than one shade lighter! And yet L&#x27;Oreal makes the claim that its product &amp;#34;will color even the most defiant grays.&amp;#34; Unfortunately, my &#x27;defiant grays&#x27; when treated with Root Rescue&#x27;s Medium Auburn turned a brilliant raspberry -and yes, I followed the directions to a &#x27;T&#x27;.  Clairol&#x27;s Root Touch-Up, while not as convenient, has no such caveat about &amp;#34;one shade lighter or darker&amp;#34; and my results replicate the color on its box.  I will never be seduced by a sale again and strongly caution brunette and auburn users against the use of Root Rescue.</li>
    <li> only got it in a pinch so it did the job on my roots but colored my bangs a light purple! beware if you have light blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered for an Aunt who was having difficulty finding her color match. She loved it, both in color matching and how it did not dry out her hair. Arrived second day delivery with good packaging.</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I would like - begins to wash out after 2 shampoos even using color safe shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Easy to use applicator with a little plastic comb at the end - very easy to apply. I like this product more than the Clairol version, which has a dinky little brush you have to dip into a flimsy dish. **  This is NOT for your entire head.  There is only enough product for the part in your hair, and temples/hairline.  It is just to keep you looking polished until you get to the salon a week or two later. Buy a regular box of color if you want to do your entire head. I have read too many reviews of people complaining there isn&#x27;t enough product.  I have tried a few colors and the results are slightly darker than the picture on the package.  Do a test first to make sure you&#x27;re getting the color you want.  I will be buying this from Amazon going forward because it is almost $2 cheaper than stores where I live.</li>
    <li> Perfect match for my highlighted hair. I have very thick, coarse curly hair and one is fine for just the part, crown and temples. I use two if I want to cover more. I get salon color done so this saves me some money because I can  push back the number of times I have to go to the colorist for a re-do. As an add-on item is great price. No mess. I leave it on for 15 minutes because of how thick and coarse my hair is. Does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Turned my hair clown red!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today to touch up my brown roots and it worked perfectly! It looks like I spent $100 at the salon! This product is so easy to use and rinses out very fast. It works wonders!</li>
    <li> I tried this because I&#x27;ve been using Clairol&#x27;s Root Touch-Up, which was very easy to use, but the color is a little brassy and my hair got dried out after a few uses.  So I wanted something like it, but an improvement. This was very much not an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says \\&quot;low ammonia,\\&quot; but it stank so bad, my eyes teared up while I was applying it. My scalp stung, which apparently means you&#x27;re not supposed to use it, but I did anyway -- yes, I know, my fault.  An hour later, my scalp is throbbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is supposed to be quick &amp; easy to use, but the comb thing is attached to a big plastic tube. You have to squeeze it to get the goo to come out, and it&#x27;s really hard to control how much goo comes out at once.  Sometimes I couldn&#x27;t get anything to come out and other times big gobs came gushing out.  It was very hard to control, hard to direct it where to put color, and it stunk so bad and stung so bad, I started moving fast, just to get it over with as fast as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are iffy at best. I can&#x27;t tell if I missed spots because I was hurrying -- though, I think, if anything, I got way too much color gobbed on in most places -- but most of the places where I put the goo show hardly any signs of having been colored at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did provide little plastic sleeves for my glasses, which was a thoughtful touch. But hair color itself was unpleasant and a disappointment. I will not buy it again. Big thumbs down.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have nearly 90% prematurely white hair.  Not grey, but absolute bedsheet white.  Most \\&quot;light blonde\\&quot; haircolor winds up being way too light on my hair so I surprised myself when, on a whim, I chose light blonde instead of  medium.  Figuring that I&#x27;d need to give it extra time to develop, I left it on for close to 25 minutes, and when I dried my hair, was extremely pleased to find beautiful seamless color on par with what I get in the salon.  While I color my hair in the salon every 4 -5 weeks, this makes it possible to avoid the \\&quot;white skunk stripe\\&quot; in between visits.  I use it once a week and virtually never see a root.  My only complaint is that I wish they would give you more product.  I can only treat my part and a few rows on either side, my hairline and temples and a tiny bit in back of the crown.  It is crazy because for a few more bucks, you can buy a whole kit of color and do your whole head.  However, touching up so frequently cuts down on the coverage needed.  The application is quick and easy although I find I have to use my fingers to spread the solution.  Overall, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I rotate between the light blonde and the medium blonde and both match my color. I also need to leave on longer for my resistant greys.  This is a very  healthy color for my hair possibly due to the rape seed oil listed in the ingredients. Any any rate, this color works well for me.  I use Frederick Fekkai shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair right after dying with this and as a regular shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is thick and healthy but I also take Irwin hair skin and nails and ultra hair and oil smart capsules.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I wish I knew about it sooner! Works really well and is quick and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Not enough product by any stretch, awful applicator, messy to fill if you&#x27;re not careful and not a big difference price-wise between regular size hair color.</li>
    <li> I HAD BEEN using Clariol &amp;#34;Root Touch-Up. Tried this product once and will never go back. The applicator is very easy to use and does not require the mixing and continious dipping into like the Clariol.  The color is the lightest they offer and blends in wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Even though I only paid a few dollars for my L&#x27;Oreal Root Rescue (8 med blonde) I am sending back the receipt and upc code to get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a few reviews that said the color wasnt right, well I had absolutely no color difference in my hair - it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other hair color products before so its not me the consumer, its definitely the product that was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;First, it was too liquidy and runny;  I like the foam products better.  I followed the directions too and my result was absolutely nothing.  I had the same stray gray roots as before I started.  I never had a color product that did absolutely nothing.  So I am sending in for a refund.</li>
    <li> Skimpy amount and the applicator is stiff and ineffective. For $7-8 a bottle this is a rip. I could only do my part area &amp; temples &amp; then ran out.  Color blending is good, that&#x27; sway 1 star.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Root Rescue and I won&#x27;t bother again.  It is very awkward to use the brush and the color comes out either too fast or not enough when you squeeze it.  The coverage is good but be careful if you run it through the rest of your hair like I do because it grabs fast.  It also stained my skin much more than the Nice and Easy brand.  I&#x27;m going back to Nice and Easy for sure.</li>
    <li> wonderful color this is great</li>
    <li> I color my hair regularly, and have been doing so for over a decade.  I always dye it red.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of products from many lines.  I decided to try root touch up products recently to see if it would make things any easier. L&#x27;oreal Root Rescue did not rescue my roots.  It colored them unevenly and darkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of application - poor.  comb/applicator included is more frustrating than usable and I ended up taking it off.  Also the coloring mixture is very runny and drippy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of rinsing - rinsed out quickly, but doesn&#x27;t include conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results - Poor.  I chose 6r because I wanted a light coppery auburn.  I got a medium dark coppery brown.  My roots look nothing like my previous colorings.  Admittedly they don&#x27;t look grey either.  I have splotchy uneven medium coppery brown roots and 6R red hair everywhere past the roots.  This is obviously not what I wanted.  Hilariously I hear 4R colors more like a 6R.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion?  If you want a natural looking red, go buy a box of Revlon Colorsilk (root stuff or regular).  It&#x27;s cheap as heck and does an absolutely great job at root coverage and shade matching.  It also has minimal fading.  If you want an extreme unnatural red go buy Garnier.  Their reds are intense and incredibly fade resistant (years later I can still see that strip of R3 on my hair).</li>
