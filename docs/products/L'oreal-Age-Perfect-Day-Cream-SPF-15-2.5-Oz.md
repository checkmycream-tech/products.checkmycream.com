      <li>Thanks, The Best Seller on time real item Thank you....</li>
      <li>be careful, it&#x27;s not age perfect.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance - clean without being overpowering and has SPF 15 which in most parts of the country is adequate.  </li>
      <li>Really made skin feel good</li>
      <li>Wow A+, excellent product, super fast shipment, would buy again!!</li>
      <li>It appears the Marine Collagen formula is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>It feels fantastic when you put it on, luxurious and creamy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, not greasy and my skin never turned oily throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Spend your money as you see fit.</li>
      <li>know if that&#x27;s true, and she is not looking 30 years younger, but she isreally happy with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried ALOT of moisturizer and this is by far the best one I have ever used especially for the price.</li>
      <li>It seems a good product especially considering the price</li>
      <li>It is mild, and keeps my skin moisturizer, without being greasy.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, dry skin which seems to take exception to most creams</li>
      <li>I live in an extremely cold region and feel that L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect day cream will be good for my face.</li>
      <li>It is an ordinary day cream with SPF 15...which could be more effective if it were higher.</li>
      <li>I was interested to review this product, since I use L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift skin regimen.  </li>
      <li>Consistent use does work with this face cream.</li>
      <li>I do it after cleaning face in the morning and at night after cleaning and getting ready for bed!</li>
      <li>It is adaquate, but nothing special so far as I can see.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice daytime moisturizer for normal to dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It goes on nicely, but I can buy 15 SPF for much less.  </li>
      <li>The jar is quite large, and will probably supply a consumer 2-3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels luxurious on my skin and really seems to work.</li>
      <li>Works very well and doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>You do need too take time too gently rub it in on face and neck.  </li>
      <li>My skin is normal leaning toward dry, so I&#x27;ve used many face moisturizers over the years, and the one I&#x27;ve used the longest is this one.</li>
      <li>My face never got that &amp;#34;sticky mask&amp;#34; sensation that so many other moisturizers leave.  </li>
      <li>I would prefer if it had more active ingredients, though.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I read only the Age Perfect Day Cream part thinking once again that this would improve the newest lines in my face.  </li>
      <li>Bet product for older skin</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I liked it because I usually always buy Lancome but the price and quality of this cream</li>
      <li>Instead they sent me the new formula which uses Soy in place of the Marine Collagen.  </li>
      <li>Am not sure that a similar product from the high end cosmetic companies would be any better.</li>
      <li>and I believe this helps in the early hours until I seat</li>
      <li>SO far this is doing the  job.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t  surprised.  </li>
      <li>My skin immediately feels more hydrated and plumped, yet the cream doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and lasts several hours.</li>
      <li>While this cream felt good going on, I found it to be too thin and &#x27;watery&#x27; to deliver a lasting effect.  </li>
      <li>It might work perfectly on &#x27;less needy&#x27; skin, but it isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>

<li> Greasy and heavy.</li>
<li> Not easy to absorb.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It has spf 15 so that you can go out with just the cream,  I do wear it with liquid makeup.</li>
    <li> I could no longer afford to buy landline and wanted the same cream quality.  This is wonderful, especially for winter, and it has a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Wife has been using this product for a short while and has seen slight improvement so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years along with the night cream and am very happy with the results.  Am not sure that a similar product from the high end cosmetic companies would be any better.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Like the creaminess of this brand. It does help with age spots over time.</li>
    <li> It will be good for the spring and summer to protect your skin from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
    <li> Greasy and heavy. Not easy to absorb.</li>
    <li> Nice day cream. Lasts longer than most I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very happy with results.  Hydrates but is invisible on skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered Lorea Paris &amp;#34;Age Perfect&amp;#34; Hydra-Nutrition.  I received Loreal &amp;#34;Age Perfect&amp;#34; day cream and they were put in a different box showing what I ordered.  As soon as I received my Discover bill, I will dispute this matter and ask for a refund.  This is considered &amp;#34;fraud&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;deception&amp;#34; because I can purchase the day cream anywhere for about 3-4$ less.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money</li>
    <li> I was interested to review this product, since I use L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift skin regimen.  Age Perfect is a wonderful cream that moisturizes your skin, helps reverse the visible process of aging AND protects your face from sun damage.

    <li> Consistent use does work with this face cream.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 days but discontinued due to a burning sensation.  I have very fine, dry skin which seems to take exception to most creams so I wasn&#x27;t  surprised.  It seems a good product especially considering the price but obviously it wasn&#x27;t for me.  If your skin isn&#x27;t as picky as mine, try it. It has a nice fragrance - clean without being overpowering and has SPF 15 which in most parts of the country is adequate.  The cream isn&#x27;t thick and absorbs well.  Try it, for the price it seems a good deal.</li>
    <li> Let me predicate my comments by telling you that I have dry, &amp;#34;older skin&amp;#34;.  While this cream felt good going on, I found it to be too thin and &#x27;watery&#x27; to deliver a lasting effect.  It might work perfectly on &#x27;less needy&#x27; skin, but it isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and loved it.  The last time I ordered it they didn&#x27;t send me the Marine Collagen version (which the picture shows).  Instead they sent me the new formula which uses Soy in place of the Marine Collagen.  It appears the Marine Collagen formula is no longer available.  I have an allergy to soy and I had to go through the hassle of returning the product.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Was happy to get same great face cream at a reduced price</li>
    <li> Great I am a Senior Lady I have beautiful skin.  I have used this for years, and will always.  It is the best I have ever used, so why break the mold  I do not plan too!  You do need too take time too gently rub it in on face and neck.  I do it after cleaning face in the morning and at night after cleaning and getting ready for bed! This works Ladies!</li>
    <li> The cream creates more of  a film on the surface of the skin. Very little of it actually hydrates the skin.</li>
    <li> Bet product for older skin</li>
    <li> SO far this is doing the  job. I work in the sun and I believe this helps in the early hours until I seat then I use a sunscreen. Pleasant smell</li>
    <li> Gave it to my grandma.&lt;br /&gt;She said it works and it&#x27;s the best cream she ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, and she is not looking 30 years younger, but she isreally happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I liked this but wanted to use both the night and day cream of the Revitalift.  I feel they work well together.</li>
    <li> I buy this for the birthday of my mom. Great product,good price. She is happy whit this.</li>
    <li> It is adaquate, but nothing special so far as I can see.  It is an ordinary day cream with SPF 15...which could be more effective if it were higher.</li>
    <li> burn&#x27;t my skin when applied. be careful, it&#x27;s not age perfect.</li>
    <li> Thanks, The Best Seller on time real item Thank you....</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  I&#x27;m 65 and am getting complements on my complexion.  I have used for about 3 years now.</li>
    <li> My mother swears by this stuff. What can I say...it&#x27;s the gift I get her every birthday and Christmas.</li>
    <li> I like this skin cream for two reasons. It feels luxurious on my skin and really seems to work. My skin does feel and look younger.</li>
    <li> My favorite day cream, received promptly.</li>
    <li> Wow A+, excellent product, super fast shipment, would buy again!!</li>
    <li> My skin is normal leaning toward dry, so I&#x27;ve used many face moisturizers over the years, and the one I&#x27;ve used the longest is this one. It feels fantastic when you put it on, luxurious and creamy. My skin immediately feels more hydrated and plumped, yet the cream doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and lasts several hours. With SPF 15, this also works as a light sunscreen and makes it perfect when you&#x27;re going out. This is definitely my favorite face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen.  Unfortunately I read only the Age Perfect Day Cream part thinking once again that this would improve the newest lines in my face.  Before using the new jar I decided to read the small print only to find that the SPF 15 was not an additional ingredient in the cream, but that WAS the cream.  Just a sunscreen.  It goes on nicely, but I can buy 15 SPF for much less.  Shame on me for not reading before I purchased my 3rd or 4th jar.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice daytime moisturizer for normal to dry skin.  I would prefer if it had more active ingredients, though.</li>
    <li> Way to go, L&#x27;Oreal.  This face cream (says it is a sunscreen on the jar itself, not a cream for anything like age spots or wrinkles)  BURNS MY EYES.  This cream burns my eyes.  Terrific.  What face cream might not get in the eyes.  Way to go L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> It is mild, and keeps my skin moisturizer, without being greasy. I have used it for many years, and had no alerting reactions to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years now.  Works very well and doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT ! TOTALLY REVITALIZED MY AGING SKIN ~</li>
    <li> I have tried ALOT of moisturizer and this is by far the best one I have ever used especially for the price. Usually I have to use oil and a cream as my skin is really dry, but not this this, and I use it for day and night. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how much I liked it because I usually always buy Lancome but the price and quality of this cream I thougth was excellent!</li>
    <li> Really made skin feel good</li>
    <li> I had surgery and was not allowed to use cream on my face for two weeks.  My skin looked the same with or without this cream.  So its up to you. Spend your money as you see fit.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes ones face feel.........creamy all day.  I put it under makeup.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year.  It makes my skin feel great and is a good sun protection measure.  My only complaint is that this product, like most with SPF protection creams, stings my eyes for a few minutes after application to my face.</li>
    <li> Love this and will never by in store again, always online!!  Much better price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay day creams for several years. Decided to try this one, and am happy to say I just love it. I live in an extremely cold region and feel that L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect day cream will be good for my face.</li>
    <li> Really great skin cream.  I bought it because of the TV commercials, and I&#x27;m happy that I did.  I&#x27;ll rebuy when my supply runs out.</li>
    <li> Have used only this for years.  Better than a lot of expensive creams</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream with FPS 15, that I use always, because hydrate my skin and renew it constantly.</li>
    <li> bought for mom she loves it</li>
