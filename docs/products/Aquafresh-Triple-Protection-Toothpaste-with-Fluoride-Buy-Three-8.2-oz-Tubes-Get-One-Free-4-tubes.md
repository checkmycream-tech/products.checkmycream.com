      <li>I like the taste, the feeling of clean teeth afterwards, no gritty residue, and it must be doing a good job since I don&#x27;t have any dental</li>

      <li>Have used this product for many years and really like the taste, plus the floride protection that it gives me.</li>
      <li>And ALL the brands there have some sort of EXTRA WHITENING or SUPER BRIGHT, or something like that.  </li>
      <li>We like that this toothpaste seems to foam a little during use and the flavor is good.  :)</li>
      <li>Aquafresh leaves your Teeth feeling very Clean and gives your whole mouth a Fresh Clean Sensation that Lasts and Lasts. ...</li>
      <li>Clean, fresh, invigorating.</li>

      <li>Fresh Breath&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I bought a four pack of the Fresh.</li>

      <li>Usually right over the expiration date.  </li>
      <li>This used to be a really good toothpaste when I was little.</li>
      <li>this was s real deal!</li>
      <li>They were pretty flimsy.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>Glad I learned about the various colored labels.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Aqua fresh is a gift for a family member who travels and is not always in a location to buy Aqua Fresh when they are running low or nearly of  tooth paste.</li>
      <li>Either that or I&#x27;ve gotten older.</li>
      <li>As a single man, a single tube of the Fresh lasts me a good long while.</li>
      <li>But this AQUAFRESH, is normal.  </li>
      <li>The red, white and blue colors make it look “hip and happening” and kids will most likely like this three color toothpaste, too.</li>
      <li>This non-whitening old style has just disappeared off all shelves in San Francisco.</li>
      <li>but I was surprised when I got soft toothpaste tubes.</li>
      <li>It has been in the Market since 1973 well known for it&#x27;s Striped Color Pattern, originally there were only Two Colors White and Blue, since 1981 there are Three Colors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aquafresh does not have a Grainy or Weird after Taste, like some others, it actually tastes very Smooth and Fresh.</li>
      <li>Not even ONE &#x27;NORMAL&#x27; or REGULAR, was there to pick.  </li>
      <li>The extra garbage in, those others, extra white, or super white toothpastes, just tastes damaging, to your health.  </li>
      <li>(The taste of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried simply doesn&#x27;t match Aqua Fresh for freshness.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Aquafresh. It&#x27;s my families favorite. This 4 pack was a great deal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste - what can you say...other than, in a family of 5, it&#x27;s nice to have 4 tubes around just in case.</li>
    <li> Aquafresh is excellent toothpaste! It has fluoride to prevent cavities, a great taste and it stays fresh a good while after I buy it. The red, white and blue colors make it look “hip and happening” and kids will most likely like this three color toothpaste, too. Just as others have noted, this toothpaste reduces and often even removes stains on my teeth when I use it to brush regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this toothpaste; it really does a great job!</li>
    <li> Great taste and dose a great job on your teeth and gums</li>
    <li> This non-whitening old style has just disappeared off all shelves in San Francisco. It has calcium instead of silica as scrubbing agent, a lot easier on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever! Good flavor and fluoride protection.</li>
    <li> I had been having a trouble with my gums and thought it might be the toothpaste.  I had been trying different ones and ran upon this one.  Hadn&#x27;t used in many years.  The toothpastes are rated at the bottom of all tubes with either a green, blue, red, or black label.  Usually right over the expiration date.  The best ones to use are the greens and blues.  The Crest toothpaste which was supposed to whiten had a red label on it.  I started using this about a week ago, and my gums are feeling better.  Also tastes good and leaves teeth feeling clean.  Someone had stated, \\&quot;Toothpaste is toothpaste\\&quot;, but some are better than others.  Glad I learned about the various colored labels.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t understand what people were saying about the flimsy tubes.  The ones I received are like any other toothpaste tube.</li>
    <li> I looked at the walmart for some toothpaste, just during this last year.  And ALL the brands there have some sort of EXTRA WHITENING or SUPER BRIGHT, or something like that.  ALL of them.  Not even ONE &#x27;NORMAL&#x27; or REGULAR, was there to pick.  For the longest time, there was arm and hammer.  But, even it, has gone, the extra nonsense way.  But this AQUAFRESH, is normal.  And it works great.  Feels great, tastes correct or great.  The extra garbage in, those others, extra white, or super white toothpastes, just tastes damaging, to your health.  So with that logic, this AQUAFRESH, taste healthy.  Good experience.  I think I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, what do you want me to say about it?  The taste is fine, it came in a 4 pack which is nice.  There&#x27;s really not much else to say.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is, in my judgment, outstanding. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh, with my teeth protected from cavities. The ingredients in this toothpaste are excellent.</li>
    <li> We bought the &amp;#34;buy 3 - get one free&amp;#34; Aquafresh offer. There are four in the family, and all seem to like Aquafresh. Brushing teeth once or twice daily makes buying 4 tubes of toothpaste at once a good buy.</li>
    <li> Favorite tooth paste...this was s real deal!</li>
    <li> Aqua fresh is a gift for a family member who travels and is not always in a location to buy Aqua Fresh when they are running low or nearly of  tooth paste.</li>
    <li> No nasty tartar control or whitening to make sensitive teeth.  This dentist recommends</li>
    <li> mint flavor not regular flavor</li>
    <li> Aquafresh is the Toothpaste I like to use everyday. It has been in the Market since 1973 well known for it&#x27;s Striped Color Pattern, originally there were only Two Colors White and Blue, since 1981 there are Three Colors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red for Healthy Gums&lt;br /&gt;White for Strong Teeth&lt;br /&gt;Blue (Aqua) for Fresh Breath&lt;br /&gt;The Slogan for Aquafresh is \\&quot;Three in one Protection for Your Family\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquafresh does not have a Grainy or Weird after Taste, like some others, it actually tastes very Smooth and Fresh. Aquafresh Triple Protection Fights Cavities and Strengthens Teeth with Fluoride, also it removes Stains on the Teeth with regular brushing. Aquafresh leaves your Teeth feeling very Clean and gives your whole mouth a Fresh Clean Sensation that Lasts and Lasts. ...Thank You D.D.</li>
    <li> love this toothpaste and love the value</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I ordered.  I&#x27;ve been unable to find this in retail stores.  We like that this toothpaste seems to foam a little during use and the flavor is good.  :)</li>
    <li> This came with a fourth tube for no extra charge. The price I paid was 13.99. Free 2 day shipping with my Prime membership. Add it all up and I would never buy my Aquafresh anywhere else except for the fact that the price changes.</li>
    <li> My hygienist turned me on to toothpaste without whiteners because, for me, whiteners seem to give me white bumps on my tongue.  This Aquafresh is just the ticket for me.  Glad to be able to get a supply so I don&#x27;t have to go searching in every drugstore in town.  It is really rather hard to find without whiteners.</li>
    <li> This used to be a really good toothpaste when I was little. I think they changed the formula. Either that or I&#x27;ve gotten older. It&#x27;s not specifically a &#x27;kids&#x27; toothpaste. But it tastes too sugary. I like the cost of the product. But as far as the cleanning and taste, I am sticking with the other brands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Not too powerful flavor-wise.&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;No tooth-damaging grit that you get with &amp;#34;Whitening&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Complete&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Total&amp;#34; toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;And at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aqua Fresh toothpaste for at least thirty years now. I&#x27;ve tried the other brands, and they simply don&#x27;t match up. I love its nice, fresh taste. And I like the way it leaves my mouth feeling. (The taste of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried simply doesn&#x27;t match Aqua Fresh for freshness.) I&#x27;ve used this particular variety of Aqua Fresh for the past few years, since it provides protection against tartar and plaque buildup, something with which I&#x27;ve had trouble over the years. I brush regularly after every meal as well as before bedtime. I also use mouthwash twice a day. Doing all this and faithfully buying Aqua Fresh has produced good checkups at the dentist office in recent years.</li>
    <li> I sure do. That&#x27;s why I bought a four pack of the Fresh. As a single man, a single tube of the Fresh lasts me a good long while. So, whenever I do run out, I constantly forget to re-up my stash. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that for hopefully a year +. How long does a typical tube even last!?</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste since I was a kid.  I love buying bulk from amazon, so I always have it on hand..</li>
    <li> For some reason this is the only toothpaste that my husband likes, and finally I have found it on Amazon.  It does a good job and keeps his breath fresh, and maybe he even brushes more often now that I have found it again.</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I KEEP TRYING OTHER BRANDS BUT ALWAYS RETURN TO THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> It is suitable price. It has good smell and not sensitize. It has Fluoride. Buy three get one free, I like it.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve been blessed with good saliva. I haven&#x27;t always been kind to my teeth and yet they have held up well and need very little dentist office cleaning. But I have to give some credit to my toothpaste which has always been Aquafresh. I like the taste, the feeling of clean teeth afterwards, no gritty residue, and it must be doing a good job since I don&#x27;t have any dental issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has a number of differnt toothpastes and once in a while, I&#x27;ll try one of his. I can&#x27;t stand the flavor and the long lasting aftertaste that seems to make all your food and drink taste horrible for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m pleased on many levels.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, so what&#x27;s to say. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years and really like the taste, plus the floride protection that it gives me.</li>
    <li> This Aquafresh Triple Protection toothpaste is the best.  It cleans but does not irritate my gums like the whitening kind.  It was hard to find so we were pleased to see it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read right but I was surprised when I got soft toothpaste tubes. They were pretty flimsy. But they did arrive on time</li>
    <li> Great taste and clean fresh feeling when using and very economical.</li>
    <li> wrong item sent, not as pictured &amp; presented</li>
    <li> I like aquafresh.  It&#x27;s my favorite toothpaste.  i give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Aquafresh is an excellent toothpaste. Clean, fresh, invigorating. Was amazed that I got it at the price that I did.</li>
