    <li> best thing ever made!</li>
    <li> This is a very useful tool for a teenager with blackhead issues. Very good value. Gets the job done easily.</li>
    <li> This is a really effective tool. My face is always covered in white heads/black heads that I never could get rid of. The first time I used this, I removed almost every little embedded white head/black head from my forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin. Trust me, there was a lot that I visibly saw being extracted by this tool.     I used this after washing my face in a hot shower. I also keep the tool clear as I use it by dipping it in rubbing alcohol inbetween extractions, and rinsing it off in hot water. You have to keep your face wet for this to work after a shower, cause only then will the black heads be visible enough/soft enough to extract.     Just drag the big loop of large areas to extract many white heads at once, such as your forhead/chin. Making sure to press it flat onto the skin, and running it over so that it presses out the heads. The smaller end is for targeting areas, such as the smaller parts of your nose, and any black heads that aren&#x27;t removed with the big loop.    The best way to use this is to scrape/drag it over the skin, slowly, but deliberately. The smaller end can be placed over a specific black head, and dragged towards the end of the loop to fully extract it.     Make sure to wash your face after using this, and if possible use of a disinfectant is best like chlorhexidine or rubbing alcohol (if you don&#x27;t mind the stinging). And make sure to moisturize after using this or any exfoliating techniques.     I would say this is a very good buy, and its really inexpensive at only $1.89 + $3.20 shipping, so $5 dollars. Its better than the Biore pore strips, because it can be used anywhere and is reusable and more effective.</li>
    <li> this is amazing. it squeezes the pimples and pops them. i haven&#x27;t had any scaring AND it popped things i didnt even know could be popped</li>
    <li> I bought two of these recently, and they are awful. Too bad because I bought one several years ago, and it was fantastic.    The difference is in the manufacturing.    The older version is like a fine medical instrument.  The loops that are used to express the comedone are strong but very thin, well-angled and appropriately sized for the task, and smoothly finished.    By contrast, the two that I bought most recently look like they were made by your average eighth grader in metal shop.  The loops are not angled at all, are three to four times the diameter of those on the good one, and are coarse in both their dimensions and finish--in fact the edges are kind of sharp and they appear to be not finished at all.  Both implements are completely useless for the task.  No better than using a paper clip.      Both the old and the new were made in Pakistan and sold by Revlon.  I guess things are really going down hill in Pakistan--and apparently also at Revlon quality control.      Five years ago, I would have said:  \\&quot;buy it.\\&quot;   Now it&#x27;s a waste of your money even at the few bucks they charge.   DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK UNTIL REVLON GETS ITS ACT BACK TOGETHER.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. It does get some of the blackheads out, however it&#x27;s pretty difficult and slightly painful. The metal loops really need to scrape the skin, which sometimes makes it bleed.</li>
    <li> I had my suspicions about this, but once I used it, I liked it. It is a helpful aid in removing nasty blackheads. The larger end does not work as well for me, and I will admit that it does sort of hurt to use-other than that, its great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had blackheads on my nose, but recently, some popped up on my chin.  I wanted to try and get rid of them so bought this product.  It works - but the next day my chin was still red, and I didn&#x27;t even push that hard.  I&#x27;m hoping the redness goes down soon - don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this again unless I don&#x27;t have anywhere to go for a few days.</li>
    <li> The best invention since the facial! I cried when I lost mine!</li>
    <li> Gift for someone - they really liked it</li>
    <li> I paid no more than 5$ including shipping for this item. After thurough comparison shopping here on amazon i decided i didnt want to overpay especially for an item that ive never owned before. I just started doing my own facials at home and so far, the thing has done its job. The metal isnt the highest of quality and its not an ergonomically designed tool. It works but i now understand why others cost $50+. Quality. If i had the money to invest in a higher quality facial tool, I would consider a more expensive one.</li>
    <li> it;s easy to use and can remove blackhead easily. it;s a little painful, but I think it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. I can do just as well without it</li>
    <li> My son uses it for the purpose it was made for.  He loves it.  Thank you...I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I opted for a more expensive brand and design over this one initially.  I wish I&#x27;d have been cheap and just bought this one in the first place.  The other one was sharp and it was hard to use without cutting the skin.  Defeats the whole purpose of using a tool instead of your finger nails.  Anyway, the loops on the Revlon gently coax out trapped white or black heads of all sizes.  One complaint on many of these is that one loop is too big and, therefore, useless.  Both ends of this one work for me.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this. It doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads without damaging your face. Only useful if you enjoy red, swollen, infected and eventually scarred skin. I would not recommend this product for my worst enemy. Save your money and see a dermatologist instead :)</li>
    <li> This item is \\&quot;OK\\&quot; in removing blackheads; however, if used by a careless person (who slams this product down of their nose trying to force blackheads out) it will leave your nose red and irritated, bruised, and prematurely wrinkled for several days.  This product is effective in getting out the sebum from a pore, but the labor of going over the entire nose is extremely tedious if not impossible. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, from these to black-head removing strips, to medicated facial cleansers with salicylic acid or benzyl peroxide (these are the active ingredient in most mainstream facial cleansers such as Clearasil), to homemade solutions (involving gelatin) but nothing really seems to work. All processes (including this one) seem to do more damage than good.  My recommendation is to think about trying this product (perhaps your pores are less stubborn than mine) because it&#x27;s cheap, but be careful! Don&#x27;t bruise your nose like I stupidly did. If it doesn&#x27;t help your nose/cheeks/forehead look better (it definitely won&#x27;t make them look perfect; lets be realistic here), it will at least be satisfying to see that you&#x27;re clearing some of your pores.</li>
    <li> Blackheads stink! Which is why I am desperate to get rid of them so I purchased this product.  The best time to use it is after a nice hot shower when your pores are open.  In my experience, it removed some blackheads but not others.  Also, it was pretty painful removing them because I would put the remover against my skin and slide it down towards the end to scoop out the blackhead.  I had to push the remover pretty hard against my skin which hurt.  It isn&#x27;t a perfect item in my opinion.  I still use it from time to time but it is not the big answer I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before buying this one and this tool was incredibly easy to use and best of all, it actually does what it says it will do. I wondered about getting it before I bought it, but I figured for the reasonable price it was being sold for, why not give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. It works as long as you remember to use a slight scooping motion after pressing down.</li>
    <li> I have one of the Pakistani-made Revlon removers (bought it in 2010) and it looks and works perfectly--at least, the small loop end. The big loop end is so large as to be utterly useless, even on larger pimples (which is why I&#x27;m knocking a star off my review). The only other issue is it does not work well on the nose or other spongy tissue; it is best for the forehead or other large, flat areas.  It will still pull up some material from other areas if you are persistent with it, but it won&#x27;t get everything.  The small loop is fantastic as scooping out blackheads and whiteheads (in the right areas), but you need to follow my simple directions as the tool comes with none at all.  You absolutely *must* wet your face with warm water first (to open the pores and provide traction) or it might scratch up your skin. Be careful with how much pressure you exert; it can still make you bleed some even if you wet your skin if you get too aggressive with it.  It also depends on the nature of the skin problem you are working on (boils and other raised, infected surfaces are prime targets to get scraped open).  Wash the tool with hot water while you&#x27;re working with it (I do it between every swipe or two, or as soon as I notice a lot of goo collecting in the loop).  Washing it will flush out the collected pus, blood and/or other material, then wash again with antibacterial soap and hot water and dry it before putting it away. Be sure to wash your face with cool water after you&#x27;re done (to seal pores and remove any excess impurities left on surface).  This little tool is amazing for the price and has been a huge help to me over the past few years since I got it. Wish I&#x27;d had it when I was a teenager!  If you have problem skin, you should also look into the following all natural treatments: [[ASIN:B0011DI8K4 Manuka Oil 100% Pure East Cape 10ml/0.34oz]], [[ASIN:B001R7VT7S Manuka Honey Active UMF 18+ Certified East Cape New Zealand]] and [[ASIN:B000V96R1G Manuka Honey and Propolis Soap]], all of which I&#x27;ve reviewed and have been a big help to me with treating adult acne and other skin conditions.</li>
    <li> it actually does what it says. i have bad skin of all sorts and it helps with the nasty removal.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have not had the same success as some others reviewing the same product. No matter how I used it, I leave with red marks all over my face. I also think the holes are too big, given that a blackhead is normally much smaller than the openings in the remover are. Instead of removing only the blackhead, you end up with a dent in your face 5 times bigger than the actual area you need to remove the blackhead from. If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d choose another product. I don&#x27;t have any recommendations as I just use a face cleanser now, but even if I didn&#x27;t, the marks wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, not exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Works great and was 3 dollars cheaper than my local pharmacy, Rite Aid and CVS...</li>
    <li> Really love this product, it removed the blackheads and whiteheads without me having to squeeze them, which would result in me having scars on my face. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> USE A BOBBI PIN!!!  This is pointless to use when you can buy a pack of bobbi pins for less than a dollar and they work just as good...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not like I thought it was going to be. The one that I saw had a small round hole on one end and a little larger one on the other end. I had been looking everywhere for one and couldn&#x27;t find one... I will check again and see if you have what I want</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see the positive reviews here....my opinion was that this item was useless but since it seems to work for others, I wonder....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item did not work for me at all. In many attempted uses it removed only one blackhead. The problem is the loop construction. The loop puts pressure on only three sides of the blemish, the 4th side is not pressured and that allows the skin to swell in that direction and therefore the blemish does not get forced to the surface. This is true for me no matter how I try to use the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I had a similar tool where the implement was shaped like a small spoon with a hole in the bottom of the bowl. Pressing the hole down directly over the blemish put pressure on all four sides, leaving the blemish nowhere to move and this style tool would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later addition: After my spoon style tool failed on me sometimes I gave this one another try and after learning how to use it I&#x27;ve revised my opinion. This one requires a different technique. With the spoon style you simply mash straight down on the pimple and it pops. With this one that technique will not usually work. Instead you have to scrape the pimple with the loop. It does put pressure on the pimple and will pop it when used that way. Both styles work for me to varying degrees.</li>
    <li> This is sturdier than the wire loop blackhead removers, but that&#x27;s because the loops are so thick that they don&#x27;t do the job.  They work fine on big blackheads that are almost ready to come out on their own,  but by then  you don&#x27;t need this tool.</li>
    <li> I used the older version of this tool, in which the ends looked like cups with holes in them, for many years until it rusted. It was a great tool. It was nearly painless and I could get out any blackhead. Now the wire loop design of this one works well, but it is painful! The ends are not offset, so by design you apply more pressure to the tiny loop and it hurts! I am not using too much pressure either, the other version had offset ends and they were broader so that the pressure was applied equally and over more area. I am sad I threw out the old rusted one, I would gladly keep using it if I could as opposed to this version.</li>
    <li> These are great for removing black heads and pussy pimples. I had one of these for a while (I lost it) and was very happy with it. I decided to get another one. This one however had sharp inner edges that really hurt and kept me from using the product.</li>
    <li> In all honesty this instrument is of positively no worth. The only use i can think of for it would be as a Christmas tree ornament. It is absolutely useless for removing pimples. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This device does not work so good for me.  Maybe its my nose and face??  Good quality material, well made.</li>
    <li> The tool is too thick for my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t get under the blackhead to push it out. Three more words.</li>
    <li> Even though i ordered two they only sent me one but I guess it&#x27;s ok. :p Bought Two of these and the [[ASIN:B0009EILKS Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips , 14 Nose Strips]] and the Nose strips were ok too?</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast delivery.  These line of products are rare to find in your local pharmacy, but once you find them you will be very happy to use them.  Always wash your face with warm water and soap, if not any other face cleaning product before using it.  You will love this to get rid off your blackhead.  Always be gentle with your  face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I have no idea how to use this and there are no instructions.</li>
    <li> I am a picker. Have been since I can remember. Bought this in hopes of reducing the scarring that usually comes with cystic acne. Meh. It it a very light weight and thin tool. The edges are not blunt and rounded, so if you&#x27;re attempting to get after cystic acne, you will still take some skin with the junk out of your pores.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was a teen and have been looking for one since my son became a teenager. Thanks to Amazon I was able to locate and buy one for him.</li>
    <li> This works very well. But I also managed to find an entire kit by Equinox Intl. for a little more that had a neat case and several tools that I liked better</li>
    <li> Good product and good shipping.</li>
    <li> This device doesn&#x27;t bend or break and it works extremely well.  I bought this for my daughter because it is the same style her dermatologist uses.  I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tool. When I first got it I steamed my face over a pan of boiling water for 10 minutes and it worked amazing. Now when I see a blackhead and don&#x27;t have time to steam my face I&#x27;ll run a washcloth under warm water and hold it on the spot for a couple minutes, it makes it so much easier. I think I lost my tool yesterday, my 4 year old probably thought it looked like a sword for his action figures. If I can&#x27;t find it soon I&#x27;m going to order a new one. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> The older style of blackhead remover was far better, but this is better than most of the options out there.</li>
    <li> This product can work in some circumstances, but you have to be very gently using it to not damage the skin.</li>
    <li> This product came earlier than expected. Came in a letter and not a package. In order to use it make sure your skin is moist or it will hurt your nose more. What you see is what you get pretty much.</li>
    <li> I have very large pores and have trouble with blackheads. This thing helps remove them when needed. It also helps get rid of pimples.</li>
    <li> This product did not work. I tried several diffrent ways and even contacted the company. Would not recommend spending a penny on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had blackheads on my nose for years, probably since I was in high school way back in the day. So I figured I would try and get rid of them, and this thing works alright I suppose. There is a little bit of a learning curve with using the best way, but once you get it, it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Poor hubby has oily skin that tends toward blackheads...this tool makes it easier for extractions. I like this one because it&#x27;s easy for me to hold.</li>
    <li> This really do work, and is very sturdy. A handy item to have in your home, and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for a few years and found it very well made for such a simple thing.  It was made in Germany and that probably explains why such care and quality were put into this simple and small stainless steel implement. I gave the one I had to my teen age son and ordered another one online to replace it. Well, let me tell you, what I got is a piece of junk that is made in Pakistan that pales in comparison to the identical German made item. It&#x27;s a thin and flat stamped piece of stainless steel, where the German one was thicker and had a gentle curve at each end making it ergonomically well made and easy to use. The new one was flat and doesn&#x27;t really have rounded edges, so I had to bend each end to make it easier to use. It works ok, but I&#x27;m definitely not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I going on such a rant about what is basically an unimportant and insignificant thing? It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m very tired of the continuous downgrading of ALL products here in America over the last several years as a result of inflation, as manufacturers try to keep their prices down. I want to be able to purchase decent quality products and will pay an appropriate price for them, but most of the time there isn&#x27;t a quality product available anywhere in the marketplace. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the positive reviews, but this didn&#x27;t work any wonders for me! I followed all the tips online to try and make it work, but nope. Just pressed for a long time and a little bit  MIGHT come out, but for the most part you&#x27;re just hurting yourself. Going to look for one in other brands and hope it works.</li>
    <li> Honestly this doesn&#x27;t work that great for black heads. Especially stubborn ones.  I&#x27;m sure it can be a useful useful tool for certain situations but this doesn&#x27;t make generally removing blackheads that much easier.</li>
    <li> doesnt really work to well on me, a few white heads come out but not the deep blackheads, maybe on different persons skin might have different affect</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use and works pretty well. However, sometimes it is easier to use your fingers.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a really effective tool. The first time I used this, I removed almost every little embedded white head/black head from my  face.</li>
    <li> Good quality as described.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me, and if it did had to put a lot of pressure on it to the point where it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand...I think you&#x27;re supposed to drag it across your skin where the blackheads are and it&#x27;ll pull them out. Which isn&#x27;t much different from doing it with your fingers except there&#x27;s less dirt touching it (and then you just wash your face after, really). It was even a little weird to try and use. I&#x27;m glad it was cheap at least, so not too much of my money was wasted.</li>
    <li> With enough effort it does serve its purpose-- to remove blackheads. But, I was practically in tears after working on my nose with this tool for awhile. Nonetheless, I would still recommend it but do not have unrealistic expectations about how painless and effortless the process is going to be.</li>
    <li> How did I live all of my life without this magnificent device? Always be gentle, and this will be good to you.</li>
    <li> Not sure how big your blackhead has to be to be able to use this but I find areas on the face too sensitive for the amount of pressure you need to apply for such a big opening. However, very good for getting hard to reach pimples on your back.</li>
    <li> Most useless item I have EVER bought! You can not remove ANY blackheads with this thing! Total waste of 3.50 Dollars!</li>
    <li> Takes out white heads but its a little difficult to clean. leaves marks on my skin so if thats what you are looking for this is perfect for you. The best way to use this is to scrape/drag it over the skin, slowly. The smaller end can be placed over a specific black head, and dragged towards the end of the loop to fully extract it. Works but dont use it if you have to go out right away.</li>
    <li> This seems like a very primitive tool, but I purchased it thinking it would be smaller. There&#x27;s no science to this just \\&quot;rake\\&quot; the remover through and you should be getting blackheads. However, it is questionable how effective this can be. I didn&#x27;t see much going on despite seeing blackheads on the remover.</li>
    <li> I own one from years ago and it works wonderfully. The new design is a bit different and the edges are extremely sharp. I was able to scrape off my nail polish with it. I sent it back to Revlon, had them smooth out the edges and it came back feeling a bit smoother than I had purchased it. I thought the problem had been fixed. After a month or two, I decided to use it, since I misplaced my old one, and when I touched it, the edges felt sharp again!! Not as sharp as when I first purchased it but still sharp. Which means it was a waste of money to send it back to Revlon because they didn&#x27;t fix the issue and these tools are junk! I can&#x27;t use them on my clients. Such a disappointment. I will never buy them again.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s great , could have more of a angle to ends but works fine</li>
    <li> Wish it were a little bigger in the handle area for gripping but works just fine.</li>
    <li> It works in the sense if you have a really big pimple you can get rid of all the bacteria quickly, but blackhead forget it you need something smaller and stronger.</li>
    <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this little device from CVS because it was sold out on Amazon and because of the great reviews, especially since it was so cheap.  It works wonders!  I cleaned out pores without leaving any facial marks or indentations on my skin and this is great before having a facial done because most aestheticians either do very little extractions or charge a lot extra to do them. Buy this, take a warm shower, use this extractor and have a facial the next day!</li>
    <li> -I will try to spare the gross details out-  This product is great, I have big pores on my nose and I used this to get (squeeze) all the dirt and oil out of the pores. It&#x27;s a good product if you are like me, and you know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. This may have just been my experience. My blackhead remover came in a regular mailing envelope (which of course means no tracking number and long shipping wait). My blackhead remover got bent while trying to use it.</li>
    <li> this product was for my mother yes my mother and she loves it she is always complaining about her black heads and know after I got her this product I don&#x27;t here a thing from her about it I would recommend this to everyone that has black heads</li>
    <li> Its branded and without doubt standard.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in removing blackheads at all.  Causes pain for no gain.  Awful!</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this product because I have a lot of blackheads especially on/around my nose. I had one years ago and it worked very well. This one, however, did not. The hole at the end is much too thick for comfort. It is very painful to remove blackheads using this tool. I just use a bobby pin now because it is less painful and works better for me.</li>
    <li> it does a good job, less pain than squeezing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of negative buzz regarding the use of this tool.  Many people say that it will \\&quot;tear up\\&quot; your skin.  The truth is, like anything, if you use it incorrectly, it can cause damage.  However, if you watch a simple tutorial online you can really gain benefits from this tool.  Since the package lacks instructions, I ranked the product with 4 stars.  I think it&#x27;s irresponsible of Revlon to not provide the consumers with some sort of guidelines for use of the tool, but the tool itself is of high quality stainless steel and does the job very well.  This is best used for face and body, but not for the nose area or areas that are very soft.  The tool requires that some kind of pressure be built in order to extract the impurities, and a doughy surface doesn&#x27;t allow for that to happen very well.  I&#x27;ve used this, sanitized it, and used it on my boyfriend.  We both love it and have certainly gotten our money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
    <li> This ain&#x27;t exactly the more expensive or complicated tool on the market but it works pretty darn well. Very happy with this little thing.</li>
    <li> I ordered it...it arrived....it works! I have neither the time nor the inclination to write more. This is the most annoying practice I have ever encountered.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Best thing I have bought for my skin in a long time! It took awhile to figure out how it works but basically for pimples with the white heads you surround it and gently press down. For blackheads you &amp;#34;scoop&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; while pressing down (kind of hurts) to get the gunk out. It works wonders! I have SO many less blackheads because of this product! Get it!</li>
    <li> i was looking for this locally and couldn&#x27;t find it&lt;br /&gt;nice to be able to find one&lt;br /&gt;too many words</li>
    <li> Hurts when too much pressure is applied, but does the job...&lt;br /&gt;You might want to wait until the head is &amp;#34;white and ready&amp;#34; to use this, and even then, it may hurt a little. 50-50 chance of recommendation, if you don&#x27;t mind the pain.</li>
    <li> Very good. I gave it to my husband but the loss, it is very good non-marking and helps clean the face.</li>
    <li> edges are very sharp&lt;br /&gt;often cuts when placed with hard pressure ,&lt;br /&gt;needs alot of pressure to work right so it made me bleed alot&lt;br /&gt;not cut very well i was expecting nice ovals but instead they are poorly cut out ovals&lt;br /&gt;the material was nice and the product itself is durable and very portable</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to remove any blackheads or whiteheads for me.  I put a hot washcloth on my face and then try to get blackheads and whiteheads out but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It works, and I like it better than using my fingers. Not to mention it&#x27;s easier on your skin. I know I shouldn&#x27;t pop pimples or squeeze blackheads, but I can&#x27;t help it! I love how there&#x27;s a big and small end, so you can get larger areas like your chin while still getting around smaller areas, like your nose.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend last year. He uses it about as regularly as a man would, but it does seem to help. He says it doesn&#x27;t do much for the smaller blackheads, and is a bit uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> The product I first saw on &amp;#34;the Doctors&amp;#34; and it really works fast, or scaring, no pain, my son had blackhead in love of his ear this remove it within seconds no easy!!!!</li>
    <li> this is much to thick for me to get a good grip around the blackhead, I have used other removers that are much like wire rings that extract much better but unfortunately broke after a few YEARS. Although I know this wont break it also wont work, I thought I was upgrading but this a serious downgrade and not worth it.</li>
    <li> I searched on Youtube about this Stainless Steel Blackhead Remover and when I got it it work perfectly, easy to use and don&#x27;t forget to sterilize it before you use it!!</li>
    <li> I thought this might work for stubborn forehead blackheads, but it doesn&#x27;t. The hole is too big and indelicate. When I push on the area with the loop, blood vessels break next to the blackhead. I&#x27;m left with a red rectangle, and a blackhead, instead of just a blackhead. Fingernails work better. Look for one with a smaller hole. Don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
    <li> Its ok however i am better using an open bobbie pin to do the job much better.</li>
    <li> This tool is okay to use when you have a blemish, this helps with acne prone individuals like my son.</li>
    <li> The ordering of this product and shipping experience was great, however, the product did not meet up to my expectations.  It&#x27;s OK, but not as effective as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> This blackhead remover did not work for me. I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly, but after watching several YouTube videos on how to use these steel removers I&#x27;m fully convinced that they don&#x27;t work on everyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a little painful but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my shopping experience, as regards my order of the Revlon Stainless Steel Blackhead Remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The posted description was very accurate and the packaging and item were everything promised. The delivery was prompt, the price was excellent. The whole process went quite smoothly. Kudos to the seller. Well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for such a device for a long time and was very happy to find something which fit the need. A long time ago, I had something like it, but the design was a bit different. This Revlon product is indeed shaped like a loop on each end of the device. The device which I had once long ago was not loop-shaped at the ends, and instead was a simple small hole and large hole.  A metal &amp;#34;pimple popper.&amp;#34;  Nevertheless, this Stainless Steel Blackhead Remover does do the job. The loop shape has one minor drawback:  it tends to pull the skin out a bit, and possibly remove more than the blackhead alone.  It&#x27;s a minor design flaw, but what are you gonna do? Revlon products are still, overall, some of the best choices on the market. This device is solidly built and will last for years and years. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> So i have a different kind...i dont know the brand but the body is sort of a cylinder shaped shaft....i misplaced it and recently broke out....so i go to get a new one and see this revlon version is half the price of the other....although it looks weird so does the other. i tried it....it is not designed properly...it was extremely painful and caused bleeding and left me scarred...this is no where near the experience i had with the other....this is a piece of crap. DONT BE CHEAP! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. It would only work if the zit/blackhead was ready to come off on its own, and in that case you could scratch if off with your nail. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Its ok it does remove black heads but not as pain free as other similer products or as good. Some other brands do a better if you have hard to get black heads. Thats why i can only give 2 stars due to brands can give you more results</li>
    <li> Works well. Cheapest I could find that didn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;d break.  I lost my old one and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Yes, it is slightly painful but if you do it after a hot shower, or set a warm cloth on your face, it makes the process a little easier.</li>
    <li> I found that even with a lot of pressure it didn&#x27;t work very well. It was way too thick and not very delicate.</li>
    <li> While the Revlon Stainless Steel Blackhead Remover does \\&quot;remove Blackheads\\&quot;, it also leaves your skin red and irritated.  Find a remover with less surface area and you will experience less irritation with pressure.</li>
    <li> Have to push too hard on face to get results; very uncomfortable. My skin is too sensitive for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative reviews for this product.  While I agree that it could be made better, it really works for me. I have tried to avoid getting a blackhead tool for the longest because many dermatologists advised against it, saying that improper use encourages scarring. But after years of scarring my face with my fingers, and having a technician use one of these  during a facial (an extremely painful process, because I think she used the one with the needle on the end), I decided to try using one of these at home myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool gently removes my blackeads and whiteheads with little to no scarring. I guess my pores are that big, and my skin is just that oily. But my skin is a lot clearer, thanks to this. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I received when they told me I was supposed to be receiving. Satisfied with it and I will buy more!</li>
    <li> Well I tried using this product, but really I don&#x27;t think it works very well (if at all).  Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong but I don&#x27;t believe I am.</li>
    <li> Waste of money! Doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s very painful to use even where there&#x27;s little to no pressure... And the item looks way different from the website photo... Very misleading! Both ends are just the same, no loop side... Both sides are very painful to use....</li>
    <li> The opening in the end is not even circle and it does not work on blackheads at all.&lt;br /&gt;If I had not ripped the package I would have returned it.&lt;br /&gt;It just does not work I think there is design flaw; the loop is too big and it does not apply equal pressure around the blackhead; therefore it does not extract it.&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting something like this by REVLON, I am surprised/disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a new one which was claiming to be &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;r and it is not by revlon. We will see.</li>
    <li> In my opinion...not long enough to comfortably hold and awkward.  The end pieces are too thick and edges need to be rounded.</li>
    <li> OPENINGS TOO BIG. NOT WHAT i WAS EXPECTING. DISAPPOINTED  AND A WASTE OF MONEY. i WANTED ROUND OPENINGS TO FOCUS IN ON THE BLACKHEAD AND POP IT. i HAD THE PERFECT ONE BEFORE, BUT MISPLACED IT.</li>
    <li> Wanted extras since I lost one of mine, very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> i use it daily. it&#x27;s sturdy so it wont break. just push down and most things pop out. if this doesn&#x27;t pop things they aren&#x27;t meant to be popped yet. good to sanitize in alcohol after each use.</li>
    <li> This is a great produce, but be sure you know what you&#x27;re doing.  Doing this without proper understand of what it is your doing could result in damaged or stretched-out pores.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I couldn&#x27;t position it right, even after watching the instruction videos. All it did was leave a weird shape on my face. I found that if you use one of those hooks that are meant for flossing teeth, I believe their called a scaler, it works much better. I got one with a wide flat hook, and you just push it right above your pore and slowly move over it and it takes all the gunk right out. Faster and definitely less painful.</li>
    <li> This item is as described. Packaging intact. New.  I&#x27;d imagine this would work great on large blackheads, which I don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> Stubborn blackheads...BE GONE! Great addition to my face cleaning routine. Just make sure to wash your face first and don&#x27;t overuse this tool or your face will get really puffy.</li>
    <li> I have a huge problem with picking at my acne, who doesn&#x27;t? This was a great way of making the process more sanitary! I love it! Quickly removes blackheads and whiteheads, and afterwards I rinse it in hot water to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same as the Revlon one I bought about five years ago. However it was very different. Mostly in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. The metal parts at the end are much thicker than the old model and due to that it&#x27;s making it very difficult to extract any zits. Also, it&#x27;s damaging my skin more. So pretty much I&#x27;m never gonna use it. Hopefully I&#x27;ll find my old one because this thing is a piece of crap. Waste of my money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I would recommend! Works great, gets rid of everything..came brand new, no problems, etc. A girl needs a clean face. ;)</li>
    <li> I tried this one time before lost it.  I have no idea what happened to it but I don&#x27;t think I would have used it anyway because it hurt.</li>
    <li> I THINK IT&#x27;S BEST TO JUST GO TO THE DERMATOLOGIST TO GET BLACKHEAD&#x27;S REMOVED.&lt;br /&gt;OUT OF 4 OF THESE(DIFFERENT COMPANY&#x27;S) THIS 1 WAS THE STURDIEST.</li>
</ol>
