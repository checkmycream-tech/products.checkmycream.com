<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice smoothing lotion.  It&#x27;s a very nice pink color and has a great smell.  I&#x27;ve used the product a few times and my feet are already better.</li>
    <li> I love to go barefoot, but in doing so, the skin on my feet can get very dry and cracked. But with daily use, this moisturizer makes the skin on my feet look healthy and pampered. I love using this right after I get a pedicure....it makes my feet so soft! There&#x27;s a whole bunch of vitamins in this moisturizer to hydrate my feet. I received a sample of this to evaluate &amp; give my honest opinion. I recommend this product...it really helped my feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a foot cream that worked for a long time. We&#x27;ll my search is over Pedi Paradis works wonderfully. My feet have never felt so good.. I love this stuff!! I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS CREAM!!! I have only been using a couple of DAYS and the difference in my heels is incredible! Sandal weather is just around the corner and my feet were a dry cracked mess. Please give this product a try! This product comes with a 100% money back guarantee, so what have you got to lose but dry, flaky, scaly feet!!</li>
    <li> After I am all done grooming my poor feet I like to rub this in. It makes my feet feel  great and soft.  Better than a day at the spa.  I even give my partner an at home pedi and she makes sure I massage this in to her feet.  I recommend that of you have dry cracked feet or just like a good foot rub you  need to try this.  Thank you so much for the chance try your product and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Awesome, leaves my feet feeling very soft</li>
    <li> So Heavenly. Beautiful Fragrance and such softness !  Love it !</li>
    <li> This cream is really softening the rough skin on my feet!  It is awesome!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when i received this Pedicure Foot Cream.  The lotion itself has a wonderful floral scent that is subtle but smells amazing.  I live in flip flops 95% of the time (unless i&#x27;m at the gym) and have really dry, cracked feet.  After using the cream for about a week, my feet feel so soft and smooth and I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed to wear my flip flops anymore!  I highly recommend this foot cream to anyone who is looking for a product that will intensely moisturize and make your feet feel like you&#x27;ve been to the spa without paying big bucks!</li>
    <li> Before using After-Pedicure Cream, the bottoms of my feet and heels were rough and extremely dry. I contribute that to not wearing shoes or socks around the house. I would rather go barefoot than wear shoes. I have tried many things improve the condition of my feet, but it hasn&#x27;t been easy.I have tried pumis stones and covering my feet with vaseline and socks. These methods worked a little bit, but I wanted more substantial results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Pedicure Cream by Wick &amp; Str&amp;ouml;m is a great sooth foot care moisturizer. I apply this cream to my feet after my shower, paying extra attention to the problem areas of my feet. The moisturizer is a creamy, rich consistency that blends and absorbs great into the skin. And the smell--luxurious and rich. Since using this cream everyday, my feet look and feel so much better! Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love the spa cream! Even I don&#x27;t have an electronic pedicure machine, instead I use old fashion way, the steel pedicure file to get ride of the cracked and dried heels. After filing the old skins, I tried the cream on the heels, it feels so soft and smooth. Love it very much! Will continue to use it see if it can prevent dry skin building up. Sure will come back for more review after more use of the cream! So far I love it so much!</li>
    <li> After using it, my foot skin is smoother</li>
    <li> I apply this cream after a pedi or twice a week after I shower it hydrates and moisturizes my dry skin it just feels so smooth and soft afterwards. This cream is light smells, really good and the color of the cream is a light pink a small amount of this cream is enough for both feet I would definitely recommend this pedicure cream to anyone who was dry, rough skin or crack heels.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! My legs and feet feel Great! I like that there is no greasy feeling after use and I use it once a day and my legs and feet stay soft the whole day. I am trying this product in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my feet so soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cant believe what a difference this stuff makes on my feet</li>
    <li> I have purchased a rechargeable battery machine to give myself pedicures and I needed a good lotion to go along with it. I have the worst problem with dead skin accumulating on my feet, and especially on my heels. The machine gets most of the skin off, but I needed a good cream that would go the extra step to keep them moisturized.  About that time I was offered this product at a discounted price for an honest review - it could not have come at a better time! After working on my feet, I put this cream on them, careful to work a little longer on the problem areas. It was not a chore to do - it was a treat!  This cream is luxurious.  It is thick and it smells great. A little goes a long way and this bottle will last a long time. Another thing that I like is the moisturization you get from this cream does not go away quickly. I put on socks that night and the next morning my feet still felt so soft. From that day on I have been sold on this cream. Another thing - it has quality ingredients including Almond Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, and Vitamins A, E and B12. I recommend this Spa Quality After Pedicure Cream to anyone looking to keep their feet soft. I think they will love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This works really well. I put this on at the beginning of my day and at the end, my feet felt baby soft. Speaking of baby soft. This cream smells exactly like baby lotion, which is actually a scent I really, really like, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy using this pedicure cream after a nice warm bath before bed, and then again before starting the day.  With each passing use, I could feel the difference in the suppleness of my skin.  Since I got a good result, I also recommended it to family member who experienced an even more noticeable result myself.  I also enjoy the light scent which makes it suitable for men/children/women alike, and that it&#x27;s not heavy which allows for a more refreshing silky feel.  A good choice.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love this Product.  Since having my twin babies i just don&#x27;t have the time to go get my manicure and pedicure every few weeks like i used to. My feet hack been seriously neglected and so dry that&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost embarrassing to wear sandals . Well i am happy to say that is not the case anymore. After the first use my feet are so soft. They even feel softer then when I go get them done and Better because it does not come with the $60 price tag. I will continue to order Pedi Paradis in the Future!!:) ** Disclaimer ** I received this Product in Exchange for My Unbiased Review. .</li>
    <li> I helps keep my feet feel soft. Its also great when you get a foot massage. It not to oily. I did get this to review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now. Bottle said for best results, use daily for five days. I have to admit that I can tell a difference in my feet, hands and legs. Skin feels smoother and softer. Love all of the vitamins that are in it and omega 3. A little goes a long way. Absorbs quickly so no need to wait getting dressed. I use right after getting out of the shower. Great Product.</li>
    <li> Very soothing.  Works out great after using my pedicure sander thing!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! Not too heavy; feels great, and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great item, feet feel amazing. Special right now Flip Flop season.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often buy lotion because I use oils to moisture but I decided to buy this for my daughter to used for her feet because she is more inclined to use things that smell good. I am happy to have found a lotion that has a light smell but also has good oils that are targeted at improving the heath of feet. The lotion is a bit thin but has a nice hold to the skin.</li>
    <li> Happy Feet!  My feet feel so soft &amp; pampered after using this lotion.  I have never paid much attention to my feet-I guess I felt I didn&#x27;t have time until I retired.  I bought one of the dry skin removers with the batteries.  This lotion is so perfect-especially when used with my little machine.  There is a slight scent but not over-powering. The lotion isn&#x27;t runny so you don&#x27;t waste any.  I just love it!  I did receive this at a reduced price &amp; I am so glad I got a chance to try it! Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is great! Took my husband&#x27;s feet from dry to fabulous in only a few days!</li>
    <li> It works on my Husband&#x27;s feet ..he&#x27;s a trucker...that speaks volumes! !!</li>
    <li> This foot cream works great. It moisturize my legs and feet. The smell is good too.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Again, I am one of those who have tried just about every product out there to help with my dry, cracked feet. I do try to get pedicures as often as possible, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the time for it. I&#x27;ve purchased soo many different lotions, scrubs, exfoliatiors - you name it, I probably tried it. Some have worked well with dryness, but may be too greasy or I just need too much. The scrubbing and exfoliating helps with the really rough parts - like the sides and my heels, but then many prudish lack in the aftercare - the moisturizer. This truly does feel like I just stepped out of the salon and got one of those spa deluxe pedicures, even if I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll apply after receiving a pedicure, (or doing one myself at home which I do a lot), but also even just daily before leaving the house or after stepping out of the shower. It&#x27;s the perfect combination for me. Not too greasy where I&#x27;m slipping and sliding all over, and enough to where it actually soaks into my feet, making them feel extremely soft and relaxing. After being on my feet all day, there is not much more that feels better than to truly pamper them. This does the trick! I have the at-home spa pedicure tub, plus the heated Homedics foot massager, so adding this little beauty before and/or after those as well is perfect serenity to me! I like it simple and this is just a perfect addition for me. I will definitely be purchasing more at this great price once needed, even though so far, after daily use, a little sure does seem to go a long way!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I have very dry, flakey skin on my feet and this smoothes and takes away that scratchy alligator skin feel.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> This is a awesome product especially after given yourself or in my case, my husband a well needed pedicure. He does construction work and is in hard steel toe boots all day.  In his words this product really gives you HAPPY FEET! !! It makes rough areas extremely smooth.I was offered this product at a reduced price however,  this is a unbiased  review and it is solely based upon my usage of this product  . I would recommend it .</li>
    <li> Just received my foot pedicure cream and had  to try it right off. After just a very few minutes it had my feet  feeling so cool and refreshing. I think tonight after bathing, I&#x27;m going to lay in bed and apply it to my feet and prop them up and relax, which is something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in awhile. Have had such pain in my feet, haven&#x27;t even wanted to put them on the floor to walk. They were hurting so bad before I put the cream on, and now being so cool and feeling great, think maybe my problem could be over.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent of this after pedicure Cream. After a long winter with closed shoes it is nice to put this cream on have them feel so soft again. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After this long winter, my feet were a mess! This after pedicure cream, softened my feet, especially my heels, which were VERY dry and cracked. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blessed to have a husband who still lotions my feet.. This has been the best lotion I&#x27;ve used. I thought it was a little thin at first but it didn&#x27;t leave my feet wet at all. I was actually able to walk across the room without collecting every hair on the floor!!! Lol! The next morning my feet still felt good, not dry like all the other lotions I&#x27;ve used. I used it on my hands and haven&#x27;t had to reapply several times today like I normally do. This is really good!</li>
    <li> I love to give myself pedicures at home and am always looking for fun new products to use. This is one of them!  My feet feel so much softer and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> This foot cream is extremely moisturizing on my feet compared to the standard Aveeno products that I use. I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> Smells great and isn&#x27;t sticky.  I will use after every pedi.</li>
    <li> This foot cream ha a smooth silky feel. It has a pleasant odor and mkes my feet feel very nice. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer for feet and legs. My sandal feet needed help and this absorbs almost instantly</li>
    <li> My feet will never be the same -- works great and feels great!</li>
    <li> Makes me feet feel great! Love it! Five stars!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lotion for feet and it seems to work well to keep the dry feet at bay.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m not impressed. It is more lightweight than I&#x27;d like I was just expecting a creamier formula.</li>
    <li> Some foot cremes are very liquid, but this has a consistency similar to vaseline. It is not easily absorbed by the skin. Even hours later you still have a greasy layer on your skin. It&#x27;s best to use it before you go to bed or you will smear it all over the carpet. But that&#x27;s also not a good idea because it stains your linen permanently. Yet, we still like it. It&#x27;s good for your feet and the smell is rather pleasant. It&#x27;s not as good as Gehwol, but it&#x27;s also cheaper.</li>
    <li> Leaves my feet feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I love it!  legs and foot are so soft!</li>
    <li> THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
    <li> My feet feel wonderful after I applied this cream.  Was like going to the spa with out the high prices!</li>
    <li> Have used a couple of times and feet are softer.</li>
    <li> Wick and Strom makes a fine product and it is like a spa experience. It helps my feet and legs feel better and softer. I love this product. I used mine after I using my Amope Pedicure Foot File. Smooth, smooth and more smoothness.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I use on my feet every night after along day on my feet. No more cracked heels and my feet feel and look so refreshed!</li>
    <li> Spa quality after pedicure cream. Made with natural almond and sunflower seed vitamin E, A ,B 12 and more! Soft smooth feet immediately lasts all day long. Refreshing feel, smells wonderful. Great for dry feet. A must have for sandal season!!</li>
    <li> I love this foot cream!  It makes my feet feel soft, subtle and moisturized.  It has helped my feet tremendously!</li>
    <li> I have intensely dry feet and this cream is doing wonders for my sole(s). Love the way it leaves my feet so soft.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s a spa like pedicure cream for your feet at home.  I used this after sloughing my feet and put some socks on overnight and my feet were smooth as silk the next morning!</li>
    <li> perfect for summer! I am always in my bare feet, so they take a beating! This cream sinks in deep to transform dry cracked skin into smoother, silkier skin.</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical until I try a product myself and I am here to say, this foot cream is AMAZING!  After soaking my feet and using my ped-egg, I put this on my feet and they feel very smooth.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time this morning, and I really liked it.  Love the fact that it has almost no scent.  Seems like every other foot cream contains menthol, which leaves me smelling like a stick of gum for the rest of the day- yuck!  Used it after my shower, and it went on smoothly without feeling greasy or sticky.  Did not make my feet sweat, either.  This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Great product for super cracked and dry feet!!</li>
    <li> this lotion makes my feet so smooth and combats my dry skin which is so important as the weather is getting nice and flip flops/sandals are a must.  smells great and non greasy</li>
    <li> oh my feet. I have very DRY feel and this lotion is incredible. I put it on my feet and put socks on before bed and my feel have never felt softer. It has a nice non greasy feel and it smells soft too! I love this stuff and now I wonder why I never pampered my feet like this before. Just in time for spring time flip flops.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this after-pedicure cream in the mail! Summer is almost here and it&#x27;s a must have to have my feet done. I put this cream on in the morning and daytime. The first time using it I could feel a difference in my legs and feet. It has been keeping my feet soft until I go back and get a pedicure again. This product contains vitamin A, B, E, and omega 3 which is amazing for your skin. The bottle says for best results apply daily to legs and feet for a minimum of five days. I haven&#x27;t even been using it for five days yet and I feel a difference. Pedi Paradis really is spa quality. The cream smells amazing! It rubs in easily and makes my feet and legs feel so soft and smell so good! You don&#x27;t have to use much to get good results. I used about a dime size on my feet and a the same for my legs. I will be using this cream all summer long and I will be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. This is a must have for anyone! Great gift for the wife or yourself.</li>
    <li> Left my feet feeling silky smooth! Feels thick and luxurious!</li>
    <li> I received this a few days ago an i have been using it since it has arrived, it not sticky or greasy, it leaves your skin nice and smooth. The bottle was well secured with its own wrapped, so thank god for that because i have had bottles shipped from amazon and arrived half empty because the liquid drained.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using this product for a few days and I extremely happy with the results so far. The lotion is a nice thick. I noticed the results even in the first use my feets feel hydrated.. Lovef</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
    <li> My feet have never been softer!</li>
    <li> Lotion is a bit thin but not greasy. Nice aroma. Key is to just use it regularly!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good and it helps with my dry and cracked feet. I always use this stuff before I go to bed then put a sock on to lock in the moisturizing effect. It is nice to have soft feel especially in the sandal wearing summer.</li>
    <li> Very nice, have used for several days now and can already notice a difference!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE- on the bottle it recommends using it For a minimum of 5 days, but my feet were 100% Better after 3 days!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I am not kidding I have tried every single high and low end foot lotion, and nothing has worked. This stuff works WONDERS. and let me tell you as a runner they take a beating.</li>
    <li> I love this foot cream. It does remind me of the same stuff they use when I get a pedicure. It even smells like the same stuff I get when I have a professional pedicure done. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and makes my feet feel smooth and soft. I love this stuff. I bought it with a discount and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Quality stuff, makes my feet feel so soft and amazing. I am someone who has issues with their feet, callouses, dryness, etc, and this combined with another product that I use I think is really going to make the difference. I want pretty toes after I paint them , and i think this is what will do the trick!!! :) Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion! Made my feet unbelievably smooth and had a wonderful scent. I would recommend this product to any and everyone!!</li>
    <li> I can strongly recommend this product. I have tried a bunch of similar products in the past, but never felt like they did the job. I have finally found a product I love!! Not only does it smell wonderful it keeps your feet moisturized for days!!</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful light scent.  I use this pedicure cream after I used my electric callous remover and it made my feet feel silky smooth.  Especially after a long rough winter.  What am I saying, a flip flop aka barefoot summer in the sand is what kills the beauty in my feet.  This year I will not be embarrassed with dry cracked feet at the pool with the after-pedicure cream.  It reminds me of pedicures when I used to live in Hawaii and I would walk out and my feet felt, fresh and new.  Wick and Strom has created a cream that does truly feel like I paid  65 dollars for an island pedicure.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with the quality ingredients in this product that make your feet feel like a million bucks!!  *received for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I Received this free for my full honest opinion and i love love this its helped make my feet nice and soft and i&#x27;ve had a hard time finding some stuff that helps me with that dry feet issue i have and this was a surprise that it helped you don&#x27;t need a lot just a little bit or at least i only needed a little bit.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! First use and I am hooked! I will be a repeat customer! As a mom of 3 toddlers im always on my feet and this cream made them feel amazing!!!Sample provided at a reduced promotional price for evaluation and review purposes, but I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast on this. Have tried many foot creams this one is fantastic... provides a thicker cream that moisturizer and stays on all day.  It has a light scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Not sure why everyone raves about this cream. I&#x27;ve given it 3 weeks already and truly don&#x27;t see any difference. My feet feel the same. I really wanted to like it as it smells great. It&#x27;s very thin consistency. When applying, it does not soak in. I am definitely very disappointed and won&#x27;t order it again. Will continue using my Ahava foot cream.</li>
    <li> It really like this foot cream. It is light feeeling but it really does the trick.</li>
    <li> works great.  I use it every day Keeps your feet smoothe</li>
    <li> Keeps my rough feet soft...</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  My feet bother me at the end of the day.  I put this on when going to bed and it not only refreshes and makes them feel better, it helps soften them.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  Don&#x27;t really see what the fuss is about.  Not sure it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> We use this cream nightly and it is light and has a nice scent.  Not like others that are thick and strong smelling.  Leaves my feet and legs feeling soft and smooth.  Def will buy again.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m a dude, I love getting pedicures.  I have a job where I&#x27;m on my feet 12hrs a day, so I get them as a treat to myself every month or so.  Needless to say my feet are always messed up and hurt.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who massages my feet.  Last night she used this while rubbing my sore feet, and they felt wonderful during and after.  I don&#x27;t think my feet have ever been softer!  Beware though,  I almost slipped because my feet were so soft and smooth, haha!</li>
    <li> I have always had an issue with my feet being really dry and cracked feeling.  I have used lotions in the past but they lefty feet feeling oily after using.&lt;br /&gt;I saw that this Spa Quality After Pedicure Cream was being offered at a great promotional price so I wanted to try it and post a review on it.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of uses of this cream, my feet were starting to feel a lot smoother and the cream soaked in very nicely.  After a few minutes, other than my feet feeling amoother, i couldn&#x27;t even tell that I had put any lotion on them.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice cream and has a great smell.</li>
    <li> This cream has a really nice scent.  It absorbs easily and is not greasy.  Really helps my dry, cracked feet feel and look better.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great  I will buy again. My feet are so soft now.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I both give each other foot rubs at the end of the day.  And rubbing a very hard, callused heel is abrasive.  So, we&#x27;ve used this lotion to soften and lubricate our heels before massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s impressive about this cream is the longer lasting results of softening of the heels.  When we had used hand creams on our feet , the next day our feet were still callused.  Now, using the pedicure foot cream, our heels are much softer the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for my candid assessment of this product expressed in my review, I received a discounted price on this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice foot cream.  I like to apply it before bed.  Not too thick and sticky, it is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice and refreshing on my feet! I use a rotary foot file thing I got on amazon that works amazing - this is the perfect finisher. I load it on and put socks on after.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product.  I&#x27;ve always had ugly feet.  I don&#x27;t have bunions, fungus or ingrown toenails...nothing like that.  I just have really dry feet.  If I don&#x27;t put lotion on them, they can look ashy.  And since I live in flip flips most of the year, my heals are just tragic.  I just hate feeling them catch and scratch as I slip on yoga pants or slide into my sheets.  I&#x27;m too embarrassed to get a pedicure so I just use a foot file to smooth them out. So bottom line, they&#x27;re not grotesque.  They get me where I need to go and for that I am grateful, I just wish they were soft and pretty without having to dunk them in wax or go someplace to soak them and make little ladies sand them down with cheese-graters. I don&#x27;t always have time to slather them in coconut oil and wrap them in plastic and/or socks. To my surprise, this lotion leaves my feet looking really nice.  My non polished nails are really shiny and my toes look nicely moisturized and healthy.  Can you believe this stuff actually works wonders on rough heels?? I couldn&#x27;t either, until I saw it with my own eyes!! Sure, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles.  I still need the foot file, but I can now add this After-Pedicure Foot Cream to my arsenal.  I received this lotion at a promotional price and agreed to provide the honest feedback that you see here.</li>
    <li> I use this product about twice a day, keep my feet moist and soft. I often use the product along with body scrub and use exfoliation gloves to achieve a smoother and glowing skin</li>
    <li> Love, love this foot cream! I go barefoot a lot, so I have to have a hard working cream!</li>
    <li> Wow this foot cream exceeded my expectations. My feet are so smooth and soft now.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very soft.  I love it. I hate dry feet.  This lotion helps for at least 24 fours.</li>
    <li> Can wear sandals now.  Feet look wonderful</li>
    <li> I used it for 5 days as recommended and it really made my feet soft.</li>
    <li> I bought and compared two foot creams.  The other brand of foot treatment was much better at healing / smoothing out foot cracked skin.  Pedi Paradis was too thin and it was difficult in this bottle to squeeze a small amount.  The 5 day test of Pedi didn&#x27;t produce as good of results as the other brand of foot treatment or my old vasoline product.  I cannot recommend this product but I did recommend the other brand of foot treatment to my son and wife.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I needed a cream that would actually help my feet. I read a few of the reviews, prayed I made the right decision. Well...Yes this is an amazing product! I have used it only a few days and I noticed the difference right away. My feet are getting the condition they need, Moisture. I recommend this product if you are looking for touchable feet. The lotion is not greasy or leaves a slick residue. It soaks right into the skin. I love the fact that it has natural ingredients makes it a plus!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!  I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE UGLIEST FEET.  AFTER USING THIS MY FEET ARE SO SOFT.  THE DRY SIN IS GONE!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing shoes, so naturally it&#x27;s taken a toll on my feet. I have a weird thing about people touching my feet, so I&#x27;ve never had a professional pedicure. I do my own at home, but no matter what I do my feet always end up dry and cracked. The After-Pedicure cream is incredible. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and I love the softness of my feet! Using this cream has allowed me to not have to use a pumice stone or callus remover as often and it keeps my feet moisturized and soft for a long time. It&#x27;s even improving the dryness in my hands just from applying it to my feet.</li>
    <li> I AM SO PLEASED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TEST WICK AND STROM PEDICURE CREAM FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST OPINIONS AND REVIEW. i really love how silky this cream is, it feels so nice going on my feet and exsorbs very quickly. after having a pedicure i started using this and so far my feet have remained nice and hydrated prolonging my pedi and i am spending less time having to take care of my pedi. it also smells really good and overall is a very nice product to use and works.</li>
    <li> I got the privilege of trying out this cream for my thoughts, and let me just tell you they have earned a customer for life.  When I opened the bottle I was impressed by the great scent.  Most pedicure creams have a medicine like smell to them, but not Spa Quality After-Pedicure Cream.  I could instantly pick up in the almond extract in the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most of the pedi creams, this one is thick.  With its thickness I knew that it would more likely stay in place and absorb into my skin better then the other creams.  After doing my bi weekly pedi I made sure to rub the Spa Quality Cream on my feet, paying gentle attention to my heels and callused areas of my feet, which with me being on my feet 10 hours a day 7 days a week there are a lot.  The cream went on smoothly and I was able to spread it evenly without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that my feet felt amazing after rubbing this cream on them.  There was no &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; or unpleasant sting on areas that had more work done on them then others.  I even went the extra step and left a little extra on my feet and put my fuzzy socks on for the evening.  I woke up to the softest feet I have seen in ages.  Definitely recommend Spa Quality After-Pedi Paradise to anyone who wants to feel pampered at a lost cost.</li>
    <li> After 1 use, I am 100% impressed!!!</li>
