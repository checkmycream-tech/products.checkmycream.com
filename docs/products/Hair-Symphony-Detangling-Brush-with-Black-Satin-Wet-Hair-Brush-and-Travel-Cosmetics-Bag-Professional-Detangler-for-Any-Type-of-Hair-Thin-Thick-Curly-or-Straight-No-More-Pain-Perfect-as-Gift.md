<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very thick hair, so when it&#x27;s wet it&#x27;s very hard to brush after showering. I used this brush after and it went straight through my hair and didn&#x27;t brake or rip one strange of hair. I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of brushes!! My 3 year old HATES to brush her hair and often has tangles so I thought that I would try out this set to use the detangling brush for her and I would keep the styling brush for myself.  After trying the detangling brush once it is the ONLY brush that she will let me go near her hair with.  She even likes to brush her own hair now.  The shape makes it easy to hold which is another great feature. I love the styling brush as well.  It is a great combo set and a great value.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like these as much as I do. I have very thick hair that is kinda curly. My 3 year old daughter has pretty curly hair that gets in awful knots. I am amazed by these! The wet Detangler just glides right through for both of us. And the brush is awesome in hair when it&#x27;s dry. Every other brush always just left her with a big frizzy mess and she cried the whole time. This goes right through and she ends up with big beautiful thick curls still. I am very happy, this is one of my favorite Amazon purchases in a long time!</li>
    <li> I received my&lt;br /&gt;hair brush set&lt;br /&gt; a couple of days&lt;br /&gt; ago and I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;Using them since.&lt;br /&gt;I find the quality&lt;br /&gt;Top Notch and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with&lt;br /&gt;Them.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair&lt;br /&gt;and the brushes&lt;br /&gt;seem to be gentle&lt;br /&gt;on it.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the&lt;br /&gt;Wet hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is&lt;br /&gt;Well appreciated and&lt;br /&gt;A pleasant bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have long straight-wavy hair that gets its fair share of tangles and knots, especially on a windy day. I got this hairbrush set to replace the hairbrush I&#x27;ve been using for years...the main brush is similar in design as my old one and goes through my hair just as well. I loved the detangler brush. Smooth feeling and was gentle on my hair. I loved using detangler while my hair was wet after my shower. The carrying case is a delightful bonus and will be great when packing my brushes on trips!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how the detangler brush works, but it really does!  My 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair declares civil war on itself every night and we used to really struggle with the fallout in the morning, but this brush has made it pain free for us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes are lightweight but sturdy feeling.  I hate spending money on a brush to have it just snap in half after a week, but I don&#x27;t think that will be a problem with these.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> With a house full of 4 young girls, hair brushing is a serious chore often ending in tears and hysterics. I have tried everything from different conditioners, detangler spray, wetting the brush. Nothing has worked to make it less painful for them. This brush saved my mornings! Now my youngest daughter actually goes and gets the brush and asks me to brush her hair, this is unheard of. The older girls will willingly do it on their own now and even think the brush makes their hair feel softer. Great product if you or your children have long hair!</li>
    <li> Just what we needed!  My daughters HATE having their hair brushed and none of us look forward to this morning chore.  I have used the brushes on them several times now and it&#x27;s been a much-improved experience.  The brushes come in an attractive travel bag that I will be able to use for many purposes.  And both brushes are great quality and working very well for us.  There was a slight plastic-y odor when we opened the bag initially but it faded quickly and was totally gone.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair.  The black brush doesn&#x27;t pull or tear my hair, make it frizzy, or cause static.  It leaves my hair nice and smooth, and the bristles feel great on my scalp, sort of like a gentle massage.  I have only used it on dry hair.  I used the pink brush on my wet hair.  I haven&#x27;t used a brush on wet hair in years because it always tears it and makes a mess, so I always used a pick.  But this detangler brush is just plain handy!  I am a new believer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have two beautiful daughters with full thick beautiful hair. Well that is if they would brush it. So when these arrived I had to immediately let them try out the brushes. The first nylon brush was nice (that is how my oldest daughter described it) and then she tried the detangling hairbrush and was in love. She actually told her little sister it was off limits.. needless to say they both love the detangling brush. Then finish with the nylon brush. I am so satisfied that they are brushing their hair I am going to have to purchase another set for each girl. The bonus bag is great because then they can label and know who it belongs to. This is an ingenious idea for any mom struggling to get their daughter/s to brush their hair. Love the product. Gone are the days of chasing my girls around the house to get them to brush their hair.</li>
    <li> Loving this brush! My 10 year old daughter is very sensitive and she doesn&#x27;t like to brush her hair as often as she should. With this brush set, I don&#x27;t have to chase her around anymore to get her to brush her hair! Yay! She is much happier and brushed! The detangling brush is so easy to use and very effective at gently detangling her hair. She really likes to use it when her hair is wet. The soft nylon hair brush is wonderful as well! I think I am going to need a new set if I ever want to use these brushes... My daughter has claimed them as her own!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good these brushes are. My whole life I&#x27;m struggling with tangles, and this is the first time that I can brush my hair without pulling and feeling pain.</li>
    <li> My hair is crazy especially when it is wet. The detangler brush is great for this. I barely have to try and my hair is out of knots. The package arrived on time and came with a great bag. The bag did have a smell to it but just leaving it out aired it out. I&#x27;m happy about this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic set of brushes. Seriously, the detangling brush? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE? I have very long hair, and since moving to Florida a few months ago, I find myself styling my hair (read: blow drying) pretty much never. Too hot, too long, too tangled. My hair has a tendency to fall out pretty easily too, so despite using conditioner every time I wash it, combing it after getting out of the shower pretty much never ended up with it being 100% detangled.  The end result of this was letting my  hair air-dry, which meant not being happy with how it looked, which meant washing it only to put it back up in a bun/ponytail/braid. With the detangling brush, I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner that&#x27;s how easy it is to use and how easy it is on my hair, all while still managing to untangle with very little effort. The styling brush is great, though I really just use it for those mid-day brushes where you want to tame the frizzies. I&#x27;m not much of a styling girl unfortunately :/</li>
    <li> They were very nice and better than I expected. My six year old really likes them too. She can brush her hair very easily now and I hope that it will help encourage her to fix her own hair.</li>
    <li> I have used only the detangler brush so far and it does what it claims on both wet and dry hair.  I have relaxed hair that tangles easily when wet so was extra careful, as the instruction says, not to tug the hair too much.</li>
    <li> Awesome set.  Perfect for gift giving.  Just wish the brushes came in assorted colors</li>
    <li> I received these brushes and could not wait to try them.... my hair is super thick and wavy, and always seems to tangle. The detangler worked without hurting my head.... I didn&#x27;t think it would, but it really did!  I take these everywhere now.... no more yanking my hair out or worrying that I will walk around with a frizzy birds nest on my head :)</li>
    <li> I love this hairbrush!  I am ordering this for gifts for friends who have girls with long hair.  I use it on my and my daughter.  I have been using all natural shampoo and conditioner.  With those products, it gives your hair moisture but they don&#x27;t detangle.  Using a regular brush it painful and takes a lot of time to gently get the knots out.  This brush goes right through the hair like nothing.  The best part is I don&#x27;t have to spend extra money on buying a separate detangling product.  Works better than expected.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush!  It&#x27;s perfect for thick hair.  Mine is thick and can tangle easily.  I used this brush on my hair wet or dry and it seems to smooth it out while detangling.  It&#x27;s good to have!</li>
    <li> My daughter has super curly hair and she doesn&#x27;t complain too much when I brush her hair with this brush. I like that it came with two brushes and the bonus pouch.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance and she absolutely loves the brushes. She has already thrown her old brush away. She was absolutely amazed at how easy it was to get the tangles out in her hair compared to her old brush. So much so that she actually got a little upset that she has been struggling with her old brush for so long and realizes now that she could have been using this brush all along. The brush itself is sturdy and of high quality. She also enjoys the bag it came in and uses it when we travel.</li>
    <li> Finally - a detangling brush that really works! My daughter struggles brushing her hair every day and it is so broken from all the pulling and tugging. This brush makes it much easier without killing her hair. And the nylon brush is wonderful for keeping her hair in tip top shape. Brushes come in a travel pouch which is convenient to use when she stays over a friend&#x27;s house. Thank you hair symphony!</li>
    <li> This brush set is awesome! I use the pink detangling brush on my 6 year old&#x27;s fine hair, and we have had successful hair-brushing experiences without tears! The styling brush is perfect for me!!! It keeps my straightened hair smooth! I love the bag, which has been wonderful during our holiday traveling! This is a great set.</li>
    <li> The brushes are salon quality, I have really thin, fine hair, and these work great. I got them for myself but my daughter tried the detangling brush and thinks it’s just great. She has really long hair and these work great for styling and detangling her hair.  I guess I will have to order my own since she has decided to keep them.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> So I bought it for my niece who has thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I have very short hair but my grandaughters both have long hair. One very fine and the other very thick but both tangle easily. The detangling brush is fabulous, easy to hold onto and great for very fine hair. Both of the girls can now do more of their own hair care.</li>
    <li> The detangling brush works great on my daughter&#x27;s thick long hair, especially when wet!  The hair brush with handle is perfect to follow up with while blow drying or on dry hair at any time. The bag is nice to have to store the brushes in, and plenty of room for other cosmetics.</li>
    <li> They are nice quality brushes, but I don&#x27;t notice any special detangling properties in the detangling brush.  The bristles are easy to clean though on the detangling brush because they are straight with no rounded ends.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very innovative design and high quality. Customer service exceeds any expectations!</li>
    <li> The brushes are really good. My wife and daughter are all like those well designed products. Well done!</li>
    <li> Our 10 yr old daughter was thrilled with the brushes.  She knew right away about the detangling brush and has used it since Christmas.</li>
    <li> The brush is not a good quality, it made hurt t he scalp when you brush the hair because the end of the points doesn&#x27;t  have nothing the red brush is the worst , the black is better I regret buy it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have gotten on this site!  The detangling brush really does work!  I have long, coarse hair and it does get tangled really easy and this brush has resolved all my problems.  I brush my hair with it to get the tangles out then I use the bigger brush to style my hair.  Both brushed are very durable and work just like they are supposed too! I love the case they came in too!  I have my both my brushes and some make in the case to carry with me, where ever I go!  I highly recommend this set to everyone!  You will not have to buy another brush for years to come or buy any detangling products!  *I received this product for my honest and unbiased review*</li>
    <li> I have fairly long hair. It is past the middle of my back and it tangles easily. I received a set of these brushes to review and they work terrifically! They both remove tangles without a lot of pulling or pain. With these, the tangles come out without ripping big wads of hair out. Man, I wish these had been around when I was a kid because it would have saved my mother and I both a lot of tears!&lt;br /&gt;The handle of the pink one looks like it might be odd to hold or handle but it actually is quite comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The case is handy as well. I recently traveled and took this in my suitcase. It worked out great. Kept the bristles from get caught on anything and made them easy to find and keep up with. They travel as well as they work! You can toss this into your bag for daily touch ups or after your work out.&lt;br /&gt;Great set of brushes that do what they say.</li>
    <li> Update: Hair Symphony sent me another set because of the defective one I received. This time the bag was in much better shape and was useable. The detangling brush worked a lot better this time, probably close to on par with a wet brush. The set together is a good value and if you have any problems the company will make it right.  3/16/15: With this set, you get a styling soft brush, a detangling brush and a pouch to keep them in. Let me just say that I was not super impressed with this set. The Regular styling brush is okay, but no better than the average brush that can be bought at Target, etc. The detangling brush didn&#x27;t work in my hair - the tangles remained. Nothing like the Wet Brush that I love so much. As for the pouch, mine had a really strong plastic smell and was covered in white powder, which is a little sketchy. While I am not a fan of this set, other people on Amazon seem to love it, so maybe I just got a dud. Received this product for free to review.</li>
    <li> Me and my two daughters have long, thick hair that tangles easily. I have tried several different types and brands of detangling brushes and combs over the years.  I received this Hair Symphony professional detangling hair brush set at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  The set includes a detangling brush, and a soft nylon brush, and nylon carrying case. My daughter unzipped the carrying case to get the brushes out to use one day and the zipper pull broke off of the zipper. That being said, the carrying case isn&#x27;t that important to me, because I have a drawer in my bathroom that I keep our brushes in, so I will keep them in there without the case. The soft nylon brush is nice, and I can use it on my daughters as long as their hair isn&#x27;t tangled too badly. First thing in the morning their hair is tangled pretty badly, so I have to use a detangling brush on it then, or they  scream and cry from pain when I try to brush the tangles out. The detangling brush that came in this set isn&#x27;t their favorite. They said it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as a regular brush, but we have another detangling brush that has bristles similar to the soft nylon brush that they prefer. They said the detangling brush in this set scratches a little. So, I will use it for myself, and let them use the one I already had since it is easier on them. Based on this, I would not recommend this detangling brush to anyone who has a very tender head, because there are other types of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brushes that are more gentle.  It worked pretty well on my hair, but it is layered, and doesn&#x27;t tangle as bad as theirs; and my head isn&#x27;t as tender as theirs.</li>
    <li> I have hair that is about 6 inches below my shoulders and it does get tangled sometimes....This brush is great and does what it says...wet or dry...it gets the tangle out effortlessly</li>
    <li> So I have VERY VERY long, VERY VERY fine hair. Tangles are a part of life, and I literally pull my hair out trying to brush it. This set takes the pain out of the process completely. The pink, curved detangling brush worked wonders, getting out knots with just a couple of swipes and no loss of hair that would have taken forever with my old brush. There wasn&#x27;t any breakage, either, which surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long-handled styling brush smoothed and played very nicely with my styling appliances, and added the perfect finish. They&#x27;re sturdy, too...I have in the past broken brush handles trying to untangle my hair. NOT kidding. I have a new favorite brush set, for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and untamed locks are my own.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! No longer have to fight with my daughter to brush her long hair!!</li>
    <li> I have 3 girls, two of whom have long beautiful hair… except my 11 year refuses to brush hers properly, no matter how many times I remind her, or worse brush it myself (and brushing through all her tangles generates tears upon tears upon tears).  Bought these brushes on a whim - a set for each girl - and they are like magic.  All of a sudden my 11 year old comes down every morning with beautifully brushed, smooth hair.  Primary benefit is she can brush her hair with the detangler brush after her shower in the evening, which makes it so much easier to brush dry hair in the am.  Thank you so much, these are wonderful!!</li>
    <li> We received the brushes on time. My daughter loves the set and it is no longer a visceral fight for us to do her hair thanks to the detangler!</li>
    <li> The Hair Symphony Professional Detangling Hair brushes are amazing!!! I was so excited to get them because I have really long hair and needed something to help me out from all of the tangles I get after washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;These arrived and I tried them out and was in heaven!!! I used the long one first and was amazed by how awesome it worked!!! It didn&#x27;t hurt at all or pull any of my hair out!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The other detangling brush I gave to my daughter to try out because she also has long hair and let me just tell you,she is very picky about the brushes she uses,but she has used this one over and over again because she said it works so good just like the other one did on my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are perfect and I do highly recommend them. They come in a handy carrying case and it zips up so that the brushes stay in place at all time.&lt;br /&gt;I received these at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
    <li> fab set of brushes, my daughter loves them. I think I will get a set for my niece too</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine- the handle on the detangling brush is nice, but I find our other brush of the same style works a little better at tangles. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m not a fan of the repeated emails asking me how I liked the product and to please leave a review- one email would be sufficient.</li>
    <li> These hair brushes were not what I expected. The pink brush combs much better than the other brush. My daughter has curly/wavy hair so it&#x27;s kind of hard to brush her hair with any hair brush. I thought this product was going to be a good detangling brush, unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t. I had previous ordered a different hair brush through Amazon and that brush was perfect. I thought these brushes were going to work and do its magic, I was wrong! I&#x27;m going to reorder the previous brush (SHARKK hair brush).</li>
    <li> Smooth, good deal; if no strong plastic smell will be better</li>
    <li> Gave them to my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. My wife knows how to use the detangling brush, but when I try, she complains about me pulling her hair.</li>
    <li> Excelent product. Does everything they say and more. My granddaughter love them. No more pulled hair.I would recomend this product to anyone and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, as it does all it says, and cuts a lot of daily prep time for her grooming.</li>
    <li> as anyone who reads my product reviews knows i have super curly crazy hair. i have been looking for my holy grail wet/ dry brush and a detagling brush. I hadnt found one unti Hair symphony. The pink detangling brush is great. No tugging or pulling and it doesnt feel like it is doing damage. The wet/dry brush is also great. i shed a ton. And these brushes are esy to clean which is huge..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recived this product in exchnge for a review. My reviews are 100% honest and my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the best set of brush I bought in my life so far. Love the way it makes my hair smooth without pain and hair fall. I am glad that I found this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy more for my cousins. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received this amazing brush free of charge to try out with my daughters. They have different hair textures but both are easily tangled and knotted. We call this the &amp;#34;no hurt&amp;#34; brush set because it easily gets out knots without tears. Our trick is to start at the bottom and work our way up. If the knots are really bad we use some coconut oil and it loosens everything right up. If you have kids who have hair that tangles easy, this is something to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I ordered this detangling brush for myself , I have an abundance of waist long hair. The daily brushing before going out had become very difficulty and trying for me, and if I did not het this brush I might have had to cut it shorter in order r make my mornings easier. A commercial bought my attention for the detangles brush which made it sound like it magically makes your tangles go away. The brush is certainly looking stylish. It is very wide paddle head and short and think handle. For my purposes the brush is worth it. I received this at a promotional price in return for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love this hair brush. I have fine naturally curly hair and it is always hard to brush out and wants to snarl. The very first time I used this detangling brush it went right through without a single stop for a snarl. The second brush is super handy for finishing styling my bangs. It is a wonderful set and I d not regret this purchase at all. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My daughter used to cry every time we had to brush her hair, especially if it was my husband the one untangling her wet hair (or dry, for that matter). Now, with this brush, she sits happily until we&#x27;re done, even if it&#x27;s my husband doing the job. I don&#x27;t know what is in this brush, but it works and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> My daughter has super long and easily knotted hair. Brushing is a task, and getting her to do it on her own even more challenging... These work great!! She has no trouble using them and seems to even enjoy it!! Yay</li>
    <li> Best brushes we&#x27;ve ever had. They work great to dangle my wife&#x27;s Rapunzel hair!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter is not screaming as much as before so that is a win :)</li>
    <li> Cute brush.. but, just a brush</li>
    <li> I have two daughters. One of whom has autism and extreme sensitivities to having her hair brushed. When we received these brushes I assumed they&#x27;d be like all the other ones we have tried in the past and I would endure a screaming/crying filled brushing session. Low and behold when I used the smaller brush on her the first day, she made not a peep and by the 2nd day she was USING IT ON HERSELF this is a big step for her and I&#x27;m so happy we found a product that can tame her long, thick hair without a fuss. My teenage daughter and I love them too!</li>
    <li> Hey Mike;  I have never used this type of hair brush before.  I  have&lt;br /&gt;really long, curly, frizzy gray hair.  It tangles as soon as it  dries.  I do not&lt;br /&gt;use much product at all.  So, I decided to try  yours.  Start at bottom and&lt;br /&gt;go Slow.  WONDERFUL.  Thank you so  much.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,  Eliese</li>
    <li> I got your hair brushes because I have very long hair that is prone to split ends. My hair was impossible to detangle. The brushes are absolutely amazing! They don&#x27;t pull my hair out, they lessen split ends, and they make my hair shiny and smooth. If you have a round styling comb for blow drying, I would buy that too!</li>
    <li> This Hair Symphony package is awful. There are currently 138 reviews giving it 5 stars. Maybe I got a bad set?&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived the case for the brushes smelled so badly that I just threw it out. The brushes themselves didn&#x27;t smell too bad though and I knew that would wear off.&lt;br /&gt;But then...&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a detangler brush before. I made one stroke through my hair and the brush pinch my finger then just... fell apart. In half. Right down the middle.&lt;br /&gt;Okay. Maybe my hair was too thick for it? (I have healthy, thick, curly, blonde hair, that has never split a brush in half before but there is a 1st for everything.)&lt;br /&gt;So I tried the larger more traditional styling brush, figuring that was probably the one I would use more anyways. I brushed my hair out thoroughly and checked the brush out afterwards. Several of the pins had come out!! And while inspecting it, I saw that the paint on the handle is flaking as well. The paint is a minor thing, or would be if it wasn&#x27;t a brand new item that was advertised as salon quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review urging buyers to beware or posted any pictures of any item I have ever purchased in the past. But this product demands it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After my 1 star review, Hair Symphony immediately reached out to me. They offered their apologies on the poor workmanship and stated that the factory may have rushed or ignored the importance of the glue. They graciously gave me a refund without my having to ask. I bumped them to 2 stars because I still feel that both brushes were not quality made, but I do appreciate a company that is proactive in their concern for customers.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have naturally curly hair and a detangling brush is a must, especially for my daughter who can get really upset when I try to comb our snarls. Sometimes those snarls are more like a rat&#x27;s nest because she has such thick hair and they get so bad and isn&#x27;t the best and making sure she combs through her thick layers. She doesn&#x27;t complain at all with this pink detangling brush.&lt;br /&gt;The black brush is for me. I haven&#x27;t owned a brush in years because I always pick out my hair with a wide tooth comb, but I have to say that I love this brush. It has &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; when I brush it so it feels soft even if I am brushing hard. I have not tried it for any styling other than combing out snarls, but it works well.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great, the pricing is fabulous for two brushes.</li>
    <li> great brush. my daughter loves it</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long thick hair that she wears in a pony tail almost every day.  If you have never had long hair and wear it in a pony tail let me tell you it gets in a lot of tangles.  Especially if you run and sweat while it is up.  Once you take the pony tail down there is almost always a big tangle right at the top of the head.  She does not like when we have to brush it out ,since it really hurts badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we received this set of brushes I was excited.  Daughter not so much.  The pink curved brush is for the detangling.  She sit down on the floor in front of me and I started brushing.  Now usually after about the second stroke she is saying it hurts not with the pink brush.  Now it was not a breeze with no pulling at all, but it was a whole lot easier to get through her thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am overall very pleased with it.  The longer black one is better on wet hair.  The pink one does better on dry hair.  I also love the travel case that it came in.  It makes it a lot easier to find when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a a discount in order to give my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:e6f2a2c163aaea16ee60ba86c7ba9378]] I absolutely love these brushes that Hair Symphony has to offer. The pink/black one is cute and stylish. They appear to be made of premium material. They appear to be salon professional type as well. I definitely will refer my hair stylist to these brushes. I have short hair but still they feel soft on my hair. They are going to come in handy when my grand daughter comes to visit. She has really thick hair that tangles. Can be used on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in my video demonstration, you can see that the product is premium quality. I give this product a five star because in my honest opinion, that it deserves a five star or more. These brushes are durable and I hope they will last a long time. I even love the bonus bag that they come in.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy and dry hair. I used to use a wide comb for detangling. It pulled my hair and I lose so many hair like that. These hair symphony professional detangling hair set is great. It comes with 2 detangling brush and a travel bag with a zipper. The brushes have high quality. I love the black one. It detangles my hair without pulling my hair and with no pain. My hair dont fall when I use these professional detangling brush. The brushes removes knots &amp; tangles. I have tried these brushes on my wet hair right after I remove towel from my hair. Also I have used on my dry hair. It makes brushing hair so easy. The grip of the brushes is great. While brushes it on the scalp. It relaxes the scalp. It glides through the hair smoothly and helps to arrange the hair or make a hair style.&lt;br /&gt;The symphony hair brush set is a perfect professional set for home or salon. The travel bag makes it possible to carry it anywhere you travel.&lt;br /&gt;The quality and look of the bag is decent. You can also add more hair accessories in it like hair ties, bobby pins etc because the bag has more capacity.&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with the look, quality, feel and how well the brushes detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I was unlucky enough to get these hair brush set as part of a promotional in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This brush set is very cute!  You get two brushes and a carrying case. I like that it comes with a bag for easy travel.  The bag ensures that you don&#x27;t get hair all over your other items.  The detangling hair brush works great.  It works through all of the tangles very easily.  I love the feel of the other larger brush.  It is very smooth and very comfortable to grip while brushing my hair.  I love this set.  I have purchased detangling hair brushes before, for the price I paid for one brush I could have purchased this set. It is a great value!  I received a sample for free of this set to test and review.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes. I&#x27;m so utterly glad I signed up to review them because they brush my hair with ease. Even dealing with a nasty knot in my daughters hair they worked well and didn&#x27;t add to the frustration of the situation. I love the little brush a lot! I would recommend this set for anyone who has long or short hair. My daughter and I both have long hair, and this helps with making our hair look gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and these brushes go right through without pulling! Love them!&lt;br /&gt;Updating my review. I was out in the wind and dust all day and anyone with long (mid back) thick naturally curly hair knows what horrible knots this causes. Ultimate test for a brush- it went right through! No pulling! Untangled the knots no problem!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brush set!!  I got this because both my Daughter and I have both have hair that easily gets tangled.  The detangling brush is great on wet hair!  I was able to get all the tangles out of her hair without the usual chorus of &amp;#34;ow&#x27;s!&amp;#34;  There is a slight learning curve with how one should properly hold the detangling brush- if you hold it wrong, it can make your job much harder than it needs to be!  But once you figure out how to hold it right, and what amount of pressure to use, it works like a dream!!  Very happy with the regular brush as well.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed when I opened this package and saw the two brushes AND then bonus bag. For some reason I just thought i was buying one detangling brush, but the listing clearly states there are two. So, good surprise for me, haha! These are especially good for little girls because they are palm-sized and very gentle. My girls are just starting to brush and do their own hair, so I&#x27;m glad they are not too huge for their hands. However, these are not mini or purse-sized brushes. They are real/normal just on the smaller side for smaller hands.</li>
    <li> This is a dream if you&#x27;re a mom to a daughter who can&#x27;t stand having her hair brushed when it&#x27;s tangled. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much out of these, but my daughter LOVES having her own &amp;#34;pink brush&amp;#34; (especially the pink part) and the detangling one really works well! No more tears! We use the second one as just a regular old brush, it&#x27;s handy to finish off the job after you use the detangler. A great gift for any little girl in your life!</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughters who have very tangly hair...and they work great! When they arrived they did have an odor to them, but that went away after leaving them out a day or so. The girls love them and they really make doing hair a much easier process. I love the included bag too.</li>
    <li> Just received this product.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this de-tangling brush.  I have very long, thick hair and this brush easily brushed through my hair after a wash and almost no hair ended up in the bristles.  Amazing product, every girl should have this in her brush collection!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with brush!  It detangled my hair gently, causing much less hair fall.  Furthermore, Hair Symphony contacted me via email to make sure that I was satisfied with their service and product.</li>
    <li> My brushes arrived in a perfect box, clean, near and a day sooner than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I love the set is so awesome. The brush for wet hair is so soft, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and affordable price.</li>
    <li> Really does helps with detangling your hair. Even better that it comes with the extra brush and pouch.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. Well built, comfortable grip and works wonders on my thick and voluminous hair. The included travel bag is a welcomed addition.I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a very speedy delivery. I was anxious to received these brushes. I gave them to my daughter who has very long, thick and wavy hair. When she wakes up in the morning her hair is always full of tangles which are very painful when she tries to brush them out. She absolutely loved the detangler brush.  She can use it with wet or dry hair. No more detangling ouchies!  The color and shapes are so cool. The Soft Nylon Hair Brush leaves her hair so smooth. Both brushes are very easy to clean. I loved the bonus storage bag. I kept the storage bag for myself. I use it to store my makeup. I was also surprised at the great price. I got two wonderful and cool brushes for a great price. Thanks for a great product. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love the little carrying case it came in! I bought this as a present for one of my friends. Her 3 girls have thick curly hair and she was looking for a good brush. So far she tells me they love it and there have been no tears.</li>
    <li> These work great. I have super thick wavy hair and am picky about hair brushes because most just pull my hair. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with these brushes. The detangler works surprisingly well! It&#x27;s super lightweight and goes through your hair like a hot knife does though butter. Very happy!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have curly hair. I have had years to deal with mine, my daughter is still learning and fighting hers. I ordered this for her hair. She LOVES it! She is 8 years old and it has been a battle getting her to brush her hair. We have invested in so many detanglers, conditioners, and hair combs......should have just gotten this to start with! She loves the way it brushes through her hair wet or dry. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and detangles it easily. She was raving about it! She really loves the bag that is came with too, it is for her own special brush! Parents with daughters with curly hair....this is for you!! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love the hair de tangling brush. I have a lot of long wavy hair and only a pick could get through my mess of a hair after a shower. The set angler brushes even nicer than the pick and I can use this to blow dry some of the dampness out of my hair too without getting knots. My only complaint is that the handle is a little short, especially when I use the blow dryer. The other brush is really nice too and comparable to most other brushes like it. I love that it came with a bag too, especially for when I travel. Great set!  A must have.</li>
    <li> As a guy with long poofy hair I bought this pack as I needed a brush for a long trip. So this came in handy with the travel bag and the hair detangling brush. Great price, all I needed and I also liked the name Hair Symphony (I am a musician). I couldn’t even imagine that a brush could detangle my hair. I even stopped trying for the last year. I know it’s pink but I don’t care! I’m taking this everywhere with me! Awesome! Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> Two awesome brushes for almost the price of one! I use the detangling brush on wet hair and the other when I dry the hair. I am very happy I can finally do this and not lose all that hair. The cosmetics bag I actually use to keep my makeup brushes organized.</li>
    <li> I got this set as a present for my niece. She is 12 yo and has long curly hair. After a few days her mom called me to ask where I got it from, as she said the brushes were amazing and wants a set for herself. She also has curly hair. I didn’t tell her, because I want to surprise her... at this price I am going to get her one as well.</li>
    <li> arrived in great condition and works very well</li>
    <li> The tips of the bristles on the detangling brush aren&#x27;t rounded enough, so they scratch your scalp as you brush. And I don&#x27;t feel like the bristle are flexible enough; they take out a lot of hair even when I&#x27;m careful. I wish I returned it when I had the chance. I have very curly hair, so I don&#x27;t even use the other brush. :/</li>
    <li> I really love this set.  My hair is long and a little wavy, and my two year old&#x27;s hair is curly so both get tangled fairly easily.  I tried the detangling brush on both of us and was surprised at how gently and easily it went through.  No knotting, and VERY little of my hair was left in the brush when I was done!  The hair brush is a standard hair brush, but it seems well made.  I use those for dry brushing, and if I have a tangle I switch to the detangling brush.  I&#x27;m really excited about not losing as much hair when I brush it - who wouldn&#x27;t be?</li>
    <li> I have very very long hair and the detangler brush works great on my wet hair and I use the other after my hair is dried. Super cute color and  comes with a little travel pouch.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this detangling brush! I have long straight hair but i have a lot of hair so it tends to get knotted up easily. This brush has been working great with those knots! Definitely cutting down on the amount of time i have to spend untangling, and my hair is soft and smooth afterward.</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter both have wicked curly hair and it would be a FIGHT for me to brush her hair! I got these and now it does not take 1/2 as long to get her hair brushed and now we do not have to use as many detanglers and oils!! Makes it so much easier and tamed when brushing her hair!</li>
    <li> My daughters are fighting over this brush! I bought it for my youngest who has fine hair that tangles easily. She HATES having her hair brushed, but I&#x27;m not ok with the baby dreads. This has been a life saver - no more crying when it comes time to brush. My older daughter keeps taking it! I may need a second one....</li>
    <li> Great brushes! They work for everyone in the family. My five year old has super long hair and the detangling brush is amazing! She has not screamed once since I used it. The bristles on the black brush are super soft. I love how it comes with a carrying case.</li>
    <li> I live with 3 girls with very long hair... Here are their observations: There brushes by Hair Symphony are awesome. First - they are diverse meaning they are great for Wet hair also. Finding a brush for dry hair is not a challenge, but one that works for wet hair is tough find, let alone brushes that work for both wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Second - they do NOT cause any static in my hair, which is a rarity for me. For some reason all my brushes get my hair static-y. Third - They do NOT pull my hair out like some of my other brushes and they feel of very high quality OH... AND they are pretty :)</li>
    <li> I have a  year old granddaughter who it works well with getting the tangles out and shes doesnt cry it hurts.</li>
    <li> When I was in elementary &amp;  middle school, I remember having to sit on the floor in front of the couch while my mother tried to work on the tangles in my hair. It was a long &amp; painful experience. I&#x27;ve always been proactive with my daughter and her hair so she didn&#x27;t have to go through the same thing, but she would still gets tangles. Since using a detangling brush, she hasn&#x27;t had any tangles. The brush does a wonderful, pain free job of getting rid of tangles! I so wish they had these brushes back when I was young! I ordered this set mainly for the detangling brush, so the nylon hair brush is kind of a bonus to me. It&#x27;s a nice, solid, basic hair brush.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the detangling hair brush.  I have long curly hair that is impossible to brush or comb out.  This brush worked in the shower with wet tangled hair and out with dry curls.  Amazing.  I want to get one for my grand daughter with long, thick and curly hair.  I think she will love it, and the color is perfect! Thanks Hair Symphony!</li>
    <li> Spectacular brush set.  I have naturally Curly hair and this detangling brush has worked like a dream to help untangle my curly locks after washing them.  I do not feel like I am pulling all of my hair out when I am brushing as the detangling brush helps to smooth my hair and glide right through the knots.  I also love the styling brush when I am straightening my curly hair it is large enough but not not super large and it does not seem to make my hair go frizzy while straightening.  I love the bonus storage bag as well it is great to keep track of my brushes and to take along when traveling.</li>
    <li> Fits very nicely in my daughters hand and doesn&#x27;t hurt her tender head. My little girl screams if you try to brush her hair usually but she likes this brush because it doesn&#x27;t hurt her. She even will brush her own hair now... The carrying case is very nice as well.</li>
    <li> I order these professional soft nylon hair brushes for me and my daughter we both have long thick hair for once I ain&#x27;t pulling out a bunch of my hair from it being knotted when I wash it and brush it with my new detangular brush doesn&#x27;t pull or get stuck in our hair like our old brush it has soft bristles not harsh on your hair and the styling brush is great for when u straighten your hair and to style it when u blow dry it now the only problem is to keep my 19 year old daughter for taking it and love the bag is to store in your purse and if get dirty just thr</li>
    <li> What a deal on these brushes! I&#x27;m a sucker for all things pink and it initially caught my eye, but then I read all the great reviews and thought I would give them a shot. I have long hair and no matter how careful I am shampooing and conditioning I almost always have knots and tangles. I just leave the detangling brush in the shower now and it works great! After I blow dry my hair it is still easy to comb through with ease. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is not is not breaking off as easily anymore. Great brushes!</li>
    <li> The detangler worked great for me when my hair was wet, not so much when it was dry.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  The detangler has many fine, pointed, flexible &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;  unlike the bristles on the included hairbrush.  It seems that when my hair is dry, the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; bend and don&#x27;t really deal with the tangle.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair.  These &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are also a bit sharp for sensitive scalps, so I need to be careful.  I received a discount for this product.  This discount did not influence my review, which is based solely on my personal use and assessment of this hair brush set by Hair Symphony.</li>
    <li> These brushes glide right through my fine hair, wet or dry.  I notice less breakage and easier manageability.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a new hair brush and this brush has been so much nicer than my old one! It glides through my hair quite nicely and leaves my hair so soft afterward. I also really like the detangling brush. I have thick, wavy hair that likes to knot up sometimes and the detangling brush just goes right through without much pain for me. I like that it comes with a bonus cosmetic bag, which I use for storing the brushes because the bag keeps dust and dirt out of my brushes. The company that I bought these from also included a handy little sheet on how to wash and take care of your brushes, so I am going to be able to use them for a long time! I am excited to get another set to use these on my daughter when her hair grows out enough for me to use these.</li>
    <li> Its alright not what I expected but I guess its good for traveling wise</li>
    <li> With 4 daughters, 3 under 5, brushing hair is a fight with all but the oldest usually. With this brush none of them fuss or complain at all. We have extremely thick to very thin hair types and it works great on all of them. Its approved by our little girls who absolutely despise having their hair brush and used to fight us so I would recommend it to everyone with young girls or just longer hair.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of hair brushes. They are easy to use and work well to detangle hair. Detangling brushes like these tend to run about $15. This set comes with a nice nylon brush as well making it comparable in price to similar brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a strong chemical odor when you first open the package but it dissipates quickly. My nylon brush was missing 2 of the bristles/pins when I took it out of the package but still works well and no other bristles have fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;As a review blogger I receive product samples at no cost or at a deeply discounted rate. Whether I pay for a product or receive a sample for review purposes my reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
    <li> Looked for a while for a product like this one.  Use the detangling brush everyday.  I get a lot of tangles and this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt me like others I have tried. It glides easily without alot of effort.  And the bag is very handy also.</li>
    <li> I really love both. I have really long hair and was worried the detangling brush would be too weak to get through it but as long as I don&#x27;t push hard it does a really nice job. the other brush is light but strong! I hate when you buy a brush and the bristle part rips out of the back, this one doesn&#x27;t seem like it will do that!</li>
    <li> This does a much better job of detangling my two-year-old&#x27;s hair than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.  Even the styling brush is good enough so I&#x27;ve only used the detangling brush a few times.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have long curly hair just above my pant line. Most brushes just rip and pull at my hair when I am trying to brush it out after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are high quality and are living up to their description. They come in a cute little bag. The detangle brush works so well with my hair. No need to be rough and feel like I am ripping hair out just brush a few times and the knots come out smoothly. The other brush is also very nice. I use that for blow drying, styling, or for brushing when my hair is already dry. I am in love with these and am so glad I purchased them.</li>
    <li> My young daughter and I share the same hair type.  Fine, thin and it tangles if you look at it the wrong way.  Brushing her hair out after a shower has always been a mutually despised chore, requiring lots of time and detangling spray.  Now that we have this set we can brush her hair out without it turning into a big scene.  The thin straight bristles on the detangling brush don&#x27;t get caught in her hair the way the tips of a regular brush can, which can create more problems than is solves.  Tonight we took turns and I did one side and she did the other, without any additional sprays, which is great. Very happy to have added this brush to her routine.  The styling brush is also sturdy and nicely balanced.  Good for brushing out her hair when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush for my daughters hair.  She has long fine hair but lots of it and gets knots that are hard to get out.  She uses this brush on her own and finds it easy to hold and gets the knots out with ease.  I would reccomend this to any parent that fights with their child when brushing their hair.</li>
    <li> I have always had long hair my entire life and have always always battled knotted hair.  This detangling brush has fixed that without pulling out clumps of my hair is easily glides right through my hair and gets those knots right out. I could not believe it! I use it on my little girls hair who also has long hair but a sensitive head and she has no complained in over a week!</li>
    <li> If I do my &amp;#34;mom hair&amp;#34; (read - mess bun) for more than a couple of days my hair becomes so knotted that I can&#x27;t pass a comb or brush through it without ripping a good third of it out of my scalp. If I wash my messy hair and use a good conditioner I can get every knot out without creating bald spots! haha I love that the bristles are all different lengths that seems to be the trick to getting through it without just ripping at the knots. I don&#x27;t know how I lasted this long without a brush like this. I like the bag that it comes with too because I can keep both brushes (my husband has taken over the black brush) and all my headbands in here and my bathroom counter is less cluttered!</li>
    <li> This detangling hair brush is perfect for my 5 year old&#x27;s long hair.  She absolutely loves to use this hair brush.  I love that she is actually wanting to brush her own hair.  It is perfect for combing through wet hair.  I love that it comes with a soft hair brush and a bag.  I love bonuses!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s tangled mess of hair stands no chance with this awesome little brush. Every time she washes her hair we get in a fight over if we need to go ahead and cut it all off. Thankfully now I dont want to hold her down and shave her head because now she can actually detangle her own wet hair with out my help!! I might be going out on a limb here but this brush may have saved my daughter and I lots of money from years of therapy we probably would have ended up with.</li>
    <li> I have two girls ages 9 and 5 with long hair. They absolutely love them.  They can easily comb their own hair without my help.</li>
    <li> I have had long hair for my entire life and getting the tangles out is a daily challenge. My hair is naturally curly, but I usually wear it straight and it&#x27;s always a long tiring process. Not any more. I used to have to keep a brush in the shower to brush through the tangles and then some detangling product as soon as getting out. With this brush, I wash my hair as normal, but don&#x27;t have to brush it until it&#x27;s dry. It also came with a travel bag, so I can easily take it wherever I go.  I have recommended this brush to everyone I know! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have long , thick curly hair. It is tough for me to find a decent brush. I also have noticed after having my son , my hair has been even harder to manage. It seems like m hair tangles so quick. SO when i was able to try out this brush set for my review I couldn&#x27;t resist. First I like how they come in a nice leather bag. It felt nice and zipped up too. I dont&#x27;t like mess so I like how I can heelp these stored. I tried them both on my wet hair. I have to tell you the black brush is the best. It brushed my hair with ease and even got out the tangles for me. I can tell you I was beyond impressed. For the pink brush i liked the shape of it but i think the black one worked better. Overall this is such a nice brush set.</li>
    <li> The two brushes are AMAZING!!! I found the detangling brush was very helpful getting through my long wet hair. When I get out of the shower after washing my hair normally I have a hard time using a wide tooth comb to get through my hair but with the wet detangling brush I was through my hair very quickly and on my way. With the other brush I got a great massage as well as once again got my hair styled with a very easy to use brush.&lt;br /&gt;Id recommend this for someone looking to take good care of their hair.</li>
    <li> I bought them for a friend who is attending cosmetology school and she loves&lt;br /&gt;them.</li>
    <li> The detangling brush is sleek and looks cool.  Very lightweight design.  This will be great for my daughter&#x27;s curls.  She thinks it is a toy.  The nylon brush seems durable.  It is very comfortable in my hand.  The free travel bag is a fun bonus too!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set. It comes with a nice pouch for travel (good touch) and is compact enough to throw into a suitcase. The brushes come with tips on use. I believe if you follow them, you will increase the longevity of the brushes. Here are my tips as well:&lt;br /&gt;Use the detangler (pink one) first on wet hair only. Spray or massage in your favorite creme rinse before and let it set in for about 5 minutes (wrap your hair in a towel). Begin at the ends of your hair (medium and longer hair) and work your way up towards your scalp. Let the detangler do the work for you and don&#x27;t yank or dig it into your scalp. The tines on the pink brush are a bit sharp and are bi level. If you follow these steps, you will minimize hair breakage and possible scalp issues. Clear the detangler of any hair and rinse in lukewarm water. Follow the enclosed instructions for cleaning every week or so.&lt;br /&gt;I follow with the red and black brush afterward once I have applied my styling product. I like the ease of cleaning for both of them and their compact size. If you are a full size brush sort of person, these may not work for you. For me, they are just perfect.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality with these hair brushes. I use the paddle brush on my own hair and it brushes my hair without leaving a ton of static! Very nice handle to grip and the brush isn&#x27;t too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the detangling brush for my neice who has just awful hair.Her hair used to take about 10 minutes to detangle. With this brush, i can do it in about five minutes.</li>
    <li> The brush does not work well at all and my daughter said it hurt her head!  I bought the original Tangle Teezer as a smaller brush, without the handle, but the pins were much softer and worked well with both my daughters.  I wanted to get the same brush, and perhaps with the handle for easy handling so it wouldn&#x27;t slip out of my hand, so I decided to try this.  To my disappointment, this brush was not nearly as good or functional as the original.  Please discontinue this item or bring back the original Tangle Teezer!  This is by far a bad imitation of the real thing!!!</li>
    <li> Detangler is perfect for wet hair, with a nice smooth but firm bristle. Softer brush is perfectly paired the blow dry and style detangled hair. Love the way they feel on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Highly dissapointed. The quality of the bristles are no better than a Barbie&#x27;s hairbrush. I&#x27;m not looking forward to Christmas morning when my mom with curly poofy hair tries out this miracle detangling brush out and screams in pain as it gets stuck and rips out follicles from her scalp.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  My 4 year old daughter used to cry and try to run every time I tried to brush her hair.  It is very fine and tangles very easily even after using lots of conditioner in the bath.  With these brushes it is easy to brush her hair.  It is no longer a battle.  This brush easily gets the knots out without pulling the hair.  It is best on wet hair but works well on dry hair too.  Love, Love, Love this brush!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush that I have ever used.  I have never before found a brush that my daughter doesn&#x27;t scream when I  brush her hair.  I didn&#x27;t even have to spray detangeler in her hair!  I was amazed at how fast it was to get the knots out.  The brush is easy to hold and extremely easy to use.  The special designed bristles make brushing all kinds of hair a breeze.  I use it on myself (wavy hair), my older daughter(straight hair), and my youngest (curly hair).  It works just as easy on either of us.  My daughters won&#x27;t let me use any other brush now.  The styling brush is also a plus.  I would have gladly paid that price for one brush but I got two and a bonus bag to keep them in.  I must say, I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome! My daughter has very long, very thick and coarse hair. I constantly struggle to brush it and keep it free of tangles. These brushes get her thumbs up for certain! The flat brush definitely helped get knots out painlessly and the other brush is great as well! I am super happy with these brushes! If you have difficult hair these are a must have!!</li>
    <li> If I could give this 10 stars, I would. We tried the detangling brush a) on just out of the shower conditioned hair b)on just out of the shower not conditioned hair and c)on dry hair. In every instance, the brush worked *beautifully*. Not a single complaint of pulling from any of the kids, and it went through their hair in record time. This is the third kind of detangling brush we have tried, and this one blew the other two out of the water. Something else that was an added bonus-one of my girls has quite a bit of natural curl, and if I used other brushes it would brush out the curls, and this brush does not.</li>
    <li> My daughter and her fine, easily tangled hair thank you!!!! Poor thing has a delicate scalp that turns bright red and she just gets so sad about brushing hair. But this brush has really made it a gentler process for her. She no has a meltdown when its time to fix her hair for the day or after a bath. Works great wet or dry. Also awesome out of the pool!  Really, thank you so very much. This is a great brush set!</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  The vented brush has a nice large pad and the bristles are coated at the tips so it is gentle and massaging on the scalp.  The detailing brush has very tight bristles to get through smaller pieces of hair.  Like the both very much. Loved the toiletry bonus bag too!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when initial making the purchase, but am no longer.  The detangling brush works! My 5 year old daughter didn&#x27;t make a peep when brushing her hair.  I was amazed.  Now, I want to buy one for everyone I know!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried out the other brush that comes with it yet, but the detangler brush is worth the cost by itself.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY brush that I&#x27;ve gotten through the inevitable tangles in my 3-year old&#x27;s super long hair without tears -- priceless!</li>
    <li> Detangling brush works great. I love the shape as well. I use it every morning. Nylon hair brush works good also. Easy to work with.</li>
    <li> The Professional Soft Nylon Hair Brush and Detangling Hair Brush work well!  Actually, my son, who has a buzz cut, likes to use the detangling brush because it actually can brush the short hair :)</li>
    <li> My wife loves this brush.  I got it for her as a gift.  She loves the detangling brush</li>
    <li> Very happy with the ease of using this brush on my daughters wet hair. Typically we use a comb to be the most effective method to get out tangles. This brush for wet detangling glides right through her hair pulling very few hairs out as we encounter tangles. It also leaves her hair nice and shiny once it is dry. Other brushes and combs we have used left her hair looking fuzzy, but not this brush!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with both brushes. I have longer fine natural curly/wavy hair. I read all the feedbacks on Amazonfor other wet &amp; detangling brushes. Most had mixed feedbacks, both pro and con, so I chose to purchase your brushes.So far they function as promised and they both are very comfortable in the hand as well as feel wonderful on your scalp.I love them! Plus, I do like the black and red colors. So I would give them both five stars as a rating.</li>
    <li> The brushes are unbelievable! I have two little girls who have very different hair, and who both hate getting it brushed. I have purchased LOTS of brushes that claim to be &#x27;no cry&#x27; brushes. All of them have resulted in tears. My youngest daughter has very thick, ringlet curly hair down to her waist. It tangles up particularly bad at the nape of her neck. I sat her down to brush after washing her hair the other night, and it was the first time she didn&#x27;t notice I was messing with her head. The unique design and type of bristle is what I like the best about this brush. They have a slight angle, and are not so stuff that they pull on the hair when you glide the brush through. I love that I don&#x27;t feel like I am damaging or breaking my baby&#x27;s gorgeous locks when I use this brush. The carrying case is an added bonus. It is big enough to fit both the detangle brush, but also the styling brush in addition to some other hair &#x27;must haves&#x27;. We have bobby pins, hair ties and clips in ours. Once we are done with the detangling brush, we smooth out the hair with the styling brush. This is the first set that I am 100% happy with, and will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter in law who has very curly , long hair.  The de tangling brush does a good job getting through the thick hair without breaking it. The cute little case to hold both brushes make it great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes.  I got this set for my girlfriend and she loves them.  In fact, she also got a different, more expensive detangling brush and she much prefers the one from this set.  I hated watching her painful struggle to brush her hair and now her hair brushing is smooth and pain-free.</li>
    <li> My youngest daughter is Autistic and she does not like her hair being touched. I have searched high and low for brushes that would not only make things easier for me, but would also make her more comfortable with her hair being brushed. When I got the opportunity to receive this brush complimentary to review I knew I had to try it out! I love that this set not only has the detangling brush, but also has a regular brush and comes in a little black carrying bag. This brush glides through her hair and gets rid of all the tangles so that she does not have to sit there for a long time while I try to make her hair manageable. So far I have used this brush on my two daughters and even my own hair. I love that this comes with the second brush because it seems to even out the hair a little better once the tangles are out of the way. I have really long hair that can be a real pain if I get any knots in it and this brush helps solve the problem.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of 2 brushes that come in a stylish storage pouch.  It includes 2 brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: STYLING BRUSH&lt;br /&gt;This one is designed just to brush your hair.  They recommend brushing your hair in the direction of your natural hair flow, and not to put pressure on your scalp.  Can be used on wet or dry hair without doing any damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: DETANGLING BRUSH&lt;br /&gt;This brush can be used in any direction (with natural flow of hair or diagonally/sideways).  They recommend doing it gently so you won&#x27;t damage your hair.  It is great to get those pesty tangles out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick and coarse hair that frequently gets tangled up.  Before using these brushes I add a few drops of Argan oil to my hair to help removing the tangles even easier.  I gently massage the oil into my hair and then use the detangling brush to get all tangles out.  I experience no pain and no broken hair.  I really love how the combination of Argan oil and this detanglish brush keeps my hair healthy and shining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received complimentary to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I was a skeptic, I&#x27;ll admit. My daughter has very thick and wavy hair.  Every morning it&#x27;s an ordeal to get her off to school with brushed and styled hair without her whining and crying the whole time.  This brush is truly a game changer! She loves having her hair done now and even brushes it herself.  Brushing with the detangling brush and then styling with the other brush makes our mornings so much easier. Great product for sure!</li>
    <li> Both brushes are wonderful. They feel soft and great on my hair. What I was looking most forward to was the pink brush. My daughter has Shirley Temple hair. Very curly. And at 21 months, she is not happy about mama brushing her tangled mess...and really, what toddler sits still for you to brush their hair. Add the knotted mass and it was torture. Along comes this awesome detangling brush and our battles have diminished greatly. I personally find it works better when her hair is wet. It just comes right through it. It works well when it&#x27;s dry, but because her hair is SO curly, I get better results when it is damp or wet. The nylon brush is great too. I love it for myself. I love the bristle pad. It&#x27;s not cheap. What I noticed first is the pad with the bristles is sealed to the base of the brush. No popping out plastic. It&#x27;s also lightweight and is comfortable to hold. The bonus bag was definitely a bonus. I throw the brushes in there when I&#x27;m finished and have less clutter! So thankful for the detangling brush...for my daughter&#x27;s sake!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new brush for my wife due to another &amp;#34;brush/dog toy&amp;#34; incident. I had never seen the wet hair detangler before, but I figured it was a nice little set. They look to be made with a extra quality in mind, but other than that it is tough for me to review. I have not had any hair since high school due to shaving or by nature :) So I let my wife try them out and here are her words: &amp;#34;I love em, especially the wet brush&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a lady of few words so that speaks volumes for this product.</li>
    <li> First thing first, this product is awesome, not only I&#x27;m I impressed, but my 2.5 year old daughter loves it too.  Yes the pink color is a huge hit with her too.  I use the detangling brush for her, since she has fine, simi-curly hair.  She use to cry when I tried to brush her hair dry or wet with a comb or brush.  Now using the detangling brush she does not cry and doesn&#x27;t tell me it hurts.  What a relief!  I have been using the Styling brush and love using it on my long hair! The bristles feel great while brushing my hair.  I&#x27;m picky on buying brushes, but this set is great and I can manage would be great on any hair style. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really like the paddle brush, and if you&#x27;ve used one before then you pretty much know what you&#x27;re getting with this one.  Works well and construction is solid.  The detangling brush was the item that sold me. I was a bit skeptical, but it really works well. My girls and I have long wavy hair and this brush gets all the snarls out quickly and without trauma. I also like the bright color since it&#x27;s always obvious which one it is and where it is. Definitely recommend trying this if you have whiny kids or if you just want to make your own hairbrushing easier.</li>
    <li> The detangling brush works great to get out tangles in my children&#x27;s hair. They don&#x27;t dread brushing anymore.</li>
    <li> It really does detangle well. I have pretty thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a nice brush to comb my hair without breaking or getting stuck. I&#x27;ve been using it daily since I&#x27;ve received the product and it detangles my hair in less strokes than most brushes I&#x27;ve used. It has a nice curvy handle and plus, it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
    <li> the detangling brush works great after shampooing the hair,but the other brush one of the bristles came off and please ensure that the brushes don&#x27;t drop because it is easy to chip off. The brushes are applicable for any type of hair.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair, if anything, it pulled more hair out than my last set of brushes. Will not buy again!</li>
    <li> So my almost three-year-old&#x27;s hair is getting SO long! Every night it&#x27;s a struggle to let me comb it after bath time. I really don&#x27;t want to cut her hair because she has the most adorable curls and I&#x27;m afraid by cutting it that the curls won&#x27;t come back. Anyway, enter search for a brush, comb, anything to let us both have a stress free post-bath hair combing. That&#x27;s when I came across the Hair Symphony Professinal Detangling Brush and Soft Nylon Hair Brush. I was reluctant when it arrived in the mail but the first night we used it, my little girl let me brush through her wet hair without any tears! All the knots and tangles were gone and I wasn&#x27;t left with a brush full of broken hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these! She was super excited when I handed her this package. Her hair is soft and tangles easy. She constantly is getting a giant tangle in the back of her hair and then cries when I try to untangle it. (she cries while I swear under my breath)  I was given these brushes to review and decided to let my daughter tell what she thinks. (kids are horribly honest on occasion) She loves the way they look she says. The detangling brush is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the regular brushes. She still hates brushing her hair but doesn&#x27;t cry now. So I&#x27;d say this product gets a 5 star review from me.</li>
    <li> I used to wear my hair short so I didn&#x27;t need a detangling brush. However, I grew my hair out a little bit recently and it&#x27;s now of a medium length. Sometimes it gets tangled, especially after working out or after I take a shower. This detangling brush is very nice to my hair and it works like a charm! I like the other brush as well and I keep it in my car for a day to day use. The brushes come with a nice carrying pouch to keep them clean and to prevent hair from getting everywhere. I keep the bigger brush in that pouch in my car so the hair wouldn&#x27;t get all over my car! These brushes would be great for everybody with long haired girls or whoever wears their hair long or medium length. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I think that this is a great quality product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have long hair (down to my waist) and I am constantly fighting my hair when it is time to brush it out. It is especially horrible right after I get out of the shower. My hair tangles so badly and I usually end up pulling handfuls of hair out accidentally. I was given the opportunity to get a complimentary set of these brushes to try out and review with my honest experience and opinion of the product. I am loving this brush set because I can actually brush out my hair without lots of pain, tugging and pulling! I also love that you can use these brushes on wet or dry hair with wonderful results. I highly recommend this brush set to anyone with long hair, anyone with colored hair that has become dry and hard to brush, and anyone with children who hate to go through the pain of brushing tangled hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set! The detangling brush allows me to brush my hair without wincing in pain! I have very long thick hair and usually avoid brushing my hair and just throw my hair in a bun on top of my head, because it&#x27;s so painful. This set of brushes makes brushing the gnarls out of my hair easy and I love the added travel bag that comes with it. Great products!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in LOVE with this set! Not only do you get an AMAZING detangling brush, but you receive a styling brush AND case for both brushes! These are high quality brushes that have completely changed our lives. My daughter has VERY thick hair that easily gets tangled, especially when playing outside…until we received our detangling brush, our hair care routine was a nightmare! Brushing before bath time, after bath time, in the morning, in the evening…all awful :( There have been so many tears shed and detangling sprays purchased and I am so thankful to have put it all to an end! I myself love using both brushes as well! I have tangle issues as well and have found that the detangling brush is perfect for my snarls and the styling brush is perfect for when I am fixing my hair each morning! I plan on purchasing an extra set as I NEVER want to be without these brushes ever again! I love the product, I love the price and I love the great customer service and care that I have experienced with Hair Symphony! I will be sharing my review on all of my social media sites as well as Youtube to let all of my friends know that there is absolutely no reason to be fighting tangles and tears when there is such a fantastic reasonably priced product out there! If only I had known sooner! I am glad to have been given the opportunity to try these brushes out and share my thoughts with you!</li>
    <li> The pink brush seems to rip an awful lot of hair out of my daughters head. It she happens to nick the back of her neck with it, It gets red and irritated. Not worth the money to me.    Update: WOW!  I am totally impressed by how Hair Symphony took care of me, very very nice of them.  Mike, I will make sure to go over the instructions with my daughter.  I&#x27;m sure she will give it another try.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have twin 5 year old girls.  One with long hair and one with short.  The short haired twin is learning to brush her own hair and we have another type of detangling hair brush but it is one you hold in your palm and difficult for her to hold on to- this one was a breeze for her to brush her hair with and she commented how much she liked it!  It got all the end of day knots out easily.  We also tried the other brush with her and, while easy to use, the knot brush was quicker on the knots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long haired twin- well we should probably invest in ear plugs for mornings- even with her hair braided overnight.  The detangling brush was easy to use on her too though- I think we had a 50% reduction in ear shattering screams with it.  Maybe even 60%!  She liked the black brush too, which we used to smooth her hair once the tangles were out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional bag is great for holding the brushes and all the misc. hair ties that appear to reproduce in our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- a great value and ear drum saver!</li>
    <li> Just what I have been looking for in hair accessories for a long time. My hair is straight and down to my waist, which tangles easy. These brushes work very nicely on mine, I can finally stop buying all kinds of hair brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  Brushes through your hair without pulling easy to clean, highly recommend</li>
    <li> i love these hair brushes and i liked the travel bag they came in it is great to use when taking trips to keep up with them and the brushes themselves are very well put together and are a cute color!! i got this product for free for a product review</li>
    <li> At first I was in love with this brush.  Not the wave looking one, but the other one worked fantastic.  I bought it two months ago.  Used it for 6 weeks and the brush bristle part popped out.  I am super bummed and looking for a different brush similar to this one but with a higher quality.</li>
    <li> Nice my five year old has very curly hair and these work great on it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  First brush I have bought in ten years that didn&#x27;t have something break on it first time using it. The detangling brush bristles seemed a bit flimsy for my hair. Probably works great with thinner hair than mine, but overall I&#x27;m happy with your product. Hope this is of some help.</li>
    <li> Me like many women have many different hair brushes for different needs. This came neatly packed in the cosmetic bag that is big enough to fit both the 2 hair brushes other makeup brushes and items and yet it is still small enough to fit in your purse.  I love the detangling hair brush because it gets the tangles and knots out of your hair easily without having to yank hard or get a lot of snags. The other long handled hair brush is great because it goes through wet hair amazingly. I love this brush and it replaced the one I have loved for years. It is a great color I like the handle you hold onto and the grip. It makes my hair look great and easy to clean hair our of the brush. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has long, baby fine hair that tangles easily.  She always gets mad when I brush her hair because she says I pull too hard.  When she puts her own hair up, she misses tangles and her hair looks awful.  When these brushes arrived, she immediately took them over.  She brushed the tangles out of her hair easily with both of them.  The larger brush, which is a styling brush now resides in her bathroom so she can use it everyday.  She put the pink detangling brush in her gym bag so she can put her hair up before basketball practice and games.  I am glad I have found a brush set that takes the tangles out of her hair painlessly.  I would highly recommend Hair Symphony to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided free products for review purposes and not compensated in any other way.  My thoughts are my own.﻿</li>
    <li> These work great. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  I wish the handle for the wet-hair brush had some rubber because it slips out of my hand, but I really like the way it slides through my hair without breaking the strands.</li>
    <li> My girls love their new brushes. They are much easier to hold for the little girls (5 and 3) than other smaller detangling brushes we have. We are very pleased with this purchase. And mom loves the additional cosmetic bag :-)</li>
    <li> Great brushes and great customer service from the company and the seller!!!</li>
    <li> I will admit that I didn&#x27;t think this type of brush would be able to hold up to my super curly hair. I honestly thought this because many brushes with similar looking design have gotten tangled up in my hair and pulled right out of the brush. I&#x27;ve even had the entire pad with bristles pop right out.&lt;br /&gt;The black brush can withstand a lot. I am able to brush through my hair with no problem. That&#x27;s great! No need to go out and buy a new brush for a while since this one does exactly what I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the pink brush are a bit smaller and there are many more. This brush is PERFECT for my niece&#x27;s hair. She has the longest and tiniest kinky curls. Her hair gets tangled all the time. I&#x27;m serious. I feel so bad for her when my sister brushes her hair with any other brush. I wanted her to try this brush so badly and OMG am I ever happy that she did.&lt;br /&gt;She said that this brush is literally the only brush that she has ever owned that is able to get her tangles out as well as it does, without the pain. It seriously is perfect. I am so glad. She really likes the brush and my sister couldn&#x27;t be more thankful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these brushes for reviewing purposes. All opinions stated here are solely my own and in no way influenced.</li>
    <li> My tender headed 3 year old didn&#x27;t make a peep as I detangled her hair with the pink wet brush!  After swim class, when her hair is super knotty.  I like the larger brush for detangling my own hair.  All around a great buy at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I had ever purchased. I bought one for me and one for my daughter. I am white with blonde long thin hair and my daughter is mixed long curly black hair and it works perfectly on both of our hair. I love these brushes and they have excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Perfect for my daughters delicate, ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> These two brushes are very nice and durable. I am planning on gifting the pink detangling brush as a stocking stuffer for my niece. I believe that she will throughly enjoy it. Upon using the black brush, it has proved very effective in use. The bonus carrying case will be used for other cosmetics and vanity supplies.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Very well made and work like a charm! The bag is an added bonus for storage instead of just throwing them on the counter or in my drawer. The brushes fit perfectly in my hand and detangle my hair without the pain!</li>
    <li> Got this set specifically for my daughter. She had seen a different brush advertised that&#x27;s listed as &amp;#34;detangler&amp;#34; and wanted to give it a try. I found this one and got it instead. She&#x27;s got thick, long, naturally very curly hair and she will attest that not all brushes are created equal. She&#x27;s been raving about these since the minute she picked them up. She&#x27;s declared that they glide through her hair smoothly, and she is actually able to brush through her hair when it&#x27;s dry (she usually won&#x27;t as her hair frizzes). She&#x27;s had no &amp;#34;snapping&amp;#34; with hair breakage during usage and continues to give kudos to this brush set. While I haven&#x27;t been able to get near HER set, I&#x27;m thinking I have to buy this for myself as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the pink one. It works good. I like that the handle is shorter. Overall good brush.</li>
    <li> Okay - that detangling brush works like a charm.  My husband has mid back lengthened curly hair (college professor - gets to grow out his hair) and this worked like a charm.  Normally with a wide toothed comb he still yanks out a good amount of hair, but with this brush he had little to no hair being pulled out during detangling.  The hair brush gave a smooth finish to my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Both perform as described.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my 10 year old daughter whose hair was very tangled and it works great! I use the detangling brush first and then the other brush to smooth her hair and the best part she doesn&#x27;t complain about it hurting!!</li>
    <li> Got this without knowing my wife purchased the as seen on tv detangling brush as well. We have 4 long-haired individuals in our household, none of whom have what would be called &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; hair. Totally pleased with this as it gets the knots right out of my 5 year old&#x27;s waist length hair. Heck he can even brush it himself (yes my 5 year old son has waist length hair as do my wife and I, my daughter&#x27;s hair is halfway to her waist). Honestly I prefer the shape of this brush over the round one m wife purchased as i can hold the brush end in my hand and get more control than holding the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you, or a family member, have long and/or &amp;#34;unmanageable&amp;#34; knotty hair, I highly suggest this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You even get a second brush, I keep mine in the car so i can brush the end of my pony tail when i get to work as it sometimes gets a bit knotty from the drive in with the windows down.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble detangling my daughter&#x27;s long hair! I have struggled with her off/on throughout the years. I wanted to try this set of brushes to see if they can help me out. I was skeptical at first because nothing I have tried has worked. I used this brushes after giving my daughter a bath and lo and behold they worked! My daughter used to cry at the thought of me combing out her hair. She no longer cries when I tell her to sit in front of me so I can comb it out. I am very happy that the  brush set worked!</li>
    <li> My 2 daughters have beautiful, thick hair that is often very tangly in the mornings.  My 5 year old routinely had tears in her eyes while I was brushing her hair before school.  I won&#x27;t lie, I always felt terrible about it, but it had to be brushed.  One day, they saw a commercial for a brush that &amp;#34;glides through tangles, without hurting&amp;#34; and they began to beg for the brush.  I refused to pay the crazy high price for the one in the commercial, positive that it was a gimmick.  The begging continued, so I came to Amazon to find a comparable brush to silence the begs.  This one had great reviews, came with 2 hair brushes and a carrying bag, so I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when I used the detangling brush and there were NO tears.  NONE.  It almost slid effortlessly through their hair, getting out the tangles, and causing little to no morning drama.  I was amazed!  One day, after being outside on a particularly blustery fall day, I decided to see how it actually worked on me.  WOW!!!  My crazy tangly hair brushed easily and mostly painlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t order this brush sooner (after I had found it on Amazon).  It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the other brush is super nice too and has replaced their other brush.  :)</li>
    <li> Love this combo brush set.  We have many lengths of hair in our family and many different types of hair, so it is a joy to have a detangling brush in addition to a great hair brush.  Most appreciative has been the long curly hair.  Our scalps thank you for a great brush set.</li>
    <li> I love these hair brushes.  I bought them for my daughter and she thinks they are just great.  She has really thick hair and these work great for styling and detangling her hair.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better brush to detangle her hair.</li>
    <li> Were great as expected.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is biracial and has a lot of hair!  These brushes seem to do the trick.</li>
    <li> not only do you get a de-tangling brush you also get a styling brush and a travel bag for them as well.  Plus there was no pressure to purchase anything else, and it is very attractive in appearance too.  Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a brush for hair that tangles. I recommend this brush almost everyday to someone, it really is that good. i liked this so much i bought one for my granddaughter and now she actually can brush her hair without crying. I am asking for another set for traveling too.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes on my daughter, who is two. They work great. I don&#x27;t have to struggle with her, because it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair. I noticed some reviewers stating that the detangling brush was too rough. I advise not to place it against the scalp when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the paddle brush to smooth out her hair. Overall, an excellent product and one that I use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided for review without cost. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My nearly 4 year old little girl, has very long, very fine waist length hair. Her hair tangles if you look at it wrong. LOL Over the past year it has gotten more and more difficult for me to brush her hair. Its a combo of her hating it, and my coordination issues. (I have a neurological condition very similar to MS) Needless to say it was becoming a living nightmare. More often then not both of us ending up in tears trying to get her hair brushed. So recently i went on a search to find a better way and after days of reading reviews I settled on the Hair symphony brushes. OMG what a major difference she will actually go and get the brush for me. Not only that but she actually tries to brush it on her own!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend this set it is so worth the nearly 19 dollars it costs!!!!!!!!!! No more fits or tears for either of us YAY!</li>
    <li> So relieved and delighted for 6 years and probably close to $100 spent on other brushes and combs to detangle and brush my Daughters hair that didn&#x27;t live up to what they were supposed to accomplish.  All I can say is if your seriously looking for a True detangling brush without struggles and crying look no further. This hair symphony product is nothing short of A~M~A~Z~I~N~G! in all Honesty going to Purchase another set for Backup. LOL Can&#x27;t say enough about this product and how much quicker it helps our mornings and bedtime go so much more smoothly. Thank you Thankyou!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product. She was trying to detangle her hair for months many many times and couldnt and she detangled her hair in just two tries (She had been bed ridden for more than 1 year). This product is awesome</li>
    <li> *edited review*  When I received my brush set one of the brushes was damaged and there was a smudge of paint on the back of the carry case.  I gave them a 1 star review and boxed the brushes back up so I could return them.  Then Hair Symphony contacted me.  They were SERIOUSLY concerned about my poor experience and went into action mode to resolve the problem.  They immediately refunded my money and sent me a new set (which arrived in PERFECT condition 2 days later).  When it comes to Quality, you just never know what you are going to get when you order online.  I&#x27;ve returned many things because they were defective... but I&#x27;ve never had a company handle the mistake like Hair Symphony.  They really do care about their products and the happiness of their customers.  I was not going to re-purchase the brushes after receiving the first set... but boy am I glad that Hair Symphony sent a free replacement.  I am in LOVE with the detangling brush.  It feels awesome on my scalp and pulls through my hair easily even when wet!  This is a great set of brushes - sold by a company that will make sure you are satisfied!!  Even after a bad first impression I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> These brushes help me getting brushing my hair easier.</li>
