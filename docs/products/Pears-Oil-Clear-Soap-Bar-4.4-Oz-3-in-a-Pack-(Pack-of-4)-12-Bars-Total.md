    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, and I can only find it online now.  I have oily, acne prone skin, and the oil clear version helps keep my face clean without over drying.  One thing I particularly like about the Pear brand over other glycerin soaps is that the Pear soap bars are large and don&#x27;t melt like other brands do so they last a long time.  Also, the scent is subtle and doesn&#x27;t cling to your skin or towels like with some brands.</li>
    <li> The smell is exotic. It leaves a refreshing smell throughout my bathroom. It is also long lasting. I have been using these specific green bars for a while and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Best soap for oily skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I order it here. No residue, leaves your skin clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this soap  I use in combination with oil free moisturizer and have noticed amazing improvements in my skin.     They do not recommend using on the face but that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve done and do notice dryness so in winter, I may cut back to 1x a day using the soap instead of 2x a day as I&#x27;m using now.   I&#x27;m having such great results I hate to change what I&#x27;m doing.    Highly recommend to anyone who has trouble using cleaning products on an oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It is difficult to find and Amazon always seems to have it when the one store in town that carries it is out. Fresh, clean scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pears transparent soap for a number of years but wasn&#x27;t aware of the Oil-Clear soap until I saw it on another site and ordered it. When I ran low I started looking for more as that site didn&#x27;t have any more...I should have known I would find it at Amazon and for a much better price than I originally paid. It has a wonderful clean scent,lathers beautifully and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> Recently ran across this soap for the first time in South Africa.  Found it in the US on Amazon.  While some reviews are critical of the fragrance, I found I liked everything about it very much.  Perhaps personal preference.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Have been using it for years and it is great. Leaves no residue on your body and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This soap really does take away the oil from your face and body. I use it now just in the summer after I have been using sun tan lotion. It will dry you out otherwise. Some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the scent but I think it&#x27;s fine. The soap also lathers well and the color is really pretty, looks great in a soap dish.</li>
    <li> Feels more natural, less artificial then soaps monopolizing shelves of drugstores - i think it&#x27;s gentler on the skin and does not leave it dry</li>
    <li> This&#x27;new&#x27; Pears stinks. Smells like an old mans shaving cream or cologne. The amber colored Pears is what so many later skin soaps patterned theirs after...so why change the worlds best skin soap into a stinky old man thing? Hope I can find some of the &#x27;regular&#x27; somewhere,even if I have to order from England. This new stuff says hypoallergenic etc, so I was hoping I got some good stuff. Nope</li>
    <li> Cleans well. Keeps me from breaking out. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.. Just awesome.</li>
    <li> This may make your skin feel too dry if your skin is just a little oily, buy may be a really good product for super oily skin.</li>
    <li> Bought the soap for my mom.  She loves the product and could no longer find locally in the stores.  Now she has enough to last her a while.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is unpleasant and unfortunately lasts for a good long while.  Doesn&#x27;t rinse away clean, left a light film on my skin.  Did not break up the oil in my ears.  Turned my face red.  I was expecting this to be like Neutrogena, but it was more like Irish Spring.  Gross.</li>
    <li> Pears Oil-Clear Soap smells great, cleans your skin of excess oils without over-drying and smells great. I really love it!!</li>
    <li> If you want to use a soap that leaves no residue, this is it. You&#x27;ll never feel your skin so clean. Also hydrates the skin besides not drying it out.</li>
    <li> seems to last longer than glycerin soap with less residue in the tray</li>
    <li> I am using these pears soaps for almost more 25 years with various flavors. I like these green oil clears soaps very much.&lt;br /&gt;Pears Soap is especially made to take care of even sensitive and delicate skin, cleansing thoroughly, yet gently and rising clean.

    <li> my FAVORITE soap.. really gets your body &amp;#34;squeaky  clean&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have always loved Pears soap. It is supposed to have fewer chemicals and it&#x27;s easy on the skin. Good product.</li>
    <li> great hypoallergenic soap from one of the oldest soap companies on earth. pretty green smell and great for fickle/sensetive skin types.</li>
