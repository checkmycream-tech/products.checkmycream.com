### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best mints I&#x27;ve ever come across!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>Guess I best stick with what I know to be good.</li>
      <li>It is a great product but just needs a bit of expansion.</li>
      <li>Lol.</li>
      <li>These things are so amazing!</li>
      <li>Truly amazing.</li>
      <li>and I must say that they are effective.  </li>
      <li>but it is potent</li>
      <li>I found out about this product through the excellent Smallflower catalog, and it was definitely a \\&quot;Eureka!\\&quot; moment.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>might want to use more than one dot</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These things are so much more than just a breath mint.</li>
      <li>The combination of herbs is excellent; the only one I don&#x27;t recognize is saussurea root, so I will have to look that up in my &#x27;Cornucopia II&#x27; edible plants encyclopedia.</li>
      <li>Great service timely shipping and 800 silver pills at a good price.these tiny balls pack a punch of mouth freshness.</li>
      <li>The Japanese text says they are good for all sorts of stomach upsets, jet lag, even hangover!</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Altogether this is a fine product -- a bit pricy</li>
      <li>but I got them primarily for my &amp;#34;dragon breath&amp;#34;.)  </li>
      <li>I got these primarily to address my work environment, experimenting with what is available -- so far these are surprisingly effective.</li>
      <li>I ordered them out of curiosity and semi-desperation since TheraBreath (pretty much the most effective system that I&#x27;ve found, but I&#x27;ve got to use the mouthwash several times throughout the day) just isn&#x27;t doing the job these days.  </li>
      <li>For years I had been seeking a sugarless breath mint that had no artificial sweeteners -- and this is it.</li>
      <li>No artificial mentholated nonsense here.</li>
      <li>I took one (yes, just ONE, or, at the most, TWO) during one of these cough attacks and in 30 seconds my cough completely stopped.</li>
      <li>(thanks, Comtachi)!</li>
      <li>My father uses these for their more traditional use as a digestive aid.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t do that right away until you know how much you can</li>
      <li>The little snap-top cardboard boxes like Saila mints and Ricola Pearls use -- would be ideal, with a larger mint.</li>
      <li>Very chalky.</li>
      <li>And the flavor is indeed very herbaceous, but that&#x27;s what I like about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll even go as far as to say I prefer KAOL, because it doesn&#x27;t leave tiny dust crumbs like Sen-Sen did, and its packaging is far more durable while being similarly classy and timeless.</li>
      <li>Powerful tiny &amp;#34;breath mints&amp;#34</li>
      <li>and I must have been feeling rich on that day because I spent between $15 and $20 just out of curiosity.</li>
      <li>When you first open the cologne-like bottle, it reminds you a bit of a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>I bought this little magic bottle in December, 2014 and it, obviously, has taken me awhile to get around to writing this review.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these little, TINY gems.</li>
      <li>But each one really packs a big punch.</li>
      <li>I used to use Sen-Sen constantly, and I was really bummed when it was discontinued.</li>
      <li>Very small, but very powerful, all natural, no sugar or sugar substitutes!</li>
      <li>I also find that the taste expands to cool you, if you drink some water with it (but try not to swallow -- not easy!).</li>
      <li>These are dark licorice flavor, and if you don&#x27;t enjoy black licorice, you won&#x27;t like these.</li>

<li> They are licorice-y and somewhat bitter and are an acquired taste, no doubt.</li>

    <li> These things are so much more than just a breath mint. The Japanese text says they are good for all sorts of stomach upsets, jet lag, even hangover! They also recommend 3 - 5 little pills, no more than 10 times a day, And when used as directed, they really work. I suffer from indigestion that leads to esophageal spasms, and these little gems put a stop to it every time.</li>
    <li> Best mints I&#x27;ve ever come across! Very small, but very powerful, all natural, no sugar or sugar substitutes! A must try! Takes a few weeks to arrive from Japan.</li>
    <li> Yuk. Chew soap powder. It was terrible</li>
    <li> Great service timely shipping and 800 silver pills at a good price.these tiny balls pack a punch of mouth freshness. Same flavor as jintan pills.</li>
    <li> Tasted terrible and shipped from&lt;br /&gt;Japan so I imagine I paid a gazillion $</li>
    <li> I found out about this product through the excellent Smallflower catalog, and it was definitely a \\&quot;Eureka!\\&quot; moment. For years I had been seeking a sugarless breath mint that had no artificial sweeteners -- and this is it. Plus it took less than two weeks to come -- all the way from Japan (thanks, Comtachi)! When you first open the cologne-like bottle, it reminds you a bit of a dentist&#x27;s office. But don&#x27;t let that throw you off. It&#x27;s just the clove oil. The taste is a bit sterile (probably from the menthol) but it tends to grow on you. I also find that the taste expands to cool you, if you drink some water with it (but try not to swallow -- not easy!). I would also like to see this product packaged in a glass container or perhaps cardboard (and an expanded size to the mint). The little snap-top cardboard boxes like Saila mints and Ricola Pearls use -- would be ideal, with a larger mint. I&#x27;d also like to see an American importer pick up the ball on this one. It is a great product but just needs a bit of expansion. The combination of herbs is excellent; the only one I don&#x27;t recognize is saussurea root, so I will have to look that up in my &#x27;Cornucopia II&#x27; edible plants encyclopedia. Altogether this is a fine product -- a bit pricy but if you savor them, it should last quite a long time. So give bad breath the brush-off with KAOL -- it K.O.&#x27;s the competition!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the taste, something like black licorice.  Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I missed it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I used to use Sen-Sen constantly, and I was really bummed when it was discontinued. I&#x27;ve since tried just about every similar product on the market, and for my purposes, KAOL is the closest match. It&#x27;s certainly a very different flavor, but both have a similar pungent, herbal/earthy-toned licorice note. KAOL is also conveniently tiny like Sen-Sen, and it&#x27;s similarly sugar/sweetener-free. I&#x27;ll even go as far as to say I prefer KAOL, because it doesn&#x27;t leave tiny dust crumbs like Sen-Sen did, and its packaging is far more durable while being similarly classy and timeless.</li>
    <li> all as advertised; I&#x27;d buy again if the need came up</li>
    <li> These things are so amazing! One tiny little bead swirled around your mouth for a few minutes, and all sign of bad breath is completely gone. You just have to resist the urge to bite down on it. And the flavor is indeed very herbaceous, but that&#x27;s what I like about it. No artificial mentholated nonsense here.</li>
    <li> Love this product. .. was shipped on time. .. long time ago. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Powerful tiny &amp;#34;breath mints&amp;#34; (they&#x27;re supposed to aid in digestion and a few other items but I got them primarily for my &amp;#34;dragon breath&amp;#34;.)  Instructions are to take no more than 5 of the silver pellets (about the size of buckshot) each time for no more than 10 times per day.  I&#x27;m only using 2 or 3 twice or thrice per day and I must say that they are effective.  I ordered them out of curiosity and semi-desperation since TheraBreath (pretty much the most effective system that I&#x27;ve found, but I&#x27;ve got to use the mouthwash several times throughout the day) just isn&#x27;t doing the job these days.  I got these primarily to address my work environment, experimenting with what is available -- so far these are surprisingly effective.</li>
    <li> These are dark licorice flavor, and if you don&#x27;t enjoy black licorice, you won&#x27;t like these. They are also expensive.</li>
    <li> Very chalky. I wanted to try something different. Guess I best stick with what I know to be good. This was a waste of cash!</li>
    <li> This is even smaller than I thought. These little mint dots are bitter but they do work well. They don&#x27;t cause the bad breath plus minty smell that some mints do. It seems to deplete the actual bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to use more than one dot (they are so small!) but it is potent so don&#x27;t do that right away until you know how much you can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer sweeter mints, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this little magic bottle in December, 2014 and it, obviously, has taken me awhile to get around to writing this review. I LOVE these little, TINY gems. Not for obvious reasons, though. I stumbled on these accidentally on Amazon and I must have been feeling rich on that day because I spent between $15 and $20 just out of curiosity. Lol. They took FOREVER to arrive because they actually come from Japan which I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered. Each one is tiny. I mean REALLY, REALLY tiny. And the bottle is tiny. But each one really packs a big punch. The taste is not what Americans would probably find palatable. They are licorice-y and somewhat bitter and are an acquired taste, no doubt. However, I have acquired that taste over the last six months. Here is the THING, though. I have, totally accidentally, found out that Kaol completely stops a hacking cough dead in its tracks practically instantly. Truly amazing. I have a hacking cough off and on because of allergies to pollen etc. I took one (yes, just ONE, or, at the most, TWO) during one of these cough attacks and in 30 seconds my cough completely stopped. I have done this again and again and 100% of the time the cough is gone in seconds. Word of advice: Do Not Chew! Just let the tiny pearl dissolve in your mouth. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father. Arrived very quickly. My father uses these for their more traditional use as a digestive aid.</li>
