      <li>I cannot say enough good things.</li>
      <li>Seriously this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

      <li>I found that I need to blend the nude with the buff to get the right colour for my skin.</li>
      <li>Slightly darker than the picture indicates, good for if you have a tan.  </li>
      <li>First time use foundation to cover some sun spots.</li>

      <li>My skin is super sensitive and this works well.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really look like I put any foundation on my face.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t want to look too very light because my hair is naturally quite dark</li>
      <li>even though I have oily sensitive skin, this one doesn&#x27;t make my face as oily if you don&#x27;t use much concealer.</li>
      <li>only makeup I have found that stays on all day and looks fresh</li>
      <li>I cannot live withouth this product.</li>
      <li>The coverage of this makeup is just as good, lasts just as long, looks less dry and mask-like</li>
      <li>Only need to apply it once and it lasts the whole day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other foundations that wear off, smudge, and look dry and flaky!</li>
      <li>Color is very true to online picture, at least on my screen.</li>
      <li>I have lots of marks in my face and this foundation is the only one that can cover it all and last the whole day/night.</li>
      <li>This covers it easily, doesn&#x27;t have the typical icky foundation smell, is cheap, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>For years I was spending 50+ dollars for Double Wear and Clear Difference, traveling to the mall or ordering online...</li>
      <li>This makeup works just as well as Estee Lauder&#x27;s far more expensive makeup.</li>

    <li> Finally, after years of searching. I have found my perfect foundation,  I order this in shade 200. Color is very true to online picture, at least on my screen. I suffered an injury a few years back that has left me with very dark circles under both my eyes. This covers it easily, doesn&#x27;t have the typical icky foundation smell, is cheap, and lasts a long time. It gives an effortless no makeup look, doesn&#x27;t crease or clump on my face, and washes off easily. I cannot say enough good things. My recommendation is to stop reading reviews and give this a try now.</li>
    <li> This foundation has great full coverage without being cakey. I&#x27;ve tried many other foundations that wear off, smudge, and look dry and flaky! This is a perfect combo of moisterizing and covering imperfections, like acne, acne scarring and redness. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Only need to apply it once and it lasts the whole day. My friends notice how flawless and natural my skin looks. Full coverage yet not too cakey. Really satisfied with ColorStay. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this foundation from hereon.</li>
    <li> This product stinks like paint!</li>
    <li> Aside from the way it was packaged, it fits in well with my skin even though I have oily sensitive skin, this one doesn&#x27;t make my face as oily if you don&#x27;t use much concealer. I think the fact that makes this product okay is that it only covers a bit, doesn&#x27;t really look like I put any foundation on my face. Other than that, I would recommend it. Oh and for those who don&#x27;t like putting foundation as much, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> First time use foundation to cover some sun spots. The nude 200 is too dark&lt;br /&gt;for my somewhat light Asian skin.  Have to purchase a 150 buff, mix the two up&lt;br /&gt;to generate the matching color for my skin.</li>
    <li> The packaging said 2 and I only received one.  Slightly darker than the picture indicates, good for if you have a tan.  Best makeup ever though, stays on all day and really provides good coverage.</li>
    <li> Seriously this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve used many expensive brands but Revlon Color stay is the best! It&#x27;s light and lasts all day. I pair it with Maybelline&#x27;s dark circle concealer. I&#x27;ve never been a drug store band makeup user but I will be using this foundation for a long time!</li>
    <li> this is the only make jp I have found that does not melt off.  Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years and I still like it. I need a full coverage make-up and this one is perfect. I actually use two colors, Nude and Ivory.  I mix them about half and half and it seems to fit my natural skin color better. I&#x27;m pretty pale but I don&#x27;t want to look too very light because my hair is naturally quite dark and I feel it&#x27;s too great a contrast. The make-up goes on smooth and is easy to blend. I&#x27;ve been buying from Amazon because the prices are better.</li>
    <li> only makeup I have found that stays on all day and looks fresh</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage and staying power even in tropical climates but I find it hard to blend well.  I prefer the one for oily skin even though I dont think my skin is oily.  I found that I need to blend the nude with the buff to get the right colour for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tryed every base possable and for the price can&#x27;t be beat!I would recommend to everyone and is so lite and even coverage!</li>
    <li> This product is watered down.  It is not the same consistency as if you were to buy it in the store.  I think it has been tampered with and it made me break out! I would not trust this seller!</li>
    <li> Not only does this product cover flaws 100%, but it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or run.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and my makeup kit is never without it. Smooth, doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, and is well made.  My skin is super sensitive and this works well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used this products for 14 years ever since I was a singer and it is still my #1 foundation. I have lots of marks in my face and this foundation is the only one that can cover it all and last the whole day/night. I cannot live withouth this product. I recommend it 300% especially for night events and if you work as an artist on stage.</li>
    <li> The price of Estee Lauder Double Wear keeps going up, up, up.....I resent this ....some of us in this economy can&#x27;t keep paying more every time we go shopping. Because of this I revisited this brand that I used years ago.  I am glad I did and wonder why I ever strayed.  This makeup works just as well as Estee Lauder&#x27;s far more expensive makeup. The coverage of this makeup is just as good, lasts just as long, looks less dry and mask-like and my acne-prone skin is healthier. I can build with this makeup or even touch up, such as with sunglass marks (this CANNOT be done with Double Wear). Also, I can use this by itself, unlike Double Wear which absolutely will not go on right without the moisturizer underneath (more cost). One note, it is hard to cleanse off and you made need to try various face washes to get it thoroughly removed. I am currently using the Neutrogena line with good results.  For years I was spending 50+ dollars for Double Wear and Clear Difference, traveling to the mall or ordering online...when I could have just been shopping at Walmart and spending 13.00....never again. Big lesson learned, I am through over-spending on makeup and skin care products.</li>
    <li> This product is my go to foundation.  Goes on lightly with amazing coverage.  Finding it on Amazon is wonderful.</li>
