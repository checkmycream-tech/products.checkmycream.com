      <li>With my hair type, the more product the better!</li>
      <li>It has a very good amount of lather for a sulfate free shampoo (many of them do not lather at all), is easy to spread through my hair, and does not require scrubbing as if I&#x27;m cleaning my pots and pans to get my scalp</li>

      <li>She said it feels thicker and in better condition.  </li>
      <li>I love this company&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I have always been pleased with it, no dislikes here.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Soft shampoo which does not leave a heavy residue on my hair for once.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot, the cap on the container - not so much.  I wish it came in a pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I used to use tigi rockaholic shampoo, but when they quit making it, I couldn&#x27;t find another that i liked as well.  This one is even better.  A little pricey, but my hair looks the best it has in years.</li>
    <li> i have no problems with this order</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo of all time. The scent is devine -- and I mean OMG this shampoo smells soooo good! BUT scent is just not enough for the discerning consumer nowadays -- I needed it to WORK. It completely delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was clean and not stripped -- not tangly, straggly, or crunchy after the shampooing. I never use it on its own since I always use conditioner so I haven&#x27;t tried it by itself-- but as part of the duo its fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I shed more hair. That got me a little worried. I tried it again and have been using it for a while now and, after that initial shed, I have notice a dramatic decrease in my shedding! My hair is baby fine, very thin, and just below chin length. Overall my hair is normal with a tendency to an oily scalp. This shampoo does a phenomenal job on my hair! It has a very good amount of lather for a sulfate free shampoo (many of them do not lather at all), is easy to spread through my hair, and does not require scrubbing as if I&#x27;m cleaning my pots and pans to get my scalp clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few caveats for you: If your hair is very thick (my daughter) you will use a fair bit of this stuff to shampoo. Also if your hair is prone to tangling like crazy (my daughter again) this did not help that -- it didn&#x27;t make it worse but it didn&#x27;t make it better. I think this shampoo is best for fine hair that is thin to medium (not overly thick) that tends to be normal or perhaps normal to oily. My daughter (in addition to the above) has exceptionally dry hair and this is not a shampoo we&#x27;d use on her on a regular basis. She doesn&#x27;t have breakage or shedding issues either which this is designed to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product, along with the conditioner, is truly amazing for my hair. I was losing a clump of hair with every shampoo--plus pulling hairs off my shoulders all day. Now--the number of lost hairs is significantly diminished. This is the ONLY shampoo (and conditioner) that I will use.</li>
    <li> this stuff is AMAZING.... it smells sooooo good. i use the shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels so soft and manageable after using versus feeling dry and rough.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an excellent sulfate-free shampoo and hydrating conditioner for my long blonde hair (highlighted), since my hairdresser got a little carried away using Schwarzkopf&#x27;s BlondeMe bleach on my hair. What a nightmare! The BlondeMe bleach really destroys healthy hair quickly. I bought this Repairing shampoo and the accompanying conditioner from Carol&#x27;s Daughter last week, and have used it twice. The first problem is the obnoxious smell (smells like Glade bathroom freshener in a fake Hibiscus scent). Not only can I not stand the smell, but people I work with have commented on the overpowering stink. The real &amp;#34;outcomes&amp;#34; from using this shampoo are specific to the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that you will notice fuller hair and 98% less breakage after ONE USE. Not even close. Please do not waste your money on this product line (including the worthless Reparing conditioner). You&#x27;ll also be doing everyone with a nose a favor too.</li>
    <li> your hair will feel so refresh i have been using this product for over 4 years now.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is some of the best I have tried that was sulfate free. Smells amazing and makes my hair feel soft and silky! Love this and will definitely buy it again. Works great with the Monoi Conditioner!</li>
    <li> First off, the scent.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s excellent. The aroma is very light, kinda beachy sun screen like scent that I personally love. I Wish it came in a fabric softner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, what it does.&lt;br /&gt; Yes, it repairs the hell out of split ends and the condition of one&#x27;s hair. Many of my ends were sealed and smooth. my curls were a bit more defined and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third and Finally... the price.&lt;br /&gt; I cant complain here, really. Usually the decent shampoos are between 12-22 dollars so this didnt bother me at all. It works well with its counterpart [[ASIN:B004Y5NA1I Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner 8.4 oz]] but i havent gotten the chance to try the [[ASIN:B004YBC5K4 Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask 7 oz]], which I&#x27;ve received mixed reviews about.&lt;br /&gt;I am natural with 4a/4b hair which can be brittle and dry because of a past dye job. But this little gem does its job accordingly and I will be purchasing it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughters products and this is my go to shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old and color treat my hair every 2-3 months; mostly low lights and very few highlights. I have oily hair but summer and color processing left my hair stiff and with a great deal of breakage. I purchased this shampoo and the Monoi Repairing Condition hoping to restore shine and improve the condition of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost three months of use it has not improved the dullness of my hair and I continue to have breakage even after minimizing the use of my flat iron. It has helped a little with improving the elasticity of my hair. The only other product I have used on my hair after washing is a thermal protectant. I feel the shampoo and conditioner actually weigh my hair down too much. I feel the need to wash every day which only makes the scalp produce more oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product combination did not work well for me but may work better on normal/dry hair. I will use what is left but will not be purchasing replacement product. The scent is pleasant and it does a decent job of leaving wet hair manageable enough to comb out without too much pulling.</li>
    <li> I love this company&#x27;s shampoo. My hair is very thick and curly and this shampoo makes it extremely soft and easy to comb/brush out.</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews. For my hair it does a nice job, I have tight cork screw hair that is soft and it is hard getting the comb through it without damage.  I purchased the trial size which is a little costly, but I liked it enough to but the regular size. It works best with the conditioner</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this product because my sister said that she loves it. My sister has natural hair. My hair is relaxed. So I was unsure if this was the correct one to purchase, but it is. The bottle says reduces shedding by 95% on the first use. I still had a lot of shedding, but on my 3rd time using it I could see an improvement. My hair and scalp was hydrated and my shedding was reduced greatly. I only purchased the shampoo, but I&#x27;m going to purchase the conditioner as well. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I actually bought the whole set which I love, however, I was not too crazy about the shampoo.  I wished it left my hair a little softer.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with color treated, fine hair. This shampoo made my hair dry instantly. It turned my long hair into a tumble weed. I had to use my hair mask to undo what this shampoo did.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and I have tried many. Having relaxed hair is a downsize because you have to be careful of what products you use, but I can say that this product does work. I use the entire Monoi system.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after my stylist recommended this brand - had never heard of it and it was a bit pricey at the salon.  (I have waist length, fine hair and am using the Monio Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner, as well as the Split End serum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t blown away after the first wash, although I did immediately enjoy the scent.  The shampoo actually does a great job of lathering despite the lack of sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the third wash that did it.  I noticed my hair was shinier, softer to the touch, and got tangled less frequently.  (Pssst!  A dab will do ya with the serum; too much and your hair is weighed down - I have a lot of hair, and I use about a jelly bean size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommended it to my gal pals and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> The packaging came in good condition.I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it has an excellent reputation. I am looking forward to using it soon.</li>
    <li> Received samples in mail on this and decided to buy some.Works great on colored hair!Leaves it soft and manageable-love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the CD Monoi Shampoo &amp; Conditioner at the same time.  One or both immediately caused my scalp to itch to the point where I had to shampoo a few times with my previous shampoo to reduce the itching.  Also, my hair felt very dry afterward, and my comb didn&#x27;t go through my hair smoothly after conditioning.  &#x27;Back to WEN I go.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and this product so far is just ok in my opinion.Ive only used it twice so i dont know yet if its repaired my damaged ends but it doesnt make my hair feel soft after use.Kinda feels like I rinsed out a protein treatment.But the smell is awesome.Will continue to use but not sure if i would purchace again</li>
    <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner! The shampoo is creamy and does not strip my hair.  It leaves it smelling great and hydrated.  It works best with the Monoi conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years on my then relaxer hair and now on my natural hair and I have always been pleased with it, no dislikes here.</li>
    <li> My hair: fine, dry, dyed along with having PCOS which makes hair even worse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun and moon. Some were good results. Nothing like with Carols Daughter. I got it as a sample from Ulta and thought, ehh what the heck. The sample barely gave any product. With my hair type, the more product the better! I used the sample anyway. A little goes a very long way. I literally used about the size of a quarter of the sampoo and conditioner. They spread through out my hair and was enough. I have shoulder length hair so someone with long hair would need a bit more. The conditioner made my hair feel very silky and soft. Even my husband commented on how my hair felt. I know that seems like BS, but believe me my husband isn&#x27;t very observational when it comes to hair... or make up. Sometimes the man cant tell when im not wearing make up. -_- *sigh* When he can notice  a difference, theres an increadible difference. Lol&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, I know it sucks, but you get what you pay for with this product. I will never use another shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I wear human hair clip I  extentions. I used the mask on them. They were very soft and hydrated. They didnt matt up, which is the sign of dry extentions. I&#x27;ll continue to use the mask on the extentions and my own hair.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed a sample so bought full size.  Over softens and makes my fine hair more fly-away. Smells great.  Prefer WEN however....</li>
    <li> Loved this product. It is a repairing to unruly hair. My hair is thinning and less fall with this shampoo. Does not dry the scalp. Amazons price is better than most places. Arrived in a very timely manner. Nothing not to like about this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has very curly hair and she loves it, because it doesn&#x27;t dry her  hair and leaves it very soft. Also she likes the scent.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell and I wish it worked for me. The shampoo is thick and a little goes a long way...unfortunately the conditioner made my hair feel very dirty. It just doesn&#x27;t clean very well. It&#x27;s a shame because it smells so good (like coppertone to me). I do have fine hair so maybe just not good for fine straight hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I was introduced to it by a hair dresser in Pittsburgh. I have tried so many other shampoos and none of them made my hair feel so smooth and clean. It smells awesome as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It stopped my fallout and breakage COLD with the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Sulfate free. Sodium chloride free. 92% - 96% less breakage in 1 use. No petroleum or mineral oil. There, 5 reasons it got a 5 star rating and the 5 reasons its an HG shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Sulfate-Free Shampoo is the best shampoo EVER! It not only smells amazing but is sulfate free with all the other great benefits of this product. I love love love this shampoo and will definitely try other Carol&#x27;s Daughters products. It is worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo!  It cleaned my hair and it felt moisturizing, fresh, and  soft while I was shampooing. It never did feel tight or dried out.  I was amazed that I had less breakage. I have relaxed hair and I had quite a bit or new growth when I shampooed, but it did not break as much as  it usually does when I wash it with other shampoos.  My hair is curly and it tangles easily but, my hair did not get that tangled when I used this shampoo.  The smell is nice, but I did have to use quite a bit of the shampoo. The bottle is kind of small.  I wish the shampoo came in a bigger bottle. I used the conditioner and it detangled my hair just fine.  My hair dried soft.  I did have some frizz, but I air dried my hair.  Overall this is a good shampoo to use!</li>
    <li> I have never used Carol&#x27;s Daughter before and I purchased this on a different site. Used this product first time today I have to say it made my hair soft and bouncy. I have thin, fine wavy curly hair. I use it with the Monoi Anti-Breakage Spray............love it. My hair just feels healthier. I have found my new shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Nothing else works like it for my wife&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look AMAZING! With nothing but this and the conditioner. Wouldn&#x27;t have believed just a shampoo/conditioner could do this much to make my hair look good. It makes my hair look like it had a salon blowout without even trying</li>
    <li> I color my naturally curly, frizzy hair and was hoping this would be my miracle product. It&#x27;s a nice shampoo but no miracle here.</li>
    <li> I have been using items from Carol&#x27;s Daughter for the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is (typical) Irish red, with a little gray, and this shampoo works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job cleaning hair, removes all frizz, and prevents hair from getting cloggd in drains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be purchased on the Web, but not at this price and with free shipping. I urge you to give it a try. You will be very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my very favourite and i highly recommend buying it from seller at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% black with thick and curly soft 3c/4a natural hair, and this shampoo is the worst sulfate- free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! The smell is amazing but it left my hair feeling so dry, brittle and stiff. It left a residue feeling after washing it out and although the bottle says detangling, I suggest no one ever think about detangling with this stuff. It would be impossible.  My hair was tangled and finger combing was out of the question. It lathers up and it is very stripping. But if you must try this, I would recommend using a little shampoo and A LOT and I mean A LOT of the monoi conditioner, to bring back everything the shampoo took away.    I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used. Brought life back to my hair and it smells wonderful. Would recommend to every one.</li>
    <li> Excellent for your hair.</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s word.  love it!</li>
    <li> I really hate to give this shampoo a bad review as I can see others had a good experience with it but it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.  I have long, fine, blond, color processed hair and this shampoo makes my scalp feel oily and my hair flat no matter how much I try to rinse it out.  The bottom of my hair does really well with it but I can&#x27;t put it on my scalp.  I tried it over and over again hoping for different results but it disappoints every time.  I also feel like it leaves my hair really dangled and I have to use a strong spray in detangler to comb it out.  I hate to throw the bottle away so I will be using the shampoo on my ends only and something else on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have fine, limp, fragile hair that is color treated. My scalp/roots are oily, while my ends are dry like straw. And I have a major problem with hair fall. This lathers better than any other sulfate free shampoo I have tried. I don&#x27;t feel like it gets my scalp and roots 100% clean, but again, its an improvement over other sulfate free shampoos I have tried. I absolutely cannot skip a day without my roots becoming a greasy mess, but my ends seem softer and less straw-like with this shampoo. I don&#x27;t know about the claims of reduction in hair fall. I can&#x27;t say for sure I&#x27;m seeing less hair in my comb or shower drain. I really like the scent. The price is a little steep.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry or damage your hair. Smells divine!</li>
    <li> I have fine, highlighted, blonde hair. I&#x27;m forever looking for the right products to keep it shiny and moisturized that do not make it limp and greasy looking. It seemed like no matter what I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to turn out smooth and shiny after blow drying. Regardless of what leave-in conditioners/serums/prep sprays/etc I used, my hair always had a wispy, cotton-candy look when dry, and the ends always felt rough.  I have tried many top rated salon/sephora lines, not cheap drugstore stuff, and nothing has given me results like the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi shampoo and conditioner. From the very FIRST time I used them, my hair blew out to soft, shiny blonde. No more cotton candy. I use the mask every ten days or so, and use the shampoo and conditioner daily. Amazing. I know this sounds like a fake review, but it&#x27;s not!! :))</li>
    <li> I used this product twice and I love it. I immediately notice the difference after the 1st uses.. My hair was soft,manageable and very little breakage. It smells good too. I recommend this product to anyone with over processed damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Product was what we expected. Wife use it every day. I have started to sneak and use it on my hair as well. We would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length wavy-to-curly hair, and with hair this long breakage is an inevitable problem.  Anything that can help strengthen my hair is worth trying!  I was really pleased with Carol’s Daughter Monoi Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a pleasant fragrance that seemed a bit strong when I first opened the bottle, but it was hardly noticeable after my shower.  It left my hair feeling clean, even though it doesn’t lather much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was combing my hair after the shower, I was pleased by how soft and silky my hair felt.  As it air-dried, I was pleased to see that my hair wasn’t frizzing nearly as much as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve already added the shampoo and its matching conditioner to my shopping cart, to be purchased when my current supply runs out.  Carol’s Daughter Monoi Shampoo is the real deal!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!  Can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
    <li> works excellent the first 2 washes in a row...then gotta use a different product or hair will TANGLE</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have thin hair.  After using this shampoo for about 3 weeks my hairdresser asked me what I have done to my hair!  She said it feels thicker and in better condition.  I told her about Carol&#x27;s Daughter shampoo and she said she wants to buy some!  Now every time I go the beauty shop she still comments on how much my hair has improved.  I see an improvement also, softer and feels thicker.</li>
    <li> Smells good make a lot of lather with one drop</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. Save your money</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are both amazing.  My hair has never been this shiny and silky!  I get more compliments on my hair when I use these 2 together</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for 2 years. You can see the different on your hair the same day you first use it.  My hair was breaking a lot do to over processing and as soon as i started to use this shampoo and conditioner as well my hair brakeage was reduce abut 80% . I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Got it for my ex, she loves it</li>
    <li> This particular shampoo is very good. It doesn&#x27;t strip the hair or leave a film. Diffenently lived up to its potential less breakage was true.  Also leaves a wonderful fresh smell to the hair.</li>
    <li> once again thanx Lisa Price for a great product again 98% correction u wont b sorry works on any type of hair. treat yourself to something good instead that stuff u buy at the drug store</li>
    <li> I found the shampoo drying. My hair breaks constantly and I&#x27;ve tried many things including that monoi conditioning cream. Neither product worked for for me. I had hoped for more. Not everything works for everybody. I do like the cowash as a basic cleansers.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely horrible. I cannot believe that Carols Daughter has the audacity to charge so much for a trash product. I was interested in the product because I am transitioning for chemically relaxed hair to natural. This product completely dried out my hair. I actually ran to to store to purchase ORS replenishing conditioner because the Monoi Shampoo and Conditioner completely messed up my hair. If I could give the product ZERO stars, I would. Keep Carols Daughter away from me! Don&#x27;t believe the hype!</li>
    <li> This is more expensive than the shampoos I usually use, but I&#x27;d heard good things about it. Turns out, I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that the consistency is very nice. It was thick, but not too thick -- I could still spread it around and work it through my roots easily. Plus, it lathers wonderfully for something sulfate-free. So if you&#x27;ve wanted to use a sulfate-free shampoo but were worried about poor lathering, worry no more -- this could be just what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this does a good job of getting my hair clean. I love that it&#x27;s free of a lot of harmful ingredients and that it&#x27;s safe for color-treated hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, and my color has not faded. My hair is actually quite shiny and soft, even though I shampoo every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to describe the scent, although I find it pleasant. There&#x27;s a hint of coconut to it, a small hint of floral something or other, and a little bit of a powdery scent. It&#x27;s a pretty strong scent, though, so if you can sniff some of this in a store before purchase, that might be a good idea -- because it stays with you, so it&#x27;s best if you like it!</li>
    <li> For fine hair, it really weighs it down, my boyfriend on the other hand has a mop of curls and he thinks this product is awesome.</li>
    <li> Lots of lather, smells nice, cleans hair and washes out without leaving hair and scalp feeling dry, brittle and stripped of all it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, salt &amp; pepper Caucasian hair. Due to aging, medications and hormone changes, my hair now is not the lucious hair of my youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Carol&#x27;s Daughters&#x27; Monoi shampoo and Monoi Repairing Hair Mask for a year now. Since I am impatient, I use the mask without a plastic cap, for only about 10 minutes in the hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe how easy comb-out is. Dried hair (air dry or blow dry) is silky, soft, shiny, and no frizz, even in high humidity. What more could you want? I&#x27;m not crazy for the scent, but it&#x27;s grown on me. Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helped with breakage - that&#x27;s ONE problem I don&#x27;t have. Give it a try - maybe you&#x27;ll like it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT SMELLS VERY GOOD AND IT ALSO WORKS VERY WELL AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN IT&#x27;S MANAGEABILITY.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for curly hair.  It activates quickly. It smells good and  cleans the hair pretty good.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Most shampoos seem the same to me regardless of price, but this stuff is worth every penny. It&#x27;s refreshing, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, smells heavenly, and does everything it promises to in terms of reducing breakage and strengthening hair&#x27;s overall condition. It&#x27;s a few bucks cheaper if you buy this at Sephora, FYI.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo a few weeks ago. The first time I used this product, I noticed it lathered very well. After the rinse,&lt;br /&gt;there was hair breakage on my wide tooth comb. I became nervous, and used the moni hair mask following&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo rinse. The mask worked very well. Detangled nicely and no hair on the comb. Smells great. I love the&lt;br /&gt;shampoo so well that I use it as a body wash. Will be buying the shampoo again as a body wash.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of this product. I have thick/relaxed hair and it leaves my hair soft and silky. Would highly recommend. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I will say the same for the shampoo as I stated for the conditioner. I love this product. It does what it states. It has stopped the breakage and my hair has started growing back, and it&#x27;s a lot stronger and healthier. I would recommend this product for anyone who&#x27;s having hair issues, or health issues. Sometimes health issues can be the major cause of hair loss.</li>
    <li> Good product, use only when needed, but appears to help my hair when I need that extra conditioning</li>
    <li> I love the way it works with my very stubborn hair. The smell is awesome too. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write a review unless I&#x27;m blown away or very disappointed.  Well, you can guess where this is going.  I bought these products, shampoo, conditioner &amp; hair mask (as recommended), because the claims, verbally and on the bottles, are that they reduce hair breakage / hair falling off your head by 92 or 96 percent (depending on which product you&#x27;re looking at).  I used all three products. I saw a very, very minimal difference.  Simply put, the hair is still falling off my head, just a little bit slower.  I went from Very Excited when ordering, to Very Disappointed after using these products.    Worst of all, your eyes may hurt / burn when you use this stuff.  And we know that&#x27;s not good.  I don&#x27;t know if it was 1, 2 or all 3 of these products that did that.  The way I figure it, if a product burns your eyes, it&#x27;s not worth using.  I had a problem of frequent burning of the eyes when using this product.  If I have to be super, super careful to not get it in my eyes, then it&#x27;s not worth the hassle because I&#x27;m discovering that hair fall-out is natural to some degree.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Does a good job of cleaning my hair but DO NOT get it in your eyes. I promise you will regret it. It burns very badly.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied....probably not the best product for all hair types.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is amazing.  i noticed so much less hair in the drain while using it and it smells so good.  it really is a quality, therapeutic shampoo and my daughter likes it, too.</li>
    <li> this product smells great and works great. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and I enjoy it. thanks.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and this product does a good job cleaning my hair without totally drying it out.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I am almost finished with the shampoo and conditioner after almost 1 month of using it. I am in mid-40&#x27;s, with fine hair which tends to get frizzy susceptible to humidity.  I long for long hair like when I was in my 30&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve even started taken a Biotin supplement along with this shampoo &amp; conditioner line with hopes of seeing some improvement (especially after my hair stylists chopped off more length than I asked for about a month ago!  UGH but I guess she had a right to cut a lot off as my ends were tattered from breakage).  So, I thought I&#x27;d see what I could do about it by buying this line (and the supplements).  First, the packaging was disappointing and difficult to open, I was frustrated.  Second, I noticed the smell, its not bad or terrible, just not my favorite I noticed it had a bit of a coconut scent and I&#x27;m not into coconut scented anything it smells like a sunscreen a little bit, not the way I want my hair to smell.  Then, the first two times I used it I noticed a couple of hair strands came out right before I was about to style my hair.  I blew dried my hair (it has been a heat wave on the East Coast, high humidity, but my house is air conditioned) and I couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair started to frizz underneath before I even walked out the door, another disappointment.  After continually using it and giving it a chance, I noticed less breakage (unlike the first couple of times I used it) but it isn&#x27;t a good shampoo line for my easily humid prone hair, whereas there are other shampoos on the market that have done better in keeping the frizz at a minimum.  I wanted to like this shampoo but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m giving it another chance.  Also, I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I had thought it would be after using it.  I will go back to Kerastase (which is very expensive and I&#x27;m not sure I just spelled it correctly), or Aveeda products.</li>
    <li> This product smells great.  that&#x27;s about it.  I have seen more breakage since using this shampoo then ever before.  Not worth the money</li>
    <li> The smell is to die for and it makes your hair feel great. My hair has grown with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, too.</li>
    <li> To start with, I am caucasian with colored,oily,long, wavy/curly hair and have been searching for a great shampoo and conditioner for 3 years.  I moved to Florida where the water is very hard and after a year of living there my hair was fried.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong until I went to my friend google and discovered it was the water.  I rented a water softener and have been searching ever since for a way to fix my damaged hair.  It was so bad, I couldn&#x27;t brush it, wet or dry, full of conditioner, it was frizzy and nasty.  I wanted to chop it all off.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners since then, and have been somewhat happy with the results.  I am also trying to get to the point where I wash my hair every other day, but it is quite oily and generally looks very dirty on the second day.  I have since moved again, and now lack a water softener and again have hard water.  I found Aphogee Keratin 2 minute reconstructor and have been using it once a week for several months with great results.  It gets rid of the heavy metals that collect in my hair.  But I still needed to repair the damaged hair, the Aphogee removes metals and prevents decline, but couldn&#x27;t do enough to improve my hair.  Recently I bought the Monoi Repairing 3-peice starter kit which contains the Repairing Sulfate Free Shampoo, the Repairing Conditioner and the Repairing Hair Mask.  I used it for over a week, about 5 applications.  I loved the smell of it, I had noticeable bounce, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the conditioner.  I have long curly hair, and I just couldn&#x27;t get a brush through it after I used it.  I was afraid I was breaking more hair off with the brush and so I gave it all to my neighbor and moved on to my next shampoo/conditioner.  After a week of not using the Carol&#x27;s Daughter however, I noticed a decline.  Hmm.  Maybe it was working, I just needed a different conditioner. Conditioners are my biggest problem, either it is slick and I can brush it, then it is heavy and weighed down or it rinses out completely and I&#x27;m stuck with a tangled mess.  So I bought the full bottle of the Repairing Sulfate Free Shampoo and the Rosemary Mint Clarifying Conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now.  The results are amazing!!!  I can easily go two days without washing my hair.  The Rosemary conditioner feels so good, it&#x27;s kinda tingly and the smell is amazing!!  I still use the Aphogee and I use the mask (I kept that, didn&#x27;t give it to my neighbor) once a week but a different day than the Aphogee.  My hair looks like those Pantene commercials, like one of those women who you don&#x27;t think really exist.  My three  year old is petting my hair.  My hair dresser (got it colored last week) even commented how much softer it is.  My hair has never looked this good, never in my life.  I have wanted this hair, but never thought I could have these results, especially this quickly!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how it is after 6 months of using these products.  I am thrilled with these products, and hope you have the same results!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgive me, but I plan to copy and paste this review onto the other Carol&#x27;s Daughter products mentioned in this review :)</li>
