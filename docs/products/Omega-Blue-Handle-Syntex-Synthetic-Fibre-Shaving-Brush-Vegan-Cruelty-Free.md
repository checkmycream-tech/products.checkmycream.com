### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome brush.  </li>
      <li>Now the phrase is: The best thing since synthetic fiber shaving brushes.</li>
      <li>Spend a couple bucks more, trust me you will be happy you did!!!</li>
      <li>Builds a good lather</li>
      <li>That is a good thing.</li>
      <li>Others mentioned it makes a good travel brush.  </li>
      <li>Ordered this as I was looking for a good quality, yet affordable shaving brush.</li>
      <li>However, I was impressed at amount of good lather and it felt good on my normally sensitive face.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best shaving brush I ever had.</li>
      <li>Its really nice</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and it whips up a nice lather.</li>
      <li>It arrived in good order on schedule, nicely boxed, safe and sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handling is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>In retrospect, the Tweezerman seemed to put the cream on top whereas the Omega allows the cream to get under and all around the hair.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t take any more effort than the badger/boar brush I have been using to load up with soap.</li>
      <li>I like this brush better.  </li>
      <li>OK, no badger brush but much better price</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want the smell of animal hair brushes, so I went with this and am glad I did...</li>
      <li>It also holds a lot more water than my cheapo badger brush.  </li>
      <li>In this case it was better to get the lowest price and just pay for the shipping.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my upgrade.</li>
      <li>IS a good quality brush that I would recommend (not knowing any other synthetic) to anyone looking for a good brush and good price</li>
      <li>The true badger hair brushes hold the water and soap 100x better!</li>
      <li>Bristles doesnt fall out and works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Pretty good brush.</li>
      <li>Best brush ever it doesnt loose its Bristles</li>
      <li>Very easy lather, its a short brush but works great</li>
      <li>I chose this brush based on the recommendation of thesweethome.com, and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>Once I understood these differences it worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>It works fine for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very pretty :)</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit my stand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty frugal / cheap / parsimonious / penny-pinching and would never spend $80 bucks on a genuine top of the line badger brush.  </li>
      <li>As my first synthetic, i don&#x27;t think i could&#x27;ve done better for price, usability, and quality.</li>
      <li>My shave was warm, soft and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>The brush&#x27;s fibers are soft yet a bit more rigid allowing better foaming and distribution of the shave cream.  </li>
      <li>Overall - a good purchase.</li>
      <li>good occasional or travel shave brush.</li>
      <li>handle gives an adequate grip for the fingertips.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am satisfied so far after one use.  </li>
      <li>I actually like this cheap synthetic brush more than my badger and boar brushes.  </li>
      <li>Great value for money shave brush, bristles are a little too soft when wet, but seems to produce a great lather.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is nice to just wet and go and does seem to build a good lather with my DE Harris hard soap and my WSP soaps but is less effective with my creams (still a good lather just not as much as I expect from my creams).  </li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t very impressed because it has about half the bristles of my other cheap brush.  </li>
      <li>I also think it takes a bit more wrist action on the face to get up a good lather, but that can vary a little anyway depending on how much water I put in the cup.  </li>
      <li>, overall it is MUCH better than the entry level badger brush I had before.  </li>
      <li>Pretty amazed with this brush after first use.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean after using and will dry fast.</li>
      <li>Not as soft as badger, though I think more durable and far cheaper.</li>
      <li>This brush is extremely small, does not work up a good lather, and when you try to brush it onto your face the soap and water come out of it and go all over the damn place.</li>
      <li>After use I gently squeeze the soap out of the brush back into the cup before rinsing it free of soap.  </li>
      <li>After it solidifies it works much like a cake of shaving</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, sterilized (according to the box) and ready to use.  </li>
      <li>For a price like this, you really shouldn&#x27;t be complaining.</li>
      <li>I have a cheap Badger hair brush and wanted to try something different.</li>
      <li>The fibers do have a much rougher feel between the fingers.  </li>
      <li>It is a decent product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works up a decent lather.</li>
      <li>It does dry faster and is much easier to clean and maintain than my silvertip though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good enough and looks like it should last a long time.  </li>
      <li>The Omega blue is definitely small for travel but more than adequate.</li>
      <li>It seems to dry quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve used so nothing to compare it with, but this seems to be holding up well after several shaves.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a very old natural fur shaving brush (an Ever-Ready 102) that I found in the medicine cabinet of an old house built in 1910 (my grams old place).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m think it must be around 50 years old.  </li>
      <li>I like the small size of it, and the bristles are very soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Looking for a travel brush that would dry quickly and could be cleaned if necessary.</li>
      <li>It cleaned up quickly and a few shakes</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this brush, but it was much too stiff and two dimensional.  </li>
      <li>The only issue I have is that the brush itself doesn&#x27;t seem to hold or fill up with lather as much as a natural hair brush.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely stiffer than the natural brush both in the bowl and on my face.  </li>
      <li>first impression was that it was a bit smaller than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really pay attention to much to the negative feedback below me.</li>
      <li>no loose bristles after numerous shaves and has held up.</li>
      <li>The brush tends to be very &amp;#34;stuck together&amp;#34; which means it covers less surface area on your face with each stroke.</li>

    <li> It works. But my experience has been that the bristles definitely do not ever look as voluminous as the picture. The brush tends to be very &amp;#34;stuck together&amp;#34; which means it covers less surface area on your face with each stroke.</li>
    <li> I like that it is a synthetic brush and no badgers were harmed, but I&#x27;m not too fond of the lather I get with this brush. I use Proraso cream out of the tube, and instead of a thick, rich lather that I used to get with my previous brush (horse hair), this tends to whip it up with a froth like effect. I&#x27;ll try and add a photo so that users can see what I mean.</li>
    <li> Very easy lather, its a short brush but works great</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve used so nothing to compare it with, but this seems to be holding up well after several shaves.</li>
    <li> Pretty amazed with this brush after first use. It lathered up my arko pressed into a mug in no time. Easy to clean after using and will dry fast. It&#x27;s a keeper in my book!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a very old natural fur shaving brush (an Ever-Ready 102) that I found in the medicine cabinet of an old house built in 1910 (my grams old place).  I&#x27;m think it must be around 50 years old.  A little balding, but it works well.  That was my introduction to shaving brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try an inexpensive synthetic brush and this was my choice.  In this case it was better to get the lowest price and just pay for the shipping.  It was cheaper than the amazon so-called \\&quot;free\\&quot; shipping version.  It arrived in good order on schedule, nicely boxed, safe and sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that it was a bit smaller than I expected.  It is lightweight, sterilized (according to the box) and ready to use.  I took it home and soaked it in water, then tried working up some lather.  I use a low, over-sized 10 ounce coffee cup that lost it&#x27;s saucer for a shaving bowl and neutrogena glycerine soap which I melt in the microwave to fuse it in place. After it solidifies it works much like a cake of shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle gives an adequate grip for the fingertips.  It didn&#x27;t take any more effort than the badger/boar brush I have been using to load up with soap. It is definitely stiffer than the natural brush both in the bowl and on my face.  It lacks the luxurious silky feel of dead wet animal fur sliding across your map. I also think it takes a bit more wrist action on the face to get up a good lather, but that can vary a little anyway depending on how much water I put in the cup.  After use I gently squeeze the soap out of the brush back into the cup before rinsing it free of soap.  The fibers do have a much rougher feel between the fingers.  It seems to dry quickly.  It is a decent product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied so far after one use.  It&#x27;s good enough and looks like it should last a long time.  I&#x27;m pretty frugal / cheap / parsimonious / penny-pinching and would never spend $80 bucks on a genuine top of the line badger brush.  Plus, I think badger fur should be left on the badger where it belongs.  Someone should come up with a nutria brush and get those things out of the wildlife sanctuaries around here.</li>
    <li> I actually like this cheap synthetic brush more than my badger and boar brushes.  It doesn&#x27;t shed and it whips up a nice lather.</li>
    <li> As my first synthetic, i don&#x27;t think i could&#x27;ve done better for price, usability, and quality.</li>
    <li> I am trying to switch from disposable razors to a replaceable double-edged blade.  I chose this brush based on the recommendation of thesweethome.com, and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Pretty good brush. Not as soft as badger, though I think more durable and far cheaper.</li>
    <li> The handling is very comfortable. I wouldn&#x27;t really pay attention to much to the negative feedback below me. For a price like this, you really shouldn&#x27;t be complaining. It works fine for me.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as I was looking for a good quality, yet affordable shaving brush. Didn&#x27;t want the smell of animal hair brushes, so I went with this and am glad I did...no loose bristles after numerous shaves and has held up. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> When my Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush with 100% Badger hair bristles fell apart after a year I purchased this brush.  I like this brush better.  The brush&#x27;s fibers are soft yet a bit more rigid allowing better foaming and distribution of the shave cream.  In retrospect, the Tweezerman seemed to put the cream on top whereas the Omega allows the cream to get under and all around the hair.  I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my upgrade.</li>
    <li> This is my go to travel brush and I travel a lot. It doesn&#x27;t quite perform as well as my silvertip but it cost less than $30; I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to perform that well. It does dry faster and is much easier to clean and maintain than my silvertip though.</li>
    <li> Looking for a travel brush that would dry quickly and could be cleaned if necessary. The Omega blue is definitely small for travel but more than adequate. The bristles feel a bit stiff dry, but I soaked them prior to lathering. As others have noted, the bristles then get a bit &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34;. However, I was impressed at amount of good lather and it felt good on my normally sensitive face. It cleaned up quickly and a few shakes and it was nearly dry for travel. Overall - a good purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t very impressed because it has about half the bristles of my other cheap brush.  It also holds a lot more water than my cheapo badger brush.  Once I understood these differences it worked just fine.  After a few months of use no bristles have fallen out; the main reason I bought this brush.  Others mentioned it makes a good travel brush.  I would agree.  No worries if you forget to bring it home.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush.  I like the small size of it, and the bristles are very soft and smooth.  Builds a good lather, overall it is MUCH better than the entry level badger brush I had before.  It&#x27;s also very pretty :)</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this brush, but it was much too stiff and two dimensional.  I went back to my badger brushes.</li>
    <li> Im not sure what a synthetic brush is supposed to be like, but I would think this brush has it.  The bristles are very soft to the touch and have a little bit of backbone.  While the brush does flex I find it difficult to get it to spread/fan out like my badger brush.  It is nice to just wet and go and does seem to build a good lather with my DE Harris hard soap and my WSP soaps but is less effective with my creams (still a good lather just not as much as I expect from my creams).  The only issue I have is that the brush itself doesn&#x27;t seem to hold or fill up with lather as much as a natural hair brush.  Perhaps a little break-in with change that.&lt;br /&gt;This IS a good quality brush that I would recommend (not knowing any other synthetic) to anyone looking for a good brush and good price</li>
    <li> Hey,,,,what is one to say. It is a shaving brush. BUT....no animals suffered to make it. That is a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best shaving brush I ever had. Unlike those smelly boar hair shaving brushes, this nylon brush has no odor. It also retains water and soap just like conventional brushes. My shave was warm, soft and comfortable.  My only disappointment was that the pretty blue handle does not light up. Still, I gave this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great value for money shave brush, bristles are a little too soft when wet, but seems to produce a great lather.&lt;br /&gt;A good occasional or travel shave brush.</li>
    <li> I have a cheap Badger hair brush and wanted to try something different. Just opened it up and tried to whip up a lather with Paraso Red. This brush is extremely small, does not work up a good lather, and when you try to brush it onto your face the soap and water come out of it and go all over the damn place. My method was no different than with a badger brush but the results where dramatically different. Spend a couple bucks more, trust me you will be happy you did!!! The true badger hair brushes hold the water and soap 100x better!</li>
    <li> Now the phrase is: The best thing since synthetic fiber shaving brushes. No more shedding like my cat just brushed across my face.</li>
    <li> Bristles are a little short and stiff, but it does the job. Works up a decent lather. Inexpensive is the key for this brush.</li>
    <li> Bristles doesnt fall out and works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever it doesnt loose its Bristles</li>
    <li> Its really nice but it doesn&#x27;t fit my stand.</li>
    <li> OK, no badger brush but much better price</li>
