<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the smell like jasmin I like it .. it&#x27;s work for me, I saw a good result with in two weeks, twice a day after shower</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for the past few year&#x27;s now. I love it. Inner thighs and armpits. Now those area&#x27;s are nice and even. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> bought 3pcs, now use only 2 weeks  twice a day ,still not feel any different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smell good , will keep using until finsh...</li>
    <li> So I bought this for my sister because she is light skin but her underarms and elboxa are darker than the rest of her body and it has worked after she has been using it for 3-4 weeks, we noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.it really whitens d discoloured area of skin.although, i think u have to continously apply it even once or every other day when the desired effect has been obtained.which is a problem to me bcoz its not available here in uk.tje shipping frm america to uk is almost d same price as d item</li>
    <li> I started in my arm pits and started seeing a major change in 3days. My pits were bad since I&#x27;m a light skinned african american, deodorant turned them really dark. I used it every night after a shower and was satisfied after about a month. Now I have my boy friend using it on is face bc where he shaves (beard area) is darker then the rest of his face and he was satisfied after 2 uses. So it depends on your skin type on how long it will take I guess. Best results happen if u use right after shaving.</li>
    <li> I have dark underarms and YES IT WORKS. To be honest, I kind of lost hope in it working at one point. Since I already bought three, I decided to not waste it and use it as deodorant (works fabulously. I don&#x27;t smell of sweat all day!) So since it is winter and I stopped wearing tank tops, I let my underarm hair grow, and THAT IS HOW IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;If you are constantly shaving your underarms, it will not work. However, if you leave your hair, IT&#x27;LL WORK. MY ARMPITS WERE THE SAME COLOR AS MY SKIN. FINALLY. I don&#x27;t know if it will stop working once I shave again, but I hope it&#x27;ll stay clear!</li>
    <li> I love it it really  works fast shipping will order more soon!!</li>
    <li> My Daughter and I purchased this gel to help lighten our knee caps within a few weeks our knees were peeling like snakes skin. Knees are still the same color trying to treat the xtreme peeling!! Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Jus keep using</li>
    <li> I lovvvvve ittttt ....the smeeeeeel</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 4 years and have always had great results-even toned skin. However, my last purchase left me HIGHLY disappointed because the cream not only made my face peel, but it also DRIED out my skin! I have embarrassing white dead skin all over my face for a month now.</li>
    <li> You have to be patient with this to show results. It took me some time to show results, buts it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> Havent decided what i wanna say bout this product because ive been using it for two weeks and i havent seen much change. So im sure gonna have to get bakk on this. I recieved it in three days tho. So no complains  bout the delivery</li>
    <li> Good value compared to other sellers but I really haven&#x27;t seen any improvements or that &amp;#34;ahhh its working&amp;#34; if it worked it was very slightly and and went back to same color. So just wasted money on the product</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it was suppose to do. Great results! I recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s suffering from blemishes.</li>
    <li> I began using the product on my dark spots on my arms and I could see the difference by the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost done with the tube and I think I will have to purchase again to obtain the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good product!</li>
    <li> Doe not work at all. Complete waste of money</li>
    <li> It works, but slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has mostly natural ingredients instead of being full of chemicals. I&#x27;ve used it once a day, about 5 days a week for 2 months. I have experience no burning or problems using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time ordering and I am on the second tube (the 1st tube of the 3 from this order). I will probably need to use it for 1 more month for the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars but I wish it would have worked faster.</li>
    <li> This was helpful where I had dark spots but I stopped using it. My dark spots did clear but not that much. Then again, I wasn&#x27;t applying this religiously. I was seeing results after a week of using this though! It really does work. I just can&#x27;t give 5 stars because the results I was anticipating, even though I didn&#x27;t apply it religiously, wasn&#x27;t met.</li>
    <li> Causes your skin to get light then within two weeks your skin gets darker than it was before you used the product</li>
    <li> Well not only did this BURN my skin, it also left the surrounding area of where I applied DARK AS HECK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it hasn&#x27;t cleared up in 2 weeks I&#x27;m going to have to see a doctor. Plus fun fact, this product is made out of hydroquinone, a derivative of benzene, AKA a carcinogenic, toxic, mutagen (causes mutations like cancer) and clastogen (kills chromosomes and causes cancer).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 5 months its amazing. Use it only on the area you need to clear up as it is very powerful but it does indeed work. I use it faithully twice a day every day under my arms and they are now so smooth and even with the rest of my skin. I am continuing to use it now just as maintence and I have stopped using deodrant altogther (which is the cause of my hyper-pigmentation I believe) there&#x27;s no need for any deoderant....simply put a small amount under your arms after the shower and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased Xtreme Brite.  I started using the product on just one underarm twice a day so that I could do a comparison.  My goodness by the end of the second week there was a huge noticible difference.  I feel so much more confident with raising my arms now.  My underarms and arms are now the same color!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for about a year. I mean, I started with a very dark armpit. Hate it !! It caused darkness due to using a shaver. Lets just say I was not very confident with my armpit. After using this product, I see that its lighten up little by little, slowly but surely! For 9 months, I used it every morning and night after I shower, make sure its dry before applying it. After that long 9 months, I only use it 3 times a week, once a day. I apply it once a day either in the morning or at night. For example: Monday, Wednesday, Saturday.. I use it less now because my armpit is white. I even lift my arms now and my boyfriend tells me that my armpit is white. I love it :) Im so happy I used this product, now that I have a white armpit!!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Besides lightening the dark patch under my arms, it eliminates the order.  Since using Xtreme Brite, I no longer use deodorant!</li>
    <li> My problems areas are definitely the under arms. But as I was abit skeptical on trying this straight to my under arms, Ive decided to apply it on my lower neck I I do have dark areas due to abrasion. During the first few days, I realised that the applied area got darken and dry, but being positive about it, i continued applying it and to my surprise the dark areas on my neck are gone. The skin kinda peeled off and exposing the new skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, personally I think we need to have alot of patient will this product. It definitely work but it will takes time.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of the 3pc. Brightening Gel, it seemed to improve my darkened skin, but now as I&#x27;m going through the second order of tubes I&#x27;m not seeing much of an improvement. I will say that this is excellent as a deodorant. I usually have to buy clinical strength deodorant because hardly anything will work for me for an extended period of time, but this works for me all day long.</li>
    <li> Bought this product came early. Used for week and seing result already but have to discontinue a while its peeling and stingy feeling skin.other than that Thanks.</li>
    <li> I applied a dime size amount once a day to my underarms. By the 7th day, I was starting to develop a rash(skin was red and tender) so I discontinued using it. Its been about three weeks and my underarms appear worse than they were. The rash has gotten darker but not disappeared. On the other hand, it smells good, no need for deorant. Unfortunately, Im stuck with three tubes that I will never use again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 6 months and I plan on using this for the longterm! This product is amazing! It gradually lightens dark pigments without over drying. It has a very potent chemical medical smell. But it fades once rubbed in vigorously. Allow a few moments to air dry before getting dressed. I find I receive best results if applied directly after shower to towel dry skin. I use this on my face lightly for old acne scars, my shoulders for sun damage, and my inner thighs for bikini line. It&#x27;s very effective! However, patience is key! These types of products take at least 3 month to see real tangible results.</li>
    <li> it worked for me really well .. i recommend buying this stuff for wightening your under arms .. will order those days for another 3set of the extreme brite gel :)&lt;br /&gt;so happy that it lightened my underarms it was seprising i did not expect it to work ^_^&lt;br /&gt;thank you ..great seller as well&lt;br /&gt;definitly will buy from that seller more&lt;br /&gt;thanx alot</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and have noticed the dark spots on my face have lightened up.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I had very dark underarms and its practically gone with the use of one tube...I love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pregnant woman and anything can happen when you are expecting . At my second-trimester, I started having some rash under my armpits and it left some black scars. Both of my armpits look so dark that I can barely wear tank top even though it&#x27;s 89 degrees outside . I started ordering 3pcs xtreme brite gel and used it twice daily every after shower. Now my armpits getting lighter. I noticed the improvement only about a week!! I&#x27;m still using it and will keep ordering. love this product.!!!!</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars as opposed to five stars because once you stop using this product, the discoloration on your skin does come back but not as bad. This is a temporary fix so if you are looking for something permanent, I would not recommend this product; however if you are looking for something easy and less pricey then this product is great. Fast shipping and great service.</li>
    <li> I use this with RX for brown skin and Palmers Cocoa butter fade cream. Mixture of all works so I AM NOT SURE WHICH IS STRONGER lol..I use it for dark skin patches on my side burns since i get my face waxed a lot</li>
    <li> Used for 30 days twice a day no results whatsoever.  Requested a return 3 or 4 days ago with no response.  Gong to dispute the charges on my credit cards.</li>
    <li> Used this morning and evening under arms and found that this product did not do very much for me. Won&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Shipping is fast. Just started using it. It peels your skin slowly. In my case I used it for my underarm and when the skin started to peel and you&#x27;re sweating a lot then it feels burning, manageable though. Used deodorant to control sweating hence control burning.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. Wow I suffered  with black underarms during pregnancy after pregnancy. So I tried it with a little tiny pea size for every armpit and its proven effective. My underarms now were so clear and lighter. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work but smells nice and felt like clear lotion, I even both the soap but found that a pen sonic pen (with electric vibration) and vitamin c serum worked within 3 days to visibly lighten hyperpigmentation spots left by acne on my face. I&#x27;m 40 something so I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t dry my face and this product didn&#x27;t do anything on other spots I tried first. I threw away the last tube.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Can&#x27;t wait to see my results!! Will order again.</li>
    <li> When I first tried xtreme brite I loved it. It worked to remove the dark underarm color. Years later I tried it again and it made my underarms extremely itchy.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I just ordered my&lt;br /&gt;Second tube. I order the deal of three at a time because it is cheaper and lasting.  I used this product on my private area and thighs it completely removes scars. You can start seeing the difference in two weeks. Also keep hydrocortisone handy wherever you apply it. Because it causes peeling. ..healthy peeling. But hydrocortisone helps with the itch.  Another thing i liked is the peeling doesnt cause burns. This is number one product&lt;br /&gt;For me. You can also use it on face,underarm and on birthmarks.  Also wear sunscreen that says non- comodogenic ( does not clog pores) if using on face. Awesome product. A must buy....i bought this product after reading the review. ..and now i am giving mine...and its another good review!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have not seen results yet, in fact it is getting worst. I will still try and use it until i finish my first tube and see if there will be any difference. For now i rate it as it is.</li>
    <li> finally found something that works, i see the difference in 3 weeks, but you have to continue using it if you want to keep your underarms whites.</li>
    <li> this gel got me some very bad strechmarks and my armpits got darker.....anyways i still have one tube more ..not using its a waste of money</li>
    <li> I like this cream it actually works just be patient started showing results by a week or so for me second time I bought this product</li>
    <li> I had a really bad issue with my dark underarms! My wedding is approaching near &amp; I would love to wear a strapless gown. After a week of using this I noticed the changes. The only though is that it stings and I had to raise my arms to keep it cool &amp; let it dry. But it works! My underarms are 75% lighter now.</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement in my skin tone</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works like magic. I order whenever im running out because they dont have this product where im from</li>
    <li> While using it ive noticed a difference but I have stopped it</li>
    <li> It did start working after I got through half of a tube, but it gave me a horrible rash!!! Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund even though I had used most of one tube.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product, I didn&#x27;t like the gel, and I did not see any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this gel  to lighten my armpits. It works with continued use, but once you stop using it. The darkened areas come back within a week.</li>
    <li> still use this product</li>
    <li> Omg I loved this product it took away all the darkness under my arms and it Made my underarms really soft and I noticed that I didn&#x27;t really perspire as much when used it. The only bad part I have to say about this is the fact that once I stopped using it. It made my underarms a lil darker but for the most part there better than what they were before I ever started using it. I don&#x27;t kno if it&#x27;s the product that made my under arms get stretch marks idk why or wtf how it happene but I notice it one day that I had these red Strech marks under my arms. I kno I&#x27;m not crazy and I think it&#x27;s this product bcz there is also another review were. They also mention havering deep red Strech marks under their arms also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If u do deside to purchase this produce beware!  U may or may not get Strech mark under YOUR arms as well</li>
    <li> Been using this for over 3 months now and see some change but not much.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was recommended for skin lightening. I bought it personally to clarify my armpits, I have only been a few days and believe it or not I watch some difference. If the product completely clear my armpits swear I will recommend it to one hundred percent;)</li>
    <li> It started peeling my armpits. they hurt so bad</li>
    <li> The gel was too strong for my arm pits.</li>
    <li> This was the second time i bought this. And i really love it because it just works and also smells good.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about two and a ha..lf months  3x a day using no deoderant and omg made a big change i still have some discoloration but i beleive sticking with this product will defenitly get rid of that</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it actually works, it makes those black patches or spots clear up. I have been using it for three months now and I like it so far. I use it for my dark armpits and it doesn&#x27;t damage your skin, it works on sensitive skin, but it does make the black area whiter than the rest of your body because you are just focusing on that area.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product c:</li>
    <li> i love it. this product have change my life in many aspects.&lt;br /&gt;the only advice. be carefull using a very hidratant cream. but the results are the best.&lt;br /&gt;no one compare with this one.&lt;br /&gt;im using it in my private areas. and wow. they look so good now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 months and I have yet to see results. I really thought this will be my solution. :(</li>
    <li> The item did not work like it was advertised to do. I will not be ordering this type of product again.</li>
    <li> Turns your skin darker and doesn&#x27;t fade a thing.  Went through 3 tubes in 1 month and nothing.  Prescription cream is the only thing that works.  Expensive but will do the job.</li>
    <li> did not help my dark armpits.</li>
    <li> These works faily well. IT takes a while to notice the difference but they do make a difference. might buy again.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been dealing with hyperpigmentation on my neck since before high school, i&#x27;m dark skinned black woman.  NOTHING worked and certainly not quite like this and without ANY irritation. (No hydroquoine I guess)I&#x27;ve tried amby skin tone,palmers, sus wexler,bio oil and plain old rubbing alcohol-these products are dead in comparison. I have VERY sensitive skin and I no problems with this products.  In ONE (1) UNO week I noticed a dramatic transformation-WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! did I say WOW!!!!!!!!!!! now I know how those women feel on those infomercials that cry because something FINALLY WORKED for them- now I understand *tear*  I ordered one tube to test it out- based on previous reviews, I had to give it try.  So here I am ordering the 3-pack this will surely do the trick and complete my transformation!!!! thanks Frenchies (product made in France) LOL  SINCERELY  Mrs B</li>
    <li> This stuff is the holy grail. I too use it on my armpits and it&#x27;s the only thing that works, and it works FAST. Only a few days to start seeing results. I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural with no harmful ingredients. I wish I could buy stock in this company because I know these folks are making a boatload of cash. I wanted to try the lotion too, but it has toxic ingredients, so I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking there. In any case, I&#x27;m glad Amazon is now selling these at a discount for a 3 pack. I keep a few tubes on hand, especially since the summer is rolling around!</li>
    <li> My wife is using it and she felt better .... but as she is still using and not completed the course duration yet this feedback is incomplete. we would like to post another review and rating after three months.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when (after very disciplined regular usage) I saw amazing results. But sure enough, after stopping, only a week or two later I was back at square one! It does work though, so if you have no problem using it for the rest of your life, or just need it for a time when you want those results albeit temporary, then go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I only give it a low rating because I was hoping it would be a permanent solution.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see that it worked, but maybe didn&#x27;t use it long enough?</li>
    <li> After using 2 tubes, The only thing I noticed is that my armpit gets lighter, and i don&#x27;t have to use deodorant. I like the smell of it..</li>
    <li> This stuff really works,at first i was hesitant to buy for many other bleaching and lightening creams didnt work,but gave it a shot and in a week saw a diference,i used it for dark circles,and in my bikini area and love it ,a most try</li>
    <li> My underarms where super dark but not anymore after using this product, I loved it so much I also bought the soap</li>
    <li> i have to say this is partially my fault as i had read the reviews but i went ahead a bought it, the cream did make my skin darker and i am still trying to fix it</li>
    <li> This product does work but it is not some miraculous cure.  You have to use at least 2-3 tubes before you see results since the tubes are very, very small (1oz).  Three tubes last about two months or less since February is a short month.  It lightens over time, not over night and it has a very pleasant scent.  I’m purchasing another 3 tubes to see if it will give further results.  After that I’ll try something else just so my skin won’t become use to it. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok so i bought this last march and started using it on March 15, it took time for me to make a review coz i really want to make sure it will give some results.. i haven&#x27;t finished the 1st tube yet, but i can really see it made my skin discoloration lighter, and i like the smell too, I also use it with their exfoliating soap.. What i did is for the first 3weeks i use it twice daily..after the morning shower and before i go to bed, then the next days only once a day, but  i guess i&#x27;ll be back using it twice a day to see the result faster.. :) moreover, i don&#x27;t wear fitted shirts as much as possible and don&#x27;t tweeze, i use an epilator since the day I started using it, coz they say it also cause the darkening, no deodorants too, unless you are too sweaty, find a deo that has no aluminum in it..finally great hygiene is still the best..and by the way i have a fair asian complexion.. :)</li>
    <li> I started seeing results the first couple of weeks. My underarms are so much lighter. I&#x27;m glad that i purchased this product and very thankful for it!</li>
    <li> So i have researched this product the best I possibly could. As some of you guys may notice there is not an overwhelming source of information; it is about a handful of sites saying the same exact thing. For this product there are no ingredients listed, no instructions on how to use the product and no results guaranteed. Although those were the disadvantages, i went on the natural route less deodorant and rubbing places of hyper pigmentation with lemon to lighten the area but i got too impatient and decided to go ahead with this product although some people say it has made their darks spots worse. A couple of days, my underarms WERE darker. By the 5th day iIT WAS PEELING. Something NO ONE mentioned in their reviews, maybe they didnt experience peeling idk. Being that it made my underarms darker, then after the peeling it kind of went lighter again but not really it just went to what it originally was before the product itself made it darker, I would not recomend this product because there are too many unceranties within this product and there is no guarantee you will see results its been about 7 days applying the product 2-3x and i have not seen any results. I will continue to use until the tube is finished because I believe i owe myself that and see if theres any changes then</li>
    <li> Not working for me...</li>
    <li> I bought a three pack because i figured either that&#x27;s how long its going to take to see results, or its going to work so good after the first bottle i would need 2 more. neither was the case for me because it really didn&#x27;t do anything! I used it under my armpits, knees, elbows, and any other areas i wanted lightened. I think the only place i saw a little improvement was right under my butt cheek and that could be just because it finally got skin treatments. I would say don&#x27;t waste your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a month ago to get rid of dark spots underneath my arms. This product has not lightened or corrected my problem. Will stop using.</li>
    <li> This product works really fast.  I saw great results almost immediately!  I even ordered a few tubes for my mother and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite product smells good gentle on skin a lil goes a long way it has helped me a lot to clear my dark underarms I absolutely love this item</li>
    <li> I am an asian woman with yellow undertone skin. I have fairly good skin. I used this product for one month, 2x a day (consumed two tubes) and applied it on underarms, entire face, neck, chest, elbow and knees. No bad reaction in the first two to three weeks then I noticed my underarms started to burn to the point that I couldn&#x27;t move my arms and wear shirt with sleeves. It totally irritated my skin. All the areas where I applied the gel became very itchy, dry, red, and irritated even my knees and elbows. The worst part is: I started to breakout on my entire chest, neck, cheeks, forehead and chin. Looks like I have chicken pox. It&#x27;s that bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know every skin is different. I am just sharing my personal experience. Now my skin is at its worst! It is summer time and I couldn&#x27;t wear V-necks or low-neckline shirts because my chest and neck still look horrible. Really embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are really curious and eager to try this product, I suggest you use it once a day (instead of 2x) to avoid damaging your skin. Test it first on your elbow or knees for one month and see how your skin reacts to the gel.</li>
    <li> Does not work, used it for a couple of weeks, no change.&lt;br /&gt;No instruction on the box.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning the product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a year.I must say it brightened my dark-as-midnight underarms.first i was so elated that the ugly darkness was gone.i also used it on my elbows and knees;i&#x27;ve noticed a difference.my elbows and knees are clearing up and that gives me hope.&lt;br /&gt;few months ago, i noticed some red marks under my arms(both arms) i was like:what are these??? where are they coming from? i had no clue what they were,as i have virtually zero strech marks;i tought they&#x27;d go away.they never left!!! now i&#x27;m reading complaints from other users; complaints about stretch marks.i&#x27;ve just taken a close look right now in front of a mirror and yes,they are strech marks!!! i don&#x27;t use foul language, but let me tell you i really feel like saying a word that might require bleach to clean my mouth with .it&#x27;s all right.Just be careful people,when using this product.i think i&#x27;ll stop the underarms usage and use only on my knees and elbows until they clear up.good luck to all.</li>
    <li> I am tough on reviews guys. I want my moneys worth and have high expectations. I have acne prone, very sensitive skin. I purchased this to use under my arms. It did work wonderfully, but here are a few things you need to know. 1. You have to use it consistently to see results. It took about 6 weeks using it twice a day to see a difference. My underarms were BLACK. No exaggeration. My friend also used it under her&#x27;s and she had to stop using it because her skin became so raw that it hurt for her to put her arms down!! 2. If you stop using it, your discoloration WILL come back. That part really sucks. But let me tell you how I have started using it. I have a very small concealer brush and I take a little and paint it on each one of the acne scars on my face. I do this morning and night. It takes about 8 weeks of consistent use to see a difference. So as with all lightning products you are going to have to be patient. I have extremely sensitive skin, and it does not cause any negative effect on my scars at all. It is worth the money, but beware you will become a slave to it, because if you discontinue use...you will slowly see the discoloration coming back.</li>
    <li> I saw a review on YouTube about this product&#x27;s ability to lighten your skin and I was sold after seeing the results on the person who posted the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the tubes are not too expensive I bought 3. The package or tube does not provide any type of instructions as to how to apply, other than &amp;#34;use regularly with other Xtreme Brite products.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the person who posted the YouTube review she used it daily for three months in order to achieve amazing skin lightening results in her underarms, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me this product did not work well, in fact it gave me a severe skin irritation, and it burned my skin leaving it worse that when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it daily and after 4 days I noticed my skin began to peel off as expected with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I kept using the product I started to experience an itchy sensation. I kept using it and after the next 2 or 3 days my skin developed a severe rash and it turned red, I immediately discontinued using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting a week or two for my skin to heal from the rash I noticed that my had skin turned darker than it was before. And had also was left with stained skin around the area of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been about 2 months and my skin is completely healed from the rash, and I still have the dark stained areas on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently used it again to see if I can get one peel to remove the stains, but after 4 days I started to feel itchy so again I discontinued its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a certain ingredient in this product that can cause you an allergic reaction, so be aware of it, because there is no type of warning on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using a product called Nadinola which I bought at Walgreens for about $3 dollars, it has 3% Hydroquinone and 3% Octisalate.&lt;br /&gt;(the highest out of all the fading over the counter creams I saw) This product (Nadinola) is helping me and it&#x27;s slowly fading away the marks left by Xtreme Brite and I can also see my skin getting lighter in the original problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know not all skins are the same but if I were you I would just buy one tube of Xtreme Brite, try it and if you start experiencing itching after the first peel stop using it immediately. Wait for your skin to heal from the first peel and then try using it again. If you get a rash after the 4th day of use stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I tried this for acne scars and dark elbows. this product was a waste of my money. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best one out there. I have tried many but got hooked with this. VERY NICE INDEED! It does what it says</li>
    <li> I started using Xtreme Bright after nothing seemed to work to lighten my melasma after having my son. This product works extremely well. You&amp;#34;ll have to take care not to over lighten. Great for hyper pigmented under arms too. Using it at night before bed is very effective.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t working at all. It&#x27;s not doing anything for me, I&#x27;ve used it for over a week and the first tube is almost gone and I&#x27;ve seen no results.</li>
    <li> The best whitening gel i&#x27;ve ever use, this is d only whitening gel that really helps my charcoal dark armpit. I am so happy. (no lies, no pretention). Since the day i use this gel i stop using deodorant. This products is my deodorant and whitening. So happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and a half and I&#x27;m seeing minimal results. The product works but sloooooow.</li>
    <li> I just received my first shipment 3 days ago so this is just a preliminary review. The reason for this early review is, just like others have reported, I have not needed to wear deodorant since applying this product and that includes while working out! No wettness and no odor! I am a carmel colored AA female who bought this for my under arms and knees. If things go well I will use for spots on my face. I am using a little larger than a dime size on each area. I do not see a difference on my knees yet, but I am already seeing a slight lightening of my under arms with no stinging, burning, or rash. I will be sure to update my review as the weeks go on, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I temporarily suspended the use under my arms after starting to get some stinging from my spanx cutting under my arm (nothing to do with the product). I have been using the product on my face and I have had some lightening of the dark marks. I do not expect these scars to go away quickly so I will continue to apply to my face. My knees are lightening up but I do notice the skin on my knees is peeling too. I am starting to apply aragan oil to my knees to help with that. I will update again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE#2: I am back to using this product and the results are still good. Underarms look great and no adverse affects to my face. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a light skinned African American with hyper pigmentation under my arms. I was using twice a day, dime sized amounts for one month. The product did work, but it BURNED my skin really bad. I work out a lot &amp; my underarms would be burning so bad from my perspiration. It got so bad to where the rubbing of my clothes would cause immense pain. I discontinued using it, but it did work. I would recommend starting off using once a day. I was using to much. Now I use every once in awhile to maintain. I gave 3 stars because it did work but there are no instructions on how to use the product.</li>
    <li> I had very dark underarms and after using this gel, it has lightened my underarms, but only some parts. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the creases or whatever that is causing this, but it&#x27;s weird. It has lightened my underarms noticeable though. And I would not recommend the soap. Be careful with the gel as it can sting after a while or after shaving. I only use it at night time since I feel like I need deodorant during the days.</li>
    <li> I bought this months ago and it was amazinggg! My face lightened three shades in a month. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a teen with very bad acne scarring. I used this for month and literally almost all of them are gone. But that&#x27;s just my skin. My chest is pale. So I lightened my face according to my chest. I reordered this for my elbows and knees and armpits, and little blemishes here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am I love with this product, and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
    <li> Omg! I was kind of hesitant about ordering this, but im so glad I did. I used on my dark underarms and my elbows. I saw results in 2 Weeks. But the full results take about 4 Weeks. Im not shy about lifting my arms anymore when wearing sleeveless shirt. I love it, recommend you buy this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 months, it works great!! But if u stop using it, your skin goes back to the ugly dark skin:/. I do recommend to be careful to not over use it or put to much just a small layer on the area . i used it under my arms and it thined out the skin. Now i have two ugly look a like  stretchmarks under my arms ..so please be careful to not use to much on the area. And the bad part is that one tube lasts about two weeks so i have to keep buying more so it can get pricy.</li>
    <li> I SAW RESULTS WITHIN 24 HOURS, HOWEVER THE GEL FEELS VERY WET ALMOST LIKE WATER. I WOULD PREFER A LOTION CONSISTENCY. BUT IT DOES WORK IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING TO LIGHTEN YOUR SKIN. IT HAS A SOFT SCENT AND IT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY SKIN SO I CAN USE IT ON SENSITIVE AREAS.</li>
    <li> this was totally misleading! I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a month and nothing has happened to my skin :( I use it in the morning and at night and still nothing. Now I wonder if the reviews posted are even real to begin with.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a month and I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;m seeing great results I so recommend it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year now. It definitely brightens dark areas. If I stop using it though the dark seems to come back but not sure if that&#x27;s from hormones. I do notice I don&#x27;t need deodarent as much when I put it under my arms.</li>
    <li> Brought this based on the reviews. After using it, I did noticed a difference on some old blemishes on my skin but its to expensive. It does have a nice smell and love the gel vs creamy texture.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews for this product and after reading so many good things about it I decided to buy. I took the time to read the negative reviews but figured that the disgruntled customers just had a case of the &amp;#34;different strokes for different folks&amp;#34;- meaning that everything isnt for everyone. Big mistake on my end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about the first two weeks I noticed a gradual lightening. I used this product in the mornings and evenings before bed. It was exciting to see the change. After a month I noticed tenderness and red spots under my arms. SO, I relaxed with using it so much and changed my deodorant to Tom&#x27;s (was using Degree Women&#x27;s before). I switched to only using it when I shaved, which was about every 4 days. Well the red spots turned into &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34; and those areas turned a deep deep brown borderline black color. It is soooo ugly under my arms now. I have to wear makeup to TRY to cover up the darkness. The areas are not small- they are very very big. They almost look like birthmarks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing bad to say about the seller. The product arrived on time, blah, blah, blah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PRODUCT on the other hand is crap--- DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
    <li> By far the best F**kn product I have ever tried. I always has a problem with my armpits. With this product my armpits are so lighter!!  Omg thank you!!!!!!! Idk who came out with this gel!! All I can say, thank you!!</li>
    <li> This gel really works, after 2 weeks using this gel the difference is very noticeable I&#x27;m happy with the results but I&#x27;m a little scared because I&#x27;ve read some bad reviews. But after been using many other products and paying for expensive treatments to improve the color of my armpits this is the only product that really works for me. I hope the product doesn&#x27;t affect my health or skin in a future.</li>
    <li> It took away the dark marks under my arms. I havent used it anywhere else on my body, but my under arms look great!</li>
    <li> This gel peeled my skin and left dark marks that took forever to clear. I looked real sicked. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> The gel does lighten your underarms, but I too got about 4 reddish stretch marks under one arm :( At the end of the day I would say Id rather have lighter arms with the stretch mark vs darker. I just wished it worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel and I used it for a couple of weeks, but had to stop using because my skin became ultra sensitive too it.</li>
    <li> Must use morning and night only a pea size amount and never the same day as waxing or shaving</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this product one star is because I am unable to give it zero. And it deserves that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman of Eastern European descent and unfortunately I&#x27;ve been plagued with dark underarms. After browsing through YouTube, searching for a solution, I stumbled upon a video promoting this product by a woman who used it to lighten her underarms. It seemed to work brilliantly for her, so I began to research the product more and read reviews. It seemed promising enough, so I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to receive my package. The product itself smells quite pleasant - very clean - and I applied a pea-sized amount onto each underarm every night for about a week. I saw no results at all, and felt mild dryness in my underarms. By day 10 I woke up to a startlingly red patch of hives that itched, stung, and burned. My skin peeled. I couldn&#x27;t stop scratching. Even to this day my underarms burn and itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad to have spent over $40 on something that only caused problems, and I&#x27;m even more saddened by the fact that my flaw seemingly cannot be fixed. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it works for some people and doesn&#x27;t for others. This is my experience only - it might actually work for you (I hope it does). It ruined my skin, sadly.</li>
    <li> I loved this product and it actually worked well for me ! I am an African American woman in my 20s and used this to lighten my armpits and it did just that. I just applied it after my nightly shower before my Shea butter and it works within 3 weeks of daily use</li>
    <li> I saw so many YouTube videos and how it worked for people in less than a month. I did not get any results. :/</li>
    <li> I am in my first bottle but still a very slow progress.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks I started to see results... Then my underarms became super sensitive... I stop using it for a couple of weeks until the redness disappeared applied aloe vera gel to smooth my irritated skin... Since then I have noticed a darker undertone now that is worse than my before results... I&#x27;m trying to find a way to lighten this dark complexion now... So irate that I spent money on this...</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I had SERIOUS dark marks under my arms and it pealed away all that dead skin and my underarms look FANTASTIC!!!!! Love love love!</li>
    <li> I used this product for total of 3-4 months. I used at some time the gel (and at other time the cream from the same brand). The gel was easy to dry after applying to skin. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin after applying (it is good to try it first at small area of skin and wait to see any reaction). The gel worked slowly but nicely the skin faded week by week even I wasn&#x27;t applying everyday. I apply the gel once a day and after I shower (where the skin is totally clean). I can say after 3-4 months of using the brand I got lighter skin (toward original skin color). I didn&#x27;t change any of my products (cleansing) but I started to scrub my skin with (lufa)or skin scrubber. I can only say that I used it and happy with it as it helped getting rid of un-balanced skin color which I am on the way of getting more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> I had dark underarms for a long time, I use many things to lighten but nothing work.. They wer so dark I never let my husband see my armpits cause I was so embarrassed. I bought xtreme brite almost 3 weeks ago and I can clearly see BIG change my armpits are much lighter.. I took some before and after pic and compare and am surprise to see the difference. Thank God I found this. I though I was the only one with  dark armpits but I can see there&#x27;s more than me, please try this it does work!!!!!</li>
    <li> It worked for a while but eventually became ineffective after continuous use of 6 months plus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product IF 1. You&#x27;re patient and 2. You&#x27;re willing to spend a decent amount. I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while. The first few times I used it, I realized I wasn&#x27;t getting much results because I wasn&#x27;t putting enough and not frequently enough. A year later I thought I&#x27;d try again because my underarms were really bothering me. So I bought 3 tubes + the Xtreme Brite Soap. I would put it on after showering, at night, and really any time I felt like the smell was fading away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t bother to use this product if you&#x27;re going to continue to shave and use antiperspirant everyday. It&#x27;s not going to work. I use this product as deodorant and yes it doesn&#x27;t protect from odor the way antiperspirant does. I use antiperspirant (Dove) when I know it&#x27;s going to be a long day. If you absolutely have to use antiperspirant. I suggest taking a shower, putting the gel, wait till the gel kinda dries, and then put deodorant. But if you&#x27;re going to do that you must use the soap to clean your underarms and night and put the gel on at night.  And shaving, well..no girl wants hairy underarms. I use an epilator because shaving and deodorants caused all this mess for me so you can see why I&#x27;m hesitant on using both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again this is my experience because I was Xtremely unhappy by how dark my underarms were so I took Xtreme precautions while using Xtreme Brite! (See what I did there)</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED PRODUCT IN GOOD TIME  I HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT PRODUCT ITS A NATURAL LIGHTNER SO IT MAY TAKE A WHILE TO SEE RESULTS THATS MY ONLY PROBLEM PRODUCT I RECIEVED WAS IN FACT WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE</li>
    <li> Bought this product because of reviews I&#x27;ve watched on youtube.  I was hesitant at first thinking it might not work on me since there were also a lot of negative reviews about it, but eventually I did.  Initially, I used it twice a day, without using deodorant since it doesn&#x27;t make me smell as long as I don&#x27;t sweat.  Then halfway through my first tube, my pits started peeling and felt stingy, so I chose to use it just once a day.  Due to the itchy and stingy sensation, I got some bumps on my pits which looked like mosquito bites. My pits did lighten a bit (probably a shade lighter), but overall, changes were not that dramatic for me.</li>
    <li> I have hyper pigmentation under my arms(could be due to shaving and using deordorant with aluminum).  Upon doing a short research I found a Youtube video of a young woman suffering from the same thing.  She filmed a before and after 9with a month in between)recommending Xtreme Bright..I was sold, I purchased the soap and gel.  It really works..I&#x27;ve had no irration, no allergic reations nothing but no more dark under arms..woo hoo!!!  My sister suffers for Lupus and her face has dark mark due to skin rash..I&#x27;m gonna send her both tell he to test a small area..hopefully it will work for her and she won&#x27;t have an allergic reaction..</li>
    <li> I have brown spots on my face from acne scars and pigmnentation discoloration.  I am always willing to try something new.  A friend of mine recommended this product and although it didnt get rid of the spots it lightened them.  I use less concealer on the brown spots to cover it up.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had to edit my last review, at first I was disappointed with this product because it was taking sometime for the product to work. I guess you have to apply it everyday and make it a routine. From the beginning I was very exited to get this, I heard awesome reviews about it. 3 months past after I got it and the changes are VERY VERY MINIMAL. At first my underarms got a little irritated and red, then it looked like the darker skin was peeling off, however, I noticed some areas were looking a bit more darker, it might be the irritated skin healing. I kept using it after a few more months and taking pictures of the progress. I could see some change and the darkness has decreased, however, it&#x27;s not the drastic change I&#x27;ve seen on other ladies. I have not been able to achieve the tone I feel comfortable with.</li>
    <li> I received my product on time, I am using this often and mostly daily. I will order this again.  Thanks</li>
    <li> i use this for dark spots on my leaf and arms, it works well, but it seems to stop working after long use</li>
    <li> I have used it for 2 weeks and it does not work!!!!!There is a lot of hype on the previous reviews and I did not have any of the results that they mentioned!  I&#x27;m just happy that my skin did not break out!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Well at first it seem to work but after a few applications skin started to peel and get red and irritated.  I used it for my under arms and between my legs were it turned dark after having and legs rubbed together.  Now it&#x27;s darker than what I started with. Im going back to using the cream in the pink tube it smells good and dries fast and did work. I just thought by buying this gel it would of given it a boost but it did more damage.</li>
