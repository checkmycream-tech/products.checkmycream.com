      <li>Def will be purchasing more</li>
      <li>Bdellium brushes are some of my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the shape of the brush and how it feels in your hand.</li>
      <li>I ended up spending a lot more money and bought a similar brush by MAC, which I am very happy with.</li>
      <li>Better than Sigma or Mac</li>
      <li>Love this brush for blending my transition eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I used them on a client over the weekend but noticed that the fibers dye easily (and orange under eye corrector I used made the brush turn peach even after 2 washes).</li>
      <li>I am not a picky person but compared to elf, sephora and Mac brushes I own, this one is good enough for the trash</li>
      <li>I strongly prefer this to Sigma&#x27;s now redesigned synthetic E40.</li>
      <li>Hands down one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It applies make-up smoothly and easily.</li>
      <li>The mac 227 dupe is just fine, but something about the hair on this brush hates my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for blending and smoking-out shadows in and above the crease.</li>
      <li>The brush is very durable, easy to clean, and it&#x27;s very easy to hold &amp; use.</li>
      <li>They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  </li>
      <li>The bright yellow handle makes it easy to find in my makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>My only con is that the brush hairs are a tad scratchy, but when I wash it I&#x27;ll condition it to see if they soften, but overall super awesome brush and I&#x27;m very happy with the other brushes I received too!</li>
      <li>It works great for putting colors into the crease and for blending out other colors.</li>
      <li>Great quality, little to no shedding.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also easy to clean, they pop right back to its original shape.</li>
      <li>The stiffness is uncomfortable, but does lend itself to a nice, clean line, and good deposit of product.</li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s fairly good</li>
      <li>Soft, fluffy, does an amazing job at blending and is super cost effective.</li>
      <li>The bristles are not really soft but it blends eyeshadows nicely.</li>
      <li>It is larger than it looks in the photo, but is great for blending shadows in the outer and inner crease.</li>
      <li>It does what it says it does, but I would pass if I had been able to feel it prior to buying.</li>
      <li>I actually got this because a beauty blogger I follow said it was one of her favorites, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a multi-task brush; from blending eye shadow perfectly to applying high-lighter with faint strokes, it all goes on well.</li>
      <li>and I wish I would have purchased several more.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>I love how it can get deep in the crease like it does.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>The bristles are extremely soft and the quality is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Affordable, quick shipping, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you about how long I have searched for make up brushes of good/great quality for a better price as compared to those found in department stores.</li>
      <li>It is very soft but not unlike other cheap soft ones, this ones blends way better.</li>
      <li>Really irritated my eyes.</li>
      <li>The price is very affordable.  </li>
      <li>I use it to apply eye shadow and blend and it works really well.  </li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve mentioned with other reviews in regards to the Bdellium brush line, I really really love this brush line.</li>
      <li>Love feels just mac&#x27;s 224 but for half the price</li>
      <li>I think the only difference is that the mac one is a tiny bit more dense</li>
      <li>Decent MAC 224 dupe.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend both this brush and the 776 as blending brushes you should keep in your kit.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
      <li>its soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>Basically, I had to use a lot more eye shadow and wasted a lot.  </li>
      <li>I usually spend a lot more money on MAC makeup brushes.  </li>
      <li>I treat this brush the same way I treat all my brushes and this is the first time this has happened to me.</li>
      <li>But really this brush with your eyes closed feels very much, closest</li>
      <li>Unlike the other Bdellium brush I tried, this one was kind of scratchy - which I had read in other reviews but ignored.</li>
      <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t very soft which can irritate the sensitive skin under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Bdellium blending brushes are by far my fav crease brushes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my eyeshadow blend so well!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to blend together my lid and contor colors.  The brush size is perfect and tapers deep in the crease.  The bristles are extremely soft and the quality is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love feels just mac&#x27;s 224 but for half the price</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  These brushes are really nice.  They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  The price is very affordable.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush for the price.  The bristles are not really soft but it blends eyeshadows nicely.</li>
    <li> Great brush, great price and received super fast. Plan on purchasing another brush soon.</li>
    <li> I just received this brush yesterday. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it, especially for the price. It&#x27;s a good brush, doesn&#x27;t shed and contours well. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> Love the texture of the briush! It applies make-up smoothly and easily.</li>
    <li> my wife is very satisfied with product quality and speed of delivery.</li>
    <li> This product is well made.  I use it to apply eye shadow and blend and it works really well.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful blending brush... It is larger than it looks in the photo, but is great for blending shadows in the outer and inner crease.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you about how long I have searched for make up brushes of good/great quality for a better price as compared to those found in department stores. I was really considering giving up and paying up $100 for only 3 brushes at MAC! Then I got this brush and i freaking swear it had a halo around it, lol. But really this brush with your eyes closed feels very much, closest you could to the mac brush 217 or something. (all other cheaper brushes won&#x27;t feel like this.) The blending is fantastic!  It is very soft but not unlike other cheap soft ones, this ones blends way better. I think the only difference is that the mac one is a tiny bit more dense but this one did the blending job just as good.</li>
    <li> I cannot complain with the brush size and yes it looks like a dupe to Sigma E40 and Mac 217. But the bristles are so hard, they are not fluffy at all. Tried washing them but still it is so hard. It says it has both natural and artificial bristles but really it is a blending brush, I hate to blend with this. I can&#x27;t do 3 swipes on my eyelid leave alone blending for a good look. Really disappointed. Sometimes dupes have the looks but really not feel.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews before buying and some had already mentioned but still went ahead and bought well..now I know that may be the batch sold in Amazon is not good one, so anyone like me do not purchase here! I mean it really.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. best blending brush I&#x27;ve used. I actually got this because a beauty blogger I follow said it was one of her favorites, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Love it.</li>
    <li> A little bit of shedding and harsh smell but aired out after washing and returned to its natural shape I&#x27;d really recommend!</li>
    <li> Feat brush great brush. It was a lol prickly but I washed it &amp; it worked great! Def will be purchasing more</li>
    <li> brush is fine but looks like a travel size and is green not yellow like the picture</li>
    <li> the entire wooden handle of this brush split all the way up to the ferrule.  i have lots and lots of brushes and not one of them has cracked like this one, I am not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> This blending brush is LIFE! Hands down one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. Better than Sigma or Mac and I&#x27;m a Sigma snob. It&#x27;s so fluffy and soft. It came just that soft and became even softer after washing it. There was no issues with shedding after washing or using. Not sure what else to say except it&#x27;s amazeballs! Soft, fluffy, does an amazing job at blending and is super cost effective.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for blending my transition eyeshadow. It&#x27;s very good quality</li>
    <li> Not a bullet brush like it appears in the picture.  It is a tapered brush.  Flexible and great for blending.  Bdellium brushes are some of my favorite.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw Kathleen Lights had used it in one of her videos and it did not disappoint. It works great! :)</li>
    <li> Ive been using this brush for a few months now and it blends well but the hairs are starting to break. I treat this brush the same way I treat all my brushes and this is the first time this has happened to me. When I use it I get little bits of hair on my eyelids.  Its not the softest brush in the world either. But, its still an okay brush.</li>
    <li> Love bdellium brushes.  Will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> i would definetly recommend this brush. its soft and gentle on the skin. can be used for applying an overall wash of color on the lid and also works well for blending concealer under the eye and for applying powder over concealer under the eye. out of those 3 uses, i use it most for setting my concealer with powder under the eye. only because it is a bit large to use as an eyeshadow blending brush, especially if you have smaller eyes like myself. it spot cleans and deep cleans well.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find something comparable to a Mac eye make-up brush I use.  This isn&#x27;t the same quality.  Doubt I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
    <li> I got this brush to use as a blending brush. It works great for putting colors into the crease and for blending out other colors. The bright yellow handle makes it easy to find in my makeup brushes. Great quality, little to no shedding.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve mentioned with other reviews in regards to the Bdellium brush line, I really really love this brush line. I have not had any issues this brush line. The brushes pick up my products with ease and there are no shedding. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love the shape of the brush and how it feels in your hand. It is easy to control and easy to locate with that awesome color!</li>
    <li> this is by far THE BEST blending brush I have ever used. The brush is very durable, easy to clean, and it&#x27;s very easy to hold &amp; use. It truly does provide a perfect blend. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other brushes as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect blending brush! This has become a favorite!</li>
    <li> Another winner! I just love this brush and I wish I would have purchased several more. Quality is excellent, could not be happier :-)</li>
    <li> Bdellium blending brushes are by far my fav crease brushes. They are perfect for smoking out my eyes and getting in the crease without creating too precise of a line. Affordable, quick shipping, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I believed the reviewers and ordered this brush. It was so scratchy I couldn&#x27;t use it. I am not a picky person but compared to elf, sephora and Mac brushes I own, this one is good enough for the trash</li>
    <li> I thought I would try to save some money and try a cheaper eye shadow brush.  I usually spend a lot more money on MAC makeup brushes.  I have to say....you get what you pay for. This brush didn&#x27;t hold the eye shadow and just pushed it around. Basically, I had to use a lot more eye shadow and wasted a lot.  I ended up spending a lot more money and bought a similar brush by MAC, which I am very happy with.</li>
    <li> I needed a really good blending brush for my brush kit and i have finally found it! It blends out shadow so well and the tapered shape is really good for blending out shadow in the crease. It&#x27;s a little scratchy but not too unbearable. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Unlike the other Bdellium brush I tried, this one was kind of scratchy - which I had read in other reviews but ignored. It can be almost painful on the eye if used at the wrong angle, so I find this works better to pat on the color and use a softer brush to blend. The handle is of nice quality, and it hasn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> I use this to blend concealer under the eyes and around the nose, but have to be careful not to overdue it.  The bristles aren&#x27;t very soft which can irritate the sensitive skin under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brand of brushes! They&#x27;re affordable quality brushes that don&#x27;t shed! They&#x27;re also easy to clean, they pop right back to its original shape. It&#x27;s a multi-task brush; from blending eye shadow perfectly to applying high-lighter with faint strokes, it all goes on well. Just try this 1 brush , I&#x27;m positive you&#x27;ll purchase the set, seriously! I need to do commercials for this darn people because I have many of their brushes-LOL! Oh well, enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s great for blending and smoking-out shadows in and above the crease. My only con is that the brush hairs are a tad scratchy, but when I wash it I&#x27;ll condition it to see if they soften, but overall super awesome brush and I&#x27;m very happy with the other brushes I received too!</li>
    <li> The size of this blending brush is great.  However I gave it only 4 stars because it&#x27;s isn&#x27;t very soft and after blending for too long it does irritate your eyelid. But other than that it&#x27;s fairly good</li>
    <li> I really love this brush 100%. I love how it can get deep in the crease like it does. Love!!!</li>
    <li> The BD 785 is a decent brush, but I consider it to be on the lower quality end of mid range brushes. I got 2 of these to add to my kit because I heard that they were a good dupe for the MAC 217 which I use for blending creams, liquids, powders you name it. The brushes came slightly splayed in the plastic sleeves (some bristles were already standing away from the brush). I sanitized them and let them dry over night which corrected the splaying. I used them on a client over the weekend but noticed that the fibers dye easily (and orange under eye corrector I used made the brush turn peach even after 2 washes). The 217s in my kit are several years old and still the same off white. Over all the brushes are sturdy and well made for the price. But if you are looking for perfection in application and blending stick with the 217.</li>
    <li> Decent MAC 224 dupe. I strongly prefer this to Sigma&#x27;s now redesigned synthetic E40. Highly recommend both this brush and the 776 as blending brushes you should keep in your kit. I have several other Bdellium brushes and they wash well with barely any shedding (especially the synthetic line). It was a little scratchy at first, but treating with argan oil or something comparable helps. I don&#x27;t reach for this brush all the time, but it&#x27;s great to have when I get my other brushes dirty.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They make blending a transition color so easy!</li>
    <li> I found the brush to be stiff, and the bristles of moderate quality. I read the other reviews, and I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad one, or if I just have sensitive eye skin, or am more accustomed to higher end brushes. Compared to the crease brush I got at Target for $15, this one is a throw away. The stiffness is uncomfortable, but does lend itself to a nice, clean line, and good deposit of product. It does what it says it does, but I would pass if I had been able to feel it prior to buying.</li>
    <li> Really irritated my eyes. The mac 227 dupe is just fine, but something about the hair on this brush hates my skin.</li>
</ol>
