      <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and tanning lotion was really good...</li>
      <li>(because, let&#x27;s face it, who likes paying full price for anything?!).</li>
      <li>The product has a pleasant fragrance and comfortable presentation, I used it only once because I almost Insole me.</li>

<li> Has a little tingle to it, but not to much.  </li>
<li> Gives a dark, long lasting tan ... but mistreated skin, too early in the dry areas used.</li>
<li> However, I do not like the tingle or redness that comes a long with it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but I always come back to Pink Diamond.</li>
<li> Deep dark tan in no time at all.</li>
<li> you are scared to use a tingle, then my suggestion would be to use Designer Skin&#x27;s Obsidian so that you can feel what a heat lotion feels like, and then move to Pink Diamond.  </li>
<li> I used Swedish Beauty Dark Escape, then I lather on the Pink Diamond, and I am the darkest I have ever</li>
<li> I bought this lotion for my step daughter who has eczema and has very sensitive skin, she has to tan twice a week to keep her rashes from getting worse.</li>
<li> There is a slight tingle to it, so read up on it before you buy!</li>
<li> The first time anyone uses a tingle is the worst.  </li>
<li> the smell is awsome and the tingle ain&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> I refuse to pay salon prices because they are just outrageous.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> for your legs and feet to get a similar tan than the one you have in your upper body, this is the one!! soft, nice sensation when you apply it.</li>
    <li> As always, I received my extra hug and kiss from my wife when I gave this product to her!  She loves it and says she will use no other for indoor tanning!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and tanning lotion was really good...the smell is awsome and the tingle ain&#x27;t bad. But it does leave your skin red. But I really like this lotion.</li>
    <li> I cant stand buying tanning lotion at the tanning salon. This product was a great buy and I was happy with the price.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this product was through a promotional discount from a salon. I loved it. I like mild tingles and this is perfect. I&#x27;ve recently run out and found this seller after looking for the best price (because, let&#x27;s face it, who likes paying full price for anything?!). I ordered on a Monday...and it was delivered on Wednesday! The bottle I got was also not the \\&quot;older\\&quot; bottle with the gold cap on top like in the picture...it was Swedish Beauty&#x27;s updated bottle and formula for 2014. I&#x27;m pretty pumped!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a number of years and this is the only lotion I buy! I&#x27;ve tried others, but I always come back to Pink Diamond. The tingle took a while to get used to, but now, I don&#x27;t like tanning without a tingle! My salon doesn&#x27;t carry this brand anymore, so I am so glad I was able to find it here!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t come in bottle</li>
    <li> The product has a pleasant fragrance and comfortable presentation, I used it only once because I almost Insole me. Gives a dark, long lasting tan ... but mistreated skin, too early in the dry areas used.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells I just got it today I can&#x27;t wait to use it and I hope they have a sale on it soon I will be buying more :)</li>
    <li> Product works really well,, smells good, has some tingle but not too much.  Product was also referred to me. I sold all that I bought in ny first order in just minimal days</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS AND REALLY FAST!! THE TINGLE IS NOT UNBEARABLE BUT IT GIVES U AWSOME COLOR..I LOVE THE DEEP BRONZE IT GAVE ME..GREAT SELLER AND GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and I swore by this lotion then and I still do! I refuse to pay salon prices because they are just outrageous. I LOVE THIS LOTION</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase of Pink Diamond. It arrived in a timely manner and it was exactly what I ordered. I will never buy tanning lotion from the tanning bed again! Amazon all the way!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have always used this but the salons around here stopped caring it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here. *HOWEVER*I didn&#x27;t get this bottle though...I received the squeeze bottle and it was listed at a cheaper price ***</li>
    <li> This lotion was just as described.  Has a little tingle to it, but not to much.  The smell is not bad either.</li>
    <li> I would have gave this product 5 stars, however i&#x27;m not because this product came in a diffrent bottle and it was supposed to have the hemp in it and it did not.</li>
    <li> All it did was burn me every time I used it and didn&#x27;t give me any color. Won&#x27;t use Swedish Beauty again. Australian Gold all the way!!</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend and she said it gave her skin a burning sensation.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping. Exactly as described and shown. Deep dark tan in no time at all. Don&#x27;t freak out when you come out all red. The red will quickly turn tan.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my step daughter who has eczema and has very sensitive skin, she has to tan twice a week to keep her rashes from getting worse.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite tanning lotions. Smells great, great texture, and works amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a salon, but I felt as though I needed to write a review for it on Amazon.  First of all, this is a FANTASTIC lotion for someone who wants to start using a tingle lotion.  The first time anyone uses a tingle is the worst.  Your skin will get used to it the more that you use it.  I bought this product three weeks ago, and I can barely feel the tingle now.  For someone who has never used a tingle, it might be a good idea to mix this product with a lotion that you normally use to tone down some of the heat.  I used Swedish Beauty Dark Escape, then I lather on the Pink Diamond, and I am the darkest I have ever been!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are scared to use a tingle, then my suggestion would be to use Designer Skin&#x27;s Obsidian so that you can feel what a heat lotion feels like, and then move to Pink Diamond.  Obsidian has a warming sensation that (in my opinion) feels wonderful especially when it&#x27;s colder outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! Shipment was slower than I expected (though it did arrived within 2 weeks of order), but packaging was great when it arrived.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great! However, I do not like the tingle or redness that comes a long with it. It smells good and gets the job done, but I won&#x27;t purchase again because of the tingle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years... tried a lot of different types and I always come back to this.  Swedish beauty is Awesome!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I have fairly red skin and this product helpes me to tan instead of burn. There is a slight tingle to it, so read up on it before you buy!</li>
