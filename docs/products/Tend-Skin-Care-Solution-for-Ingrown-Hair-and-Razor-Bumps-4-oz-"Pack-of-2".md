    <li> Ladies do not shy away from this product. Tend Skin will erase embarrassing ingrown hairs on the face and bikini areas. i am so happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Bought several of this and always satisfied with the performance. Keeps me from itching immediately after application</li>
    <li> Works like a charm after a week i had no more bumps</li>
    <li> Razor bumps and ingrown hairs are not a problem anymore! This product does everything it promises.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try after shaving since I have sensitive skin. It truly does ease the pain caused by razors; in fact I no longer have razor bumps or irritation.</li>
    <li> best product for bumps on market</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff. If he runs out he goes crazy. We buy 2 bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the TendSkin website does little to educate the consumer on how the product actually works.  I was referred to the product by an esthetician because of razor bumps after  shaving.  The product makes the area very dry and flakey.  Because this was not mentioned as an initial side effect on the TendSkin website, I deferred back to the esthetician.  He told me this was normal.  Allow at least 3 weeks for the product to really take affect and do not use moisturizers on the affected area as it may counteract the affects of the Tendskin.  I was glad to know it was normal and that he still endorsed the product.  I have had about a full week&#x27;s use of the product and so far I do notice a lot less irritation from shaving than before.  Will update if anything goes South.  :)</li>
    <li> I stated using it and witching a week started seeing results. I love it!</li>
    <li> Gets rid of razor bumps well.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for my skin. I have been trying all kinds of Skin Cares for my shaving bumps but no better results until my barber introduced me to this product and it has been a life saver. I am now stacked to it like a glue. lol.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product and this was a really GREAT deal!  Once you use this product for a bit you wont even need it.</li>
    <li> Compared to other after shave products on the market Tend Skin was head and shoulders above all even the ones with a cream lotion base. I never had shaving problems in the past and low and behold it occurred after shaving too close and often, now with the using Tend Skin for a couple of years now it&#x27;s been a quite a pleasure to keep my face smooth and bump free. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I shave my head, and Tend Skin is the only product I trust to keep my skin from breaking out. Just great stuff.</li>
    <li> i use after plucking after laser hair removal shaving it realy is like applying liquid asprin to control inflamation really</li>
    <li> It works very good ! Body was clear in 2days</li>
    <li> love this product it was really really good especially being in the military I was able to use it to help with a lot of my facial skin problems I believe it will help anyone with razor bumps and razor burns.</li>
    <li> I am a Black Hispanic with mildly sensitive skin. Ever since I first started shaving as a teenager, I noticed that I would get unsightly razor bumps after shaving. I used to dab rubbing alcohol as a remedy but as I got older and had to shave more frequently, the alcohol wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. Especially since I needed to start using other products on my face to keep it healthy and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started purchasing TendSkin after seeing a wealth of positive online reviews about it along with mentions in various articles regarding skin care for men.

I haven&#x27;t suffered from any razor bumps since I started using it, even on my most problem areas such as my chin and jawline. It does sting after usage, but that&#x27;s always going to happen when alcohol comes into contact with open skin. However, it isn&#x27;t a painful sting, it&#x27;s more like a &amp;#34;it&#x27;s working&amp;#34; sting. Unfortunately, TendSkin is a very expensive product but I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve lasted on the 4oz bottles for 6+ months so you do get a great value for what you&#x27;re paying for. I have found that it is cheapest either on Amazon or at WalMart; I noticed that other stores such as Target and Walgreens charge anywhere from $16.99 - $18.99 for the 4oz. bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product for both men and women who have trouble with razor bumps/burns or have sensitive skin.o you do get a great value for what you&#x27;re paying for.

    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for razor bumps. It works for my bikini line and it works for my husbands face and neck.</li>
    <li> Very effective in preventing ingrown hairs if used regularly</li>
    <li> I can put up with the smell - it disappears in minutes. The solution is very effective against the skin bumps and helps them heal fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years and I am still pleased with the results.  This product literally eliminates my razor bumps within 4 days. I love it!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Tend Skin for years. No more sore underarms!</li>

    <li> I always stand by tend skin as an aesthetician,  it helps for  post Brazilian  waxing.</li>
