      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money</li>

      <li>I love it and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available</li>
      <li>It will leave your hair shiny, soft, and, easy to style.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser sold me my first bottle of Agadir Oil and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years.  </li>
      <li>It was here in no time and was reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I was born with hair that is greasy after one day, so I was hesitant at first to put oil on my hair.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product at my salon.  </li>
      <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It keeps away the frizz and leaves you hair healthy and shiny while flat ironing.</li>
      <li>Smells like heaven and works well against frizz to form better curl while protecting during blow dry.</li>
      <li>Because I have very curly hair</li>

      <li>I also really appreciate the travel tubes.</li>

      <li>every other day (curly hair tends towards dryness) and in the past have spritzed my hair damp and added some leave in conditioner on the second day but not with this - use it after shampooing and you will be pleased with the product.</li>

<li> Just a few drops of this product leaves my hair shiny and conditioned without being greasy or weighed down.  </li>
<li> Just a few drops smooths those little fly-away hairs.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is amazing!  My extremely thick, curly and always frizzy hair has seen some serious hair care products usage over the last 20 or more years.  The humidity in Florida is relentless and I have tried everything to keep the frizz under control -- gels, mousse, sprays, conditioners.  All of them have had minimal success and all had side effects -- stiffness, crunchiness, etc.  Agadir oil controls the frizz, smells heavenly and leaves hair EXTREMELY touchable!  An added bonus that doesn&#x27;t seem to be mentioned in any of the testimonals is scalp relief!  I am so grateful to have discovered such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It was here in no time and was reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser sold me my first bottle of Agadir Oil and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years.  I have fine straight hair and this made it feel soft without weighing it down.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money and I will continue to use it.  I gave the travel packs to my sister and she is using it now too.</li>
    <li> Agadir Hair Oil is a fantastic product. I used to use it when it was called \\&quot;Moracan Miracle Oil\\&quot;, so I was thrilled to see it back on the market.  However, it was advertised to include 3 travel tubes with each 4 oz. bottle. I purchased two bottles, but did not receive ANY travel tubes. Also, one of the bottles had a loose cap and leaked before it got to me.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a year now, and love the product.  It is best for thick/coarse/dry hair, and you do not need to use a lot for it to be effective.  Also great for dry skin spots!  The scent is Heavenly!!</li>
    <li> I like how smooth my hair felt, without feeling greasy.It gave great frizz control as well as added shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> This oil works great with the flat iron. I have long, wavy hair, and this works great. I&#x27;ve gotten my girlfriends hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven and works well against frizz to form better curl while protecting during blow dry.</li>
    <li> Ok, where do I start, I had seen this product on Amazon and read the reviews and thought, \\&quot;hummm.... this is just like the other argan oil\\&quot;, I BEG TO DIFFER!!!!! I have relaxed hair, so I purchased this product (4ozs + 3 travel tubs), let me tell u this product IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER OILS, it made my hair soft and it is not heavy; it absorbs into your hair. U know how u hear people saying how good a product is, it is this, it is that, well, I&#x27;m one of those people who was skeptical at first. Since I&#x27;m a HCPJ (hair-care-product-junkie)I said why not give this product a try, what can it hurt, I&#x27;ve got a close full of products that I don&#x27;t use, so why not try this one. OMG.......... I LOVE THIS OIL!!! It is better than One-and-Only Argan Oil, it is better than Jose M....argan oil.     I haven&#x27;t decided on whether to buy the conditioner or not, but this oil is GREAT.    If you have relaxed hair, try it.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite product to use. It smells delicious and makes my hair feel great! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most oils do. It&#x27;s actually lightweight. I have naturally frizzy hair, and this product helps battle the frizz. I love it and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available and I&#x27;m able to use it.</li>
    <li> Glad I found this product. Was exactly what I was looking for. My hairdresser used this on my hair and have been looking for a \\&quot;cheaper price\\&quot; than the salon offered.  This was a steal!.. Works great on my dry frizzy curly aging hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and I am so happy to find it on Amazon for WAY cheaper than my Salon!    It leaves my hair soft, silky, and oddly (since it is oil) with more volume than I started with. I actually use it instead of hairspray anytime I would want to use hairspray. I style my hair just with a round brush and it keeps all day.    Only thing to watch out for - tie your hair up at night to keep your hair off your face. Although it doesn&#x27;t make my HAIR feel oily at all, I break out with zits if I don&#x27;t put my hair in a ponytail before going to sleep after using this.    It smells soooo good and I definitely recommend! I was born with hair that is greasy after one day, so I was hesitant at first to put oil on my hair. This product works for me without making my hair feel oily. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this AFTER blow drying and BEFORE straightening. This oil is not heavy or greasy. It simply moisturizes and makes it shine. This is the only oil I&#x27;ve used that truly stops my hair from looking dead on the ends. I have smooth hair all the time now! Not just after I go to the salon. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> My hair has never been healthier since I started using this oil. I&#x27;ve tried different argan oils and none compare. I also really appreciate the travel tubes.</li>
    <li> I have very thick  long curly hair and I have not managed to find a product to tame it without any negative side effects up until now.  This stuff really works! When i straighten my hair it leaves it very smooth,shiny and completely eliminates the frizz. It also eases very dry and itchy scalp.  I would definitly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> No problems with the order or product. Can very fast and happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff - it does not feel like hair \\&quot;oil\\&quot; once applied and dried.  It cuts my drying time in half and leaves my hair frizz-free, silky-soft, and holds my styling much longer.  I have semi-coarse long blonde hair, and it transforms my locks into loveliness!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes you hair so soft and smells so good. It keeps away the frizz and leaves you hair healthy and shiny while flat ironing. Love, Love, Love It!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. You can use it on either wet or dry hair; I prefer wet. It leaves your hair feeling well conditioned without feeling oily. And the smell is so delightful.     I having been purchasing it at a local beauty supply and have been paying more than twice the price for the same bottle without the three travel samples. I gave those away to co-workers and now they are all hooked.     Try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed and you, too, will be recommending it to your friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Leaves your hair silky, shiny but not greasy.  I use it almost every day</li>
    <li> Adds Richness and Vitality to Lifeless Hair with a Great Scent.  Leaves no oily residue.</li>
    <li> Great hair treatment that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy. Makes my hair soft, and it smells great! I was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  it make my hair fell like silk and no more frizz when I use all the products available.  I am telling others.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Daughter who has naturally Curly hair and always complains about humidity,Frizz,and bad hair days when it rains. She used this product and her hair stayed as styled, her hair didn&#x27;t frizz, and she loved that it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  The hair absorbs it and you are left with faster drying time (She let it dry naturally)and healthy, shiny, hair. And it lasted all day long, even when she went out in rainy weather. I will absolutely buy more for her and myself!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  It makes my hair so soft and shiny without making it greasy at all!  I use the travel tubes of this when I go on vacation and it is great when I don&#x27;t have to take the large plastic bottle with me.  I use this oil on my hair after I towel dry my hair and it makes for a great detangler!  I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for something to detangle their hair and make it softer, and shinier.  It is also important to remember to that even though this is an oil it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down or make it greasy at all when you use it.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at my salon.  I have a cabinet full of hair products that don&#x27;t deliver or stop working after a short time.  This product is absolutely wonderful. I have relatively fine, straight hair but as I&#x27;ve aged it has lost some of it&#x27;s luster.  Just a few drops of this product leaves my hair shiny and conditioned without being greasy or weighed down.  I like this product so much that I purchased the three small travel sizes to share with my sisters.</li>
    <li> I was given Agadir Hair Oil as a gift and when I tried it I was so impressed that I ordered the 4 ounce bottle for a gift for my friend who has the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;. She loves her gift as much as I love mine. It gives my baby fine silver hair a beautiful shine, does not weigh it down. I will be ordering this hair treatment often.</li>
    <li> instead of one bottle of 4oz product which was represented in the ad, I received two 2oz bottles.&lt;br /&gt;this is not what I thought I was ordering and actually is very inconvenient for me considering what I do for a living.&lt;br /&gt;I would never order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I do like this oil and you don&#x27;t need much at all.  It will leave your hair shiny, soft, and, easy to style. Because I have very curly hair I shampoo every other day (curly hair tends towards dryness) and in the past have spritzed my hair damp and added some leave in conditioner on the second day but not with this - use it after shampooing and you will be pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing stuff ever!!! It smells wonderful and really helps with dry or frizzy hair. A previous stylist tried to sell me a bottle for $50, so I am glad I can get it at a better price!</li>
    <li> this item is realy great and a sure hit if you try it,,it was detter then i expected, i was very satisfide with the produxt</li>
    <li> Just a few drops smooths those little fly-away hairs.  The travel tubes are good for travel or giving to a friend to try.</li>
