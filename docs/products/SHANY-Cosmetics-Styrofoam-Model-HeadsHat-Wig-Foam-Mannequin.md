<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> built a zombie lady on top of this came out great</li>
    <li> Very Nice, Thank you!</li>
    <li> THE SIZE OF THE HEAD LOOKS LIKE IT IS THE SIZE OF MY ONE YEAR OLD NEPHEWS HEAD. THE PRICE IS NICE BUT THE HEAD IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR MY USE.</li>
    <li> Use to store my Halloween wig, just to keep it&#x27;s shape...have other wigs, that are worn full time, needed a cheepie to store my Halloween one...this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Make sure you check the measurements because the head is very small. I used it to make a wig but next time I will opt for one that&#x27;s larger</li>
    <li> this wig head is nice because it is straight on. some of the ones with more &amp;#34;delicate/feminine&amp;#34; looking faces actually have their heads cocked, which could make for uneven styling if you are not as experienced.</li>
    <li> purchased several of these to use to make zombies for halloween.  they are typical female styrofoam heads (smaller). price was good.  Lets just see how they hold up for halloween masks, etc.  Only gave 4 stars because they are kind of petite sized--(I&#x27;ve never wore a wig so i dont know how big theyre supposed to be but they are smaller than my head and I&#x27;m a girl.)</li>
    <li> THIS IS CHILD&#x27;S SIZE!! This is not made for your wigs or hats. It is very small and can not be used to hold your wig while you cut it. It can only sort of work as a wig stand and even then only for very short wigs. There are better deals out there KEEP LOOKING!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a year or more for this styrofoam head for my \\&quot;Garden Lady\\&quot;.  I was so excited to finally find it on Amazon.  It arrived in excellent condition and so fast.  Thanks again Amazon for confirming the reason I always shop you first.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for a Halloween ghost prop! I painted the eyes black, glued an eyelet screw on the top, and then glued a wire hanger to the bottom to create &amp;#34;shoulders&amp;#34;. (There&#x27;s a hole at the bottom of the head that I shoved the hanger into) Then I pinned a cut up garbage bag to the base so it wouldn&#x27;t look like just a floating head and then draped several layers of cheesecloth over everything. When it was hung up with fishing wire it made a spooky looking ghost that was less expensive than similar store bought props. I would say the only down side is that the head is a little small to be a full grown adult, but for my purposes, who cares?</li>
    <li> Great product for the purpose for which I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Size is good.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Also very light</li>
    <li> it not tall enough. I thought that it would be taller, so I was able to find one in a store and it&#x27;s much taller &amp; bigger and it cost less too.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price and perfect for my many hats.  I recommend this product and I will purchase additional items in future.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these back when they were about $4/head, but I would not re-purchase them at their current price of $8/head. I use the heads mostly for temporary wig storage/display and as a place for pinning wigs when I&#x27;m styling them. I don&#x27;t style using the size of the head or its features as a guideline - the head is much too small for that. The wig head is also made of light, foamy styrofoam, so you&#x27;ll need a wig stand or some pole to keep it upright if you&#x27;re styling longer or heavier wigs (I have an old drum major&#x27;s baton that I pop the head on - the head has a hole in the bottom for a wig stand). The foam doesn&#x27;t have the nice, sealed look that higher-quality foam heads have, but it&#x27;s durable enough for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever were to model prosthetics or perform more intensive wig styling, I would do the plastic-wrap-and-masking-tape alteration to get a more accurate hairline and head shape.&lt;br /&gt;Tutorial for adjusting a wig head to fit your hairline and head shape: &amp;#60;http://silencedrowns.tumblr.com/post/33849463668&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;(if Amazon removes the link, search for &amp;#34;how to wig head hairline silencedrowns&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my wigs very well. . They tend to just slide right off.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the average size of a woman&#x27;s head but it was too small I made a wink and when I put the weight on my head it didn&#x27;t fit. But it&#x27;s good for with holder if you need one</li>
    <li> Served its display purpose, arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> Who has a head this small? A toddler? I tried to use this to make a wig but it threw off all of my measurements. Wasted hair and time. Ended up tossing the head in the trash.</li>
    <li> it work will for the wig i have it is a good wig stand it is a great place to keeep the wig till it is need for use</li>
    <li> A bit too small compared to my actual head, but it works.</li>
    <li> The wig head is a little small, but it&#x27;s great for displaying your wig so that it doesn&#x27;t get all gross and frumpy.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a visual model for a camera mount I&#x27;m working on. While, yes, it is small (child-sized), it&#x27;s properly proportioned and arrived intact. For the price, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is currently labelled as being \\&quot;12 inches femal head\\&quot;, but just consider it to be a child&#x27;s head - male or \\&quot;femal\\&quot;. If you need an adult-sized head, be prepared to pay 2-3 times as much.</li>
    <li> They are handy. Small head for my wig but serves the purpose. I have to put it on the edge of the table when I have my longer hair wig on it. Otherwise, okay. Arrived 2days after I ordered it and was in good condition, also packed very well.</li>
    <li> The display heads are perfect for the hats I make and sell. I deoupage them with paper bags because I sell in Renaissance fairs and this makes them look like wood or stone.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this item. I bought it to hold my grandmother&#x27;s wig and it does. It&#x27;s super light so if you want something more substantial, buy something else. If you are just looking for something to hold your wig&#x27;s shape and style, then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this item for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a really good wig head for the price, the only thing is the size is smaller than an average head. I did not expect for the wig head to be that small. The size of my head is already on the smaller side, and this wig head was just slightly smaller. So I would suggest that if your head is average size or larger, you should buy a bigger wig head at your local beauty supply store (which would practically be the same price) or use tape to make this wig head that same size as your own. But other than that, the product is really durable.</li>
    <li> Great for wigs and hats if you want to sustain a good shape and extend the life of your wig or hat!  :)</li>
    <li> I used for Halloween props. They displayed masks nicely and was able to use the Styrofoam stand to secure a cap around the neck.</li>
    <li> This is my home girl&lt;br /&gt;And now she&#x27;s chillin in the closet&lt;br /&gt;She worked very well for a mask project of mine</li>
    <li> I was asked to write this review.  It&#x27;s ok.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my expectations, but it seems a bit on the small side.  Almost as if it was a head for a child.  Would have liked it a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> The item does the job and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. The head circumference is too small and tough to work with for long hair styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the dimensions in the customer reviews, but was hasty in my purchase. The seller should include the measurements to their item description at some point!</li>
    <li> Omg, ew. It&#x27;s tiny. As in, a toddler&#x27;s head tiny. The wig just falls off of it. I got it to model my wigs and hats, and ew, ew, ew it&#x27;s too small.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose.  Catches stains really easily from wig caps but that is to be expected. I would buy again</li>
    <li> I was expecting a regular full sized head.  I didn&#x27;t realize they came in smaller sizes.  I think this size is good for a child size wig.  Or to hold a hat (which I&#x27;ve been using it for).  Great price just realize it is not regular size.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than anticipated, but otherwise great</li>
    <li> This is the size of a child&#x27;s head.  Wish it stated that it&#x27;s for a child, and not an adult size.</li>
    <li> I am using these styrofoam heads to display children&#x27;s eye patches. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. They are smaller, as the other reviews suggested.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re exactly the size stated, very white, not mangled or dented, no chips. They&#x27;re definitely female though, even painting a mustache isn&#x27;t going to change the heads&#x27; gender!</li>
    <li> Great quality wig holder. My daughter got creative and drew in a face on the front kinda fun kinda creepy lol</li>
    <li> This thing was awful.  You should spend the extra money and get a plastic head with some weight to it.  This head is only good for storing wigs, not for gluing weave.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, I PUT MY WIGS ON IT TO CUT THEM. GREAT FOR THAT.  OTHER THAN THAT  THAT&#x27;S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.</li>
    <li> This met my needs but the styrofoam is very soft so 2 of the three came with dents. One with a squished nose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, if a little smaller than I thought! A great help when displaying our photographing hats</li>
    <li> I love this wig heads. They&#x27;re much sturdier and you can sort of style the wig on the head to see what works for you before placing it on your head.</li>
    <li> This is so perfect for my many costume wigs. The price and quality are great.  Can&#x27;t wait to put it to good use.</li>
    <li> This is a great foam head but the neck is super fragile. Mine arrived cracked nearly the entire way through the neck. I needed it for an art project I had to complete in a hurry so I did my best to glue it back together so that I could turn my project in, but if you are using it for wig storage or anything else you will want to be careful with it because it gets damaged easily.</li>
    <li> but overall it works for putting my cosplay wigs on when i want to style them and it doesnt fall over too easily which is great.</li>
    <li> I love my Styrofoam head! I got this head because I made u-part wigs. Its perfect. I totally recommend this Styrofoam head.</li>
    <li> I got it on time but the head is very small which was very disappointing but you can achieve what you are trying to do.</li>
    <li> This Head was way to small to be an adult size head, maybe a child.</li>
    <li> The heads were a bit narrower than I thought. They work great for what I needed them for: hats and wigs for a musical.</li>
    <li> work as expected and are a good size, if your looking for a  Styrofoam head to have your wigs well maintained, then I recommend these</li>
    <li> The only thing I wish it had a wider base, but that&#x27;s easily fixed by gluing it to a piece of cardboard.</li>
    <li> I really needed this. It is great for making wigs. The wigs are very versatile with this styrofoam head. Love it.</li>
    <li> Wig fits perfect on it. Makes it easy to style now. Happy with product at this time.&lt;br /&gt;may buy another.</li>
    <li> This was a good value, and was just what I needed for my shop display. It was a great price and I like that it has facial features.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not really much you can say about a styrofoam head. I bought several of these in both men, women and child sizes so that I have something to model the knitted hats that I have made. They seem to run pretty true to size and they work well for fitting my hats.</li>
    <li> Used for an art project and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this for modeling a sew in. This is only for holding a wig off of a surface.</li>
    <li> Needed something just to hold my wigs and it works. It&#x60;s very light but what can I expect, it&#x60;s styrofoam. It&#x60;s very very small however, not like a normal head size.</li>
    <li> the head got squeezed in the mail, so it looks funny but it served its purpose until it fell apart a  few days later</li>
    <li> These are a little short and the head size is small. I think they will be ok for my short wigs but not the longer ones.</li>
    <li> I have never needed a product such as this head. It is very nice and arrived safely with no damage. Thanks</li>
    <li> Arrived when promised.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use when utilized with C-Clamp wig stand.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too small for my wig. and the nose fell off. It looks hideous now.</li>
    <li> I like the solid heads better, Styrofoam breaks easily, but If you need something quick to hold hair pieces this is it.</li>
    <li> The head is a bit small</li>
    <li> What you are purchasing is the same as the picture. This foam head is the perfect fit not to big or to small. If using to create wigs or hold wigs I suggest having pins to hold them down because it slips off easily.</li>
    <li> The packaging was well cared for, and was in good condition. Great price and best choice for a simple wig holder.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t an exact replica of a woman&#x27;s head, it&#x27;s a bit smaller than what you&#x27;d consider to be average. (But luckily for me I practically have a smaller sized head and it&#x27;s the exact same shape and size as mine.)&lt;br /&gt;It also has a hole on the bottom for stands and such if that is what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, good purchase!</li>
    <li> sturdy and exactly what I expected. I was planning on putting a whole in the bottom to stick on poles, luckily it already had them so that was a plus for me. I had a little fun and drew eyes, brows, nostrils, and outlined the lips, and put them on the table waiting for my wigs to arrive, and about an hour later my dogs where going nuts barking furiously as I ran in to see it was the heads.....A great laugh!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help hold the wig up while I style it and I must say it does it&#x27;s purpose. Also, the costumer service from this company is outstanding! When the one I have wears out i will definitely.will buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> I love using these things to put wigs on and try out new hair styles. Like for my halloween wigs, when I want to do something different with them, stick them on this head and i can see everything that I am doing to the hair.</li>
    <li> The nose came deformed, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was going to use it for anyways. It holds my quite heavy wig that is very thick, curly, and reaches to about my bum. Other than the nose being odd looking it&#x27;s what&#x27;s pictured and nice quality for what it is; a foam head.</li>
    <li> This would be great to prefect your make up signature style and practicing the make up artist art form. This product is reasonalby priced and the ideas to prefect are endless.You could record,take pictures for your portfolio with this or if you are a buiness owner for your shop.</li>
    <li> The head is smaller then I&#x27;d like. I need it to keep wigs on and the wigs slide around too much.</li>
    <li> Was what I expected. Strong too</li>
    <li> nice..i recieve this faster..highly recommend this to my friend.this product is in good quality and shiny.its good for my handmade craft to put on it.</li>
    <li> This is great quality for the price, love the free shipping.  This says it&#x27;s an adult size, but it&#x27;s a really small adult size.</li>
    <li> I received this today in perfect shape. Looks just like the picture and it&#x27;s super lightweight! Definitely a great product to have if you&#x27;re going to be carrying around a wig in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Well I had gotten the wigs and now I needed the heads to put them on as I styled them and this fit the bill</li>
    <li> I liked this wig head. It is stable and my wig fits perfectly. I rated it four starts because the face is a bit too realistic for my taste.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these heads with three wigs and fond the heads to be much to shall for the adult wigs. The title should read SHANY Cosmetics Female Child&#x27;s Styrofoam Head, 12 Inches, 4 Ounce.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed something other than my own head to hold a wig I was using for a cosplay.  It was very good for the price; it&#x27;s lightweight, easy to manipulate, and because it&#x27;s made of foam, it was easy to pin the wig down while I styled it.  It was just the right size for a standard wig, too.  Even without the stand (which would have been very helpful, but I couldn&#x27;t afford it at the time) the head stayed upright while I was working with it.  And because it&#x27;s made of foam, it was very easy to clean, and didn&#x27;t stain too easily.  The product came in plenty of time, too; within just a few days of ordering it, it was at my doorstep.  All in all, it&#x27;s a good, professional-grade product at a really good price.</li>
    <li> just as i expected and was on time.</li>
    <li> Needed something for styling/storing a wig for a costume and though this is smaller than an adult&#x27;s head it still does the job great. It holds my long wig fine without falling over even when propped up on something tall. Though it does piss my dogs off. Like a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a box w/ air packets so it came mint, no dents or dings. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Saturday and it was here yearly Tuesday, works great is light weight so if your looking for something to hold still when you brush your wig you need to anchor it down, try a dow rod attached to a block of wood works great lol</li>
    <li> I will be using this to do some cutting of my new hair extensions. I saw a girl on YouTube using this and it seemed to work great. Delivery was great and so was the price.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I had expected but it works well for what i use it for. Designing crocheted hats.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what kinda reveiw to leave, it&#x27;s foam and does the job.  It does dent, so try not to push on it too hard.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a child&#x27;s wig form when I came across this.  Yes, it is small, but it&#x27;s the perfect size for displaying children&#x27;s hats.</li>
    <li> This is a light, cheap, great form for hat/headdress making. It worked as intended and the price is right for this product.</li>
    <li> i love this : ) as a cosmetologist it helps out alot BUT.... the head is very small meaning its not as full on the sides compared to an actual head but for me it still served a huge purpose</li>
    <li> Bought this to display a headband I made. It&#x27;s a styrofoam head. What do you expect?  All the parts at there. It&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Not too small. When I bout it it, the price was 4 dollars. Excellent price for a good product.</li>
    <li> a nice head that doesn&#x27;t really do much but hold your wig, hat or helmet. it&#x27;s a bit smaller and lighter than I expected it to be considering I&#x27;m placing a large helmet on it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as ordered.  Looks great, nice packaging.  Has the standard hole at the bottom so that you can attach it to a wig head clamp.</li>
    <li> Product came fast and works well. I wish they included the&lt;br /&gt;Bottom part (suction cup) with the head. Other wise you may need to rig something up yourself.</li>
    <li> This is the first Styrofoam head that I&#x27;ve ever owned and I purchased it to store a costume wig in place of it&#x27;s plastic bag and to style when ready to wear. This head measures 10\\&quot; tall not 12\\&quot; &amp; the head circumference is 20\\&quot;(small) which is the perfect child size head....not quite adult size which is typically 22 inches. I have no experience with this type of product, so I&#x27;m unfamiliar with industry standards, but I expected a Styrofoam head to be both taller and a few inches larger.  However for the price, I&#x27;ll simply keep it to measure headbands and hats that I make for my daughter while she&#x27;s in school. I&#x27;ve ordered the [[ASIN:B000I6N8AK Styro Manikin (Styrofoam Mannequin) Head]] which is 15 1/2 inches tall and I think the added height will make it perfect for both storing &amp; styling, even if the head circumference is small.</li>
    <li> The wig heads came to me falling apart. It appears they have had a previous life before reaching my home. Possibly old wig shop. Expected more from a shany product</li>
    <li> The head is a bit on the small side compared to other styrofoam wig heads, but the sturdy base is a plus</li>
    <li> Makes it so much easier to style or store the wig I purchased. A need to have for any wig wearer.</li>
    <li> small heads, smashed noses and very small at that!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in your product.  I know these heads are not expensive and are pretty cheap to make; the packing probably cost more than the original product, but the carelessness in packaging, ramming heads in sideways and deforming the faces of these styrofoam heads is inexcusable.  I am trying to figure out how I can use them/alter them so that they don&#x27;t look like something that has been in a horrible accident.  I would not recommend your product to anyone and, again, am very disappointed.[[ASIN:B005ACLU3E Shany Cosmetics Female Styrofoam Head, 12 Inches, 4 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> The Shany Cosmetics Female Styrofoam Head, 12 Inches, 4 Ounce is good for holding my wigs.It&#x27;s good quality.I love using it.</li>
    <li> This is a good sized head. It is styrofoam so sturdiness is questionable depending on where/how you set it. My sister uses this for paper mache masks and other art projects.</li>
    <li> Holds my wig up perfectly (with the help of those wig hair pin things of course.) Without that the wig will just slide right off. haha</li>
    <li> This was purchased to display an original Indian headdress.  This was given as a gift.  Very satisfied.  Headdress looks great.</li>
    <li> My son wanted a star wars room and has an awesome Darth Maul mask.  He wanted to display it and I bought this to put the mask on.  Worked great!  Keeps the maskin the proper shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a wig for a year now and keeping it in the bag wasn&#x27;t good, The wig fits on it and it stays on even if the head falls.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how small the heads were. Some marks and impressions here and there, but all I wanted was something to put my wigs on that wasn&#x27;t my fan, and even if they are small, they work. My long wig mostly drapes off the desk I have it on while on its head, so I guess that is one way to solve the short length problem with the head as well, just be careful the weight of the wig doesn&#x27;t sent it tumbling to the ground.</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s cheap, good buy. My son is afraid of it though lol. When I want to keep him away from somewhere I just sit the head there haha.</li>
    <li> I love these heads.  I put molding clay on them and then paint them with flesh tone paint.  I put a wig on their head and a scarf on their necks.  They keep me company.  They are very quiet and don&#x27;t ask for anything in return for their pleasant companionship.  I like that these heads are very cheap and are shipped with lightening speed by Amazon.  I always buy enough of the heads or buy them in conjunction with another Amazon purchase to qualify for Amazon&#x27;s great FREE Super Saver Shipping.</li>
    <li> Gift for friend who wear wigs - she liked it.</li>
    <li> Wigstand strong support; great fitting!!!  Does the job!!!!!!!!  Buy it! Some wigstands topple over and become a pain in the neck.. This does not. Definitely worth the price for this solid &amp;#34;do the job&amp;#34;  wigstand!  Buy it if you have a wig or even some hats!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight foam head.  Standard size, holds my wig, but topples over easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll embed a small weight in the bottom to make it a bit sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing spectacular, but a good quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great value, and very lightweight. The dimensions of the head are average and it should fit just about any type of wig.</li>
    <li> my head came with half a nose and some foam chunks missing but it does its job, keeping my wig in place.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. I have a business where I sell crocheted hats. I needed this display so I can take pictures for my websites. Good price and arrived right away.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my mother needed.  She was looking for an inexpensive wig stand.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better price.</li>
    <li> These are pretty helpful with keeping the wigs in shape. They work great and were cheap. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> No surprises here...Styrofoam heads are Styrofoam heads and they do what you&#x27;d expect them to do.  Good price and good quality.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Shipped very fast. Meets expectations..</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price to hold a wig up... a friend recently went through chemo and this was the perfect place to set the wig.  Lightweight and the right price.</li>
    <li> This styrofoam head is just what I need at my store! It&#x27;s great for personal use too. I know a lot of older ladies who use these for their wigs and it could be nice for someone who needs a wig young or small. Helps so you can style your wig before you but it on as well.</li>
    <li> I have a friend who needed a few \\&quot;heads\\&quot; for wigs she was working on for different cosplay outfits and I picked up a couple of these for her. She LOVES them. They keep all her wigs so nice. She wants to order more!</li>
    <li> This cosmetics female styro foam head is great for short to medium length hair wigs! And this is a really great price for one!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my friend that is currently in hair school. I figured that she could use this at home with a wig to practice styling hair....and she loved it!  This is also great for young girls that want to eventually do hair! Great price, great product - make someone&#x27;s day and purchase this awesome gift!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in hopes that I could use it as a mold for my own hair making it eaiser to style wigs and make them...Boy was i wrong! I ended up having to make the head larger by using paper and flower and doing 1st grade arts &amp; crafts. Not so bad, if you are not using it for business purposes or for display. If it&#x27;s for personal use it&#x27;s fine, it is styrofoam and is not adult human head porportional so unless you want to put in work like me, go ahead and pay alittle more for real head.</li>
    <li> Quality Styrofoam head that takes a beating. I used this to hold my wig while not in use, and to style my wig. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was doing with the pins, so there was a lot of stabbing and restabbing the head to get the wig to sit right. Even with pins going in and out, I never ran into an issue of the styrofoam flaking off into the wig or other places.</li>
    <li> Very nice item!  I used this to style a wig and keep it in shape and it works well.  Will be back for a few more.</li>
    <li> Great size, worked perfect for a paper mache mask.</li>
    <li> The head of this bust is unnaturally small unless you are comparing it to a very small child&#x27;s head. It was difficult to style my girlfriend&#x27;s wig on because it didn&#x27;t fit right on the head bust, but I was able to make do with it anyway</li>
    <li> I recently lost my hair to medicine and bought a few wigs. This works great to style and hold them in place. My wigs are short so I put a couple on this head.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I will use it to attempt to style wigs for cosplay &#x3D;). Yay!</li>
    <li> This works great to keep my wig on when I&#x27;m not usin it.  Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and convenient</li>
    <li> ME ENCANTA HACER TEJIDO ASI QUE DECIDI COMPRARME ESTA CABEZA DE UNISEL PARA QUE ME AYUDARA UN POCO EN MIS PROYECTOS Y ME FACINO.</li>
    <li> The head is really small and the neck is really short. This means most of my (fairly short) wig just sits on the table, instead of hanging down.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition and timely fashion. Used this item for a project we were working on at church. If you need a Styrofoam head, this one is it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an extra display for displaying my handspun, hand knitted hats and it really came in handy.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> i meant to write a review sooner.  This is cheap and way too small. Like a child&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> this styrofoam heads are pretty good size. i got them for a friend to use for his wigs. and he logs it. they hold up really well and its well worth the price I i would really recommend you get these for your wigs.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a styrofoam head, but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank. Luckily for me, Shany delivers. Very nice and durable. Great steal for only $5!</li>
    <li> It is too small for what I had purchased it for, but it is what they advertise. My suggestion is measure your head and make sure you get the right size for your purpose.</li>
    <li> Since I often forget my own this addition is perfect for those Queen of Hearts moments. My wig also fits beautifully.</li>
    <li> Item was as shown.  Fast and safe delivery.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It holds up great and is perfect for wig display! I bought this to prevent my wig from getting messed up and it works great!</li>
    <li> I use these for Halloween and Christmas displays and love these for making horror faces or nice humble Christmas characters...all in all they are a really good purchase every time I have ordered.</li>
    <li> Fits more of a child than an adult, but it works for kids heads. I like that it works to see how my beanies are coming out for sizes.</li>
    <li> Nice head.  I am displaying my hat on it.  Received it quickly.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a head form for sewing project and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. The head circumference is approximately the size of a normal adult head. Base is sturdy. Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this to make a wig, but was a bit disappointed. However, I&#x27;m not going to give up on it. The head is a bit on the smaller side, but if you use this just to hang wigs on it does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these for some wigs I had ordered. For the most part, they work very well. However, I did run into a couple of problems. First of all, these heads are kind of slippery and I had some difficulty getting the wig on. I found that laying the head on a level surface made this easier. Also, it tends to fall over if a very long wig is placed on it, so I don&#x27;t recommend using it for wigs that are very long.</li>
    <li> This head is only 10&amp;#34; tall not 12&amp;#34; (the neck is not nearly as long as pictured) and its circumference is only 19-3/8&amp;#34; around! A small childs head, to say the least! It was just thrown in a box with a strip of blown baggies! Box arrived bent &amp; beat up the nose smashed in &amp; scars all along the cheek &amp; on the head! Those blemishes just added to my irritation on the size! I had purchased a 12&amp;#34; head at a local supply shop but the head was cocked &amp; just did not work for placement of facial features. So I thought 12&amp;#34; on this would be the same size around but highly mistaken!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Nice size, not too big or bulky, easy to work with.  The price was also right.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for the wig lover! The styrofoam head is great for wig storage or styling! It has a hole in the bottom for use of a wig head stand or clamp to hold it down so you can style the wig. Very useful!</li>
    <li> Good little head, but just that - a lil&#x27; head.  About 2 inches smaller in circumference than my big ol&#x27; noggin, but that&#x27;s better than it being too large!  I can always pack a tshirt on it and duct tape it so it&#x27;s the right size.</li>
    <li> I really like this foam head, she was essential to me and u-part wigs, I have put her through the ringer, but she is still hanging on, put clear tape around her head to help with measuring because this head is smaller than mine. I love it alot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the size of the average female head. Luckily, I don&#x27;t need it to be, because I bought it to display hats that I&#x27;ve crocheted. So it&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This wig form is as nice as it appears.  Great price.  Delivery was very prompt.  I would recommend this wig form to all those who have to wear wigs.</li>
    <li> Awesome item so far.  It&#x27;s lightweight and portable and perfect display in my bedroom for my wide brimmed hats.  May consider buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I love this. I used it to make my 3/4 wig and it fits perfectly on my hair. I made a YouTube video please check it out youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;-efDR5dBics  you will see how the wig looks like.</li>
    <li> i got a kick out of this stand when it came. it&#x27;s so odd and creepy, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described. Product arrived promptly and made the owner of the gift very happy. Thinking about ordering another one for her.</li>
    <li> these are a must have for wig owners that want to avoid matted wigs. and they make styling a wig much much easier than trying to do so while wearing it</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as I expected. Looking back at it now, I do wish that the head was a larger scale but for the cost and need of only one foam head, this was perfect! Product arrived early than expected. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> SO EASY TO FILL WITH CRUSHED MEDS!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive but not flimsy.  If you have wigs that you wear often, this is worth the small investment.</li>
    <li> The Shany Cosmetics Female Styrofoam Head, 12 Inches, 4 Ounce is good for holding my wigs.It&#x27;s good quality.I love using it.</li>
    <li> I love this Styrofoam head, It is great to put all my handmade hats and caps on. Easy to use, carry, and store. Very durable. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Just needed a few to hold some wigs that I didn&#x27;t want to store (and risk crimping) and these are working great! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly with t-pins and you can tell the styrofoam isn&#x27;t going to chip off or start to break any time soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a rubber halloween mask to help keep its shape for its yearly use, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I only have one wig which I bought recently so I have nothing to compare this to.  I was inexpensive and it works.</li>
    <li> I probably have a big head LOL but it works great. My wig stayed on and it sat well. I&#x27;ve only wore the wig a few times I just have it</li>
</ol>
