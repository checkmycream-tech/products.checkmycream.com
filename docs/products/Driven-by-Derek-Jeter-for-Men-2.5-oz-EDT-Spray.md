<li> Do you honestly think DEREK JETER would come out with a BAD product???</li>
<li> But it didn&#x27;t improve his ability to make double plays out of grounders, or any other aspect of his fielding ability, not one bit.</li>
<li> When Avon cut out the fragrances I liked, I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> We are thinking of trying the Driven Black next time.</li>
<li> just wish it would last a little longer.</li>
<li> but, my wife couldn&#x27;t care less about baseball...</li>
<li> Tried the Driven Black too.</li>
<li> Not overpowering and not sweet.  </li>
<li> so i&#x27;m a little bias with my review...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little yellower</li>
<li> I will put it plainly...</li>
<li> Not strong.</li>
<li> (Driven Black is not nearly as good)</li>
<li> This fragrance is subtle, but it made me want to follow the&lt;br /&gt;guy</li>

    <li> Super masculine fresh fragrance, I&#x27;ve bought 4 times for my husband.  He actually lets me know when it&#x27;s getting low which tells me he likes it too!  EXCELLENT quality for such a good price.</li>

    <li> This cologne has such a wonderful smell. I have purchased other brands for my father as gifts such as Aqua Di Gio and this is still my dad&#x27;s favorite. He gets compliments on it all the time. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and received it within a week from the time I ordered! He didn&#x27;t have much left and I love that it smells clean and fresh; it&#x27;s not an over-powering scent at all. He thought no one sold the cologne anymore and didn&#x27;t know it had been released again, so this saved him from having to switch to a different brand/scent altogether.</li>
    <li> a fresh burst of clean greatfruit. this colgne  smells soo good,  highly recommend to any age . you wont be dissapointed</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE cologne for men.

    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! It smells so good on him. We are thinking of trying the Driven Black next time.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband, he loves it and I love it on him, its the only thing he will wear</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling cologne on the market. Clean crisp fresh! Get compliments on it all time! I was purchasing when it was just $20 ...now it&#x27;s popular and have to spend $60... Such is life....</li>
    <li> Product was made in 2006. It&#x27;s a little yellower then the new (2012) bottles. Still smells the same. I love this spray. I&#x27;ll re-order this due to the lower price and convenience. :)</li>
    <li> now I smell like a rockstar again... thank you</li>
    <li> One of Derek Jeters best AVON cologne. I big hit.</li>
    <li> Avon discontinued this item...why?? who knows...it does smell very nice!!</li>
    <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve found in years.  A co-worker told me about it, I ordered it.  Tried the Driven Black too.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my boyfriend. I love that this scent isn&#x27;t a strong scent like most men&#x27;s fragrances. I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of my boyfriend whenever he wears this.</li>
    <li> It is not overpoweringly flowery. Smells as if you just got out of a clean shower. Not perfumey, musky, or woody, just clean.</li>
    <li> But it didn&#x27;t improve his ability to make double plays out of grounders, or any other aspect of his fielding ability, not one bit.</li>
    <li> This is my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite scent she loves it! She got it for me for a Christmas gift and it does smell really good. Anyone that wants to smell awesome should buy this!</li>
    <li> This was my grandson&#x27;s first real cologne.  I gave it to him for his birthday and he loved it.  It has a really nice smell.  Not overpowering and not sweet.  A good cologne for any man.</li>
    <li> I really like the Derek Jeter cologne and my girlfriend LOVES it!  It&#x27;s affordable and smells great.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone that likes to smell good.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is subtle, but it made me want to follow the&lt;br /&gt;guy that wore it around!  It smelled sooo nice!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe Avon sold something that good.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shippment. Would do business with again.</li>
    <li> Makes your guy smell gooood!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> It is a great iteam. Great price. I love it. Smells great. Not strong. Fresh clean kinds of fruity very nice</li>
    <li> I love this cologne its a light sent &amp; allergies won&#x27;t be bothered either. I buy this all the time for my husband, its his favorite</li>
    <li> Love the Smell! Woman love it ;) I use to wear it a lot when it first came out, but then AVON stopped carrying it. Thank you amazon for finding it for me. I&#x27;m a HUGE Derek Jeter fan...so i&#x27;m a little bias with my review... but, my wife couldn&#x27;t care less about baseball...yet she LOVES the smell of this cologne. GET IT!</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he has an older version of driven (warm cedar wood). We both love this new scent and its pleasant without overpowering. Derek jeter is the man too bad he snapped his ankle. Sad day for Yankees fans ) :</li>
    <li> This particular perfume was awesome without any doubt ok.</li>
    <li> Was surprised I could find it. Is the only cologne my son wears &amp; I can&#x27;t find it at Avon.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this on me. what more is there to say?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  This is one of the best smelling colognes of all time and it&#x27;s an Avon product!  I will put it plainly...it makes me want to jump him and rip his clothes off...lol!</li>
    <li> When Avon cut out the fragrances I liked, I was disappointed.  This takes what I liked, and kicks it up a notch!</li>
    <li> The only cologne my son will wear.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne for my husband! Avon doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore...big bummer. I hope it will continue to be available here! (Driven Black is not nearly as good)</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t stop making this!!!!</li>
    <li> Before it was discontinued, Blue Rush Intense from Avon was my favorite fragrance.  Then I found Derek Jeter Driven by Avon which I like just as much and can be found on Amazon at a discount.  This is a great unisex fragrance, it smells clean and is not overpowering.</li>
