      <li>Well thsi product is FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>For $3-4 dollars in a store (yes, it&#x27;s more on Amazon), it&#x27;s worth buying a replacement, though.  </li>

      <li>and It is better to use It with a different brush</li>
      <li>If you find the brush that comes with it makes too thick a line for you, this eyeliner workes great with the pointed cotton swabs as well.</li>
      <li>This liner is awesome for the price, it is VERY BLACK, stays on for a VERY long time.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is also extremely easy to wash off with just regular soap and water.</li>
      <li>This item comes with a little pot of paste and a nice brush applicator.  </li>
      <li>and I have to constantly redip, smooth it out on the brush and reapply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll prob buy a whole box n save</li>
      <li>so it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dont waste your money on high priced gel liners, this stuff works great. Waterproof, smudge proof (as long as you let it set), all around great! Works better than the MAC equivalent! My only issue is the brush. I don&#x27;t like it much and use a brush that I got elsewhere</li>
    <li> This liner is awesome for the price, it is VERY BLACK, stays on for a VERY long time.  The black color is very intense and I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this stuff I was impressed. The brush was cheap and way too stiff, but I had my own so it didn&#x27;t really matter. The liner stays on well and looks fantastic and smooth! However, it completely dried out after the first use!! I still use it from time to time by dripping a drop of oil-free makeup remover into the pot, letting it sit, then swirling it around on my brush. It works in a pinch when I need a liquid liner instead of my everyday pencil liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, which is awesome... It works... But mine dried out and had a terrible brush. Others&#x27; experiences have been better. I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I was a loyal user of the l&#x27;oreal HIP gel eyeliner. The product is good but the brush is weak and the bristles will loosen from the grip and slide inward so you can&#x27;t use it. plus the product eventually dries out and will clump. Anyway, I was looking to try a new product. after much research, i decided on teh Maybelline gel eyeliner. I went to 2 stores, walmart and rite aid and both were out of stock with the basic black. Seems lke a very popular product. As i was walking out, i see this wet&#x27;n&#x27;wild cream eyeliner sitting all by its lonesome. I decided to give it a try because as i was doing research, i did come across many positive review of the wetnwild. Well thsi product is FANTASTIC. The brush is amazing and the cream eyeliner goes on very smooth. you can make precision lines with little effort. it does not smuch or smear and lasted at least 6 hour in PERFECT condition (top line). Now bottom line, it did smudge a bit. I can&#x27;t remember if i did myself or it was the product. Either way, I love this product and I will be sticking with this indefinitely unless something else catches my eye.</li>
    <li> It was great for the first month then it started to dry out and became difficult to apply. I have to keep taking off the clayish top layer in the pot in order to get to eyeliner that is still a creme consistency.</li>
    <li> The product its self was good! I love how smooth it goes on my eye lids and the rich black color it gives. On the other hand it clumps up and I have to constantly redip, smooth it out on the brush and reapply. Once this runs out I will consider just buying a liquid eye liner pin!!</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever tried! It&#x27;s makes it easier to do cat eyes! It&#x27;s very dark, creamy, and it stays on all day until I wash it off! This stuff is also extremely easy to wash off with just regular soap and water. (I hate eyeliners that require many washes to remove. Very damaging for your delicate eye area and eyelashes!) I like the packaging. It comes in tiny jar that easily comes off and goes back on. It prevents the eyeliner from drying out! Cap tightly after each use. The brush is so small and pretty much useless, so I just use a different liner brush. Other than that, this liner is PERFECT! Why pay for M.A.C when you can get something way cheaper?!</li>
    <li> Better than any other. I love it. Creamy dark, doesn&#x27;t smear. Its perfect long wear. Im excited to actually go out wearing it !!!!</li>
    <li> The product is quick drying and flaky so it is very difficult to apply!</li>
    <li> This is great for all day wear. It does not smear and is waterproof so any tears won&#x27;t mess up your line. I personally don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with because it&#x27;s a pretty thick brush, and my personal brush is very thin so it can give a nice clean and crisp line. I love this eyeliner; however, the package isn&#x27;t not tight enough to prevent air from seeping through. I use it about once a month and can see the edges of the eyeliner recede from the edge of the container little by little due to drying, but it&#x27;s still very much usable. I would say if you leave it alone without using it (of course you open the package), it will completely dry up to the point you cannot use it within about 8 months, possibly a year. But for the price, it&#x27;s absolutely no problem at all. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a durable eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great color BUT it smears even when I put primer on.</li>
    <li> Pros: Really black, easy to apply, stays put&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Hard to remove, not waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this eyeliner! I just hate trying to take it off :/</li>
    <li> I purchased this in eggplant, which is a deep purple color.  This item comes with a little pot of paste and a nice brush applicator.  I absolutely love it!  I don&#x27;t even have to wear eye shadow with this liner, because I feel like the eggplant liner adds enough color to my eyes.  Again - I love this product!!</li>
    <li> Omg!!! I&#x27;m so I love with this. Please never stop making them. I&#x27;ll prob buy a whole box n save so I dont run out. 👌🏾</li>
    <li> everything that I thought it would be and better!!!! I really enjoyed the product in the quality of it. if I ever want to purchase this product again I know where to go.  :-) 5 stars all the way</li>
    <li> It arrived all dried out, so I was never able to use it. :( ~Susan R.~</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge at all unless you have make up remover residue left on your eyelids or something like that. Great for long wear. Would recommend. It&#x27;s cheap too, for a creme eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I prefer crème eyeliner because it stays better than stick eyeliner. I love this one because I have bought many kinds even more expensive ones, but this one has less of a mess and bleeding of the black out to under the eye.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner on-line and when I opened it it was hard as a rock and did not go on my lids at all, I returned it for a refund. I have never bought a gel or cream liner that did not easily go on the eyelids. This liner would NOT go on AT ALL. It&#x27;s said you get you pay for NOT true the Wet&#x27;n Wild Fergie Centerstage liner is GREAT it&#x27;s inexpensive and absolutely worth buying.</li>
    <li> If you find the brush that comes with it makes too thick a line for you, this eyeliner workes great with the pointed cotton swabs as well. Long lasting, comes off with baby wipes. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was a bit iffy about this product, but was surprised at how well it stood on. No smears or rub offs for almost my whole day</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite gel liners that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: With a good brush, this goes on very smoothly, and is very opaque.  It dries well and doesn&#x27;t smear, and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The brush it comes with is pretty awful -- it&#x27;s just too thick to get a good line.  I would recommend buying a smaller angled brush or a tiny liner brush (even the ones from art stores are better than the one in the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I am a MAC snob and never buy anything else and actually prefer this over macs black track. It goes on so smooth and stays on! Even when I wash my face I still have remains. This will be my new eyeliner from here on out!</li>
    <li> So I generally don&#x27;t do reviews but I am so unhappy with this product that I am compelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this twice... and that&#x27;s it.  Why?  Because it completely dried up on me.  I closed it tightly, but apparently the packaging is not airtight because now I just have a big block of hard eyeliner, of the consistency of an eyeliner pencil.  It is completely useless in this form because it has no shape that&#x27;s usable like a pencil, and it&#x27;s so hard that a brush is useless.  I tried adding some water to it to see if it would get back to its gel form but it did not.  This was a terrible waste of money.  I liked it the couple times I applied it, but only 2 uses is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the brush.  The handle is too short to hold near your eye without completely blocking your view, and the bristles are rough and it does not feel good against my eyelid.</li>
    <li> I really liked this eyeliner until It dried out after a couple of months. It is creamy and smooth and very easy to apply. Try he brush that comes with It is no good and It is better to use It with a different brush but the formula is great to create a perfect winged look or cat eye. The only thing is that the cap is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t close tight to completely seal the product so It dries out quicker than other gel eyeliners I have used. But aside from that. I recommend this eyeliner because It is good quality for It&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I got to use it once and then it dried like a stone. Waste of money. The only positive thing is the brush that now I use as an eyebrow brush.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of eye liners and they dont last  i love this on it really makes my small eyes stand out &amp; it last all day on me, it has not dryed out at all either I just keep the seal &amp; top on all the time great product!!</li>
    <li> I love it because my eyes tear easily and this stays put the longest of every brand I have tried and its the cheapest!</li>
    <li> Love this Wet n&#x27; Wild Eyeliner is simply goes on smooth not hard to work with at all. It&#x27;s a really dark black so it goes will with any make up artistry. It doesn&#x27;t smudge, it a long wear with high quality for low price. I would definitely recommend this product to any one who loves the beauty of make up.</li>
    <li> This was one of the fist gel eyeliner I ever purchased. It&#x27;s just a few bucks, and very good quality. The eyeliner goes on very smooth, it doesn&#x27;t tug. The pigmentation is very good, and it stays on all day. You might just want to buy another brush, because the one that is given to you is a bit thick and it makes it a bit hard to apply. Everyday gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> For about 3.99-4.99 I believe it was, this gel liner does the job and looks so sexy on your eyes. I use this to line my outer lash line and fling it up to create the \\&quot;cat-eyed\\&quot; look. This is very comparable in my opinion to MAC&#x27;s fluid line in black track. Ladies, it&#x27;s worth a try if you like gels.</li>
    <li> Best gel eye liner out there! It&#x27;s very black, waterproof and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Shipping was quick and easy too.</li>
    <li> I love this &amp;#34;eyeliner&amp;#34;, but I actually use it as a black lipstick. I apply it then add a gloss so it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips, it works perfectly. Unlike most lipsticks I&#x27;ve tried, this stays on for hours and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It&#x27;s a harsh black as well, yet it comes off easily with some soap.</li>
    <li> Great Eyeliner. Wonderful pigmentation also. Exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice seller also. I received my item on time</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is horrible. I would reccomend loreal gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for giving yourself the perfect cat eye.&lt;br /&gt;It is equivalent to MAC&#x27;s gel liner without the high cost.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little dryer than the MAC version though, but it works wonderfully for me.</li>
    <li> I havent found anything that I like about this cream liner...I thought it would be great compared to my usual liquid eyeliner but I was sadly mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the color on this is not very black...it doesnt apply on dark enough for me, even after layering it multiple times. It just slides together in clumps along my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it smudges everywhere and fades leaving me with raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that comes with it is complete crap, but i didnt expect anything fantastic from it anyways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah...may as well throw away this liner :(</li>
    <li> every eyeliner smudges on me this is the one liner that doesn&#x27;t smudge on me and is a very flattering deepest darkest shade of black for my eyes, other eyeliners do not look as good as this on me. its very hard to find sometimes and i am glad i can find it here.</li>
    <li> This is cheap but AWESOME.  Only problem is it dries out in the pot after about a month of use.</li>
    <li> Great product. I like it better than MAC&#x27;s Blacktrack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just learning about make up. I love this eyeliner. It lasts all day without smearing. They have a customer for life!!</li>
    <li> Ok, first things first. I hate the brush! But the liner itself is great, applies well nd gives that bold dramatic look! It&#x27;s ridiculously small.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZEBALLS I LOVE IT !! I have had the same jar for a year and will be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> I found this product cheap and crappy. The brush is terrible. Maybe if you are really good with eyeliner you can use a better brush to apply it but I literally through mine away.</li>
    <li> I had always been a fan of twist-up stick liners for a more subtle lash line enhancement. However, I saw girls with beautiful black cat-eye liner and I knew I had to try it. I didn&#x27;t want to invest in something more expensive (like MAC) without knowing if I&#x27;d like using a gel liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has great staying power. I can wash my face, including rubbing my eyelids, and it will not come off. It dries quickly after applying, so no worrying about smudging. The black color is a true, deep, matte black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the brush that comes with it is not very good. Do yourself a favor and buy an eyeliner brush (I use one by Elf, I think it was maybe a couple dollars). Another thing, this liner dried out after about a year. Once you open it, put it in a little plastic bag for storage.</li>
    <li> We don´t want too many people to find out how awesome this eyeliner really is! It lasts all day. It´s super easy to apply. I tried all kinds of eyeliner, from store brands to high-end brands, and I always return to WnW creme eyeliner. It is simply the best!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best and long lasting eyeliner on the market. I have tried every single \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; liner our there  and all of them start to crease, fade or create the dreaded panda eyes within a few hours, especially when I apply on my waterline. This one stays put and will not come off unless you use a make up remover. Knocked off a star because the product itself does not last very long as it begins desiccate after about 5-6 months and you&#x27;re left with nothing but a hard piece of black coal. But its cheap enough where you can just keep repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product cuz I wanted a cream liner with a smooth consistency so far so good. It has perfect pigmentation and glides on quite easily. Would definitely purchase again, it&#x27;s my favourite liner!</li>
    <li> Although this product is really pigmented and goes on fairly easily and mess-free, it&#x27;s painful if you wear contacts! I applied it to my fluidline, and was satisfied until I stepped away from the mirror and realized every time I blinked I could feel the eyeliner rub against my contacts, which was really irritating and painful. When I looked in the mirror again after it started to hurt, I noticed that the liner had begun to stick to my contacts, and when I took them out and cleaned them, the liner would not come off of them so I had to throw them out and open a new pair. I then tried to wear the liner on my top lashline as I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, but it was too creamy and just smeared when I tried to put it on. This will just be one of those products that sits unused in my makeup bag :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky about eyeliners because I touch my eyes way more than I should, and usually they come off/smudge/flake, whatever.  This one has never budged.  It has always looked as perfect at the end of the day as it has when I&#x27;ve put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never quite gotten the hang of eyeliner pencils, so I prefer liquid/cream/gel.  I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay, Stila, and other brands, and the only eyeliner I keep coming back to, for years now, is this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use it, it will eventually dry up.  For $3-4 dollars in a store (yes, it&#x27;s more on Amazon), it&#x27;s worth buying a replacement, though.  I&#x27;ve heard (but haven&#x27;t tested), that storing it upside down (on the grey cap) will help keep it a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people don&#x27;t like the brush, but I really do.  I have used it for every gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried because it&#x27;s stiff enough to get the exact line I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could keep saying how much I love this eyeliner, but it&#x27;ll just get repetitive.  All I can say is try it!</li>
    <li> I actually really like this eyeliner. It&#x27;s super pigmented, smooth, and easy to use. But the one thing is that it can dry out if the lid is not properly on, and the container is really cheap and flimsy. You have to be really careful about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s 3 dollars (at my local CVS) and the product is still very usable even though it can be a little bit dry. I really do recommend if you are looking for a thick, creamy, rich, highly pigmented, black cream eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh,but the brush it comes with is crap. Don&#x27;t try to use it because it is very flimsy and sheds very easily.I use my Studio Basics Dual Ended brush with the angled brush side.</li>
    <li> Most of the eyeliners end up smudging on my eyelids after a half day, but this one does not! I have very sensitive skin but this does not irritate me at all! Great product for great price!</li>
