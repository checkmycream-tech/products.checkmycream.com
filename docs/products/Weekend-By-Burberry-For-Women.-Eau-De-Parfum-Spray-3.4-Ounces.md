      <li>I love this perfume, it has been my absolute favorite for about fifteen years.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume based on the great reviews and I really like B-Brit, but when I received it and put it on there was a high strong note</li>

      <li>and if its not real its a pretty dammed good knock-off.</li>
      <li>the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping, 2 days.  </li>

      <li>Too Bad)I&#x27;m glad I only bought the sample I am going to try this from now on,</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and wear it daily.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Yet the impression totally depends on the individual&#x27;s preference, I personally favor this kind of fragrance which gives feeling of femininity with the mostly powdery, plus a hint of citrus fragrance..</li>
      <li>Neither of us had a problem with the perfume as it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
      <li>lovely..light, fresh &amp; young...</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>

      <li>My sister originally purchased this for me last year.</li>
      <li>Ther perfume smells different from the original scent.</li>
      <li>Burberry weekend is a classic sent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an older model</li>
      <li>Boyfriend recommended this to me since I was looking for a fresh, lighter perfume that would last all day (or night).</li>
      <li>It was a very large so it will last.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>Not super fruity or sweet.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t quite place, it was very like disinfecting way up in my nose (but I Am very sensitive to perfumes)kind of reminding me of final net hairspray (</li>

<li> Whenever I try fragrances by Burberry, I feel like it reminds me of some atmosphere of British woman in mid 20s - mid 30s rather than the active or athletic young girls.</li>
<li> And yes, buying perfume blindly is silly; but if buying over the Internet is the most convenient means to getting certain products because those products are not readily available to you because you live in a small town, then sometimes you have to make that gamble.</li>
<li> BUT IT DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG.  </li>
<li> now i know ...is just different from my previous bottle; smells last for 5-10 minutes...  </li>
<li> this product took a long time to arrive!</li>
<li> Came before I expected it</li>
<li> This size lasted my mother-in-law roughly 4 months when I got it for her in August for her birthday.  </li>
<li> It is definitely fake and not the real scent.</li>
<li> ...is fake  shipping fast ....</li>
<li> how can be half price...</li>
<li> IS THAT I BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON FOR 50% LESS THAN THEY SELL IT IN THE STORES.</li>
<li> Color appears slightly off too.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is a poor excuse for a citrus scent.</li>
<li> It is sharp and simply not good smelling.</li>
<li> I bought this perfume blindly based on reviews I read on perfume sites  on the Net.</li>
<li> I usually buy this in the store and figured I would try it online.</li>
<li> Stores don&#x27;t carry this brand usually</li>
<li> I have worn it for casual events for several years.  </li>
<li> My mom loves this fragrance &amp; since its hard to find in nearby department stores, Amazon was the answer!</li>
<li> but I was a little skeptical too order it offline because I was scared it would be fake.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m just addicted to the scent...</li>
<li> This is definitely a fake product !</li>
<li> It smells bad in the bottle, on paper, and on the skin.</li>
<li> but .... :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use to use this perfume when I was younger and then all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore! I searched al department stores and Burberry themselves and never found it. Recently I decided to look it up on Amazon but I was a little skeptical too order it offline because I was scared it would be fake. I ended up taking the chance anyway (that&#x27;s how much I love this fragrance) and it&#x27;s perfect!!! It smells exactly like how I remember it did and if its not real its a pretty dammed good knock-off. I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase and I will definitely be buying from this vender again when mines runs out! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Ahhh I love this scent.. I get questioned often \\&quot;whats that perfume ur wearing? lol</li>
    <li> THIS PERFUME IS VERY NICE BUT IT DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG.  THE ONE GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON FOR 50% LESS THAN THEY SELL IT IN THE STORES.</li>
    <li> This scent is GREAT for everyday.  It smells so good, and lasts all day.  Plus, my husband loves it.  What more can a girl ask for?</li>
    <li> I received it today, but when I opened the package, I found that it&#x27;s not the one showed in the picture on amazon.com, it&#x27;s actually another Spray (3.3 ounces), but I don&#x27;t want to change it anymore because I like its smell.</li>
    <li> Unlike the other reviewer wrote, this perfume smells good on me. Whenever I try fragrances by Burberry, I feel like it reminds me of some atmosphere of British woman in mid 20s - mid 30s rather than the active or athletic young girls. Yet the impression totally depends on the individual&#x27;s preference, I personally favor this kind of fragrance which gives feeling of femininity with the mostly powdery, plus a hint of citrus fragrance..</li>
    <li> Love the way this perfume smells.  Unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  Not super fruity or sweet.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this fragrance &amp; since its hard to find in nearby department stores, Amazon was the answer! It arrived on her b-day...free shipping, ahead of scheduled delivery!! Love, love, love!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually buy it from amazon. I picked it out at a store and absolutly love this perfume!  It is not one of those florally perfumes that smell overbearing.  To me it smells very light and fresh.  I get nothing but compliments.  I just ran out and am putting it on my christmas wishlist!</li>
    <li> I purchased burberry weekend @ TJMaxs 1.0 oz bottle for 19.99. I wanted to try something new. At first I didn&#x27;t like it. However, I put it on a week ago and It smelled yummy. It smells similar to Tommy Dreaming which I am trying to get use to. Burberry weekend is a classic sent. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I was wondering...how can be half price...now i know ...is just different from my previous bottle; smells last for 5-10 minutes...  so please save your money..don&#x27;t buy it  ...is fake  shipping fast ....but .... :(</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it has been my absolute favorite for about fifteen years. It is a light, day time fragrance that I wear almost every day.  I often get comments regarding how nice it smells</li>
    <li> It was delivered very fast!  very well wrapped.  I have purchased this perfum before and love the soft smell so I decided to purchase my second one, because not everyone carries it anymore, and I am very happy with it. The prices was even better than what I had paid with my first one from a retail store.  From now on anytime me and my family need perfums this is our place to get them from!    Thanks</li>
    <li> Ther perfume smells different from the original scent. Color appears slightly off too. This is definitely a fake product ! Never again.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume blindly based on reviews I read on perfume sites  on the Net. And yes, buying perfume blindly is silly; but if buying over the Internet is the most convenient means to getting certain products because those products are not readily available to you because you live in a small town, then sometimes you have to make that gamble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a poor excuse for a citrus scent.

Maybe I&#x27;ll have better luck with a Bvlgari fragrance.</li>
    <li> this product took a long time to arrive! the packaging was new and the price was very just!!!! Makes a good gift</li>
    <li> i will use this perfume for like forever..i&#x27;m just addicted to the scent...lovely..light, fresh &amp; young...&lt;br /&gt;delivery on point as always with amazon</li>
    <li> My sister originally purchased this for me last year. It&#x27;s a light, fresh, alluring scent that can be worn for all occasions.  She uses it too and I just bought her a bottle for her Christmas present.  Yes, it also is the original product. Neither of us had a problem with the perfume as it&#x27;s the real deal.  Happy Shopping!</li>
    <li> Came before I expected it so it was here for the holidays! Will certainly order from Scented Monkey again</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume based on the great reviews and I really like B-Brit, but when I received it and put it on there was a high strong note I couldn&#x27;t quite place, it was very like disinfecting way up in my nose (but I Am very sensitive to perfumes)kind of reminding me of final net hairspray (Too Bad)I&#x27;m glad I only bought the sample I am going to try this from now on, saved me a-lot of money  if I would have bought the full bottle! and also to flowery for my taste I like a more clean smelling scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I have worn it for casual events for several years.  A great everyday fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, 2 days.  Stores don&#x27;t carry this brand usually b/c it&#x27;s an older model but my wife loves it so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and wear it daily. You only need a small amount and this size bottle was a fantastic deal for the price.</li>
    <li> This cologne is of high quality and smells great, and my order arrive way before the time specified. This is a really great service from Amazon. I would recommend this item to all females out there who have a problem choosing a great cologne.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this in the store and figured I would try it online. It is definitely fake and not the real scent. Never again will I buy this.</li>
    <li> This size lasted my mother-in-law roughly 4 months when I got it for her in August for her birthday.  Great set up for filling out her Christmas list!</li>
    <li> Very nice and soft, suitable for everyday use. I bought it as a gift to the friend. She was really happy about it.</li>
    <li> I guess every woman has to have a perfume smells classical like this product, for me, it is a perfect choice, since it goes very well with my skin and stays longer on my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fragrances and this truly DOES smell like a delightful weekend feels.  Relaxed, sweet and refreshing.  I keep coming back to this time and again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Burberry scents and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.  It doesn&#x27;t turn on me like some scents do.</li>
    <li> the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
    <li> This is absolutely a NICE, long-lasting perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I wear it, I get lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the ideal every day scent for me!</li>
    <li> Boyfriend recommended this to me since I was looking for a fresh, lighter perfume that would last all day (or night). I don&#x27;t like being overwhelmed by scents and two spritzes of this in the morning leave me very happy throughout the day. I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that you can only purchase this through Burberry online or from Amazon now...so stock up while you can :)</li>
    <li> I just love this Burberry and so does my wife. It was a very large so it will last. Great gift guys.</li>
