      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>It is glass and a true mirror - not plastic junk.</li>
      <li>It would be good to have larger sizes also.</li>
      <li>Most of weight comes from the glass itself, so it is not hard to imagine how light it is.</li>
      <li>I love it for personal use and I love it as a makeup artist to let my clients get a gooooooood look at themselves.</li>
      <li>The folding cover is great and the different positions for standing works really well.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with it and will recommend to my friends.</li>
      <li>Very slim and easy to pack.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a lighted mirror, but find this one to be just as useful without having to replace bulbs/batteries, etc.  </li>
      <li>pull this mirror out every day, and right corner where I lift it has started to raise up away from the mirror itself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is just the right size.</li>
      <li>Great for traveling or using in a small space where you need to put things away when you&#x27;re done using them.</li>
      <li>This mirror is made of padded synthetic leather and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>A bit large though....</li>
      <li>I love the size, not too big but not small.</li>
      <li>Would be so much sleeker without branding all over cover.</li>
      <li>I use this mirror every day for getting ready or for when I am rolling my hair.  </li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t need extra lighting and being inconspicuous is important -- this is the mirror for you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the prefect size and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I also like that the mirror is real glass.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real mirror, not the plastic mirrors that have distortions and hazy reflections.</li>
      <li>Not exactly purse size (or for my desk at work, which is why I bought it). :-)</li>
      <li>I was very pleased it was such a hit with her and other members of her team.</li>
      <li>The black outer part is padded, so I feel confident traveling with this mirror and not worrying about it breaking.</li>
      <li>(drop off the kids at daycare without makeup -- fine; have a big meeting without it -- less &#x27;fine&#x27;).  </li>
      <li>This is a high quality mirror with the case, just what I needed.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this mirror, if you are looking for portability, clarity and ease of use.</li>
      <li>The size is large enough to do your hair, but not too large to tuck it in your luggage.</li>
      <li>The size of the glass is just right for regular use, also for travel.</li>
      <li>This allows me to sit closer to the window and have a large enough mirror to get ready in versus trying to use a compact.</li>
      <li>Its big enough to see my whole face when I do my hair and make up, but still folds flat for easy storage.</li>
      <li>As a mirror it is fine, but trying to get it to stay in place is a little bit of a hassle.</li>
      <li>Enclosed in a hard case protected very well and makes for easy traveling.</li>
      <li>The glass is crystal clear, and it adjust to 3 positions when standing</li>
      <li>For $25 you get a real mirror and the cheapest plastic cover you&#x27;ve seen for a long time.</li>
      <li>But the almost extraordinarily gauche, vile and repulsive quality of the plastic &amp;#34;faux-leather&amp;#34; means that, if you have any taste at all, you will put it at the bottom of some drawer you know you won&#x27;t open for long, long time.</li>
      <li>I spent more time than I care to admit looking for a small mirror for my office desk.</li>
      <li>She needed something relatively small, easy to transport, and adjusted to different angles since they travel and have to prepare hair and makeup often in limited space.  </li>
      <li>#34;This seems like a lot money to spend on a small mirror.&amp;#34; but it has been absolutely worth it.</li>
      <li>I try to put it in the first notch and it slides down to the second or third notch.  </li>

<li> Great mirror for traveling - often times when I travel for business the lighting in the bathrooms is horrible for doing makeup.</li>
<li> Finally, the cover is well-design, having three groves so you could adjust the angle to see your face, also thick enough to protect the mirror.</li>
<li> The notches in the black padding are very shallow, so it looks like the mirror won&#x27;t stay in place, but it does really well!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little heavy for travel, but it does fold flat</li>
<li> /&gt;It is not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> usually use this mirror on my desk, and I have to bend down over it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> would not recommend using this as your main makeup mirror as it does not have a stand and is awkward to place at eye level.&lt;br</li>
<li> Anyway, this mirror is small, folds down to the size of a small pad of paper.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this mirror 3 years ago and it has stood up beautifully to daily use and dozens of cross country trips. It&#x27;s the prefect size and very sturdy. I remember when I bought it, thinking -- &amp;#34;This seems like a lot money to spend on a small mirror.&amp;#34; but it has been absolutely worth it. About to purchase another one as a gift, since it&#x27;s really such a quality product.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Perfect size for face mirror. Enclosed in a hard case protected very well and makes for easy traveling. Great quality, worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great travel mirror! Compact, ideal sized, padded, lightweight &amp; you can easily set-up to see yourself &amp; work with wherever your travels take you.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of mirror that I have been looking for.  I use this mirror every day for getting ready or for when I am rolling my hair.  I would buy another one and also give them as a gift.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed for putting on a table when I&#x27;m displaying crafts.  It is just the right size.</li>
    <li> This mirror is okay.  I like the padding around it and I feel like it is sturdy and could be packed on trips although I have not yet.  I got this to keep at my desk to touch up on makeup etc.  I try to put it in the first notch and it slides down to the second or third notch.  As a mirror it is fine, but trying to get it to stay in place is a little bit of a hassle.</li>
    <li> Great size mirror and very substantial. I use it or traveling and it&#x27;s been very handy for doing my makeup.</li>
    <li> The mirror is well made and stay upright when you want it. A bit large though.... Not exactly purse size (or for my desk at work, which is why I bought it). :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my granddaughter who is on a competitive dance team.  She needed something relatively small, easy to transport, and adjusted to different angles since they travel and have to prepare hair and makeup often in limited space.  She said it worked great and many of the other girls wanted to use it, too!  I was very pleased it was such a hit with her and other members of her team.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, fits nicely in my makeup case for traveling. It is not too small, its enough big to see your face and hair, while getting ready.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of weddings on location, and this is so easy to carry and set up. I accidentally left it at a client&#x27;s house last week and I&#x27;m missing it!!</li>
    <li> Plastic stand has NYX in big letters all over it.  A bit tacky. Would be so much sleeker without branding all over cover.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-good quality&lt;br /&gt;-slim, easy to put away/travel with&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-hard to angle/adjust&lt;br /&gt;I usually use this mirror on my desk, and I have to bend down over it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using this as your main makeup mirror as it does not have a stand and is awkward to place at eye level.&lt;br /&gt;However, I recommend for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pull this mirror out every day, and right corner where I lift it has started to raise up away from the mirror itself.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a very nice piece.</li>
    <li> I love it for personal use and I love it as a makeup artist to let my clients get a gooooooood look at themselves.</li>
    <li> Great little mirror, and perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> I take this mirror everywhere. Very good quality and the cover is sturdy and adds great protection for the mirror. I also love how the cover serves as a stand.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for traveling - often times when I travel for business the lighting in the bathrooms is horrible for doing makeup. This allows me to sit closer to the window and have a large enough mirror to get ready in versus trying to use a compact. Very slim and easy to pack. Also great when traveling with others and having to share a bathroom!!</li>
    <li> Slim, well made, easy to stand up and adjust, nice quality mirror. Great for traveling or using in a small space where you need to put things away when you&#x27;re done using them.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my wife because she wanted a mirror she could travel with. She is impressed on how well the mirror looks and designed. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Great for taking to craft shows. It would be good to have larger sizes also.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror because I was scheduled for surgery and wanted a mirror that I could use while sitting in my hospital bed.  And something I could use in the future for travel. This mirror is convenient and well made. I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet, but it&#x27;s so compact and won&#x27;t take up hardly any room. It&#x27;s a real mirror, not the plastic mirrors that have distortions and hazy reflections.</li>
    <li> Very love this product. It is as the same as the description on Amazon. The size of the glass is just right for regular use, also for travel. Most of weight comes from the glass itself, so it is not hard to imagine how light it is. Finally, the cover is well-design, having three groves so you could adjust the angle to see your face, also thick enough to protect the mirror. Overall, I am very satisfied with it and will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is the best travel mirror I have ever had. It is so beautiful. The padded cover protects the glass when traveling. I also like that the mirror is real glass. The glass is crystal clear, and it adjust to 3 positions when standing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase another one to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I do like this folding mirror.  It&#x27;s a nice size with a great mirror.  It&#x27;s a little heavy for travel, but it does fold flat and I believe you could easily pack it in between clothing items and it would arrive fine.  I can recommend it, with one star removed for its weight.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality mirror with the case, just what I needed.  Will be awesome for traveling.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I spent more time than I care to admit looking for a small mirror for my office desk. I was looking for something with lighting -- but all the options available via amazon were poorly ranked or too big to tuck into a drawer.  I needed a mirror for doing my makeup at the office on those days when I was running late (drop off the kids at daycare without makeup -- fine; have a big meeting without it -- less &#x27;fine&#x27;).  Anyway, this mirror is small, folds down to the size of a small pad of paper.  And doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&#x27; like a mirror so I can close it up as I say &amp;#34;come in&amp;#34; and nobody knows I was touching up.  I still wish it had some lighting to help me see what I&#x27;m doing.  But if you don&#x27;t need extra lighting and being inconspicuous is important -- this is the mirror for you.</li>
    <li> This mirror is made of padded synthetic leather and is exactly what I was looking for. The size is large enough to do your hair, but not too large to tuck it in your luggage. It will hold up in your luggage because it is well protected with the padding, and just as a cautionary step, I keep it it the sturdy box it came in. It is glass and a true mirror - not plastic junk. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to bring with me when I travel. Its big enough to see my whole face when I do my hair and make up, but still folds flat for easy storage. I don&#x27;t worry about it breaking because of the nice padding on both sides. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror for traveling. No more broken mirrors in a suitcase! The folding cover is great and the different positions for standing works really well. Great product.</li>
    <li> Mirror is perfect for small spaces without sacrificing quality. I especially like the way the mirror stays in place when propped open and I love the padded leather case. Would make great gifts.</li>
    <li> Great product for traveling!</li>
    <li> This mirror is a substantial size (see description). You can easily see your full face and hair in the mirror, which is unique in a travel mirror. The black outer part is padded, so I feel confident traveling with this mirror and not worrying about it breaking. The notches in the black padding are very shallow, so it looks like the mirror won&#x27;t stay in place, but it does really well! Incredibly easy to set up as well as store. In addition to being great for travel, it is a perfect size for camping. For people who wear contacts or apply makeup, this is very handy. Much better than trying to prop up the mirror in a powder compact or strain your neck to use a mirror in your car. This would be a great thing to have on hand for people who sell jewelry and want their customers to be able to hold things up to themselves. It would also work for hair and makeup artists, especially to show people the back of their hair. It seemed a little pricey for a travel mirror, but I am very happy with it. I will be using this for years and every time I do, I will be happy I&#x27;m not balancing some little tiny mirror on my knee!</li>
    <li> Plastic. For $25 you get a real mirror and the cheapest plastic cover you&#x27;ve seen for a long time. The quality of the mirror glass itself is excellent. But the almost extraordinarily gauche, vile and repulsive quality of the plastic &amp;#34;faux-leather&amp;#34; means that, if you have any taste at all, you will put it at the bottom of some drawer you know you won&#x27;t open for long, long time. And you will hope no one else finds it either.</li>
    <li> The NYX folding mirror is wonderful.  It has enough padding that I can take it on extended overseas trips in my checked baggage.  I love the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; with three positions for better viewing.  I was looking for a lighted mirror, but find this one to be just as useful without having to replace bulbs/batteries, etc.  I highly recommend this mirror, if you are looking for portability, clarity and ease of use.</li>
    <li> I love the size, not too big but not small. I can use it anywhere I need, the stand works great. When not in use, I can close the leather case and put in a drawer or leave out cause it looks great.</li>
