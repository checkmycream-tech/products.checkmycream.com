      <li>Dress size 8-10 look great on me, by raising &#x27;the girls&#x27;</li>
      <li>Looks great.</li>
      <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s a great idea and even the dsign is great</li>
      <li>It works just like advertised and does a great job of lifting and providing additional support.</li>
      <li>It arrived promptly and is of good quality.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is good or not because I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
      <li>Fit well and made the girls nice and perky!</li>
      <li>and it feels very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Ordered two more, at that price a bargain.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my boobs look</li>
      <li>The size is inaccurate way too small...claims 40-42 more like 36.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Found a better product by lovefifi and size was accurate to 38 to 40.</li>
      <li>you do decide to order this, be sure to order a size up the first time!</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and if it just wasn&#x27;t cut about two to three sizes too small it would be PERFECT!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to fit.</li>
      <li>, they just didn&#x27;t get the details right.</li>
      <li>But it definitely worked to life breast and make them more noticeable.</li>
      <li>One set of straps are removeable, which made it more bearable, but not enough that I would continue to wear it for any length of time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; weigh 133, 36D. I ordered large.</li>
      <li>I have a 38\\&quot;-40\\&quot; bust, so I ordered the large, which claims to be 40-42\\&quot; bust.</li>
      <li>For a 36D I bought a large.</li>
      <li>really look at the sizes before purchases.</li>
      <li>They should really rethink their size recommendations altogether.</li>
      <li>This works really well.</li>
      <li>Got this last night and was excited to try it today.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 73 year old woman that wants to keep self esteem high.</li>
      <li>Saw the infomercial for these a while back and was interested</li>
      <li>The only reason I am giving it a decent mark is because the company was super cool about returning the wrong size.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update 6/29/12&lt;br /&gt;I wore this out to a graduation and barely made it through before ripping it off my body!</li>
      <li>Even with the larger size, it still fit uncomfortably tight around the band, on the last hooks.</li>

<li> Even with the larger size, it still fit uncomfortably tight around the band, on the last hooks.</li>
<li> There are two sets of straps that come from the back and cross over the shoulders neither of which are long enough adjusted to the maximum length.</li>
<li> I ordered this a few sizes bigger than I need</li>
<li> The only drawback is that they are a little snug, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just me.</li>
<li> It did not fit just as expected.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t worn it out around town yet, so I&#x27;ll adjust my review if needed once I do, but I imagine it will be very uncomfortably tight.</li>
<li> A few weeks ago I came across this listing on Amazon and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
<li> Way, way, way too tight!</li>
<li> and it *still* fits very tight, with flesh bulging out the sides, even after pulling my breasts forward.</li>
<li> Does what it claims but way, WAY too small.</li>
<li> Both sets of shoulder straps should be at least an inch or two longer.</li>
<li> However, they did NOT refund shipping, so if I want to get a larger size, which I do, I have to pay for shipping again! :(  </li>
<li> Because of&lt;br /&gt;the thin straps</li>
<li> Also, to hide my bra straps behind the bustline shaper, I also order some Bra Clips.</li>
<li> NOT happy with this purchase!&lt;br</li>
<li> I am a 32I bra size and this wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable although definitely not good for all day wear.</li>
<li> Makes me look like I have weird boobs</li>
<li> However, they aren&#x27;t terribly uncomfortable to wear at all.</li>
<li> it is uncomfortable and feels like it is digging into  the area medial to the shoulder.&lt;br</li>

    <li> They are back where they belong. Sad I can not wear this with everything because the racer back... Still love</li>
    <li> Saw the infomercial for these a while back and was interested but I never bought them. A few weeks ago I came across this listing on Amazon and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. It works just like advertised and does a great job of lifting and providing additional support. The only drawback is that they are a little snug, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just me. However, they aren&#x27;t terribly uncomfortable to wear at all. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it. Wear it all the time. Get 2 sizes up. Fits perfect.</li>
    <li> Makes me look like I have weird boobs</li>
    <li> The size is inaccurate way too small...claims 40-42 more like 36. Found a better product by lovefifi and size was accurate to 38 to 40. I went with the bigger size after reading reviews, but that did not help!</li>
    <li> The size I ordered was a L and when I received it looks like a XS. I end up giving it to my friend. I don&#x27;t know if it is good or not because I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> Go up a size. For a 36D I bought a large. Worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Does what it claims but way, WAY too small. Based on the reviews, I ordered a size larger than the size they recommended for my measurements. Even with the larger size, it still fit uncomfortably tight around the band, on the last hooks. There are two sets of straps that come from the back and cross over the shoulders neither of which are long enough adjusted to the maximum length. One set of straps are removeable, which made it more bearable, but not enough that I would continue to wear it for any length of time. Both sets of shoulder straps should be at least an inch or two longer. They should really rethink their size recommendations altogether. Like I said, it&#x27;s a great idea and even the dsign is great, they just didn&#x27;t get the details right.</li>
    <li> I had purchased  3 of this push up bra several years ago.  5 years later I am purchasing&lt;br /&gt;it again.  Does what it says, gives us ladies a boob uplift.  The quality of the product is not as&lt;br /&gt;good as it was 5 years ago.  I do not know if  the manufacturer is the same one.  Because of&lt;br /&gt;the thin straps it is uncomfortable and feels like it is digging into  the area medial to the shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the latter, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. It&#x27;s works wonderfully. Also, to hide my bra straps behind the bustline shaper, I also order some Bra Clips. Looks great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and if it just wasn&#x27;t cut about two to three sizes too small it would be PERFECT!!!!!!! They need to work on that...</li>
    <li> This works really well. It arrived promptly and is of good quality. I love how it makes my boobs look and it feels very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Got this last night and was excited to try it today. I have a 38\\&quot;-40\\&quot; bust, so I ordered the large, which claims to be 40-42\\&quot; bust. I had to let the straps all the way out and it *still* fits very tight, with flesh bulging out the sides, even after pulling my breasts forward. I haven&#x27;t worn it out around town yet, so I&#x27;ll adjust my review if needed once I do, but I imagine it will be very uncomfortably tight. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/29/12&lt;br /&gt;I wore this out to a graduation and barely made it through before ripping it off my body! Way, way, way too tight! I could feel it the rest of the day, even off. I contacted the seller to find out exchange/refund policies and they decided to refund my money, without discussion. However, they did NOT refund shipping, so if I want to get a larger size, which I do, I have to pay for shipping again! :(  NOT happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to order this, be sure to order a size up the first time! Or find it somewhere else!</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving it a decent mark is because the company was super cool about returning the wrong size. I wear a 38 E but size 10 jeans. so I thought the support would be helpful.  I went a bit larger and still WAY, WAY off.</li>
    <li> I wear a 36 DDD bra. I ordered this a few sizes bigger than I need and it didn&#x27;t fit at all. I&#x27;ve NEVER had a chance to use it. It was the weirdest, most uncomfortable thing I&#x27;ve ever tried to put on. This is one of the only things I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon that I just didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to fit. bought 1 size larger and it is 3 sizes too small.couldn&#x27;t even close the hooks.</li>
    <li> Over all worked well! really look at the sizes before purchases. I bought my actual size. It did not fit just as expected. But it definitely worked to life breast and make them more noticeable. I think it could have been just a tad bigger. It arrived within shipping times given.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. I&#x27;m a 73 year old woman that wants to keep self esteem high. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; weigh 133, 36D. I ordered large. Dress size 8-10 look great on me, by raising &#x27;the girls&#x27; it flattens the sides and tummy.  Ordered two more, at that price a bargain.</li>
    <li> Fit well and made the girls nice and perky! I am a 32I bra size and this wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable although definitely not good for all day wear. Helped with posture a lot.</li>
