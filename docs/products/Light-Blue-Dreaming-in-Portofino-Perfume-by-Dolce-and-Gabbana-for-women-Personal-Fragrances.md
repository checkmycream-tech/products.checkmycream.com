      <li>Glad I did though!</li>
      <li>Make sure if you are looking for &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34; that it DOES NOT have &amp;#34;Dreaming in Portofino&amp;#34; in the title!</li>
      <li>AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Plus the scent is amazing.  </li>

      <li>She liked it</li>

      <li>Very light and feminine.  </li>
      <li>Not my favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance on my wife.</li>
      <li>I love D&amp;G anyway, but, especially love &amp;#34;Light Blue Dreaming&amp;#34;!!</li>
      <li>Ongoing I love this</li>
      <li>love it will buy again</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance</li>
      <li>This buyer was ontime with the order and I am pleased with way it was boxed.</li>
      <li>This is truly one of the best scents in my personal opinion.</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments that I ordered another bottle.</li>
      <li>Its ok but</li>
      <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s more winter :)</li>
      <li>I did my research in many retail chains and this was a perfume that I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I found this scent in the duty free shop in Cozumel and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>The shape of the bottle also makes it easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance; smelled it first in the summer and thought it was a great, new summer fragrance from D&amp;G.</li>
      <li>Although the scent isn&#x27;t as strong as the original Light Blue, it is just as unforgettable.</li>
      <li>Some cheap knock off smell</li>
      <li>This is such a great fragrance.</li>
      <li>It still manages to be light but don&#x27;t expect any citrusy notes.</li>
      <li>the purchasing/shipping process went smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Keep it light, and its perfect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one is totally different than the original light blue, a lighter more refreshing summer scent, perfect</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it was love at first smell</li>
      <li>many of my friends have the light blue original and while I like it this one smells so much better!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never owned the original, but I have smelled it on friends of mine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not over-powering, just clean and tropical with a clean musk.  </li>
      <li>The smell is so clean, crisp, fresh yet flowery and elegant all at once.</li>
      <li>I love Dolce &amp; Gabban Light Blue and thought this would provide a more exotic twist of the fragrance I already enjoy, but it doesn&#x27;t have any of the exotic notes I had expected after reading about the scent.</li>
      <li>It smells clean and fresh- like after a shower.</li>
      <li>Wife says is a fresh and clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is a similarly clean smell, like the original Light Blue, but has more of a citrus, summer smell to it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better than the original light blue</li>
      <li>all the time it&#x27;s like the light blue original but more of a winter</li>
      <li>I was able to find this and ensure that I am going to be able to dream... for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I took a chance and ordered this without knowing what it smelled like first because I loved the male version that my husband wears.</li>
      <li>It is softer, more feminine, very sexy.. not as hard &amp; citrusy as LB, but still clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I was already a faithful D&amp;G Light Blue user but this &amp;#34;Dreaming in Portofino&amp;#34; scent is even better.  </li>
      <li>Not overwhelming; very nice; Quality, clean.  </li>
      <li>What a welcome surprise to find it here on Amazon for half price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually fairly picky when it comes to scents and while I like light, crisp scents the original Light Blue had never really stood out to me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great summer scent and its not nearly as strong as the original light blue.</li>
      <li>My wife is a HUGE fan of the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue perfume and always wears it.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe this would be like the original light blue</li>
      <li>Smells young and fresh- definitely a clean smell.</li>
      <li>People tell me they love my smell, but only when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
      <li>I took a gamble and ordered this without knowing what it smelled like first...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to simple mists, which fade over time, but its better than walking around with a cloud of stuffy cotton smell.</li>
      <li>The product arrived in tack, packaged well, and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I really like the original Light Blue a lot.</li>
      <li>More fresh/bright/citrus than the original light blue, and way less powdery.  </li>
      <li>I received twice as much product for the same price I paid at the duty free shop.</li>
      <li>So much</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants a feminine, but not overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>so much so bought the bottle there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and airy, but has a generic smell.</li>
      <li>More then I expected.</li>
      <li>really like the smell of the perfume as well and enjoys it when she wears it when we go out for dates and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
      <li>the cottony smell was too much.</li>
      <li>It really is a different impression from the original Light Blue.</li>
      <li>I found that odd as am able to return to Norstrom when I have purchased from them.</li>
      <li>the fregrance does not endure the hole day I had bought my wife the same perfume from a local store and the endurance of th fragrance was better.</li>
      <li>and it could of been the main even.</li>
      <li>Shipping was decent too as i live in Hawaii.</li>
      <li>- the bottle still looks new, used maybe 3 times.</li>
      <li>It lingers and I would definately reccomend it to anyone  looking for a new scent to try.</li>
      <li>so I will be stuck finding a new perfume when I run out.</li>
      <li>To me, it smells completely different from Light Blue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s similar to Light Blue but smells lighter.  </li>
      <li>This is the exact fragrence I wanted that they never seem to have in the stores, only thing that concernes me is that the spray nozzle fell off and now i have no way to use my perfume!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product for those who are looking for a simple yet very pleasing smell.</li>
      <li>I came on to Amazon to buy Light Blue and stumbled across this limited edition flanker.</li>
      <li>I was just about to go with a bottle of Acqua di Gioia when the sales lady suggested this limited edition flanker of light blue.</li>

    <li> The product arrived in tack, packaged well, and was exactly what I wanted.  I did my research in many retail chains and this was a perfume that I wanted.  This was the best price I could find and the purchasing/shipping process went smoothly.  Plus the scent is amazing.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a feminine, but not overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent, as do I.</li>
    <li> This is truly one of the best scents in my personal opinion. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t a limited edition. Its so hard to find. I purchased this then wanted to give as a gift but then was never able to find it again. Glad I did though!</li>
    <li> This one is totally different than the original light blue, a lighter more refreshing summer scent, perfect I bought 2 bottles</li>
    <li> many of my friends have the light blue original and while I like it this one smells so much better! the shipper was great, I got the product very quickly and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a new perfume for awhile and recently went into my local Sephora looking for a new scent. I&#x27;m usually fairly picky when it comes to scents and while I like light, crisp scents the original Light Blue had never really stood out to me. I was just about to go with a bottle of Acqua di Gioia when the sales lady suggested this limited edition flanker of light blue. I was skeptical about liking it. Fortunately, it was love at first smell but they only had the 3.3oz in stock which far exceeded my budget. What a welcome surprise to find it here on Amazon for half price! The only complaint I had was how long shipping took. While I understand you can&#x27;t ship perfume by plane by being a &amp;#34;flammable&amp;#34; substance I think it&#x27;s silly that the nearest warehouse they had it in was clear across the country (and I mean clear across).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it smells, it&#x27;s definitely got sweeter notes but is probably closer to a floral. It still manages to be light but don&#x27;t expect any citrusy notes. It really is a different impression from the original Light Blue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s similar to Light Blue but smells lighter.  I get plenty of compliments from men and women on this perfume...</li>
    <li> This product smells nothing like &amp;#34;Light Blue for Women by D&amp;G&amp;#34;!  Some cheap knock off smell and I CAN&#x27;T return it because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Flammable&amp;#34; but of course they can ship it to me?!?! What a waste of money. Make sure if you are looking for &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34; that it DOES NOT have &amp;#34;Dreaming in Portofino&amp;#34; in the title!</li>
    <li> This scent soothes me.  It&#x27;s not over-powering, just clean and tropical with a clean musk.  People tell me they love my smell, but only when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
    <li> Came in quicker than expected! Very pleased with it,</li>
    <li> This is the real thing I purchased for my wife and it was the same as from the local retailer.  If you are like me you may be skeptical about purchasing perfume on line.  I gave this one a shot based on the reviews and my wife loves it.  This is a perfume she wears often and has been for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Great smell but Scent does not last. I have worn it a few times and within an hour is basically gone.</li>
    <li> Smelled horrible. It gave me a headache and what&#x27;s worst I could not return it. I found that odd as am able to return to Norstrom when I have purchased from them.</li>
    <li> Love this one! smells like a hint of mangoes on a summer day! i&#x27;ll definitely be getting another one. Cheers!</li>
    <li> This is such a great fragrance. I have gotten so many compliments that I ordered another bottle. It smells clean and fresh- like after a shower. The fragrance last a long time, and it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it! However, it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;m constantly re-applying the product. Other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> Ongoing I love this I get complacents all the time it&#x27;s like the light blue original but more of a winter smell it&#x27;s a summer addition but I feel like it&#x27;s more winter :) love it will buy again and it&#x27;s cheaper the. In stores</li>
    <li> Awesome scent!!  Very light and feminine.  More fresh/bright/citrus than the original light blue, and way less powdery.  It came really quickly and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Its ok but the fregrance does not endure the hole day I had bought my wife the same perfume from a local store and the endurance of th fragrance was better.</li>
    <li> Smells young and fresh- definitely a clean smell. I took a chance and bought this over the original and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! It smells so enchanting!</li>
    <li> I found this scent in the duty free shop in Cozumel and fell in love with it.  I was already a faithful D&amp;G Light Blue user but this &amp;#34;Dreaming in Portofino&amp;#34; scent is even better.  So much so that when I got back home only to find that this isn&#x27;t a scent I can find at the stores.  That&#x27;s where Amazon.com came in.  I was able to find this and ensure that I am going to be able to dream... for a long time.  I received twice as much product for the same price I paid at the duty free shop.</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever.  It lingers and I would definately reccomend it to anyone  looking for a new scent to try.</li>
    <li> I took a gamble and ordered this without knowing what it smelled like first... I really like the original Light Blue a lot. I&#x27;ve never owned the original, but I have smelled it on friends of mine. I came on to Amazon to buy Light Blue and stumbled across this limited edition flanker. I am so glad I bought it. To me, it smells completely different from Light Blue. It is softer, more feminine, very sexy.. not as hard &amp; citrusy as LB, but still clean and fresh. If you are thinking of getting this, you will not be disappointed! Love love love!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best scent. I get lots of complements on it. Better than the original light blue but it is nice too</li>
    <li> I thought maybe this would be like the original light blue but it is not. It smells like bug spray</li>
    <li> AMAZING. The smell is so clean, crisp, fresh yet flowery and elegant all at once. Although the scent isn&#x27;t as strong as the original Light Blue, it is just as unforgettable. This buyer was ontime with the order and I am pleased with way it was boxed. Highly recommend this product for those who are looking for a simple yet very pleasing smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a great summer scent and its not nearly as strong as the original light blue.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance; smelled it first in the summer and thought it was a great, new summer fragrance from D&amp;G. I have purchased it two additional times since then so I am never caught without it! I love D&amp;G anyway, but, especially love &amp;#34;Light Blue Dreaming&amp;#34;!! You can wear it any time of the year.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance on my wife. Not overwhelming; very nice; Quality, clean.  Buying it again. More then I expected.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this scent. It&#x27;s light and airy, but has a generic smell. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am bummed that this was a seasonal scent from last year so I will be stuck finding a new perfume when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and I get so many compliments on it! I took a chance and ordered this without knowing what it smelled like first because I loved the male version that my husband wears. Great price, great product, thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite fragrance. I love Dolce &amp; Gabban Light Blue and thought this would provide a more exotic twist of the fragrance I already enjoy, but it doesn&#x27;t have any of the exotic notes I had expected after reading about the scent. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a teaser for her Xmas present and it could of been the main even. i was shocked but of course had to play it of but this is an awesome perfume and i was extremely happy with my purchase. Shipping was decent too as i live in Hawaii. Not too bad.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like perfumes that smell like flowers so this is perfect.  The shape of the bottle also makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> My wife is a HUGE fan of the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue perfume and always wears it. We were on a cruise for our one year anniversary and she saw this variety at a store and smelled the sample. She liked it so much so bought the bottle there. It is a similarly clean smell, like the original Light Blue, but has more of a citrus, summer smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Since D&amp;G doesn&#x27;t make it anymore, it&#x27;s getting harder to find at department stores and online.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell of the perfume as well and enjoys it when she wears it when we go out for dates and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. You&#x27;ll like it too</li>
    <li> Just what my wife was searching for.  She receives a lot of compliments when wearing the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is disappointed it has been discontinued by D&amp;C</li>
    <li> Wife says is a fresh and clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice perfume. In comparison to some other ones I have, I&#x27;d say this works for me for dressier occasions, rather than everyday. Be careful not to spray too much though, one day I did and it had that harsh cottony smell. Keep it light, and its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update- 8/7/13 - the bottle still looks new, used maybe 3 times. the cottony smell was too much. I cannot wear this anymore, as it gives me a headache. I&#x27;ll stick to simple mists, which fade over time, but its better than walking around with a cloud of stuffy cotton smell. don&#x27;t know what ill do with the bottle though! :(</li>
    <li> This is the exact fragrence I wanted that they never seem to have in the stores, only thing that concernes me is that the spray nozzle fell off and now i have no way to use my perfume!</li>
