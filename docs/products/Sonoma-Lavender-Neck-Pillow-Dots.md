      <li>If you are considering this kind of product then this review is for you specifically.</li>
      <li>However, if when you get a migraine, you cannot abide any kind of scent - don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
      <li>I have tried just about every kind of buckwheat hull-like microwavable product on the market.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was a gift for my aughter-in-law and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Wife loves her anniversary gift.  Very relaxing for her tense muscles in her neck.  She loves the lavender smell with the warmth after microwaving it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift, having owned a similar Sonoma lavender neck pillow for over ten years.  I use it regularly to combat neck and shoulder aches. The new one has a very soft cover and - if it&#x27;s half as   good as the original - will be much appreciated.</li>
    <li> I microwave it for 2 minutes and it does the job on my neck.</li>
    <li> I love this neck pillow. I get migraines and it helps every time. So soft and the lavender scent is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Super happy. Excellent pillow. Was using an electric heating pad and I kept getting stuck in the cord. The lavender has really helped with my headaches. It is strong, but I&#x27;m sure that will fade and then I will miss it or try to refill it. It is super soft, and I have been looking into buying all the other wraps just because I like it. My neck is the only thing that ever bothers me though. I did put it in the freezer and it didn&#x27;t seem to keep the cold, but it IS August so I will retest in winter. You will love this</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and is weighted in all the right places! It came very quickly--nearly a week sooner than estimated!</li>
    <li> Best Neck Pillow Ever.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great if they also made unscented as some family members would prefer no scent.</li>
    <li> What can I say.  We have had one for 5 years, until it eventually fell apart.  Bought another one since it was so great!</li>
    <li> I just opened up this gift from a friend, put it in the microwave for 1 minute and am now writing this review with the smell of lavender floating up from my shoulders.  I&#x27;ve had surgery on both shoulders and in the winter my shoulders sometime ache.  This is truly a very thoughtful gift.  The only drawback to this neck pillow is that it weighs 2 lbs 10 oz. which can be heavy if your shoulders are aching.  I would suggest using this in a chair or in bed and you won&#x27;t notice all of the pillow weight.</li>
    <li> This neck pillow is awesome....feels good, smells good and can adjust to suit your neck. Love the fabric because it doesn&#x27;t get too hot around my neck in the summer months. Just bought my second one! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My first package was stolen from my gated apartment complex.  The Company was very hands on in dealing with me and resolving the issue.  They had my purchase reimbursed through Amazon and sent another one right in time for Christmas.  Several e-mails were traded back and forth to keep me updated on the status which I thought was very attentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is reasonably priced for good quality.  It was a gift and the person I gave it to is very happy with it.  The only small complaints would be the overpowering scent for the first couple of weeks (this goes away eventually) and that it takes a lot longer to heat up than other similar products tried in the past.  I would definitely recommend this and buying anything else from this Company.</li>
    <li> I like it for a gift, and bought one for myself. The neck pillow is attractive, smell is pleasant. I use it once in a while to relax, and no regrets I got it.</li>
    <li> Well-made and a lovely smell!</li>
    <li> this neck pillow smells wonderful- it&#x27;s like being at the spa at home. I microwave the inside bag for 2 min. It does not get as hot as other neck pillows but the scent makes up for it and it stays hotter longer.</li>
    <li> This pillow helps me to sleep better than ever.  The softness is incredible and the lavender  smell is calming and peaceful.  It smells so good.</li>
    <li> I get migraines. In addition to medication, using a moist - microwavable pack like this really helps with the agony. I have tried just about every kind of buckwheat hull-like microwavable product on the market. This is NOT cheap, however it lasts longer than those buckwheat hull types. If you are considering this kind of product then this review is for you specifically. This does have a lavender scent but it is not overpowering. However, if when you get a migraine, you cannot abide any kind of scent - don&#x27;t buy this. One of these pillows will last me several years and it will retain the scent for a very  long time, but it does fade over time. The other caveat I think is worth mentioning is that any kind of microwave item like this will kind of &amp;#34;cook&amp;#34; over time with back to back nuking. I will use this for hours at a time and that means that you have to keep warming it up over and over - obviously. I have found if you just use it for 20 minutes, let it get cool and then nuke again - it will last longer. So....I have two that I use. In addition, unlike the buckwheat hull types they sell for 1/3 the cost in the drugstores, this retains the moist aspect for longer both in daily use and over time. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much, I bought one for an elderly friend. She loves hers as well!</li>
    <li> Smells great, and the moist heat is very soothing.  I especially like that the material inside doesn&#x27;t shift around, like in some cheaper neck wraps</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS NECK PILLOW. THE BEST. NO MORE NECK STRESS. HEAT AND RELAX. II is not my first one. This one is the finest.  The seller is GREAT!  Very happy!  S</li>
