    <li> These tools are doing very good job, they are not professionals but for first aid you can have them!</li>
    <li> High quality products amazing product for the price</li>
    <li> Very cheap feel.  The nippers won&#x27;t nip any cuticle because they aren&#x27;t sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also took weeks to get here.  Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> This was too cheap to pass up and, as it turns out, a perfect compliment to the 5 piece Stanless Steel Manicure Set in Black case that I bought for my wife.</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely fashion.The 2 nail tools are well made and do the job, howerer , this cuticle clippers are too light weight. They are hard&lt;br /&gt;to hold in position and they are not sharp at all !!!!! IMO not worth the trouble, it would have been better to pay more money for something that&lt;br /&gt;really works.</li>
    <li> Some people had said this is a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; set. I found it pretty good! The only &amp;#34;bummer&amp;#34; was the clippers were not super sharp when they arrived. Not a problem to sharper. The rest of the tools are heavy/good quality and I&#x27;m glad I got this. If you order from the US you might have to wait a while since these come from China - but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> works as expected  great price</li>
    <li> Great and to me seem to be salon quality</li>

    <li> only one of the three items arrived..it works very well,...,but I paid for three pieces....after having to wait a whole month to get it......don&#x27;t bother buying this</li>
    <li> Not an excellent quality, but does the job.</li>
    <li> Great tools, all work well. Great price too</li>
    <li> Very good quality tools.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I wanted. High quality instruments.</li>
    <li> thanks you my tools are very good. To fast and very good product, thanks you. The nail cuticle and the nipper remover are perfect for my job</li>
    <li> These instruments are VERY poorly made. The cuticle nipper is the worst - so dull it rips instead of cutting! The other two are heavy, too big and poorly shaped.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t send them back was having to pay for the return shipping, which would eat up the refund... Lesson here: don&#x27;t cheapskate if you expect decent quality - there are no \\&quot;free lunches\\&quot; here!</li>
    <li> Good prices and delivery</li>
    <li> This is a great sturdy set. Sometimes you order something and its flimsy but these are very solid, made well</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this was genuine Solingen products. I always have and used this brand, besides the blade was so dull:(</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I purchased these items. I waited about 3 weeks for their arrival and was a little disappointed in what I received. The very first thing I noticed was that the nail clipper was not in the package. Upon contacting the seller, they told me that they were sold out and would refund me a portion of what I paid. I never got the refund (which I didn&#x27;t stress because I paid peanuts for these items anyway.) The cuticle pushers were not what I was expecting either. If you look at the pictures that they provide, there are two different sets of cuticle pushers shown. The ones that I recieved were not rounded but came to a slight point on the cuticle pusher side. What I was looking for was a cuticle pusher with a deep curve. I was aiming for something that I can use for my cuticles as well as a scooper for my acrylic and glitter mixes. This item does NOT have a deep curve. It&#x27;s almost completely flat. At the end of the day, it pushed my cuticles back, but I was looking for the dual function of two different size scoopers for measuring powders and glitters. It&#x27;s an OK product, but definitely not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Was really awfull I&#x27;ll never buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> still a wait after 5 weeks so far. silly purchase mistake surely4 me. ugh!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this item. Buy from some one else.</li>
    <li> My cuticles have never looked better.  I use it on myself and everyone in my family.  Great design and qood quality.</li>
    <li> Works well. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Recommended seller, smooth transaction, great price, thank you.</li>
    <li> Good quality, sturdy, not cheaply made. Took about 3 weeks to get to me though</li>
