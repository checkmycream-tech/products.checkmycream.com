      <li>Makes my very coarse, very curly hair very, very soft.  </li>

    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I originally tried this because it&#x27;s completely plant based and has no chemicals. I like it and the results but feel I need to use too much to get the results. I&#x27;ll stay with it because it does control my flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> okay, this is the most amazing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I live in Hawaii and hair does not survive here well without good, nourishing and hydrating shampoos and conditioners.  This product is awesome.  My hair is healthy, shiny and soft.  Love it!</li>

    <li> Best conditioner without harmfull chemichals</li>
    <li> I recently discovered this conditioner on a trip when I ran out of my usual. I have a sensitive, itchy scalp, and now I don&#x27;t. I personally think the smell rocks, and have gotten numerous compliments regarding the smell when I pass someone. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love the styling gel this company makes, it is the absolute best ever! (they make 2 types, 1 in a tube which seems stronger/, 1 in a pump which is the one I use and love). So I decided to try their conditioner.  I like it very much, but I also add in my own essential oils which help my scalp to not be dry and flaky:  Peppermint, thyme and rosemary essential oils, a dropperful of each, to your liking.  I put in a separate container and then stir in the oils, maybe 1/4 cup at a time~ not the whole bottle.  That way you can make adjustments on the oils as needed.  Works for me.  I color my hair with a healthy brand of hair color and my hair is very shiny and healthy and I&#x27;m over 50!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for my daughters curly hair (she is mixed race) it&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells absolutely wonderful! We&#x27;ve tried a LOT of conditioners and this is definitely one of my favorite, and probably the most expensive one that I happily pay the money for when I can.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells great, is all natural &amp; gluten-free.  I try to maintain a toxin-free household &amp; sometimes find these products don&#x27;t work well.  Well, this shampoo works GREAT.  I will continue to purchase and love this brand.</li>
    <li> Feather light moisture.  Makes my very coarse, very curly hair very, very soft.  I add two or three drops of argan or jojoba oil when I need a little extra.  I combine this with the MGA shampoo.  Lovely.</li>
    <li> My hair looks &amp; feels great, texture is very soft color looks great and it is also very light and buoyant. This would have to best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive ones</li>
    <li> I love that they have the big bottles.  This stuff is the best</li>
    <li> I love the way it leaves hair feel silky.  It doesn&#x27;t take much either. I have not notice it adding to the problem on my scalp it does help with the itch.  The only con is it stinks.</li>
