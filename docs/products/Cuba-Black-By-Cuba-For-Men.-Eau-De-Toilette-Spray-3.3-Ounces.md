      <li>Very Satisfied, it has a very good smell,</li>
      <li>I bought my husband every kind they offer!</li>
      <li>VERY STRONG FRAGRANCE .....</li>
      <li>Swells good but wears away too quickly.</li>
      <li>The wonderful long smelling nicely, water.</li>
      <li>More linear.</li>
      <li>This is easily my favorite.</li>
      <li>REALLY GOOD FRESH SMELL</li>
      <li>ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY BROTHER IN LAW, HE SAID THAT IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD COLODNE.</li>
      <li>Wonderful cologne last long smells great and the price is amazing...</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this cologne, Cuba colognes are fantastic, affordable, cool bottles and</li>
      <li>Packaging is very cool and unique as well</li>
      <li>It does not smell cheap at all.</li>
      <li>the smell is fabulous...</li>
      <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
      <li>But trust me not even a frag head would know you weren&#x27;t wearing the original.</li>
      <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>My previous experience with this brand was pretty good.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price.</li>
      <li>This juice is a perfect copy of Azzaro pour homme on the dry down.</li>
      <li>smell pretty good but needs to be a little stronger.</li>
      <li>my husband loves this item and this was the first time I had purchased it from you company, and I will continue to buy this item he loves it and asked why had I not got it before, but now I will be buying it from you</li>
      <li>Probably because this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>When I first smelled the Cuba line I was sold.</li>
      <li>The odiferous scent is extremely pleasing and refreshing, plus it&#x27;s not to over powering, I own eight of the many different Cuba varieties offered and will be purchasing the others in the future.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it can smell so natural and rich for 10 bucks.</li>
      <li>The sillage and longevity aren&#x27;t as great as azzaro, probably due to lesser quality ingrediants, but for the price, just reapply.  </li>
      <li>I just like to smell like a real man.</li>
      <li>Which is an absolute masterpiece.</li>
      <li>Wow, what a strong deep scent.</li>
      <li>The black one has a very strong smell that&#x27;s more like a heavy artillery fuel.</li>
      <li>, IT IS A DECENT SCENT</li>
      <li>It smells so similar, and it is a good price, however it does not last very long.  </li>
      <li>ordered the black because I enjoy the Gold so so much, but the smell is somewhat fant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It smells ok, a little generic to be honest but my biggest gripe is that it doesnt last long on hubby&#x27;s clothes, 5 minutes tops</li>
      <li>For a few bucks more you could get a Nautica blue or classic EDT.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last whole day though.</li>
      <li>HE WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT DISSAPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS \\&quot;HAVANA\\&quot;, WHICH IS NOT ABLE TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE.</li>
      <li>I am a massive azzaro Ph fan, and once the original dries down I can&#x27;t smell the difference to save my life.  </li>
      <li>But that being said at a third the price, its so close, I might just replace my azzaro with a super size Cuba black magnum, when I run out.</li>
      <li>Cuba is similar in the top and mid notes to azzaro, but doesn&#x27;t smell as complex.</li>

    <li> Great, the best undoubtedly brought everything indicated by the publication, is great quality, has exceeded my expectations. Great buy. From Venezuela recommend</li>
    <li> I have bought all the expensive colognes over the years. When I first smelled the Cuba line I was sold. My girl says the Cuba Gold is the best she has ever smelled.</li>
    <li> This juice is a perfect copy of Azzaro pour homme on the dry down. I am a massive azzaro Ph fan, and once the original dries down I can&#x27;t smell the difference to save my life.  Cuba is similar in the top and mid notes to azzaro, but doesn&#x27;t smell as complex. More linear. But that being said at a third the price, its so close, I might just replace my azzaro with a super size Cuba black magnum, when I run out. And this from an azzaro Ph fanboy. The sillage and longevity aren&#x27;t as great as azzaro, probably due to lesser quality ingrediants, but for the price, just reapply.  It does not smell cheap at all. Some of the best juice on the planet for the price. I don&#x27;t know how it can smell so natural and rich for 10 bucks. Azzaro Ph budget version. But trust me not even a frag head would know you weren&#x27;t wearing the original. Which is an absolute masterpiece. And no I&#x27;m not from the 70s or 80s. I just like to smell like a real man. And Cuba black/azzaro does that. Use either or with moderation.</li>
    <li> This is a knock-off of Ralph Lauren Polo.  It smells so similar, and it is a good price, however it does not last very long.  But for the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> VERY STRONG FRAGRANCE .....</li>
    <li> The wonderful long smelling nicely, water.</li>
    <li> The odiferous scent is extremely pleasing and refreshing, plus it&#x27;s not to over powering, I own eight of the many different Cuba varieties offered and will be purchasing the others in the future. I personally like all of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased. The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price. Packaging is very cool and unique as well and it&#x27;s compliments my perfumery/cologne display collection.</li>
    <li> It is not what I expected for this product. It seems like imitation, because it smell does not last long</li>
    <li> The black one has a very strong smell that&#x27;s more like a heavy artillery fuel. My wife hates it and it&#x27;s not my preferred.</li>
    <li> Among the Cuba black, royal and gold... This is easily my favorite. Probably because this is exactly what I was looking for. This has that slight spicy cinnamony tobacco leathery fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t last whole day though.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a strong deep scent.</li>
    <li> It smells ok, a little generic to be honest but my biggest gripe is that it doesnt last long on hubby&#x27;s clothes, 5 minutes tops, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s been watered down drastically. For a few bucks more you could get a Nautica blue or classic EDT.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this item and this was the first time I had purchased it from you company, and I will continue to buy this item he loves it and asked why had I not got it before, but now I will be buying it from you the smell is fabulous... so Yes I wll recommend to my friends and family....Thank you....</li>
    <li> Very Satisfied, it has a very good smell,</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> not a very nice smell, and it doesnt stays long, for the price what can you expect</li>
    <li> this is a must have. smells great. not too heavy or over powering. makes a perfect gift, and travels well with the metal containers. also come in range of great smells. especially the black</li>
    <li> My previous experience with this brand was pretty good. However, this last purchase did not last as long.  The cologne wears out within an hour or two.</li>
    <li> Swells good but wears away too quickly.</li>
    <li> ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY BROTHER IN LAW, HE SAID THAT IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD COLODNE. HE WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT DISSAPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS \\&quot;HAVANA\\&quot;, WHICH IS NOT ABLE TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE. BOTTOM LINE, IT IS A DECENT SCENT AND HE IS HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cologne, Cuba colognes are fantastic, affordable, cool bottles and all of them smell AWESOME!  I bought my husband every kind they offer!</li>
    <li> REALLY GOOD FRESH SMELL</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne last long smells great and the price is amazing...</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I LOVE CUBA GOLD!!!!! My lady loves to smell me in Cuba Gold.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the black because I enjoy the Gold so so much, but the smell is somewhat fant.&lt;br /&gt;I smell pretty good but needs to be a little stronger.</li>
