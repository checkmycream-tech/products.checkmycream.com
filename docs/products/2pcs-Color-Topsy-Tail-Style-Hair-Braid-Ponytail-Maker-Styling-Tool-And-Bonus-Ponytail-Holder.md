      <li>You can learn how to use this loop with a whole lot of variety videos on YouTube.</li>

      <li>My granddaughter said that this really doesn&#x27;t work like.  </li>

    <li> This very cheaply made so called Topsy Tail Style Hair Braid Ponytail Maker Styling Tool was so super flimsy that it was broken before we even got a chance to use it. I want my money back!!!!  Do not purchase this product!!!</li>
    <li> Flimsy. Just waiting for them to break.</li>
    <li> Not the name brand item, came in a package all in Chinese . Boo</li>
    <li> Cheaply made! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Total knockoff junk.  Thin plastic.  NOT a real Topsy Tail.  Fake and terrible quality. Cheap.</li>
    <li> I used these as a teen and when I saw them was so excited to have them back again.  So easy to use and makes your hair look professionally done.</li>
    <li> My daughter is # had has hair that is almost to her butt. I love this product because it makes it easy to make her hair look cute when im running low on time, or even just to sit around the house. It doesn&#x27;t hurt her and she likes the end results. I would recommend this product for anyone. Even would be easy for dads to do.</li>
    <li> used these when my kids were young, it was fun to see them again.  Wish I had gotten more, since I gave these to my daughter to use for my granddaughter, but as always, its something fun and different to do with our hair, and not difficult.</li>
    <li> Already broken!   It did not last long! The plastic is too thin not very strong! I do not recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice - really helps to give you more options with longer hair   But it broke on third use....  Will look for a better quality one next time</li>
    <li> I have tried many of these topsy turvy twists but this one seemed to disappoint. Even though the price is cheap, for this same product the prices often change and the quality is questionable. Not my favorite purchase.</li>
    <li> Look at another topsy tail option mine broke after using it twice. Cheaply made. I hope I can get them to send me a new one.</li>
    <li> it works really good on long hair</li>
    <li> Same kind of hair product from the past.&lt;br /&gt;It is now kinda flimsy - not the sturdy plastic originally&lt;br /&gt;made. Still it works the same. Made in China so that was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Directions were in Chinese but came with photos to demo how to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now comes in a pair with a mini one.</li>
    <li> These topsy styling tool I USE THEM A LOT MY 7/O little princess has a VERY looooong hair so, I am always making new hair do&#x27;s for her and I want to say that this is my main tool I use to create those very nice styles.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic one broke within a week</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I used it not worth buying...</li>
    <li> When I had long hair I was still working at a job that had hair style protocols &amp; these made such a ego boost to boring buns. Now my granddaughters think I&#x27;m quite the miricle worker between the Topsy Tail Stylers &amp; great tutorials on YOUTUBE, what a fantastic duo.</li>
    <li> They work great, but they break very quickly, we get to use them for a few weeks and we have to buy another set.</li>
    <li> I have had a pair of these hair stylers before and they have been lost or broken. I bought the smaller set but now I can put one in each bag or area I have hair tools. Will be able to find one when I need it. Between the directions and your imagination, you can make many styles.  They are flexible, easy to use and the simpler styles are very easy to do.  As you get used too using the tool, like where to place the band, you will be able to play with other ideas.  Love mine. You do not have to have really long hair to use this tool.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool for my granddaughters hair!</li>
    <li> Quality wasn&#x27;t great, extremely flimsy. I ordered this for a girl who loves to do fun designs with her hair. She enjoyed it, but I was hoping for something a little better.</li>
    <li> I ordered three sets, because I intended to give them as gifts.  The design is ingenious.  However, after using the large size twice, it broke. I am now using set #2 for myself.  I wish I could get this product made more durably, because these are too lightweight to last.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and flimsy! Do not waste your money! It broke the first time I used it. I wouldn&#x27;t give it any stars!</li>
    <li> Gave as gifts.  Given to families with young girls who had long hair.  Mothers were so happy to get them.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a long fine hair and this tool helps me to make cute hair styles on her hair. It is a fragile item like any hair tool.</li>
    <li> Too much fun and easy to make your hair look as though you went to a lot of effort</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these when they first came out in the late &#x27;80&#x27;s or early &#x27;90&#x27;s, this one was a lot cheaper and it broke.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter said that this really doesn&#x27;t work like.  Said the smaller was a little better, but it was big disappointment all around.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little tool that works very well.  The only reason I have it 4 stars is because I got two of them in the package (one large and one small) and the small one broke pretty quickly.  It probably would not have been a problem for someone with not-so-think of hair:-)</li>
    <li> I like it for longer hair and it makes it easier to use than to try to wind my own hair through itself.</li>
    <li> The twins loved playing with these</li>
    <li> They are plastic, what can I say, they do what they were intended to do.  My daughter loves them, easy to use.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is pretty expensive considering they are just some flimsy pieces of plastic, but I&#x27;m not about to make them from scratch either.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this item via internet, as I was unable to find it in any store. However,they stretched and broke after the first two uses. I am very disappointed. If I could find this same item made of stronger material, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thin hair and altgough this worked well the first couple of times about less than a week the loop broke.</li>
    <li> I love this product as I had it a long time ago and misplaced it. The product arrived and is in great condition and works well! The back of the card is in Chinese I think so if there are tips on hairstyles, I cannot read them and will look the styles up on the internet to get instructions.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my wife was looking for.  She had some of these many years ago, and had lost most of them.  Her hair is now long as it was many years ago, and these fit the bill.  Shipping was done in a timely manner, and price was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brand name tipsy tail, but these work fine. Flexible and they come with different sizes for different updo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughters hair. It&#x27;s quick and makes the cutest styles for her to go to daycare. Being a working mom who has to leave the house before 6AM can get hard sometimes with the motivation to get up and get the whole house ready. These are perfect for what I needed them fore. It came with a big one and a small one. They are a bit flimsy, but that&#x27;s better for my daughters tender head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dad with two girls. 3,5 and 2 years of age. My first daughter has a long straight hair, it reached her lower back already, so this product help me to easily braid or make a ponytail for her daily active day. You can learn how to use this loop with a whole lot of variety videos on YouTube. Happy daughter makes me a happy dad!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, works on my thick curly hair (with a little extra trying) and easily works on my daughters straight hair.</li>
    <li> These broke immediately.  Total waste of money!  Don&#x27;t bother buying, they are too thin.  Just not&lt;br /&gt;sturdy enough.  save your money</li>
    <li> If I could give this a zero I would.  They broke the first time I used them.  Do not spend your money on these...I bought 3 and I wish I would have looked for the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Topsy Tail.  I have since found them at hairflairaccessories.com  Made by Conair.  They work like a dream.</li>
    <li> the large loop broke first time I used it&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend everyone to buy different brand  I was so looking forward to trying it on my granddaughter</li>
    <li> Flimsy. Works well on my thin hair, but will not pull my daughter&#x27;s thick hair through for the style.</li>
    <li> Broken when I received it. Very flimsy. Would not recommend this item to anyone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made with cheap plastic. Just same thing as you can get it from dollar store. It cannot hold my hair at all therefore there was no use of making some style. Do not buy...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has think long hair.  This product was awful.  The point that goes  into the hair first had plastic peices that stuck out so it was getting caught on her hair and pulling it.  The plastic piece on the top was too weak and couldn&#x27;t pull the hair through the pony tail.  this is an awful awful product.</li>
    <li> Buyer BeWARE!!!! Do you see a set of three Black, Blue and Pink. Well that&#x27;s just to make u think you get all three. You have to read the order which is for 1 of the 3 show here. Way over priced for 1.</li>
    <li> we have used it several times.  make sure you leave some slack in the hair when you invert the ponytail...or it will pull really tight to the scalp in some places.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money... broke after 3rd use... very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this is a knock off and not the real product when I purchased it.  The instructions that came with it are in Chinese.</li>
    <li> i love this product... it made my hair look like it was done in a salon... it also came with a guide on how to style your hair... must buy!</li>
    <li> Handy gizmo that easily does what you need it to do. Simple in form and function. Love it. I&#x27;ve recently seen them in retail stores. Hadn&#x27;t seen them for years. They&#x27;re making a come back.</li>
    <li> Over charged, Broke the first time I used it.  No ponytail holder included.  A joke for the price.  Buy Conair</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for long hair and with the set, could give out to several people as well as keeping a set for myself. I had one a long time ago; but recently was not able to find anywhere for me to give as gifts. It was well received.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product since my daughter broke my original.  It is a bonus to have the smaller one also.  It works on my grand daughter who is 4.  I have been telling many people about this on Amazon and who to buy it from.</li>
    <li> The shipping was great and the little one works for the small portion of hair.  Mine snapped (the large one) on the third use guess my hair is to thick.</li>
    <li> I could not find this item anywhere in the stores and had one years ago which I loved. Now, i have this and I use it all the time. It came carefully wrapped and was sent immediately. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like this product even more than I thought I would. It is very handy and easy to use. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great 80&#x27;s hair tool, Google for some cool styles. It is sturdy and realistic  for thick hair, you won’t have to worry about it breaking.</li>
    <li> Quality could have been better. the smaller tool broke after 2 uses- my daughter has very thick hair though....The larger one is working fine, and came with a few pictures of stlye ideas, but the pictures were very small &amp; in black &amp; white, very hard to see. Still well worth a couple dollars</li>
    <li> Mom loves using it in her hair</li>
