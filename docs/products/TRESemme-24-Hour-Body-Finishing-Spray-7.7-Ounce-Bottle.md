      <li>Thank you for making great products like this  this affordable and for such superior service!!!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled amazon has this spray by the case.  </li>

      <li>So glad it&#x27;s on amazon &amp; I</li>
      <li>I love this product, it is affordable and keeps your curls held in place all day..</li>
      <li>Like the fine spray and hold - could do without the fragrance :)</li>
      <li>it holds great, but leaves my hair bouncy enough so it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sprayed\\</li>
      <li>Reasonable price and great product, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Smells great, gives me great body, and is flexible enough, I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel stiff</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair and this hairspray works well to give a light hold, adds body, and smell isn&#x27;t too strong, overall good buy.</li>
      <li>Really fast delivery and just what I wanted!!</li>
      <li>This is the only kind I use.</li>
      <li>Tried many hairsprays with volume but nearly all of them create whitish build-up and hair is often glued into unsightly clusters.</li>
      <li>I use this hairspray everyday, so I love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon.</li>

      <li>It delivers a good hold while allowing you hair to still move and not get stiff.</li>
      <li>This spray also does not hold curls very well.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this as a root lifter or an overall light hold hair spray, but don&#x27;t expect your styles to hold \\&quot;24 hours\\&quot; like it says.</li>
      <li>THANKS FOR ALWAYS HAVING IT IN STOCK.</li>
      <li>Very manageable and soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>This spray is rare exception from this trend - definitely a saver for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon cares this product, it has become hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite volumizing hairspray and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores all of a sudden.</li>

    <li> I was thrilled amazon has this spray by the case.  It really does hold all day long and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff like traditional sprays.  My local stores have some of the 24 hour body products but not the spray.  So glad it&#x27;s on amazon &amp; I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> Like the fine spray and hold - could do without the fragrance :)</li>
    <li> Tresemme 24 hour body finishing spray is wonderful!! When your hair is all done this finishing spray just completes it. My hair lasts all day, unbeliveable.</li>
    <li> I use this hairspray everyday, so I love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon. It&#x27;s a great product by TRESemme - it holds great, but leaves my hair bouncy enough so it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sprayed\\&quot; look. I&#x27;ve used a lot of pricey salon products that don&#x27;t even come close to this hairspray.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite volumizing hairspray and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores all of a sudden. Reasonable price and great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind I use.</li>

    <li> I have been using this spray for several years now; it has been recently difficult to find in stores-- thankfully I can always count on Amazon for having the products I need at a competitive price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite hairspray, I can only find it online now. It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery and just what I wanted!! Thank you for making great products like this  this affordable and for such superior service!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HAIR SPRAY!  NEVER STICKY AND IT HOLDS GREAT.  NO BUILD UP. THANKS FOR ALWAYS HAVING IT IN STOCK.</li>

    <li> I love this product, it is affordable and keeps your curls held in place all day.. It doesnt make your hair feel all sticky and it smells good to, thats a bonus.</li>
    <li> The best product.. Holds my very fine hair even in the wind! Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or look frozen on the head. Very manageable and soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Love it! So sad it is being discontinued .</li>
    <li> Smells great, gives me great body, and is flexible enough, I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel stiff, it&#x27;s my go to hairspray</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray! It delivers a good hold while allowing you hair to still move and not get stiff. I have a hard time finding it in stores so I was glad when I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This finishing hairspray has a light pleasant smell, not overpowering like many hairsprays. It is also an airy spray that does not make your hair sticky. When I first sprayed it to my hair at the roots, I could noticeably see an increase in volume to my styled hair. However, after an hour or two, the volume would go away. I have very thin and fragile hair, which was perhaps the reason why this product did not work. This spray also does not hold curls very well. I would recommend this as a root lifter or an overall light hold hair spray, but don&#x27;t expect your styles to hold \\&quot;24 hours\\&quot; like it says.</li>
