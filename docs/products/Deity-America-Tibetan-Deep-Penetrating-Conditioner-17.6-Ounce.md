<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this product along with the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment since October 2014 and it has been amazing. Recently, I added the tonic hair growth restorer, which I use on my temples and nape area. My hair was originally brittle and constantly breaking. After the first shampooing and conditioning my hair stopped breaking and has been growing ever since. I have become a walking advertisement for these products.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out</li>
    <li> I have used deep penetrating conditioner with deity of hair plant shampoo about 2 years. My loosen hair started to grow.</li>
    <li> It made my hair brick hard.  Have been trying to recover.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says.  This is by far the best conditioner that I have used.  It leaves your hair tangle free and managable.  I would recommend this product to friends and family</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the texture! It works very well on my natural, coily hair, with a nice balance of protein and moisture.</li>
    <li> Good deep conditioner help overall hair not much change for problem areas on thinning hair but as far as benefits of deep condurioning good</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised!!!</li>
    <li> This product broke my hair off really bad! My hair began to split in 3 places per hair strand. I also noticed that it makes your hair very dry. I purchased the entire line of products and instead of my hair growing I had to get about 3 inches of my hair cut. I have tried to contact the maker but to no avail.</li>
    <li> works very well for my daughter,s hair</li>
    <li> I have tried many conditioners for my hair, and by far this one is the best. To know its all natural is a huge plus. I am using this along with other products by this brand and the difference is amazing. The results are not just something you feel but can easily see. I highly recommend this product for anyone who cares about the health of their hair.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my hair &amp; difficult to wash off. I tried just a small amount but very sticky so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This is a major staple in my hair care regimine. It is a smooth brown mixture that smells of ginseng. It softens and shines the hair. Sometimes when it dries, it hardens the hair, so be careful and use a shower cap. I usually leave it in my hair overnight. At first I disregarded the line of products because some of the writing on the various packaging is not spelled correctly. Product has prime herbal ingredients including 100% Tibet Herbal Essence, ginseng, ganoderma (wood mushroom), Angelica and wheat protein. The price is $10, fantastic. Worth the time and money!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST DEEP conditioner!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I steam my natural hair with this!!!</li>
    <li> Smell is not so good, but the results are the best! Leave your hair sooth and shine. I bought again...</li>
    <li> Arrived badly packed, half of conditioner was spilled. They sent a replacement one right away, no additional cost.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the product itself is OK, wouldn&#x27;t say I am completely in love with it, but it is nice enough</li>
    <li> my hair became healthy again when i started using this conditioner, I notice a big difference after I use it the way the directions instruct me to do. I bought about 4 of this same conditioner and will continue to do so...Don&#x27;t really care about the smell though, I dont care its still good.</li>
    <li> This is great for thin damaged and breaking hair. My AA texlaxed hair hair is thin and lifeless due to breakage from weaves, but use of this product is slowly getting my hair back in shape. My hair has noticeably more body and bounce after using this product.  Use it as a deep conditioner and follow-up with a moisturizing conditioner (this is a MUST) and a leave in moisturizer. As with most heavier-duty protein conditioners, it can make the hair dry and not \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; but all you need is a little bit of oil serum to give it shine again. Love it and it&#x27;s not too expensive. I suggest alternating it with a moisturizing deep conditioner. I am going to try the other products in this line, hope they live up to this one.</li>
    <li> Extremely effective as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> this is a very good protein conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for several years on my 4c hair it does a great job, I like it!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky soft</li>
