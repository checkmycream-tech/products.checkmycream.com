### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Price is also excellent.</li>
      <li>If the blade was 2 inches longer they&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
      <li>Palmer&#x27;s No Blade Shaver continues to be the best plastic blade on the market.  </li>
      <li>These are great if you use a cream shave.</li>
      <li>This one works great.</li>
      <li>Is this your best product for shaving with Magic shave?</li>
      <li>Good for my purpose of shaving my husband.</li>
      <li>Great product and arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>Magic shave use to include a plastic razor just like a straight razor that shaved beautifully.</li>
      <li>It seems the blade then does a better job of pulling the hair out of the follicle instead of just breaking it off at the surface.</li>
      <li>so I bought three to be on the safe side.</li>
      <li>Like many others, I was a fan of the one by Palmers.</li>
      <li>There is another version out there that you can get from the beauty supply stores, if they have them, that works much better.  </li>
      <li>I want to bring more bloggers</li>
      <li>Does not give me the clean shaving remova of beard.</li>
      <li>I like the old one better!</li>
      <li>But overall a good product.</li>
      <li>Palmers had some shorts no razor shave, these are much longer not as easy to use.</li>
      <li>I got the best results when I sat in a hot bath and steamed my pores open as much as possible before drying off and applying the depilatory cream.</li>
      <li>The edges are not sharp enough to give you a good scrape on the skin.  </li>
      <li>, I initially purchased the Palmers product  which is far superior, a pity it is no longer available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a plastic straight razor.  </li>
      <li>The pack was a good deal but the razor itself was no good at all.</li>
      <li>The Pro Edge blade isn&#x27;t as sharp as the old Palmers no blade shaver, plus the blade doesn&#x27;t fold up like the Palmer&#x27;s one did, but it was better than not having one at all.</li>
      <li>My smoothness still lasted much longer, though, with the old Palmer&#x27;s blade than these.</li>
      <li>The plastic blade is not sharp nor long enough to pull all of the Magic Shave off of my face.  </li>
      <li>I used magic on a regular basic and it is really hard to find replacement blades.</li>
      <li>not very sharp blade  </li>
      <li>Blade is not long enough for an adult males face</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade is a too blunt and dull for an adequate shave</li>

    <li> Good for my purpose of shaving my husband. Price is also excellent. These items are not in stores. Thank you</li>
    <li> not very sharp blade  but it works.</li>
    <li> The Pro Edge blade isn&#x27;t as sharp as the old Palmers no blade shaver, plus the blade doesn&#x27;t fold up like the Palmer&#x27;s one did, but it was better than not having one at all.

    <li> Like many others, I was a fan of the one by Palmers. The Pro Edge is useless because the \\&quot;blade\\&quot; is too dull.</li>
    <li> This is cheaper that getting it in the store and works well on my skin, this will be the way I get my shaving cream from now on.</li>
    <li> Palmers had some shorts no razor shave, these are much longer not as easy to use. So help if this feedback get to maker.</li>
    <li> This blade is not effective.  The plastic blade is not sharp nor long enough to pull all of the Magic Shave off of my face.  Palmer&#x27;s No Blade Shaver continues to be the best plastic blade on the market.  Unfortuately, Palmers have since discontinued that product.  I want to bring more bloggers/reviewers together to convince Palmers to bring back the No Blade Shaver!</li>
    <li> The blade were too short so using them to remove the cream was difficult. If the blade was 2 inches longer they&#x27;d be perfect. the edges of the blades could&#x27;ve been thinner.</li>
    <li> I used magic on a regular basic and it is really hard to find replacement blades. This one works great. Please dont discontinue.</li>
    <li> Garbage! I like the old one better! Thing to too short and it doesn&#x27;t shave enough hair off! SUCKS!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> Blade is not long enough for an adult males face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade is a too blunt and dull for an adequate shave</li>
    <li> The edges are not sharp enough to give you a good scrape on the skin.  There is another version out there that you can get from the beauty supply stores, if they have them, that works much better.  It&#x27;s like a plastic straight razor.  Would not recommend.</li>

    <li> Great product and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> What I needed for my shaving. I thought it would fold. But overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Plamer&#x27;s plastic blade, I found the Pro&#x27;s to be very dull by comparison.  Doesn&#x27;t scrape off the shaving powder I use.  Won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Does not give me the clean shaving remova of beard. Edge could be a little sharper.Magic shave use to include a plastic razor just like a straight razor that shaved beautifully. It  open and closed like one as well. This one can stand some tweaking . Is this your best product for shaving with Magic shave?</li>
    <li> The pack was a good deal but the razor itself was no good at all. It was very dull and did not rem ove the hair from husbands face well at all.</li>
    <li> Very little effectiveness, I initially purchased the Palmers product  which is far superior, a pity it is no longer available.</li>
    <li> These are great if you use a cream shave. I can never find these in stores so I bought three to be on the safe side. I use them on my face because I can&#x27;t use a razor.</li>
