<ol>
      <li>For the money this is an excellent nail tool kit.</li>
      <li>Great nail file/buffer tool.  </li>
      <li>Works great and was shipped INA timely manner.</li>
      <li>I am glad it works!</li>
      <li>I really find this to be the best inexspensive electric nail fial I have ever bought.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t spin on its own, you have to spin it your self before it will start spinning on its own.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also quite comfortable to hold, my hand hasn&#x27;t cramped yet! :)</li>
      <li>i love it ,it works fine</li>
      <li>Very happy customer will purchase other items from this company, always.</li>
      <li>but I did not have the need to do this since it files off what you need just fine.</li>
      <li>but hte nail bits and stuff were fine..</li>
      <li>Suitable for amateur and a professional nail tech would be happy with this drill as well!</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>Spend a little more and get a better one.</li>
      <li>First, I waited three weeks to get it.  </li>
      <li>I noticed if you use a higher speed it won&#x27;t do it as often.</li>
      <li>(Though You should let it rest before it gets too hot, you don&#x27;t want to burn it out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whether you use this tool for your nails, or detailed carving, i&#x27;d definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very Unsatisfied.  </li>
      <li>This is for real.</li>
      <li>My though is that if you are first timer for doing Acrylic Nails - like me, then this would be great to start out with - not too expensive.</li>
      <li>bought this in hopes it&#x27;d be powerful enough to sand clay and wood, and by god it does!</li>
      <li>Or maybe it&#x27;s not necessary to use as much pressure if you use a higher speed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, even if it is limited by the (slightly) short cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far it works perfectlly.</li>
      <li>I do find that the power cord is very flimsy &amp; may even (sometime later with use) get pulled out from the plug itself.  </li>
      <li>It has the switch that goes from low to high speed and all the drill bits included.  </li>
      <li>Nice selection of buffers/files for all types of natural or artificial nails.</li>

<li> Also it has absolutely no power to it so as soon</li>
<li> If you need it pink, buy some spraypaint.  </li>
<li> Husband used a digital multimeter to test the power source and it&#x27;s completely dead.  </li>
<li> Not like other ones i bought that acted like toys.</li>
<li> Not worth the hassle.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work, cheap and very unhappy with this product</li>
<li> The box was bent (like something heavy fell on it) which made me concern that the product might be damaged.</li>
<li> If you do press down hard it will stop turning</li>
<li> Very little power, and if you get any it&#x27;s in spits and spurts.  </li>
<li> Pretty disappointed</li>
<li> When it came the tip spun sooooo slow and when you put it up against your nail it ddnt run at all</li>
<li> something must have been wrong with the little motor or something</li>
<li> IT SUCKS!  </li>

    <li> I just got this today. When you go to turn it on it doesn&#x27;t spin on its own, you have to spin it your self before it will start spinning on its own. Also it has absolutely no power to it so as soon and you touch your nail with any sort of pressure it stops it from spinning. Pretty disappointed but you get what you pay for. Spend a little more and get a better one.</li>
    <li> quit working 5 seconds... literally ... after I got it. Amazon provided a prompt refund and I ordered a different machine.</li>
    <li> This was the 1st one I received out 4 orders (FYI - USA order don&#x27;t take long to get). It came in a padded envelope with bubble wrap around it. The box was bent (like something heavy fell on it) which made me concern that the product might be damaged. I am glad it works! It has the switch that goes from low to high speed and all the drill bits included.  If you do press down hard it will stop turning but I did not have the need to do this since it files off what you need just fine. I do find that the power cord is very flimsy &amp; may even (sometime later with use) get pulled out from the plug itself.  My though is that if you are first timer for doing Acrylic Nails - like me, then this would be great to start out with - not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Since I can&#x27;t give 0 starts, I&#x27;m giving one.  It arrived on time, today.  I opened it, turned it on the lowest setting and upon applying the lightest pressure, it died.  Tried turning it off and on and it wouldn&#x27;t power on.  Husband used a digital multimeter to test the power source and it&#x27;s completely dead.  No option to contact the seller, my only option is to return it and try to find another to replace it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it appeared to be in used condition and the lock button to change bits didn&#x27;t work (bits slid and out regardless of whether it was locked or not).  Very Unsatisfied.  Don&#x27;t waste your time, get a real dremel at home depot and call it a day.  If you need it pink, buy some spraypaint.  Not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Totally recommend this to anyone in the professionals nail field! As a at home nail , or practices acrylic nails and pedicures. Works great and was shipped INA timely manner. Very happy customer will purchase other items from this company, always.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product!</li>
    <li> The parts don&#x27;t lock onto the machine..</li>
    <li> Great nail file/buffer tool.  Nice selection of buffers/files for all types of natural or artificial nails. I gave it 4 stars because it will stop if you apply some pressure while filing. You just have to turn if off and back on to restart.  I noticed if you use a higher speed it won&#x27;t do it as often. Or maybe it&#x27;s not necessary to use as much pressure if you use a higher speed. For the money this is an excellent nail tool kit.</li>
    <li> It is not sturdy and I can&#x27;t get the blades to sharpen</li>
    <li> I really find this to be the best inexspensive electric nail fial I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> i love it ,it works fine</li>
    <li> I only gave it 1 star because I cannot give it ZERO!  I purchased this with reasonable expectations given the price, but it SUCKS!  First, I waited three weeks to get it.  Then it broke.  Then I waited over FOUR weeks to get the next one.  And, guess what?  IT SUCKS!  Very little power, and if you get any it&#x27;s in spits and spurts.  A complete waste of energy and time.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> This drill does what was advertised! I have used this drill couple of times.So far it works perfectlly.Suitable for amateur and a professional nail tech would be happy with this drill as well! I would recommend this drill!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a nail-art device, it&#x27;s a full-blown power tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in hopes it&#x27;d be powerful enough to sand clay and wood, and by god it does! Who would have known such a small machine would do so much work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you use this tool for your nails, or detailed carving, i&#x27;d definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, even if it is limited by the (slightly) short cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after an hour of use (despite getting a tad hot), the motor doesn&#x27;t seem to slow down at all! (Though You should let it rest before it gets too hot, you don&#x27;t want to burn it out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also quite comfortable to hold, my hand hasn&#x27;t cramped yet! :)</li>
    <li> it broke the same day it arrived...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, cheap and very unhappy with this product</li>
    <li> This is for real. Not like other ones i bought that acted like toys.</li>
    <li> Product turned on but would not spin.</li>
    <li> When it came the tip spun sooooo slow and when you put it up against your nail it ddnt run at all but hte nail bits and stuff were fine..something must have been wrong with the little motor or something</li>
