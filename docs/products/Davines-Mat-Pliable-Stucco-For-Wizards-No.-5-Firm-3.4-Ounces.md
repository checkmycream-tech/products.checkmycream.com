      <li>amazing hold, but</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Having great looking hair is as important as having my loaded Walther PPK/S in my shoulder holster.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the best stuff I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using hair gel for most of my life, and this is a nice alternative.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it would serve many people well.  </li>
      <li>She says it give her hair more body.  </li>
      <li>The ladies love it.  </li>
      <li>Excellent overall.</li>
      <li>They love the vanilla smell of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>like to enjoy my nice martini, shaken not stirred, while my hair looks fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They love putting their hands on the hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way this applies.  </li>
      <li>If you know a couple of magic tricks, it may help, though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than anything else out there.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll know why we all love it so.</li>
      <li>much better than sumotech and sebastian clay</li>
      <li>Once I do that however, it is pretty good at what is is designed to do.</li>
      <li>Gives fine hair more body.  </li>
      <li>Super fast delivery, great product</li>
      <li>It REALLY easy to put on and forget about it.</li>
      <li>the vanilla/cupcake smell is too strong and lingers</li>
      <li>Great for really short hair.</li>
      <li>Very lite at the touch but creates great volume with a very natural look.</li>
      <li>The imprinted product tracking number placed on the container by the original manufacturer appears to have been melted, so it cannot be read with a soldering iron.</li>
      <li>Great for giving limp hair a bit more volume and stylability.  </li>
      <li>you want it to last all day, and then some&lt;br /&gt;- most importantly, you want it to easily wash off!</li>
      <li>And, it is very \\&quot;mold\\&quot;able, which allows my hair to move, but gives it texture and helps it to retain the shape throughout the day.</li>
      <li>an added bonus, this wondrous product will leave your hair smelling sugary sweet all day</li>
      <li>/&gt;Additional awesome: I&#x27;ve used this on my hair through every  shade of every vibrant color dye imaginable and have not noted any of the increased fading usually associated with hair sprays and holding gels.</li>
      <li>This adds great body for that messy look.  </li>
      <li>well worth the money!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the feel, it smells great going on, and it just naturally holds my hair (when it&#x27;s short and when it&#x27;s long).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much shipping the Amazon 3rd party vendors charge.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients have seperated and first liquid came out then a gooey glob.  </li>
      <li>First time I purchased was from a salon.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for styling short hair (from pixie length to a choppy bob) so that it looks textured but not stiff.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the only products that works on my shorter-than-chin-length, fine hair.</li>
      <li>and this really does a nice job of adding texture and a little volume.</li>
      <li>I also use Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play Harder hairspray to keep my fine hair as volumized as possible.</li>
      <li>Then I recommend buying a few more, because if this product ever goes the way of the dodo, you might be lost without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;But there has to be another hair product that is similar right?</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without the pliable stucco from Davines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got medium length hair, very straight and flat.  </li>
      <li>Not stiff that will hold whatever look you want.</li>
      <li>The only product I really like.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my naturally wavy/curly hair as \\&quot;gel\\&quot; to provide texture without crunchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to be not mixed very well, so I have to shake it every once in a while</li>
      <li>Product is older (and now discontinued) and it shows when you open it.  </li>
      <li>This includes herbal based vibrant semi-permanent dyes such as Manic Panic.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work quite as well when my hair gets down to my chin, but for a matte, messy, separated, volumized look, this is amazing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for similar hair types.</li>
      <li>It stays soft, and holds hair that is swept back.  </li>
      <li>I use the #4 with moderate success (am changing from it as well), but with the #5 it is is just a tortured mess with no definition at all.</li>
      <li>I realize hair care products vary wildly depending upon the type of hair but for fine hair I definitely don&#x27;t thin</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re high quality and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian, with thick coarse hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
      <li>My hair dresser introduced me to Davine products and, while expensive, they are worth the price because it&#x27;s one of the rare situations that you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Even though it is a little on the pricey side, it is definitely worth it and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to people with fine and thin hair.</li>

<li> (she used it on her dry hair).  </li>

<li> Too bad that Davines had to discontinue it… apparently they have reformulated their whole line!</li>
<li> Work a little through wet hair</li>
<li> Just a bit after the shower, blow dry, and you&#x27;ll see what they mean by &#x27;pliable.&#x27;  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s so expensive and seems to sell out frequently.  </li>
<li> Not too heavy.  </li>
<li> It ads texture to your hair, without making your hair stiff or greasy.</li>
<li> I love this product,but since it is discontinued, the price is outrageous.</li>
<li> Not sticky or hard or too greasy..............</li>
<li> Unfortunately this company is discontinuing this product and there is no logical reason for it</li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> makes me sad.</li>
<li> so sorry Davines dropped this product!</li>

    <li> I tried this at my hair stylist&#x27;s shop.  Then I found it on Amazon.  I love the feel, it smells great going on, and it just naturally holds my hair (when it&#x27;s short and when it&#x27;s long).  Very happy.</li>

    <li> Like the old jingle goes, \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.\\&quot;  Great for giving limp hair a bit more volume and stylability.  It gets a \\&quot;9\\&quot; in my book.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser introduced me to Davine products and, while expensive, they are worth the price because it&#x27;s one of the rare situations that you get what you pay for. They&#x27;re high quality and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have found nothing that compares to the way it performs.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this really does a nice job of adding texture and a little volume. It&#x27;s really the best stuff I have ever used. It&#x27;s ashame it&#x27;s so expensive and seems to sell out frequently.  It&#x27;s amazing how much shipping the Amazon 3rd party vendors charge.  They should be chastised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like James Bond, I need to look my best when I am out on missions.

If anyone has used something similar to this texture please let me know in the comments section of my review! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost three years now and I&#x27;m still as happy with it as I was the day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;A tiny amount on short hair provides just the texture needed for a fun messy style and just a smidgen can tame even the wildest bangs.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, this wondrous product will leave your hair smelling sugary sweet all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one and you&#x27;ll know why we all love it so.

    <li> Don&#x27;t be decieved...you do not need to be a wizard for this stuff to work.  If you know a couple of magic tricks, it may help, though.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery, great product</li>
    <li> The best hair product I have ever found in my lifetime. Not stiff that will hold whatever look you want. Unfortunately this company is discontinuing this product and there is no logical reason for it makes me sad.</li>
    <li> The imprinted product tracking number placed on the container by the original manufacturer appears to have been melted, so it cannot be read with a soldering iron.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Not too heavy.  Gives fine hair more body.  I would recommend this product to people with fine and thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good product for my haircut for years. Last week my hair stylist used this on my hair. It smells wonderful, held the shape of my haircut without that nasty gel feel, and worked how I&#x27;ve always wanted. So I went home and found it for $10 cheaper here on amazon. Great Price. Great Product. (By the way, I have a medium length guys haircut for reference)</li>
    <li> Excellent overall. Very lite at the touch but creates great volume with a very natural look.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product!  Too bad that Davines had to discontinue it… apparently they have reformulated their whole line!</li>
    <li> First time I purchased was from a salon.  I love the way this applies.  Smells good and does just what I want it to do.  Not sticky or hard or too greasy..............</li>
    <li> As described- good product</li>
    <li> The only product I really like.  It stays soft, and holds hair that is swept back.  If I get windblown, I just run my fingers through my hair in the direction I want it to go.</li>
    <li> amazing hold, but the vanilla/cupcake smell is too strong and lingers forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still much better than sumotech and sebastian clay</li>
    <li> I love this product,but since it is discontinued, the price is outrageous. Wish Davines would bring it back. I have not found anything to compare.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Even though it is a little on the pricey side, it is definitely worth it and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The product is strange. It seems to be not mixed very well, so I have to shake it every once in a while so it is not separated into different liquids. It is hard to say whether this is a single defective item, or whether the whole line is this way. Once I do that however, it is pretty good at what is is designed to do. It ads texture to your hair, without making your hair stiff or greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got medium length hair, very straight and flat.  This adds great body for that messy look.  It&#x27;s better than anything else out there.  Just a bit after the shower, blow dry, and you&#x27;ll see what they mean by &#x27;pliable.&#x27;  And it smells like grapefruit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2003 and have never looked back.  I&#x27;m Asian, with thick coarse hair that frizzes easily.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for styling short hair (from pixie length to a choppy bob) so that it looks textured but not stiff.  I use it to make pieces in my hair (otherwise I look like a fuzzy mushroom) while still leaving it touchable.  Highly recommend for similar hair types.</li>
    <li> Great for really short hair. Smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I use it for my short hair cut.  Work a little through wet hair and it keeps it spikey all day.  My wife has wavy long hair and she uses it too (she used it on her dry hair).  She says it give her hair more body.  It&#x27;s a waxy, &#x27;liquid&#x27; paste (like toothpaste).  It REALLY easy to put on and forget about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair gel for most of my life, and this is a nice alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this if:&lt;br /&gt;- You don&#x27;t want shiny hair&lt;br /&gt;- you want some flexibility in your hair&lt;br /&gt;- you want it to last all day, and then some&lt;br /&gt;- most importantly, you want it to easily wash off! (both from your head and hands after application)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it&#x27;s the best hair-stiffening/shaping product I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to a friend?&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> The best hair product out there. Im so sorry Davines dropped this product!</li>
    <li> Product is older (and now discontinued) and it shows when you open it.  The ingredients have seperated and first liquid came out then a gooey glob.  This is not how the product was when it was in production.</li>
