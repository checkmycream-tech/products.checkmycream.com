      <li>Very nice tool for doing pedicure.</li>
      <li>It has a good weight in your hand when using it.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed how easy it was to lift the ingrown part out and file it away!!</li>
      <li>All Tweezerman&#x27;s products seem to be exceptionally well made.</li>
      <li>It works best after a bath, when the nails are softer (a shower would also be adequate for this).</li>
      <li>I bathe my foot in a combo of peroxide and warm water for about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I do my own because girls alway leave my skin cut.</li>
      <li>Nicely made instrument.</li>
      <li>love this</li>
      <li>It helps me lift my toenails and file it in places I wouldn&#x27;t be able to if I didn&#x27;t have</li>
      <li>I am glad I got this.</li>
      <li>Have tried just about all the products available, this one is, to me, clearly the best.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>If you have ingrown toe nails and don&#x27;t want to go to the podiatrist to get toe surgery, this is the next best thing.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I used for so many years.</li>
      <li>I love this item because it will be put to use because I keep ingrown toenails all the time</li>
      <li>What more can I say about this item?  </li>
      <li>on top of the nail.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to see what appeared to be a much more normal looking nail.  </li>
      <li>I had to learn to pull and put pressure on it to get it to file well, but works very good, I can file through quite a bit of nail with several passes.</li>
      <li>Until I found this superb professional instrument I&#x27;d all but given up on being able to find a nail file that could handle my very fungus-damaged two toenails.  </li>
      <li>The curved end makes it easy to get under the nail.  </li>
      <li>Appears light not an 18 gauge quality.  </li>
      <li>After the excellent cleaning, the med liquid I began aplying was able to work better, and that summer I actually wore sandles for the firt time in several years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The day my Tweezerman Ingrown Toenail File and Cleaner arrived, I used it immediately and was pain free 12 hrs.</li>
      <li>I have owned this for 3 years, and it is sturdy, with a comfortable feel in hand because of the grip.</li>
      <li>It is a unique tool that you will not find in any kit.  </li>
      <li>so I coud finally clean out the yecky flaking underneath.  </li>
      <li>As a runner I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this tool.</li>
      <li>I have used it several times for my fungus problem and it really does a great job cleaning under the toenails.</li>
      <li>The nail lifter end is curved just right, and can also be used to clean around the nail.</li>
      <li>And the large rubber gripped handle makes it easy to hold onto.</li>
      <li>the tool is not cheap, great quality and finish on the metal make it worth thir money.</li>
      <li>The very tapered end did a fantastic job of getting between the end of the turned-up nail tip and the skin</li>
      <li>I have several other Tweezerman products that I am very happy with, so</li>
      <li>Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
      <li>so thank you very much.</li>
      <li>This was exactly the tool I needed to care for my toenails.  </li>
      <li>but there was immediate improvement that was most noticeable when I put my shoes on and 3 days later there is no toenail</li>
      <li>I have had many similar tools over the years, and none of them came close to the quality of this tool.</li>
      <li>Yes it is very pricey, but one that is well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>great concept but way too thick to really get the job done.if</li>
      <li>It is strong, well made, it will last you your life time.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really hesitate to go with the brand again.  </li>
      <li>Although the price is high, this is a value item!</li>
      <li>The Tweezerman Professional Master Tech Ingrown Toenail File &amp; Cleaner is worth every penny of the price.</li>
      <li>Also, it is very durable and lightweight.</li>
      <li>This is a quality product that has been better than I ever expected.  </li>
      <li>They are an absolute necessity when cleaning underneath the toenails and in the corners.  </li>
      <li>This is a much get</li>
      <li>I am very ticklish so I have never had a pedicure.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>And the industrial-grade file was superb in actually thinning down the thickness that had developed not only under the nail, but</li>
      <li>a unique tool i haven&#x27;t seen locally</li>
      <li>It is very useful in the all-important area of foot care especially in the older population.</li>
      <li>Love it - easy to use and definitely takes care of the need to file down the ingrown nail!</li>
      <li>I work in a family practice office and this did wonders for mild to moderate ingrown toenails!</li>
      <li>I can highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>That actually seems pretty reasonable considering</li>
      <li>I was starting to experience pain at the corner of my big toe and could see that the nail was becoming ingrown.  </li>
      <li>The nail file part has sharp and precisely crafted  teeth.</li>
      <li>Clearly, once again, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Overall, highly recommended to end ingrown toenails!</li>
      <li>The tool is very well made and it will last forever.</li>
      <li>Finally, a product that really helps control my ingrown toenail.</li>
      <li>It is thin and strong and very helpful.  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time, well packaged and perfectly as expected from all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>The part to clean under the nails is flat enough but should be a little wider.</li>
      <li>Very well made, just as other reviewers have noted!  </li>
      <li>The toenail rasp is key in ensuring no sharp corners are left to grow into the cuticle.  </li>
      <li>They had gotten so thick and so crumbly, and nothing I tried was thin enough and strong enough to get in there and do the job to clean it up properly.      </li>

    <li> This is a great heavy-duty quality tool.  It has a good weight in your hand when using it.  If you have ingrown toe nails and don&#x27;t want to go to the podiatrist to get toe surgery, this is the next best thing.  It is a unique tool that you will not find in any kit.  As a runner I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this tool.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Great help with ingrown toenail</li>
    <li> I work in a family practice office and this did wonders for mild to moderate ingrown toenails! I was amazed how easy it was to lift the ingrown part out and file it away!! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a WONDERFUL tool to help lift and file ingrown toenails.  Very well made, just as other reviewers have noted!  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> great concept but way too thick to really get the job done.if the file was smaller it would probably work great.</li>
    <li> very good pedicure product. fairly sharp. quality just what you would expect from tweezer man. i would recomend this product.</li>
    <li> This was exactly the tool I needed to care for my toenails.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> Until I found this superb professional instrument I&#x27;d all but given up on being able to find a nail file that could handle my very fungus-damaged two toenails.  They had gotten so thick and so crumbly, and nothing I tried was thin enough and strong enough to get in there and do the job to clean it up properly.      As soon as I got this tool I saw the quality and set about preparing a soaking pan, scrubber, towels, cuticle remover, skin exfoliant, cuticle remover, etc. to do a proper prepping.  Finally, I tried out \\&quot;the file.\\&quot;  The very tapered end did a fantastic job of getting between the end of the turned-up nail tip and the skin so I coud finally clean out the yecky flaking underneath.  And the industrial-grade file was superb in actually thinning down the thickness that had developed not only under the nail, but on top of the nail.  I was happy to see what appeared to be a much more normal looking nail.  After the excellent cleaning, the med liquid I began aplying was able to work better, and that summer I actually wore sandles for the firt time in several years.  This tool is a must for anyone with fungus-damaged nails! The Tweezerman Professional Master Tech Ingrown Toenail File &amp; Cleaner is worth every penny of the price.</li>
    <li> Helped a lot with my problem toenails. Used alcohol to disinfect tip with each use and I think it helped my nails too.</li>
    <li> Very nice tool for doing pedicure. I do my own because girls alway leave my skin cut. I have used this now several times and would want to be without it now.</li>
    <li> I am glad I got this. It helps me lift my toenails and file it in places I wouldn&#x27;t be able to if I didn&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;Great tool</li>
    <li> I had to learn to pull and put pressure on it to get it to file well, but works very good, I can file through quite a bit of nail with several passes.</li>
    <li> a unique tool i haven&#x27;t seen locally</li>
    <li> I am very ticklish so I have never had a pedicure.  It believe I would end up humiliating myself, therefore I cannot compare this tool to what the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; feet folks use.  I was starting to experience pain at the corner of my big toe and could see that the nail was becoming ingrown.  After trying unsuccessfully to deal with it using some tools I already had (like the tip of a metal nail file), I decided to spring for this tool made just for what I needed.  I have several other Tweezerman products that I am very happy with, so I didn&#x27;t really hesitate to go with the brand again.  It worked well and I saved by not allowing it to get so bad I would end up having to go to a podiatrist.</li>
    <li> I used these when I did pedicures for a living.  They are an absolute necessity when cleaning underneath the toenails and in the corners.  The toenail rasp is key in ensuring no sharp corners are left to grow into the cuticle.  I was unable to find these at my usual beauty supply store. Thank goodness I found them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for ingrown toe nails you could ever want. It works wonders!!! This is a much get</li>
    <li> Yes it is very pricey, but one that is well worth the price.  I have bought stuff like this before and found them to be wanting.  And, I was looking for something that I could depend on.  I can highly recommend this product.  It is strong, well made, it will last you your life time.  Try it and you well not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that has been better than I ever expected.  The tool is very well made and it will last forever.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that really helps control my ingrown toenail. I bathe my foot in a combo of peroxide and warm water for about 30 minutes. Then use the file to get deep and help cut the offending part of the nail. Have tried just about all the products available, this one is, to me, clearly the best.</li>
    <li> Performs alright.  Not sure of the quality of the stainless steel.  Appears light not an 18 gauge quality.  Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s made for. Nicely made instrument.</li>
    <li> I find that because of the way it is weighted it is a little cumbersome. The part to clean under the nails is flat enough but should be a little wider. The file should be flatter and the file itself finer. Because of this I could only give 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped promptly.  I have used it several times for my fungus problem and it really does a great job cleaning under the toenails. It is made of a very good quality material and I do recommend it for anyone having fungus under the nails after soaking the feet several minutes.</li>
    <li> didnt jnow what else to do.  my toe hurt all of the time. i followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and wow, no more pain. love this</li>
    <li> Great product! wish i found sooner!</li>
    <li> A great tool!  Cleans, also files underneath nails where the nail might be uneven!  Although the price is high, this is a value item!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It is thin and strong and very helpful.  Also, it is very durable and lightweight.</li>
    <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, well packaged and perfectly as expected from all the positive reviews. Love it - easy to use and definitely takes care of the need to file down the ingrown nail!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool, both in function and quality. The nail lifter end is curved just right, and can also be used to clean around the nail. I have had many similar tools over the years, and none of them came close to the quality of this tool. The nail file part has sharp and precisely crafted  teeth. It is coarse, which means spending less time filing the ingrown toenail. the tool is not cheap, great quality and finish on the metal make it worth thir money.</li>
    <li> Works as described, but will still have to visit a podiatrist for a permanent solution.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to a person that knows how to use it. The instructions are not clear. I use it to get the crud from under my toenails while in the shower. I continue to use the clippers when is have an ingrown toenail. It serves a purpose so I guess I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 star because the instructions are not clear. And no I would not recommend it to the average person.</li>
    <li> This stuff works perfect! I would recommend it to a friend. It was a very successful purchase - must try!</li>
    <li> Thanks to other Amazon reviewers who needed help with painful ingrown toenails, I ordered this little tool on Tuesday. When it arrived on Friday I was ready to try it out on my 3 very painful ingrown nails. It works! Not fun actually using it but there was immediate improvement that was most noticeable when I put my shoes on and 3 days later there is no toenail pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/30/14: 1 have not used the Tweezerman since the initial review a month ago and just noticed today that one toenail is starting to demand some attention. That actually seems pretty reasonable considering I have only used the tool one time and I know it will help.</li>
    <li> This instrument is surgical quality. It is very useful in the all-important area of foot care especially in the older population.</li>
    <li> All Tweezerman&#x27;s products seem to be exceptionally well made. This is a well-thought out instrument that will replace several \\&quot;tools\\&quot; I used for so many years. I don&#x27;t know where Tweezerman has its products made (my guess is Germany), but the workmanship and quality of materials is at par with Solingen. I also bought the V-Cuticle Nipper and the Shape and Shine Nail Tool and they are all top-notch quality. Clearly, once again, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had been dealing with an ingrown toenail that had been getting progressively worse and more painful for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The day my Tweezerman Ingrown Toenail File and Cleaner arrived, I used it immediately and was pain free 12 hrs. later.&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!! I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I had problems with ingrown toenails for years so I gave this a try. It is uncomfortable to use, but I no longer have pain from the ingrown toenails, so it is worthwhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it for maintenance, every 3-4 weeks, to prevent a recurrence of the ingrown toenails. It works best after a bath, when the nails are softer (a shower would also be adequate for this). I have owned this for 3 years, and it is sturdy, with a comfortable feel in hand because of the grip. Overall, highly recommended to end ingrown toenails!</li>
    <li> Very good item.  It does what it is supposed to do.  What more can I say about this item?  ThanX.</li>
    <li> The curved end makes it easy to get under the nail.  And the large rubber gripped handle makes it easy to hold onto.</li>
    <li> I love this item because it will be put to use because I keep ingrown toenails all the time so thank you very much.</li>
