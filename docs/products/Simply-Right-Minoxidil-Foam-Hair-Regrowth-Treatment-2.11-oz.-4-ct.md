### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best price I have found for this product and will continue to reorder.</li>
      <li>It works great and does not harden my hair like rogain</li>
      <li>I use this product and it works great.</li>
      <li>Also, good packaging.</li>
      <li>My head is still itchy and I think I&#x27;ve lost a great deal more hair from all the side effects.  </li>
      <li>Ok bottom line, this stuff works!  </li>
      <li>Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>filed with amazon and they were nice to notice how unreasonable the seller was and refunded me my money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultimately I dont care since the stuff absolutely works flawlessly</li>
      <li>good stuff, much better than liquid.</li>
      <li>Even though it says not for use by women, my dermatologist said it was perfectly safe for women to use this product.</li>
      <li>Just like a name brand, product is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Spray valves are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>The seller and everything was great, my only beef is with the product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is good and all, but I noticed that Rogain is much better overall.</li>
      <li>and I would happily give my left macadamia to keep my hair intact but on principle I cant give them the full 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Works great Just like any other name brand!</li>
      <li>I have noticed that my scalp is somewhat more sensitive to this product, but that could just be that I&#x27;m becoming more sensitive to Rogaine products in general. .</li>
      <li>Seems to be exactly like the brand name version at 1/3 the price.  </li>
      <li>Next time I will just buy the brand name--not that it is necessarily better but because with the brand name</li>
      <li>does not create a wet matted patch of hair on top of your head so you look funny at work in the morning like the liquid version does.</li>
      <li>If you use it twice a day as directed each can really lasts anywhere from 11 to 14 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier to apply than the liquid.</li>
      <li>Once you&#x27;ve done your whole area, use your fingers to massage it into the scalp.</li>
      <li>Packaging is convenient, shipped on time, much easier to apply than the liquid.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from hair loss.  </li>
      <li>Container actually sprayed all over the bathroom my first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used the brand name for a long time and now that the generic has come out, I see no reason to pay more for the same thing.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and it really works.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: bend the stem forward, not down, to unlock it.</li>
      <li>Not easy to press - have to really jam it to open it the first time.</li>
      <li>In addition, return would only be accepted if the bottles are returned in the original box AND there will be a %25 re-stocking fee!!!&lt;br /&gt;So they send out  defective product and instead of apologizing they make so many demands that would make it impossible to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After 3 weeks on this stuff not a SINGLE hair falls out in the shower or on my pillow and my hair is thicker and fuller.  </li>

<li> The foam will maintain its consistency plenty long enough to finish the application.</li>
<li> Plus you have to use double the amount with this which takes forever to dry.</li>
<li> Essentially the same ingredients as found in the leading brands like Rogaine or the Walgreen&#x27;s equivalent for LESS $$$.</li>
<li> I was a desperate man and wanted a cheap solution</li>
<li> Seems to work as well as any other Rogaine foam out there.</li>
<li> had tried this other product/seller before and had no problem.</li>
<li> I bought a plastic bowl and a hair color brush, which has stiff bristles and a long thin tail, for about $6 total.</li>
<li> This product just as tight as all the brand name products out there.</li>
<li> All the 4 bottles stopped dispensing after a few times of using.</li>
<li> I have been using this foam for the past year and it works well at reducing hair loss.</li>
<li> at least I know what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
<li> Because there is some serious false advertising with this product.  </li>
<li> but now I&#x27;m stuck with 4 months of foam and 6 months of the kirkland grease crap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product as described. Works great Just like any other name brand! It&#x27;s much easier to apply than the liquid. Will order it again!</li>
    <li> Spray valves are cheaply made. Not easy to press - have to really jam it to open it the first time. Container actually sprayed all over the bathroom my first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: bend the stem forward, not down, to unlock it. Thnx C. Stefan for the obvious solution.</li>
    <li> It works great and does not harden my hair like rogain</li>
    <li> I use this product and it works great. I wanted to share how I apply it to get it onto my scalp and not in my hair. I bought a plastic bowl and a hair color brush, which has stiff bristles and a long thin tail, for about $6 total. To apply, squirt the foam into the plastic bowl. Use the tail of the comb to part off 1/2 inch sections of hair, then use the stiff-bristled hair color brush to apply the foam to your scalp. Once you&#x27;ve done your whole area, use your fingers to massage it into the scalp. The foam will maintain its consistency plenty long enough to finish the application.</li>
    <li> Yall aint even gonna believe this... Call your friends and family in here to read what I&#x27;m about to write. This product just as tight as all the brand name products out there. Yet, it is cheaper. Also, good packaging.</li>
    <li> Seems to be exactly like the brand name version at 1/3 the price.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this instead from now on.</li>
    <li> good stuff, much better than liquid. does not create a wet matted patch of hair on top of your head so you look funny at work in the morning like the liquid version does.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good and all, but I noticed that Rogain is much better overall. Plus you have to use double the amount with this which takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this foam for the past year and it works well at reducing hair loss. This is the best price I have found for this product and will continue to reorder.</li>
    <li> Essentially the same ingredients as found in the leading brands like Rogaine or the Walgreen&#x27;s equivalent for LESS $$$. I find it to be the same in every respect and say if you find it priced below the &amp;#34;Brand Names&amp;#34; to definitely consider the savings....</li>
    <li> Seems to work as well as any other Rogaine foam out there. I regrew hair with Rogaine and I have not gonebald yet since using this product therefore it must be working . I have noticed that my scalp is somewhat more sensitive to this product, but that could just be that I&#x27;m becoming more sensitive to Rogaine products in general. .</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and it really works.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from hair loss.  Even though it says not for use by women, my dermatologist said it was perfectly safe for women to use this product.</li>
    <li> TRABAJA MUY BIEN, I don&#x27;t want to be bald so for that reason I used, and I saw the result. bacanisimo!!!</li>
    <li> Just like a name brand, product is easy to use. Packaging is convenient, shipped on time, much easier to apply than the liquid.</li>
    <li> Generic Rogaine for a fraction of the price.  I have used this for a couple of months and like it just as well as the name brand.  I used the brand name for a long time and now that the generic has come out, I see no reason to pay more for the same thing.</li>
    <li> Ok bottom line, this stuff works!  I used to have handfulls of hair come out in the shower and on my pillow.  After 3 weeks on this stuff not a SINGLE hair falls out in the shower or on my pillow and my hair is thicker and fuller.  Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars and not 5?  Because there is some serious false advertising with this product.  They say each can will last you a month.  I call BS!  If you use it twice a day as directed each can really lasts anywhere from 11 to 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I dont care since the stuff absolutely works flawlessly and I would happily give my left macadamia to keep my hair intact but on principle I cant give them the full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> All the 4 bottles stopped dispensing after a few times of using. I tried each and every way to get them to work to no avail. I contacted Amazon and the seller. The seller asked me to return all 4 bottles so they &amp;#34;inspect&amp;#34; the dispensing mechanism of the bottles!! In addition, return would only be accepted if the bottles are returned in the original box AND there will be a %25 re-stocking fee!!!&lt;br /&gt;So they send out  defective product and instead of apologizing they make so many demands that would make it impossible to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I filed with amazon and they were nice to notice how unreasonable the seller was and refunded me my money.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried this other product/seller before and had no problem. I will now order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Rogaine-Regrowth-Treatment-Minoxidil-Packaging/dp/B0012BNVE8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1393567012&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;rogaine</li>
    <li> My head is still itchy and I think I&#x27;ve lost a great deal more hair from all the side effects.  The seller and everything was great, my only beef is with the product.  I was a desperate man and wanted a cheap solution but now I&#x27;m stuck with 4 months of foam and 6 months of the kirkland grease crap.</li>
    <li> Seen no growth after 2 years...</li>
    <li> I found the name brand stuff at my local wholesale club for about the same price as this stuff. Next time I will just buy the brand name--not that it is necessarily better but because with the brand name at least I know what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> It did not grow my hair</li>
