### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Excellent formulation!</li>
      <li>Smells good too!</li>
      <li>A good product!</li>
      <li>When I opened this it flooded me with happy memories because of it&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer with the added benefit of sunblock.</li>
      <li>For hands this is great, though in that case I&#x27;d recommend just buying the bottle marketed toward body (not face).</li>
      <li>Also, this is a great size to tote to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked the way this went on--light, not greasy and very good protection throughout the day.</li>
      <li>My partner, who is fair skinned, used Hawaiian Tropic and walked away from 9 hours at the beach with not a hint of sunburn.  </li>
      <li>LOVED</li>
      <li>Good product but not convinced I need to carry two bottles of sunblock when I&#x27;m gardening, going to a concert, or playing by the beach or lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a quality face cream that also happens to have superior sunblocking qualities.  </li>
      <li>But still, the lotion provides SPF 30 and is otherwise quite good.</li>
      <li>I loved this addition, so when I saw a product made specifically for the face, I wanted to try</li>
      <li>I have fair skin, so I like for the face lotion I put on each morning to have sun protection in it.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and burn quite easily.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>However, it goes on smoothly, didn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and seemed to give me great protection.  </li>
      <li>, it never clogs my pores, and it provides a nice level of sun protection.</li>
      <li>product is excellent, much like the body version of it.</li>
      <li>feel of the lotion is nice</li>
      <li>catching whiffs now</li>
      <li>The pump applicator is a nice touch rather than just having it in a squeeze bottle.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen keeps my face from burning, feels silky, and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>One of the sunscreen ingredients, oxybenzone, is controversial.</li>
      <li>I love this face lotion, it smells amazing</li>
      <li>and I prefer to go very light</li>
      <li>That would make it a winning product.</li>
      <li>I love the Hawaiian Tropic scent anyway</li>
      <li>At SPF 30, I would imagine that Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Face Lotion would protect a more sun-sensitive skin</li>
      <li>, I love the texture.</li>
      <li>&gt;* &amp;#34;Works&amp;#34; as sunscreen with great results, and the face really needs to be protected&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most sunscreens in the drug store use avobenzone, so if you use sunscreen at all without checking ingredients, you&#x27;ve probably used sunscreen with avobenzone in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny which many sunscreens do.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this face lotion- the SPF 30, the hydration, the scent, the sun protection it gives my skin.  </li>
      <li>The lotion itself looks appealing with the stripes in it.</li>
      <li>I love that it is a 12 hour protection.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent and the lightness of the lotion.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice scent, like the Hawaiian Tropic tanning oils - very</li>
      <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin that burns easily.</li>
      <li>I also LOVE the scent, it&#x27;s not too strong</li>
      <li>Silk Hydration Face feels and smells REALLY good -- and that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
      <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a stranger to use it on hisor her face, but for most people it will be perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>I was delighted with this lightly scented cream when it first arrived.  </li>
      <li>Very nice sunscreen, with an unusually light texture for a high spf sunscreen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The packaging is well-designed too; it&#x27;s easy to get a controllable amount of product out and lotion has not leaked out all over the bottom of my bag.  </li>
      <li>It spreads easily on the face and the SPF works well.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is coconutty, medium strong.</li>
      <li>I really liked the idea of this product, and at first it seemed to work well.</li>
      <li>I like using it under light makeup when out during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>This product is light, greaseless and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>It has a light tan color but does not impart color to the skin.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower like some lotions.  </li>
      <li>Oil free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels smooth and silky on the skin.</li>
      <li>you may feel a bit of a warm tingle when you first apply, but it quickly goes away.</li>
      <li>Most people aren&#x27;t sensitive to avobenzone, oxybenzone, nor octocrylene, so this product will be fine for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it when i go for a run and find it goes on smooth, is absorbed easily, and doesn&#x27;t bleed into my eyes.  </li>
      <li>and since I work outside a lot it&#x27;s nice to know I have sunblock in my locker if I need it!</li>
      <li>Fragrance is as great, a little milder than most HT products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on light, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or shiny residue, and it absorbs quickly with no adverse reaction to its ingredients that we&#x27;ve noted.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant, but personally I prefer no scent so that was a drawback.</li>
      <li>I recently bought the sunblock from this brand --- I&#x27;ve never used this brand before --- and I loved it</li>
      <li>A good product overall.</li>
      <li>If you think that your skin is a good barrier to internal absorption, consider this: &amp;#34;In</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have kept in the car on hot days longer than I should, but it holds up fine, not separating as I&#x27;ve seen others do.  </li>
      <li>would avoid using this on children or while pregnant.</li>
      <li>It was absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I could find something better than my previous favorite, but I&#x27;ve loved the body version of Silk Hydration for years and they&#x27;ve finally made it for the face!</li>
      <li>This is a very pleasant cream - with the classic strong Hawaiian tropic aroma - so if you don&#x27;t like that smell it is not a good choice.  </li>
      <li>for the octocrylene, this enhances the ability of avobenzone and oxybenzone to be absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs nicely, you don&#x27;t have to keep rubbing and rubbing for the white to dissipate.</li>
      <li>It is gentle enough to use on my face and does a really good job on the non-oily feeling.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many many facial sunscreens and this one is my current favorite.</li>
      <li>I could go in the pool and not worry about reapplying right away because it&#x27;s water resistant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, very satisfied with this variation of my favorite sunscreen, and I plan to keep it in my gear bag for morning and late afternoon outings.</li>
      <li>in all, this is hands down the best daily sunscreen for the face.</li>
      <li>* Absorbed easily and completely.</li>
      <li>Well, the only sameness is the scent, this lotion goes on smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does seem to soak into my skin quickly, and I feel as if I need to apply more than regular lotion, but it does its job</li>
      <li>This particular lotion comes in a very convenient bottle with an easy pump.</li>
      <li>the true test will be in 3 weeks on the beach in the strong Mexican sun.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the scent, but I was willing to tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it really makes you feel like you&#x27;re on a tropical vacation!</li>
      <li>Many facial sunscreens, even sports sunscreens that claim not to run with sweat, burn and sting my eyes.</li>
      <li>I also have found that many facial products for sun protection cause me to break out and make my skin oily.</li>
      <li>Currently at 16.98 plus 4.67 shipping, way more than I would pay.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is a bit strong and very beach-y, and if you have sensitive skin like</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absorbed into your skin with a light rub and while not greasy, there is a sheen to your face and a definite &amp;#34;something&#x27;s there&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t mind using this on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>It has that strong coconut-y scent, but I can&#x27;t downgrade the rating much, because it&#x27;s actually what I expect from Hawaiian Tropic</li>
      <li>For people a little less sensitive to scent, the smell is also fairly summery, which is nice given that it feels &#x27;in season&#x27;.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it must be my soap, or the air, or something else, because I don&#x27;t generally have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;d been using it just fine.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>

    <li> Great moisturizer with the added benefit of sunblock. Not heavy or greasy. Oil free. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin that burns easily. Usually by mid-March I am worrying about sunburn or getting sun hives. I have tried many many facial sunscreens and this one is my current favorite. I didn&#x27;t think I could find something better than my previous favorite, but I&#x27;ve loved the body version of Silk Hydration for years and they&#x27;ve finally made it for the face! (Sometimes I wonder if there is any difference between the two formulas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent, much like the body version of it. It has the same creamy texture that spreads easily and sinks in quickly, leaving my skin feeling moisturized but never greasy or shiny. No matter how much I use, which is important, because with other sunscreens I find myself skimping on the amount I use to prevent the shiny look. With this stuff, I can use the full recommended amount of 1/4 tsp without looking shiny or feeling like I am wearing a heavy amount of product on my face. In fact, I don&#x27;t feel as though I am wearing anything at all, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit strong and very beach-y, and if you have sensitive skin like I do you may feel a bit of a warm tingle when you first apply, but it quickly goes away. Many facial sunscreens, even sports sunscreens that claim not to run with sweat, burn and sting my eyes. This one never does, and I bike daily even in the dead of summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is hands down the best daily sunscreen for the face. Even in the middle of the summer day, sweating like crazy, this product has not let me down. I love it! If only they could get rid of the initial tingly feeling, but that&#x27;s a very minor quibble compared to all the other pros.</li>
    <li> The scent of HAWAIIAN Tropic Silk Hydration Face Lotion brings back 30+ year-old memories of youthful days spent on Waikiki Beach with that company&#x27;s sunscreen slathered all over my body. Coconut, pineapple, and some indefinable scent I just associate with summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used [[ASIN:B00639DL3U HAWAIIAN Tropic Silk Hydration SPF 12 Sunscreen]] and my whole family enjoyed it, so I was eager to give the Silk Hydration Face a try when I saw it at a local store (for half the current list price I might add, so shop around). I&#x27;m not sure what benefit other than aesthetics the ribboning of the lotion provides, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt it&#x27;s effectiveness. The pump applicator is a nice touch rather than just having it in a squeeze bottle. This is a facial lotion I would recommend applying  if you plan on being outdoors in the sun for an extended period of time. It goes on light, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or shiny residue, and it absorbs quickly with no adverse reaction to its ingredients that we&#x27;ve noted. Silk Hydration Face feels and smells REALLY good -- and that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the lightness of the lotion. the true test will be in 3 weeks on the beach in the strong Mexican sun. I am always on the lookout for a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Won&#x27;t know for sure for a few weeks down the road but I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for the Neutrogena lotion I was using, as the Neutrogena stings like acid if you get it in your eyes.  This is a very pleasant cream - with the classic strong Hawaiian tropic aroma - so if you don&#x27;t like that smell it is not a good choice.  However, it goes on smoothly, didn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and seemed to give me great protection.  A good product!</li>
    <li> It definitely feels silky, not greasy when it goes on.  It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower like some lotions.  I could and do see using this as a daily application for whenever I leave the house, not just going to the pool. I like using it under light makeup when out during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big problem with this – the price.  Currently at 16.98 plus 4.67 shipping, way more than I would pay.  I hope the price comes down and it’s eligible for Prime shipping.  That would make it a winning product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping this in my purse and using it whenever I am caught outdoors unexpectedly.  It is gentle enough to use on my face and does a really good job on the non-oily feeling.  It has a very nice scent, like the Hawaiian Tropic tanning oils - very summery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my hands and arms a bit too and a little bit will actually go quite a long way.</li>
    <li> I found this completely ineffective as both lotion and sunscreen. As a lotion, it was thick and flaky on my skin, never properly absorbing; as a sunscreen, I went outside for twenty minutes and came back red, and I don&#x27;t have the fairest skin out there. Maybe I got a bad batch, but my experience with this product was terrible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s summer and time to think of sunblock to stave off the drying and damage of the sun particularly when it comes to your face. This product claims 12 hour &amp;#34;moisturzation&amp;#34; with UVA and UVB protection for a 30 SPF. It has that branded Hawaiian Tropic fragrance with a pump dispenser for the beige colored sunscreen. It&#x27;s absorbed into your skin with a light rub and while not greasy, there is a sheen to your face and a definite &amp;#34;something&#x27;s there&amp;#34; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently used this product on an overcast day where I was outside for 5 hours and while I did not reapply it to my face and hands after 2 hours as is normally recommended, I did not end up with a sunburn. No burning in the eyes and no rashes either. I usually use a sunblock by another producer (Neutrogena) but wanted to give Hawaiian Tropic a try since they have been in the business for ages. Do you need a separate product just for your face when you&#x27;re going to be outside for an extended length of time? Your call. Good product but not convinced I need to carry two bottles of sunblock when I&#x27;m gardening, going to a concert, or playing by the beach or lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients: avobenzone 2%, octocylene 5%, oxygen zone 3%|</li>
    <li> I first want to point out that people&#x27;s skin can be sensitive to any ingredient in the world. Therefore, if you know you&#x27;re sensitive to avobenzone, octocrylene, or oxybenzone, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way avobenzone and oxybenzone work is they allow UVA and UVB rays to enter the skin, but then absorb them so they&#x27;re no longer harmful to us. Most sunscreens in the drug store use avobenzone, so if you use sunscreen at all without checking ingredients, you&#x27;ve probably used sunscreen with avobenzone in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the octocrylene, this enhances the ability of avobenzone and oxybenzone to be absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, for people who are sensitive to one of these ingredients or for young children (whose skin can be naturally more sensitive), I&#x27;d recommend titanium dioxide or zinc oxide instead of avobenzone and oxybenzone, as another reviewer has stated. The problem is (and the reason why a lot of people don&#x27;t like these ingredients) is they work by reflecting the UVA and UVB rays - which is why they often give a &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; sheen to your skin; you&#x27;re essentially a mirror at that point. For a pale individual like myself, that isn&#x27;t an issue, but it can be irritating to darker-skinned folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you have to pick and choose. Most people aren&#x27;t sensitive to avobenzone, oxybenzone, nor octocrylene, so this product will be fine for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this product is very fragrant. THIS is the fact that makes me question its marketing as a sunscreen for face; it&#x27;s extremely common for people to be sensitive to fragrance, especially on already more-sensitive skin like that found on the face. That said, it&#x27;s very tropical-smelling (yum) and I certainly don&#x27;t mind using this on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the texture. It&#x27;s very silky, similar to the Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration with ribbons for body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a stranger to use it on hisor her face, but for most people it will be perfectly fine. For hands this is great, though in that case I&#x27;d recommend just buying the bottle marketed toward body (not face).</li>
    <li> Last year I tried a sunscreen product for the body that had the hydration ribbons in it. I loved this addition, so when I saw a product made specifically for the face, I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;ll address my only dissatisfaction, and that&#x27;s the smell. It has that strong coconut-y scent, but I can&#x27;t downgrade the rating much, because it&#x27;s actually what I expect from Hawaiian Tropic exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;Works&amp;#34; as sunscreen with great results, and the face really needs to be protected&lt;br /&gt;* My skin is not dry. It&#x27;s normal to oily at times, and this was not overly heavy or oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;* Absorbed easily and completely. I wore it under makeup and didn&#x27;t need to wait to apply my makeup.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is as great, a little milder than most HT products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this lotion stand apart is its less greasy formula.  As a pro photographer, I find the lotion better than the standard supermarket brands because it doesn&#x27;t smear the display on the back of my camera as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to soak into my skin quickly, and I feel as if I need to apply more than regular lotion, but it does its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have kept in the car on hot days longer than I should, but it holds up fine, not separating as I&#x27;ve seen others do.  We have not gotten into the hottest days of summer yet--and I&#x27;m not going to push it, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with this variation of my favorite sunscreen, and I plan to keep it in my gear bag for morning and late afternoon outings.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this face lotion- the SPF 30, the hydration, the scent, the sun protection it gives my skin.  What I don&#x27;t love is that it stings a little bit when I put it on.  I have very sensitive skin.  The stinging goes away after a few minutes, but it&#x27;s pretty significant for me. It seems to be less noticeable if I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for a week or so, steady.  But still, the lotion provides SPF 30 and is otherwise quite good.</li>
    <li> I was delighted with this lightly scented cream when it first arrived.  Got about 1/5 of the way through the bottle when the pump dispenser broke.  Irretrievably useless and pumpless with absolutely no way to get the top off and access the remainder of the product without taking a hammer to shatter the plastic.  Threw it away, would never get this again!</li>
    <li> Very nice sunscreen, with an unusually light texture for a high spf sunscreen. The fragrance is coconutty, medium strong. It has a light tan color but does not impart color to the skin. I will get a lot of use from this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This particular lotion comes in a very convenient bottle with an easy pump. The lotion itself looks appealing with the stripes in it. Now, the smell is very perfume-y... reminds me of other Hawaiian Tropic items but has an even stronger smell. This will either be a hit or miss for each person. For me, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but maybe just a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this and it is definitely not oily as advertised. In fact, I don&#x27;t feel like it really moisturized my skin. There is one spot on my cheek that&#x27;s a bit dry and it still feels slightly dry after using this. It seem to have been moisturized only a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is advertised to last 12 hours but lasted for me maybe at max 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was so-so for me and the biggest pro this has going for it is the fact that it is not greasy or oily. It is far from natural if you&#x27;re looking for a more natural lotion. This does do a decent job, just seem like it&#x27;s not for extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  It spreads easily on the face and the SPF works well.  I wish, however, that it didn&#x27;t have a scent to it.  I put on face lotion with an SPF--not just when I&#x27;m going to sit out in the sun.  And for daily wear, I prefer products that have no scent.  The scent, however, is quite minor and shouldn&#x27;t deter one from trying the product.  After all, it costs much less than most other face skin care products with SPF.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, so I like for the face lotion I put on each morning to have sun protection in it. I haven’t been using this product as sunscreen, though--applying it multiple times if I’ll be outside for long stretches of time. I just use it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does burn slightly when I first apply it, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but the sensation goes away within 15 seconds or so for me. The scent is pleasant enough, but it is a little too reminiscent of tanning lotion for me to want to smell it all day. Coconut oil just reminds me of the outdoors, and it’s a little bizarre to be sitting at my desk all day catching whiffs now and then that make me think of the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the lotion is nice: it’s smooth and thick, but it rubs in easily and doesn’t leave an oily residue on my skin. I wondered whether the “ribbon” of color in the product would add any sort of self-tanning effect to my face, but it doesn’t appear to. My biggest complaint pertains to the packaging: a single pump dispenses a larger amount of the product than I need to cover my face, so I’ve taken to doing more like a half-pump so I don’t have too much excess lotion that I’m trying to rub in to already-saturated skin.</li>
    <li> I liked the way this went on--light, not greasy and very good protection throughout the day. The scent is pleasant, but personally I prefer no scent so that was a drawback. Also, although it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34;, there are three ingredients that people can be allergic to--avobenzone, octocrylene, and oxybenzone. Those are the only drawbacks I saw to this (and the ingredients did not affect me at all--just wish it was unscented). A good product overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite some time, and since I live in the Pacific Northwest, haven&#x27;t had much opportunity to use it, but I recently went to Cabo and shoved it in my beach bag for the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels smooth and silky on the skin. It absorbs nicely, you don&#x27;t have to keep rubbing and rubbing for the white to dissipate. It has a nice scent that is subtle and not overpowering. Sometimes when I use product, I break out, but this touts it is &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;won&#x27;t clog pores&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out during my drip (unlike what I used on my chest). I could go in the pool and not worry about reapplying right away because it&#x27;s water resistant. It made my skin feel smooth. Also, this is a great size to tote to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all...no burn! (again, unlike my chest, which was not a Hawaiian Tropic product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. (I also bought their Hydration After Sun Lotion, which I also recommend)</li>
    <li> At our recent beach vacation Hawaiian Tropic came away the big winner.  My partner, who is fair skinned, used Hawaiian Tropic and walked away from 9 hours at the beach with not a hint of sunburn.  I, on the other hand, had used Banana Boat for Men and though having much darker complexion than my partner was sunburned so bad I had the chills that night.  We were in the sun the same amount of time and I had been outside considerably longer than my partner before we hit the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only conclusion that can be drawn is that Hawaiian Tropic is a clear winner.  Not only that is had added moisturizing benefits which my partner said made her skin feel supple, not dried out.</li>
    <li> Having just attended a lecture by a leading esthetician I knew I needed to step up my sun protection.  I live in the tropics and wear lots of makeup with SPF in it but that just is not enough.  I have added this lotion to my morning routine.  I put it on after washing my face and layer the moisturizer on after it.  I love that it is a 12 hour protection.  Everyone should be wearing an SPF daily!  Ladies get the men in your life on the bandwagon too!</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea of this product, and at first it seemed to work well. A facial sunscreen with decent SPF that doesn&#x27;t make me all shiny? Perfect! I didn&#x27;t like the scent, but I was willing to tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after using it for about a week, my face started getting all red and irritated whenever I&#x27;d apply it. At first I thought it must be my soap, or the air, or something else, because I don&#x27;t generally have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;d been using it just fine. But no, it was this Hawaiian Tropic Face Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to being sad and shiny. Ah well.</li>
    <li> When I opened this it flooded me with happy memories because of it&#x27;s scent. It reminds me of summers past, spent at the beach or at the lake. I also remembered the lotions of the past with their sticky texture and the need to reapply it so often. Well, the only sameness is the scent, this lotion goes on smooth and easy. It was absorbed quickly. It lasted all afternoon. It did not cause any rash or face breakout. I love it! I would recommend this as a daily moisturizer during the summer because you just never know when you will be out in the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and burn quite easily. I also have found that many facial products for sun protection cause me to break out and make my skin oily. I have used this several times so far and have been quite pleased with the results. I love the Hawaiian Tropic scent anyway--I wish they&#x27;d bottle it and sell it as an EDT--so that made me want to try this one. Of course if you have skin allergies or issues you need to check out ingredients; but that&#x27;s just normal common sense. This product is light, greaseless and makes my skin feel smooth. Use it on the neck, as well.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion, it smells amazing (like you would expect with coconut fragrance and such) and works well, it&#x27;s thick but I don&#x27;t have any problems coating my face and neck with it, it never clogs my pores, and it provides a nice level of sun protection. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny which many sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen keeps my face from burning, feels silky, and smells nice.  It is a very small bottle though, so the price seems a little high to me.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the sunblock from this brand --- I&#x27;ve never used this brand before --- and I loved it so when I saw this up on Vine, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. I know you can use sunblock on your face but I hate that white cast it has and how it takes FOREVER to absorb, not something I&#x27;d want to deal with on my face so I decided to try the face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how small this is so I can throw it in my work purse and go and since I work outside a lot it&#x27;s nice to know I have sunblock in my locker if I need it! I also LOVE the scent, it&#x27;s not too strong and it really makes you feel like you&#x27;re on a tropical vacation! I also like how fast this absorbs and I didn&#x27;t have a big problem with the white cast I was talking about earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found my go to sunblock brand!</li>
    <li> This is a quality face cream that also happens to have superior sunblocking qualities.  I use it when i go for a run and find it goes on smooth, is absorbed easily, and doesn&#x27;t bleed into my eyes.  Excellent formulation!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not prone to sunburn, I wear sun protection on a daily basis, and I find that even a little SPF keeps any burning at bay.  At SPF 30, I would imagine that Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Face Lotion would protect a more sun-sensitive skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two tests for facial sunblock; whether or not it runs into my eyes and whether or not it causes breakouts.  This one stays put and allows my skin to stay clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is well-designed too; it&#x27;s easy to get a controllable amount of product out and lotion has not leaked out all over the bottom of my bag.  I&#x27;m a big fan of packaging that allows me to take sunscreen on the go as it is designed to be reapplied throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this!</li>
    <li> They scented this just a little too much for my liking. When something is going to be directly on my face, it&#x27;s obviously right where I can smell it and I prefer to go very light so I&#x27;m not inhaling so much of it. That&#x27;s personal preference and your opinion might obviously be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it absorbs well and seems to do its job as far as sun protection goes. For people a little less sensitive to scent, the smell is also fairly summery, which is nice given that it feels &#x27;in season&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Since this is a Hawaiian Tropic product, I wasn&#x27;t too surprised that it smells like their suntan products. The word Silk in the name indicates there may be some silk in the lotion, and sure enough, about half-way down the list of ingredients I see &amp;#34;Silk Amino Acids/&amp;#34; which are said to be extracted from raw silk. Here is the complete list of ingredients: Water , Cetearyl Alcohol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane , Glycerin , VP/Eicosene Copolymer , Diisopropyl Adipate , Ethylhexyl Benzoate , Phenethyl Benzoate , Polyethylene , Sodium Polyacrylate , Caprylyl Glycol , Dimethicone , Coco-Glucoside , Ceteth-10 Phosphate , Dicetyl Phosphate , Xanthan Gum , Carbomer , Disodium EDTA , Paraffin , Mica , Silk Amino Acids , Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate , Tocopheryl Acetate , Panthenol , Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice , Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract , Colocasia Antiquorum Root Extract , Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract , Passiflora Incarnata Fruit Extract , Plumeria Acutifolia Flower Extract , Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract , Phenoxyethanol , Methylparaben , Propylparaben , Fragrance , Bismuth Oxychloride , Iron Oxides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I do not see this list on the Amazon page. It is on a product label that is under the back label on the bottle in rather small type. One of the sunscreen ingredients, oxybenzone, is controversial. Rather than just taking the rather alarming warnings on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website, I recommend reading the Wikipedia page. It&#x27;s a little more balanced but still offers reasons to worry. If you think that your skin is a good barrier to internal absorption, consider this: &amp;#34;In a 2008 study of participants ages 6 and up, oxybenzone was detected in 96.8% of urine samples.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would avoid using this on children or while pregnant. For adults, use only when needed and try to find safer products. Personally, I don&#x27;t plan to use it anyway because (a) I dislike the smell and (b) I am allergic to aloe. I did not know that it contained aloe when I ordered it because Amazon did not list all the ingredients.w that it contained aloe when I ordered it because Amazon did not list all the ingredients.</li>
