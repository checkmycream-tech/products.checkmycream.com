      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>They work better for me than bobby clips or even a hair band.</li>
      <li>, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be made of gold :)</li>

      <li>/&gt;They hold more hair than I thought..</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for more than a year</li>
      <li>I love that they come in an 18-pack, because I tend to lose them around the house/car/purse.  </li>

      <li>These clips are my go-to answer for a quick hair-do or a hot day, as well as a great way to get my hair out of the way when I wash my face.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even grab them comfortably, how am I suppose to be able to use these?</li>
      <li>good product, shipped fast and</li>
      <li>Easy to put in, easy to take out.</li>
      <li>They can easily pop out of your fingers.</li>
      <li>These are perfect for holding hair bits off my face while I&#x27;m waiting for it to grow back, and they&#x27;re fun to boot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten some of this size before that are strong and hold a lot of hair, but not these.</li>
      <li>Strong grip without ripping the hair out.</li>
      <li>These clips have a strong grip.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m growing my hair out, and while it&#x27;s not baby fine or anything, there&#x27;s just not a lot of it</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t recommend these for people with really fine hair though since they don&#x27;t have rubber non slip on the inside.</li>
      <li>Because they&#x27;re so cheap</li>
      <li>They fit snug in place and don&#x27;t move.</li>
      <li>These were smaller than I thought they would be and not that great of quality.</li>
      <li>However, Amazon had them, plus they were really cheap.</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic rubbish</li>
      <li>Smaller than they look in the picture but great value.</li>
      <li>I added these hair clips to my order to qualify for the free shipping.  </li>
      <li>and honestly they don&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
      <li>Goody&#x27;s mini clips are larger and a bit more sturdy, and would be more suitable for thicker hair.  </li>
      <li>These are small and perfect.</li>
      <li>but they seem to hold more than you think when you first look at them.</li>
      <li>My Grand Daughter has very thick hair and these work perfectly for her.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re about the right size for toddlers!</li>
      <li>but they are just the right size!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, and I still am not going to be able to pull back more than about 1&amp;#34; width of hair with these.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair, so they work perfectly to give me that whimsical look :)</li>
      <li>The packaging on them was great because they didn&#x27;t get crushed during shipping.</li>
      <li>Only good for 1-2 wears.</li>
      <li>Make sure your hair is ready to be clipped when you grab one.  </li>
      <li>I have thick, wavy/curly hair, and these hold my hair perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I love them to pull my bangs back and the look is super trendy right now.</li>
      <li>I keep them around in all my purses for a quick up-do.</li>
      <li>and so you&#x27;ll go through them quickly if you use them often.</li>
      <li>The company was kind enough to let me keep the scrunchies they had originally sent by  mistake</li>
      <li>As long as they don&#x27;t get stepped on, they are good to go.</li>
      <li>These are great little clips for you hair, however the teeth break pretty easily</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
      <li>great little clips.</li>
      <li>These are great for clipping back bangs but aren&#x27;t large enough for holding more quantities of hair.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t look like they are very sturdy, but they were relatively cheap</li>
      <li>Tiny claws require acute dexterity.  </li>
      <li>they are more geared toward a child than adult and do not hold my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Strong grip without ripping the hair out. I have really thick/heavy hair and these hold my bangs back with no troubles.</li>
    <li> I first Goody mini-clips, but I had such a hard time opening them that I ended up by these Scunci&#x27;s mini clips, which open easily.  There are small, which is exactly what I need to keep my hair out of my eyes when working out.  I would give it 5 stars, but I wish they offered them in just brown or black.</li>
    <li> I have very baby-fine hair that is thin in places around my face and forehead, and one of my favorite ways to wear my hair is to use these exact clips to secure the hair all around my scalp line to where it looks a bit like I have it braided just at the hairline. Then my hair is free past that and forms a natural bounce and fluff, thereby giving the beautiful deception of thickness and volume. The clips (the smaller the better) hold pretty well in my hair as long as I do not have too much hair gathered in any one clip or clipped too far away from my scalp line. These clips are my go-to answer for a quick hair-do or a hot day, as well as a great way to get my hair out of the way when I wash my face. If you have thinning or baby-fine hair, do try them. They work better for me than bobby clips or even a hair band. ~~ the wife</li>
    <li> These are small and perfect. They fit snug in place and don&#x27;t move. They aren&#x27;t very noticeable which is a plus for me. Surprisingly I haven&#x27;t broken a single one yet so that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
    <li> These are a great way to pull your hair back without being obvious or bulky. I used to get these at a local drugstore but haven&#x27;t been able to locate them anywhere for the past couple of years. I don&#x27;t care for similar products that are close to the same size. The other products tend to be stiffer and bulkier. These work great. Unfortunately (through no fault of the product), I have a tendency to lose these and needed replacements. As an afterthought, I decided to check Amazon and was thrilled to discover they sold them. I purchased several packs and hope they will last me a while before being accidentally misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, under the product features it says \\&quot;Mini jaw clip is ideal for children&#x27;s dos.\\&quot; These ARE very small clips but I am an adult female with long, naturally curly, medium-thick hair and these are perfect for my needs. Most of the time, I use one on each side to pull hair back and up out of my face and they stay in with no problem. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them falling apart or breaking unexplainably. I have managed to break them but it was definitely due to my negligence - i.e. placing them in my pocket, forgetting about them, sitting down and promptly smashing them. I&#x27;m guessing it was my fat butt and not the product at fault.</li>
    <li> I curly hair and these are perfect to keep them together.  Same as the ones at CVS.</li>
    <li> Beware, these clips are really tine, not the standard small size. At first I was a little disappointed with them, but they hold hair well (whatever hard they can grasp)</li>
    <li> Sometimes I want to wear my hear down but don&#x27;t want it in my face.  I can use these little clips to pull back small sections of hair until I have just enough out of my face so that it doesn&#x27;t annoy me...but still gives the effect of wearing my hair down.</li>
    <li> I love these clips! They are so cute and small and they hod your hair in place so well!  I would definitely recommend these!!</li>
    <li> These clips have a strong grip. They are small though so don&#x27;t expect them to hold a ton of hair but they seem to hold more than you think when you first look at them.</li>
    <li> These honestly do nothing to hold my hair back, I wasn&#x27;t looking for it to hold a ton of hair but at least my bangs! it will hold a few stands and not very well!</li>
    <li> The picture shows a full-sized hair clip, but these things are doll-sized. Useless, so I&#x27;m returning these today. But it&#x27;s a huge hassle since I don&#x27;t have the hair clips I wanted when I needed them, and now I have to mess with shipping these back.</li>
    <li> The clips are good for thin hair.  However, if you have medium to think hair, I find that these clips break easily and do not have enough grip to keep those fly-aways under control.</li>
    <li> I find if I clip up my curly hair when it&#x27;s wet and leave the clips in all day, it gets &#x27;trained&#x27; for the rest of the week without the need for clips. These clips are TINY, but that is just what I was looking for.  The black ones are perfect for holding back bangs that are growing out or stray wisps. They get lost in my thick curly hair so not too noticeable. They stay and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> I wish they were slightly bigger. I have fine hair, and I still am not going to be able to pull back more than about 1&amp;#34; width of hair with these.</li>
    <li> First these clips are small, a little smaller than a penny..only meant to hold a little bit of hair in place. In that sense they are great and haven&#x27;t broken yet given their size. Don&#x27;t recommend these for people with really fine hair though since they don&#x27;t have rubber non slip on the inside.</li>
    <li> Good product. But one of the clips was broken when I got it. I have 18 more so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
    <li> These clips are definitely hard to find in the store, they never have this particular size. However, Amazon had them, plus they were really cheap. The packaging on them was great because they didn&#x27;t get crushed during shipping. I use these for keeping the front parts of my hair back, like my bangs. For such small clips they hold really well.</li>
    <li> Two of the clips broke the first time they were used.  The rest lost teeth in a matter of a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I added these hair clips to my order to qualify for the free shipping.  It was the perfect choice for a couple dollar purchase.  It served as a stocking stuffer and my daughter wears them everyday.  They seem to hold up well and she likes the size, saying they hold the right amount of hair for that small piece to the side look.</li>
    <li> These are not for adult hair because of the size of the clip, they should be used on children. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> These can hold hardly any hair. I&#x27;ve gotten some of this size before that are strong and hold a lot of hair, but not these.</li>
    <li> so awesome for when I just need my hair out of my eyes.  I love that it comes with a few color options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing my bangs out and these are perfect for clipping them back.  You have to be careful though, they are small.  Make sure your hair is ready to be clipped when you grab one.  They can easily pop out of your fingers.</li>
    <li> Not a good enough grip in these clips. Each time I&#x27;ve tried using these clips no matter how many I use at a time, my hair falls right back down with the clips sliding out.  I can&#x27;t see these clips being strong enough to hold baby doll hair up. Kind of a waste. Using them to keep usual fly always intact under pony tail.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. For the price it&#x27;s not too bad. They get stuck in my hair a lot and honestly they don&#x27;t hold much hair. The picture isn&#x27;t a good portrayal of size. These are tiny -- perfect to hold a small portion of the bangs back, but not really much else.</li>
    <li> good product, shipped fast and the wife is happy with them.  As long as they don&#x27;t get stepped on, they are good to go.</li>
    <li> Tiny claws require acute dexterity.  I frequently fumble them when trying to put them in my hair.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item, I didn&#x27;t realize how mini these mini clips were. They are labeled as Mini Jaw Clips for thick hair, so I thought that they would be a little bit bigger. I did end up keeping the clips because it would seem like such a hassle to send them back. I do still use them though. They are just big enough for me to put up my bangs. I do have pretty thick black hair so I was amazed that they still held my bangs together. Even though these clips work, they would work better for someone with finer hair or younger girls.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and these work great to pull small pieces of my hair back to give a quick, easy cheat of a style. I just need to find a better way to keep up with them, because they&#x27;re very small!</li>
    <li> Looked every where for these little guys.  Was so happy to find them on Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find them anyplace around here.  I love them to pull my bangs back and the look is super trendy right now.</li>
    <li> Size as expected. Good as for fine mine as for my kids&#x27; hair. Works good. No problem with use. Good ordinary colors.</li>
    <li> So I was excited to receive my jaw clips but then opened my package to my disappointment received 2 packages of black scrunchies. Im waiting to see how the seller is gonna deal with this situation (as I did write to them and told them of the mix up) and will write a followup to this, once I see what takes place. And maybe will add a few stars or take one off. Lets see&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I received the item. The company was kind enough to let me keep the scrunchies they had originally sent by  mistake and they sent my order of jaw clips. And though I am pleased with the customer service I do have to say that the clips were way too small. I mean I knew they were gonna be mini clips but I didn&#x27;t think they were gonna be extra tiny clips. So I&#x27;ll give 3 stars for the service but thats it.</li>
    <li> these break faster than I would like to see.  I got them for a good price though, and I like how many come in a package</li>
    <li> I have somewhat thick hair but these actually work so well! I got the shorter ones, and alligator claw ones, and they just don&#x27;t hold the hair as well so I had to get these online.</li>
    <li> My fault, it does say 1 cm but I didn&#x27;t realize that 1 cm is really small for a hair clip. I don&#x27;t think I will get much use out of them as they will only hold a very very small clump of hair and can&#x27;t be used to pull my overgrown bangs to the back of my head. Maybe I can use them instead of bobby pins for pulling a little back on the sides -- tried it &amp; it only works on &#x27;part&#x27; side of my head where there is less hair to pull back.</li>
    <li> I got these as an add on item and I thought they would be just a little bit bigger than they actually were. I have really thin, fine hair and still to put my hair back in any sort of way I would have to use at least five of these.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. It was smaller than I imagined and when I tried to even use it, it broke into pieces. Cheap plastic rubbish, that is what it is.</li>
    <li> I should have known better than to try these. My thick hair was too much for them and they did not last.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how easy the jaws are to open and how much hair these tiny clips can actually grab. The ones I was using before were incredibly hard to open. The wire spring was just too strong for the tiny clip and I would often drop them as a result. These are very nice. Easy to put in, easy to take out. Time will tell how strong the claws are, in the past, similar brands&#x27; claws have broken off easily. I will amend my review accordingly after I find out how well these perform over time!</li>
    <li> These were smaller than I thought they would be and not that great of quality. I can use them I guess.</li>
    <li> Tiny and cheaply made. I can&#x27;t even grab them comfortably, how am I suppose to be able to use these? They are miniscule. Frustrating. Maybe good for babies&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> great little clips. Much better than drugstore deals</li>
    <li> 4 stars because I LOVE THEM, but the price should probably be about $1.5 cheaper. D:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hold more hair than I thought.. I have straight-across bangs plus a little length to the sides and with one of these clips I can pull all my bangs back, plus some and do a mini-pump and still have a discreet, non-gaudy clip holding it in place.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got seriously thick, bushy hair, too- if that helps. These things are a life saver, if you know how to use them ;D</li>
    <li> The Scunci Effortless Beauty Thick Hair Mini Jaw Clips are not for thick hair because they are much smaller than they appear.</li>
    <li> They do what they are meant to.</li>
    <li> too small but look good on the barbies</li>
    <li> Holds my very thick hair out of my face</li>
    <li> The description states the clips are 1cm, but they look more like 1/2cm to me. These could be used for dolls or infants, but I would think twice about buying them for any other purpose.</li>
    <li> These are very very weak clips. I have clips about the same size as these from Claire&#x27;s and they have incredible clamping strength, so I was a bit surprised by how weak the Scunci ones are. They feel like they&#x27;re meant for children&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m putting very little hair in them but I do like to place the clips farther back on my head, and these just keep slipping out or letting go of my hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend them but obviously they work for other people. I&#x27;m going to give my set to someone&#x27;s daughter and try to find something else for myself.  Edited to add: I just got these which are much stronger/sturdier clips:  [[ASIN:B003YOX52Y Goody Micro Claw Clip, Mini 15 On, 15ct]]</li>
    <li> Clips are cute but do not last long literally broke all my clips purchased this item a month or so back.</li>
    <li> No problems, all are intact and exactly what i ordered. Happy to say this purchase turned out well., and they look great.</li>
    <li> I routinely use the tiny Goody mini clips (normally purchased at Target). I have long curly hair, and I use 3 or 4 of the tiny clips to strategically secure &amp; position individual locks, not large sections of hair. I purchased the Scunci ones from Amazon, and while they are similar to the ones I normally use, they are about 20% bigger. As such, they don&#x27;t hold my hair as well and also are more visible which I don&#x27;t like.  Because these are a bigger size, the teeth don&#x27;t actually secure the hair in the middle of the clip. In my case, with curly hair, the curls pull slightly loose because of this, and it looks messy.</li>
    <li> I love these clips!  I have thick, wavy/curly hair, and these hold my hair perfectly.  Just the right size for my little updos (my bangs are annoying, so I twist them up and out of the way).  I love that they come in an 18-pack, because I tend to lose them around the house/car/purse.  I was pleased to find them here, as I had looked at several retail stores and couldn&#x27;t find them in this size.</li>
    <li> Great item. i use as plant clips</li>
    <li> For thick hair these might just not work. But I&#x27;m growing my hair out, and while it&#x27;s not baby fine or anything, there&#x27;s just not a lot of it yet since there&#x27;s very little overlap (it&#x27;s only a couple inches long overall). These are perfect for holding hair bits off my face while I&#x27;m waiting for it to grow back, and they&#x27;re fun to boot. I like to pinch them on little bits of hair in patterns, so that it looks neat and not messy. Growing hair out takes so much patience, you should certainly use things like this to make it less of a hassle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bet these would be amazing on little girl hair. They&#x27;re about the right size for toddlers!</li>
    <li> They work well and do what they are supposed to. Usually a good brand and all three colors makes it easy to match.</li>
    <li> These are great little clips for you hair, however the teeth break pretty easily and so you&#x27;ll go through them quickly if you use them often.</li>
    <li> Holds the hair nicely and fits good</li>
    <li> very small. sayss for thick hair, but i dint think they are - i dont have thick hair so they will work for my needs.</li>
    <li> Thick hair???  Seriously?  These are for little kids with baby fine hair.  The picture on the package is very deceiving.  They look big, they&#x27;re not.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these clips. They are small but that&#x27;s how I like them for picking up smaller sections of hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, straight, fine hair (asian) and these clips PERFECTLY hold just a few strands off her face without slipping or having to be &amp;#34;shifted up&amp;#34; too often during the day. They do not have the soft rubber on the inside, but they still seem to hold my daughter&#x27;s fine hair without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, I have wavy, thick-er hair and I have it in a pixie cut with long bangs, and I use these clips to keep the bangs out of my face while I&#x27;m working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips are super tiny- smaller than dimes. They are definitely not designed to hold &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of hair- just a few strands. But if you want a small, discrete clip to pull back a lock of hair, or just get your hair out of your face, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I use these while my hair dries, to add lift and volume. I find that they work better than alligator clips, for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Too wimpy top do anything with</li>
    <li> These clips are SO TINY!  I don&#x27;t see how they are made for thick hair.  I have fine straight hair and they are too small for my hair.</li>
    <li> i got this shipment in within a week and the clips are cute if you have very thin hair. I have thick hair so i had to use 2-3 for one side of my head.  otherwise havent broken one since :)</li>
    <li> I bought these clips as part of a Halloween costume.  They worked perfectly.  I don&#x27;t know that they could serve much more purpose than a bobby pin would, but were sufficient for my needs.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair, they are good for holding back just a few pieces of hair, but if you have thin hair they could hold back a substantial amount.  They are the smallest any clip could be, know that, no matter what the picture looks like.</li>
    <li> Use these to clip small sections of my hair around my face.  I have fine curly hair, so they work perfectly to give me that whimsical look :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t look like they are very sturdy, but they were relatively cheap, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be made of gold :)</li>
    <li> This product is WAY smaller than expected.&lt;br /&gt;AND VERY cheaply made. Have to handle delicately as I am afraid that they will break by touching them.&lt;br /&gt;Was not expecting such a cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> you will need a cluster of them to pull back any substantial amt of hair, but they do work and i will use them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these myself; I use them solely for my little dog so I can see her eyes! They don&#x27;t pull out her fur, and while I have to readjust once she&#x27;s scratched it or has been playing, they serve their purpose well and are surprisingly durable.</li>
    <li> I Have curly hair and sometimes its hard to make it behave, these can hide in the curl of the hair and give me  some control on my front bangs.</li>
    <li> These shipped quickly, were in good packaging and arrived in good shape.  they are more geared toward a child than adult and do not hold my hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small scrunchie to hold my long bangs to the side and these are perfect for what I wanted.  If you are looking for something to hold a lot of hair these are not for you.  They seem to be made nicely but the spring is not real strong so they are intended for small jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Amazon Prime member I got these as an add on to one of my orders and so got free two day shipping and everything in my order arrived on time in great shape.</li>
    <li> Like them to make hair styling cause they hold very good for their size and stay on it&#x27;s place all over the day and night, if needed ;)</li>
    <li> The clips don&#x27;t have much spring and are a pain to open and close.</li>
    <li> Much smaller then they looked..in fact..they are &amp;#34;tiny&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> it was a nice price, but after using them so many times, the teeth do break off easy. Would not recommend for kids. They would break after only a couple of uses</li>
    <li> These might be 1 CC, I didn&#x27;t measure but they seem very small.  Only buy if you want tiny ones.  Price seems fair / didn&#x27;t end up using them for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would be tiny enough but they are just the right size! Perfect for clipping little girl hair, pushing long bangs to the side or fixing those little whisps!</li>
    <li> Pro:  great, easy to use, have used over and over.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  wish could get pack of all one color (brown) instead of multicolors.</li>
    <li> Perfect mini size but with great grip/hold!! I keep them around in all my purses for a quick up-do. I suggest anyone to buy them!</li>
    <li> Love these small clips!</li>
    <li> Made the mistake of not reading the description very well of this product or the reviews.  If you look at the picture of the girl in the product she has a larger style clip, not a itty bitty mini one.</li>
    <li> these clips are really good. If your hair is super thick it might be a problem sometimes it will barely hold my hair but my sister has really thin hair and they work out way better on her.</li>
    <li> These are good small hair clips.  They are really very small.  Work best for a style with several in your hair or with short hair just to pull side pieces back.  Great for a toddler who will keep them in her hair too.</li>
    <li> I love these but I don&#x27;t use them for my hair. I use them to clip wires and cables together, so I don&#x27;t know if my review will apply to you. However, for my purposed, they work great.</li>
    <li> These clips are TINY.  They are great to hold small wisps of hair, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d hold thick hair very well.  Goody&#x27;s mini clips are larger and a bit more sturdy, and would be more suitable for thicker hair.  But if you are looking for tiny clips to hold small amounts of hair, these are what you need.  They&#x27;d also be great for clipping orchids to their stake.</li>
    <li> Tiny tiny clips not.08 inch that is the size of the package, its too much effort the return so I guess I will just trash them</li>
    <li> I got these since I use these types of clips a lot.  It&#x27;s a bit cheaper than in the store.  I&#x27;ve been using them for more than a year and I have maybe 3 of them left that haven&#x27;t broken.  I got them because they are similar to some other clips that I got a long time ago, and that store no longer carries them.  I wear them pretty much every day.  Because they&#x27;re so cheap I could just replace the ones that broke but they really didn&#x27;t last that long.  If you have thin hair or you&#x27;re just using them to accent your hairstyle rather than support your hair, they would probably be ok.</li>
    <li> My Grand Daughter has very thick hair and these work perfectly for her. I also use them with my feather hair clips.</li>
    <li> Too thin and not the clips I was expecting, don&#x27;t want to bother with returning..</li>
    <li> A little to small for my particular hair.</li>
    <li> Good product and price but smaller than expected. Product came on time.&lt;br /&gt;First these clips are small, a little smaller than a penny..only meant to hold a little bit of hair in place.</li>
    <li> As described. Mini clips. But can buy almost every place locally</li>
    <li> The good news: they hold thick hair. The bad news: The long teeth break too easily. Only good for 1-2 wears.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful clips --- I&#x27;m dumbstruck at the ability of others to copy the design.  If you have thick hair - this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> the clips are far too small for my hair - which is moderately thin - and they broke immediately when I took them out of the package. will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was not prepared to see how small these clips actually were. As tiny as the are, they can hardly handle my thick, curly hair. Now I just use these on wash days when I deep condition and apply other treatments. These are the only days when my curls are stretched enough to fit in these adorably miniscule clips.</li>
    <li> Good but very very small</li>
    <li> Smaller than they look in the picture but great value. I use them to clip pieces of hair aside while curling my hair</li>
    <li> These are great for clipping back bangs but aren&#x27;t large enough for holding more quantities of hair. These are about the size of a dime.</li>
