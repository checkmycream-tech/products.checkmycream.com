    <li> Smells amazing, and actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do do! Cleans and detangles! What a novel idea. I&#x27;ve searched for detangling shampoos which actually work since tcb and cream of nature changed their formulas and don&#x27;t work anymore. My search is over. Don&#x27;t change Nairobi! If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> love, love, love..product is awesome... Love the way it makes my hair feel, and love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer of this product!</li>
