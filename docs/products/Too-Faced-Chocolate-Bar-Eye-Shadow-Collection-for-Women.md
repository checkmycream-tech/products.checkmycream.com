    <li> Love everything about this palette. I&#x27;ve always loved brown colors. And, this palette is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and, did I mention IT SMELLS LIKE CHOCOLATE?!</li>
    <li> arrived in box , but eye shadow tin was scratched all up very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Awesome eye makeup and great colors.</li>
    <li> This is such a fun palette.  The colors are fabulous and they REALLY do smell like chocolate.  If you search on YouTube you&#x27;ll find several videos from bloggers about different ways to apply these colors.  I use this palette every single day.</li>
    <li> It was shipped and handled with care!! And it smells like chocolate because it&#x27;s made with coco plants!!</li>
    <li> This is gorgeous color. Very pigmented, stays on beautifully. I adore that it smells like chocolate.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is Incredible and delivery was speedy and intact!</li>
    <li> I Love this pallet, it&#x27;s not only looks great but smells great, plus it&#x27;s got really chocolate In the powder...what girl doesn&#x27;t love chocolate. I feel it makes it super smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> This is the original Too Faced Chocolate Bar palette!  Amazing neutrals with some matte and some shimmery shadows.  Excellent for traveling and creating an array of eye looks.  Part of my collection now:).</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this palette. It&#x27;s my go to every single time I go out. The colors are very pigmented and let&#x27;s not forget the smell  :)</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these for my daughters.  The colors are beautiful plus they smell like chocolate!  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a reason to recommend something but honestly the awesome aroma does add to the appeal.</li>
    <li> This was a Birthday gift and i lOve it!&lt;br /&gt;It smells Delish! I got it from Macy&#x27;s so i know it&#x27;s the Real Deal as far as authenticity. The color pay off is incredible and stays put.&lt;br /&gt;the colors are to die for so warm and creamy, This worked for me and my skin with no irritation or break-outs.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite palette EVER. I am an makeup whore, but this one I keep coming back to. I love it!</li>
    <li> The Best palette money can buy. The colors smell amazing and it&#x27;s super pigmented.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow was gorgeous, but when I accidentally dropped it, one of the small eyeshadows completely shattered/broke. The tin box is ridiculous when you drop it just once.</li>
    <li> Love these colors!!! They are easily spread on and they look great together... the only complaint I have is the application eye make up that you apply the eye shadow with is kinda hard and it falls apart.... but other than that I love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this. Totally awesome. I tasted it as well to test authenticity of the chocolate, and to my surprise it was sweet just like chocolate. Completely in love and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I originally wanted this palette because of how it looked, but after using it I can definitely say this product is worth it. The colors are pigmented, they smell good (like chocolate, not sure why that matters), and they last a very long time. They are easy to blend and do not crease! I bought the semi-sweet palette, so let&#x27;s see how that one performs! :)</li>
    <li> This palette is definitely NOT worth the 45$. This palette should be 6$ at most. Not only are the colors hard to transfer onto my lids but the colors don&#x27;t even stay on and fade within the hour.......I use Nars primer which holds ELF shadows for wayyy longer than these colors. Can not believe other people hyped this product up so much. Shouldn&#x27;t have listened. Do not get this...</li>
    <li> I love this palette, I purchased it from Sephora. It smells divine, like chocolate. It is very pigmented (except for strawberry bon bon). The thing is, it&#x27;s a permanent edition to the too faced line, so why is it selling for $62 dollars on amazon? But it from ULTA, Sephora, or the too faced website.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually buy palettes but this one has all the perfect colors for me (I have tan skin). And it&#x27;s way too cute -- I love the case and the chocolate smell! Your face will smell like dessert, but not obnoxiously. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m only giving four stars because it contains talc and mica which may concern some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add: I actually accidentally bought a counterfeit before getting the real one.&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO TELL IF IT&#x27;S FAKE:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not smell like chocolate&lt;br /&gt;- Label sheet has a pink font instead of light purple&lt;br /&gt;- Less detailing on the case&lt;br /&gt;- Shades are duller and not bold at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added comparison pictures from my blog. (I don&#x27;t have the original pictures anymore so it has my lame watermark, sorry.)</li>
    <li> Shipped faster than expected, the palette was in perfect condition, and it is the updated slimmer palette, with the names printed on the actual palette, not a clear plastic overlay insert.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful colors, and good color payoff! An all around great palette to add to your collection with the interesting bonus of the sweet smell of chocolate.</li>
    <li> The too faced eye shadows are beautiful and excellent.i enjoy from the prudect very much.</li>
    <li> This is a fun product and it&#x27;s one I use almost every day. These shadows are mostly neutral in color, and they are scented with chocolate (how did they do that?) The palette box is metal, like a child&#x27;s paintbox. Two of the shadows are \\&quot;base\\&quot; colors, one shimmery, one matte and the rest go from medium to dark, with a few colors (purple, burgundy.) Mostly, these are neutrals. Some of the shadows are shimmery or glittery but most of them are matte. I find this a very useful set and I carry it on trips. By wetting one of my makeup brushes, I can use the shadow as liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well to use a primer with these shadows: I use [[ASIN:B0013CSGBE Too Faced Cosmetics, Shadow Insurance]] which works well, as long as you squeeze the tube a bit before using to mix it up; it tends to separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are tutorials all over Youtube to give you examples of how to mix up these shadows. The only shadow that doesn&#x27;t work for me is the violet one--it&#x27;s very glittery and it doesn&#x27;t go on very evenly or dark. So it&#x27;s not the crease shadow you&#x27;d hope for. It seems to work better wet. I just don&#x27;t use that one at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the metal palette for throwing in my makeup bag as it is very sturdy in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> I love my Too Faced Chocolate Bat Eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Love it! The colors, packaging and pigmentation are all great and it smells delicious. The person complaining about it being too pricey for amazon shouldn&#x27;t even say anything. It&#x27;s the same price on amazon that it is at the store Big deal</li>
    <li> Anyone who knows me knows I am he biggest too faced fan ever! All of their shadows have he most amazing pigment and blend so nicely, and this chocolate bar palette is my absolute FAVORITE ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does is smell like chocolate, it is actually made with cocoa powder!! It has some of the most amazing colors I have ever seen and they are all so beautiful and blendable. My favorite is the gold color and the cherry cordial. You can use these dry or wet to increase the intensity of the color. I like to spray my brush with a little setting spray before applying the gold and it is just heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of makeup from all different high end brands, but this is the one that I always seem to grab for. The shadows last all day/night and I am so beyond please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture that I have posted is 100% with this palette and my mascara is &amp;#34;better than sex&amp;#34; which is also by Too Faced!!</li>
    <li> Chocolate. Really don&#x27;t need to say much more but I will. LOL This is the best neutral palette I have ever used. It has pretty much replaced all my other palettes. All the eye shadows in this palette are super pigmented and creamy! They last all day and I have gotten so many compliments. After showing my friend this palette she had to go out and get it. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have that fake chocolate smell to it either. It&#x27;s a real Cocoa smell and what a way to start your day than with a huge whiff of legit chocolate, which you smell immediately. The amazing chocolate smell aside, the colors in this palette are so beautiful! I don&#x27;t think they could look bad on anyone.  I use it to do natural looks and more done up intense looks. It&#x27;s so versatile. To top it off I got the new version of this which has the names printed on the palette instead of on the plastic insert everyone loses. If you&#x27;ve been on the fence about this item, stop thinking, just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> My favorite to do soft natural looks smells sooooooooo good even though I don&#x27;t even eat chocolate as much. Great investment it has a lot of matted shades which I love and some sparkle too.</li>
    <li> This was not an authentic too faced product.</li>
    <li> IT IS FAKE. NO CHOCOLATE SMELL!!!! NOT WORTH $45!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> customer service is lacking. palette came to me tossed in an oversized envelope with nothing to keep it protected and without a receipt or invoice. When I opened the palette it had been clearly tampered with as some of the shadow surfaces were smeared. I brushed the top layer off for use. Im still annoyed that keeping it less trouble then sending it back at my expense for a refund. PURCHASE FROM SEPHORA OR ULTA.</li>
    <li> I love Too Faced eye shadow &amp; was very happy with this package. Nice colors wears well &amp; was packaged well when it arrived. Very pretty on</li>
    <li> Love this palette, it has just the rigth colors, i use all of them, it is a really must have, it is easy to work, really pigmented, the smell is a plus, it can go with all skin types. The delivery was perfect, my product was well care, well wraped, very serious seller.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells good, stays on throughout the day, and the colors are perfect.</li>
    <li> This set made me break my rule of paying a lot for makeup. I&#x27;m a cheapskate, but I do love makeup. However, when you add chocolate to the mix, I&#x27;m a gonner... This is made from chocolate, the color density is good, it applies nicely, especially with a primer, I adore the pinks that go so splendidly with the browns, and I could go on and on and on. If you are a fan of natural color palettes, chocolates, and beautiful, clever packaging, I absolutely know you will like this item. Shop around. Make sure what you have is the real thing and not a knock-off. I did not buy this set here.</li>
    <li> I was debating on buying the Chocolate Bar or the Full Exposure (I ended up getting this first, then Full Exposure next)... but the Chocolate Bar is now my go-to palette which i choose over all of the naked palettes as well.  The colors go on so smoothly, and buttery, and the pigmentation is fantastic.  This is my first Too Faced product and it gets me excited to start purchasing more eye products from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SMELLS LIKE CHOCOLATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors: the left side consists of warm browns and bronzes, which i use for my every day looks.  I LOVE how this palette has a lot of mattes to choose from, whereas some palettes have too many shimmers and not enough blendable matte browns.&lt;br /&gt;The right side of the palette is a little more playful, with pinks, reds and purples.  There are two larger pans of color, and I love how one is matte and one is shimmer- both are good for highlighting.  I wa sat first dissapointed that there was no black, but that would ruin the look of the palette, and i use this for daytime anyway.  The darkest color is a dark-choco color that is use to create a smokey eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging: THANK YOU, Too Faced, for putting this in a tin container.  I don&#x27;t like when palettes are in cardboard because it makes me less inclined to travel with it and \\&quot;ruin\\&quot; or rip/scratch the palette. The chocolate case is so cute and durable! Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush because that would be ideal for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:butterly, smooth color&lt;br /&gt;pigmented&lt;br /&gt;easy to travel with/ tin container&lt;br /&gt;you get your moneys worth&lt;br /&gt;smells like chocolate&lt;br /&gt;comes with a makeup guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: no brush&lt;br /&gt;you open the container more than you need to because it smells soooo goood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this palette to all of my makeup junky friends and will continue to rave about it.</li>
    <li> The colors look better in person, like the one that looks army green in the top left, doesn&#x27;t look greenish in person. I don&#x27;t like the matte pink or the purple (too dark) but it&#x27;s decent. It&#x27;s not too expensive when you consider how many eyeshadows you are getting with this (how much do you have to pay for a good brand of individual eyeshadow?) I thought I would like the Naked 3 pallet better since I like rosy brown hues but I don&#x27;t, I use this one more, the pots seem larger too, which I like. Granted there are some colors I still haven&#x27;t touched yet. It&#x27;s a decent compact and you get alot of shades here. With the one I recieved, the names were printed on the tray in gold lettering, not on a removeable clear sheet like it shows in alot of youtube videos, maybe they improved it. Even If you find a better eyeshadow compact, don&#x27;t kick youself for getting this, because you will get use out of it. With a couple of these sort of compacts, you have all the eyeshadow you need for a long time.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the product I loved it and it&#x27;s at an amazing price and they have great service fast tooo!!</li>
    <li> The colors are wonderful and for those who don&#x27;t know it does smell like chocolate. The reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is the packaging, it came in an envelope and it could have broken easily. Thank goodness mine was unharmed.</li>
    <li> Just got them today!!!!! Super fast shipment, plus nice package.&lt;br /&gt;They smell like chocolate, full of sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me wanna say &amp;#34;wowowowowow&amp;#34; I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth like real colour .. Excellent and fast packing</li>
    <li> I love this pallete especially on days I want to wear a smokey eye or even just a basic natural look on my eyes. Its become one of my favorite eyeshadows</li>
    <li> Great colors and long lasting.</li>
    <li> smells just like chocolate love the colors makes me look super fall looking</li>
    <li> The palette has some great colors and a great smell. However, it is not a good quality product for what you pay. Most of it never reaches your eyelids because it dusts off and lands in the sink or all over your face. Follow a similar palette but with another brand name. You are basically paying for chocolate dust.</li>
    <li> I have set aside my lorac pro palette, my nars eyeshadows, my mac and i have just been using this palette for my eye looks for work. First up, it smells delicious! Just like the too faced chocolate bronzer. I am an nc43 in mac and all of these colors show up well on me. The only color with some fallout is the purple shimmery shade but has good color payoff and is really pretty to wear in the crease or smoked out. Its not just a &#x27;different shades of&#x27; brown palette, but has a greenish color, burgandy, a pink, gold , caramel etc making your looks endless but staying neutral, meaning that, you can use a cooler toned brown on the lid and warm it up in the crease with the caramel color. Dont forget you can mix them well together too and the blend nicely on the lid. Even use the highlight colors on the lid because they are that well pigmented for a great cut crease look. Packaging is nice too and is metal magnetic snap shut and i would take it with me traveling anytime.</li>
    <li> Packaging was nice and the product was in perfect shape. It smells like chocolate. To me, the pigmentation wasn&#x27;t all that great but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors with amazing color pay off! Became my favorite palette instantly. Could not be happier with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Smells exactly like the chocolate palettes in store and the color pay off is just as good, so I am assuming its not a fake. Absolutely love it! It arrived in perfect condition  and in bubble wrap for protection.</li>
    <li> These I shadows are amazing!  Great Purchase !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette! You can get so many looks out of it. Some of the colors intimidated me at first, but wow. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this! The shadows are very pigmented &amp; it smells just like chocolate!</li>
    <li> Better colors than naked2</li>
    <li> One of my favorite brands.And they didn&#x27;t disappoint me with this pallet. The first thing you notice is the chocolate smell which I liked. And the colors are amazing for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this pallet and most of Too Faced pallets that their shadow are so pigmented, but in this pallet only one color which was the blue one is the dusty one and it didn&#x27;t apply to the skin as you see it in the pallet.&lt;br /&gt;For me I recommend this pallet for day look.</li>
    <li> These shades are gorge!! Super pigmented, deep, rich, long-lasting color! The metallic ones are my fave!!</li>
    <li> It is gorgeous! All the eyeshadows have great pigmentation and smell like cocoa! It cannot get any better than that!</li>
    <li> I purchased Naked3&#x27;s palette and the same day, I stumbled upon Too Faced Chocolate Bar Eye Palette. It is by far superior to any eye shadow I&#x27;ve owned. The pigmentation is fantastic. You don&#x27;t need a primer! The shadows are silky and blends so easily! You don&#x27;t have to be a pro to have gorgeous eye makeup. This palette will enhance whatever skill level you have! I&#x27;m a loyal Too Faced customer.</li>
    <li> Love the colors but I only get 2-3hours of stay power...it fades fast and I have to reapply. Iv tried it with out eye primer ,and eye primer , eye primer and nyx jumbo milk together still fades fast...I love to chocolate smell...</li>
    <li> Love love just beautiful and smells wonderful. The pigments are top of the line. Lasts and lasts. Definitely would repurchase.</li>
    <li> This goes for 49.00 in Ulta, Sephora, and Too faced! Why would anyone want to pay more when they can get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> My Too Faced Chocolate Bar Eye Shadow palette arrived quickly! I am pleased with the seller because the product was placed in a fragile package. This shows that the seller cares about customers.  In addition, it is apparent the seller took the time to wrap the product up nicely. I love the package design! ;) Overall, it was a &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; to purchase this product. I have saved so much money! Typically, this particular palette sells for over $48.00, plus tax at Sephora, sometimes even $62.00 online (it depends where you purchase it from because it seems that the more rare it is, the more pricey it becomes!). I absolutely love the cocoa smell! I am excited about my new Too Faced Chocolate Bar Eye Shadow palette. Thanks so much for making this product much more affordable. I am very pleased about all points mentioned above. I definitely will continue to shop with this seller! :)</li>
    <li> Love this palette, the only thing I would say is that the some of the colors are darker when applied than I expected from just looking at it.</li>
    <li> Is this real or fake?! I don&#x27;t care it is VERY PIGMENTED!!! I just received this today in the mail. I did a color swatch on ALL the colors ( I&#x27;m African American with a caramel color) they should up vibrant on me. Yes it is a bit pricey but i can say it is worth it. When I opened up the palette I can smell a chocolate smell. It was wrapped up very nicely and tight so if it was to get handled roughly I nothing would break it unless something heavy fell on it. NO DAMAGES!!! It was also a note thanking me for purchasing it and to do a review and statin that if any thing was wrong or something to contact them via email and they left their email. It also comes with a small booklet showing you 3 different makeup looks you can do and it also gives you step by step. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and will probably buy another as a gift. It smells amazing and the colors are beautiful. I don&#x27;t love the white but other than that, I use them all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I chose this palette as my first. It has a variety of pigmented colors, with a good combination of both matte and shimmery shadows. It has a lot of neutral shadows for work-friendly looks, and some extra pinks and purples as well. Not to mention, the entire thing smells like chocolate. I appreciate how true-to-concept they stayed, with the chocolate bar casing, the names of the shadows (such as milk chocolate, haute chocolate, champagne truffle, cherry cordial, etc) and the chocolate smell. It also comes with a little booklet with pictorial diagrams that show you how to make a few looks, but really I think you could combine basically any shadows with any of the others in the palette and have it look good, all the colors seem to go together very well. Overall, a great palette.</li>
    <li> This was not a real too faced chocolate bar palette. Colors do not match up to the original. No chocolate smell just a chemical smell on the shadows. Colors weren&#x27;t pigmented at all.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT COVERS EASY GO,S ON WELL AND STAYS ALL DAY</li>
    <li> Perfect. All colors are amazing!! And it smells so good!! I use it a lot! I can&#x27;t get enough haha!</li>
    <li> I think every woman should own this palette!  Not only does it smell amazing it&#x27;s the perfect mix of matte and shimmer color&#x27;s.  They blend like a dream. Even if your new to makeup you will love this! It is also the same price than Sephora with free shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> BEST MAKEUP EVER ! Such great colors and really good pigmentation it was worth every penny. Smells like real chocolate and lasts all day. 10/10</li>
    <li> This is an awesome pallette. It is so awesome that i would be willing to pay much more than i did for it!!  Colors are beautiful!</li>
    <li> I bought the product at a brick and mortar store the first day it came out. I love Too Faced products and the colors were all my favorites. I am so disappointed that the colors are very flakey. I have to build and build and still the color does not look the same as in the pallet. Plus they flake all over my face and clothing. I do not find the colors very pigmented at all! I don&#x27;t understand the other reviews that say that the product is pigmented. For the price, I would say don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow kit! It says it&#x27;s made of real cocoa and it smells just like chocolate! It&#x27;s my everyday eyeshadow choice for a low key look for work, love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I buy from Sephora but more convenient.</li>
    <li> this shadows are great quality, blend easily and colors are gorgeous.</li>
    <li> love it!!!!!!!! thank-you excellent shipping  regards cathy</li>
    <li> The packing for the palette was so off, 1. it was too large 2.no protection for the palette. I wish I could post a picture of how damaged it looks, and for $49.00 from online you would expect it to be in one peace. I will be going to Sephora to purchase, so much for saving time!...P.s it does smell good.</li>
    <li> awesome pallette Colors are beautiful! Smells like real chocolate</li>
    <li> This pallet is a absolutely stunning !!!! Smells wonderful... And stays on till you take it off. Love it</li>
    <li> I never buy pallets. I get recommendations from friends, i listen to the hype, and then i just end up hating eyeshadow again lol. I took a chance with this one since the colors seemed alright and the reviews from others persuaded me. I AM IN LOOOVEEE!!! The colors are great, it goes on perfectly, everything smelled wonderful, and it&#x27;s just... Plain amazing. And the shipping; can&#x27;t complain. It was DEFINITELY secure and everything was intact. I can&#x27;t even use words to describe my happiness right now!!! I might even buy the semi-sweet one later on. Yup. I love it that much.</li>
    <li> wow beautifully crafted so love this ive made it my fav eyeshadow kit it has replaced all the others i have i just love this now goes on real smooth and the colors are bright and pigmented...smells like chocolate too...will def buy from this company again</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my make-up crazed friend, she loves it and the make-up actually smells like chocolate:)</li>
    <li> perfect gift loved it</li>
    <li> I love this pallete! The color range of this is gorgeous! My only concern is if it&#x27;s fake. I saw it at a store and on the Internet and it doesn&#x27;t have the names of the shadows printed on it. Also, the pigmentation is a bit dissapointing. The smell is absolutely AMAZING! I love how the pallete has 3 matte brown shades, unlike other palletes where there are too many shimmery shades. I will definetly get a lot of looks out of this pallete! I would really recommend this to a beginner in makeup or a makeup artist. Over all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Omg I LOVE this palette. Two face hit a home run with this one. The smell of chocolate is so scrumptious!!! Worth the money</li>
