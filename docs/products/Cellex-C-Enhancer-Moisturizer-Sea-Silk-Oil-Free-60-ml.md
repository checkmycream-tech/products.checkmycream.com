      <li>Cellex C Enhancer moisturizer - Sea Silk Oil Free is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years and have tried others</li>
      <li>and i can say i love it</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin or just looking for a light moisturizer, this is the perfect item!!</li>
      <li>This is truly one for the ages and will always be a top of list product I can go to.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better for my skin than this product...</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It is so easy on the skin and the smell is pretty nice too!</li>
      <li>and I love the light fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love this, the texture is incredibly smooth.</li>
      <li>Have used this on and off for years, was happy to find it on Amazon and use it mostly as a day cream as it keeps my skin from shining mid day in the S. Florida heat.</li>
      <li>and it was free home delivery.</li>
      <li>It is so light</li>
      <li>The creams texture is gentle, yet effective.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The feel is light, non-greasy, and absorbs quick.</li>
      <li>It works, can&#x27;t write enough good words about this cream,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten into sea botanicals for moisturizers, and this product is hands down one of the absolute best I&#x27;ve used--and I&#x27;ve used a LOT.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is clean, smells fresh and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all.</li>
      <li>And the icing on the cake is the smell is so clean, fresh</li>
      <li>It is very light on the skin and my skin is soft.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer in particular is great in the winter time when my skin gets extremely dry and needs a pick me up.</li>
      <li>This smells really good, makes my skin really soft, but is not heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>It makes many break outs, I&#x27;m using it only in the neck so as to get some use of it.</li>
      <li>I bought it first from my skin health specialist.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and as advertised.</li>
      <li>This is very lightweight and feels heavy enough for night time, but also great under makeup.</li>
      <li>The one from Amazon had a very foul smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: My original jar has finally run out.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product for diminishing small lines and sun spots on my face...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s oil-free and not too heavy on the silicones (as many oil-free moisturizers are).</li>
      <li>The new one expires on 2016 and does not list \\&quot;Seasilk\\</li>
      <li>I have used La Mer, Chanel, SKII and various other top of the line products for decades.</li>
      <li>Hypoallergenic and usually sold at dermatologist offices for a lot more money.</li>
      <li>It was exactly the same smell as the one I received from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately this moisturizer had the opposite effect it is supposed to - I originally had a good complexion before beginning to use it, and it caused clogged pores, oiliness and I needed a facial within 10 days of use.</li>
      <li>I have used this moisturizer for years--love it for being non-greasy and light, but moisturizing enough for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>My Dermatologist recommended this moisturizer to me to keep my skin clear and glowing before my wedding</li>
      <li>&quot; as an ingredient as the old formula does.</li>
      <li>I am 40 years old</li>
      <li>, i have combination, oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and their products do not irritate or cause my skin to break out.</li>
      <li>At the end, I accidentally left it near a sunny window and the smell turned foul.</li>
      <li>It doesnt clog my pores and it has a mild smell, it also doubles up as a makeup base for me, i just love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this moisturizer to me to keep my skin clear and glowing before my wedding and I have been using it ever since. It is clean, smells fresh and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all. I even recommended it to my mother and she loves it too! Will never try another product again.</li>
    <li> I have oily yet sensitive skin, and this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s oil-free and not too heavy on the silicones (as many oil-free moisturizers are).</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get used to the smell but once i did i started liking it. The lotion consistency is a bit heavy and takes several minutes to fully absorb into the skin. But once it does the skin doesn&#x27;t look shiny, does not conflict with any makeup, does not clog pores, moisturizes great.</li>
    <li> I have used La Mer, Chanel, SKII and various other top of the line products for decades. This one came as one of the best moisturizing lotions I have ever used. So I ordered another bottle through Amazon. I still had some left over from my previous bottle, which I received as a present. The one from Amazon had a very foul smell. I compared the ingredients and it seems like the company changed its formula recently (my bottle&#x27;s expiration date is 2015). The new one expires on 2016 and does not list \\&quot;Seasilk\\&quot; as an ingredient as the old formula does. On the Cellex-C website, they seem to claim that \\&quot;enteromorpha compressa extract\\&quot; is seasilk, but nowhere on the Internet can you find any information that supports this. I am very disappointed with this new formula and may not purchase this lotion again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My original jar has finally run out. At the end, I accidentally left it near a sunny window and the smell turned foul. It was exactly the same smell as the one I received from Amazon. So instead of the formula change causing the smell, Amazon must have sent me one that has lost its chemical integrity.</li>
    <li> This cream is incredible. I was at a spa in Aspen Co in 2007 and it was recommend to me. I have been using it ever since. I love this cream!!!! My face feels wonderful after I put it on. I am 40 years old and I have oily skin. I love the smell too!!!!</li>
    <li> Your gonna need with that face wash, it will bring your face back</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful feel and smell to it. Not oily at all! It just makes your face feel really good once applied.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Does what it says and is very light.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin or just looking for a light moisturizer, this is the perfect item!! It is so easy on the skin and the smell is pretty nice too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very long.  I know that I will like the results.  However, it is heavy...and not something that works under makeup</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but still need a moisturizer.  This is very lightweight and feels heavy enough for night time, but also great under makeup.</li>
    <li> Been using moisturizers for about 20 years now (43-year-old male). I started with grandma&#x27;s Oil of Olay, did the Avon phase, and then spent years with organic goods. I&#x27;ve gotten into sea botanicals for moisturizers, and this product is hands down one of the absolute best I&#x27;ve used--and I&#x27;ve used a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel is light, non-greasy, and absorbs quick. My skin type can sometimes have a little &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; to it with some products but not with this one. This is truly one for the ages and will always be a top of list product I can go to. And the icing on the cake is the smell is so clean, fresh--it smells like &amp;#34;Spring Break&amp;#34; in a jar!</li>
    <li> Cellex C Enhancer moisturizer - Sea Silk Oil Free is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I also use the cellex C Serum and the moisturizer goes on good after the serum for an awesome result.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years--love it for being non-greasy and light, but moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and I love the light fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a great product my wife uses.  Hypoallergenic and usually sold at dermatologist offices for a lot more money.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me and now I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.     This is really a great, non-greasy moisturizer, and a nice alternative to Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar (which I also use and recommend.)</li>
    <li> I have combination oily sensitive skin with dry patches and this product helps keep my skin less oily, but still moisturized in the winter.  I would not recommend in the summer though as the moisturizing effect will make skin too oily, especially in the T-Zone in warmer weather.</li>
    <li> Again, I have used this product for years and loved it.  It lasts and I have had wonderful results.  When I could no longer find it in my area it was delightful to find it at amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used Cellex-C Enhancer Moisturizer for about 18 years.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it.  I get compliments on my skin all the time from total strangers.....</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer that works for my combination skin. Keeps me from being dry in the winter without making my T-zone oily. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. I have been using this product for many years and have tried others but this is the best! I use other Cellex-C products along with it and have never been disappointed in the results on any of their line. I&#x27;m over 70 and have very few wrinkles so that tells me it has helped eliminate some of them.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin feeling awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I use it along side the cellex c beta plex moisturizer and serum (for my nightime regimen) and this during the day, under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had sunscreen built--in but then again it probably wouldn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 6-9 months.  I love it...I tried Estee Lauder but I think it&#x27;s just too oily for my skin and it caused me to break out.  I do great with this moisturizer and it goes on nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was given to me as a gift several years ago. My skin vacillates from oily to slightly dry, and I always have difficulty finding a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy. This one is perfect. It&#x27;s light, soothing, and smoothed lines and softens my skin beautifully. I use it day and night. I&#x27;ve tried other brands over the years, but keep coming back to this.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cellex c line for 3 years now and i can say i love it, i have combination, oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and their products do not irritate or cause my skin to break out. This moisturizer in particular is great in the winter time when my skin gets extremely dry and needs a pick me up. It is so light it feels great on my skin! It doesnt clog my pores and it has a mild smell, it also doubles up as a makeup base for me, i just love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it! It is very light on the skin and my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> Have used this on and off for years, was happy to find it on Amazon and use it mostly as a day cream as it keeps my skin from shining mid day in the S. Florida heat. The creams texture is gentle, yet effective. It works, can&#x27;t write enough good words about this cream, it&#x27;s consistency is amazing.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well for me. Maybe it&#x27;s with my skin. It makes many break outs, I&#x27;m using it only in the neck so as to get some use of it. I&#x27;ll not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This smells really good, makes my skin really soft, but is not heavy or greasy.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and as advertised. My wife is happy!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for diminishing small lines and sun spots on my face... It doesn&#x27;t work overnight but I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better for my skin than this product... It is truly wonderful..</li>
    <li> Always the best&lt;br /&gt;!  Service excellent!</li>
    <li> I love this, the texture is incredibly smooth. This is my second jar and im going to keep buying this product</li>
    <li> I love this product. I bought it first from my skin health specialist. I found it online at a little cheaper price and it was free home delivery. You can&#x27;t beat that. I use it every AM under my foundation. It is great for women in their 60s.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this moisturizer had the opposite effect it is supposed to - I originally had a good complexion before beginning to use it, and it caused clogged pores, oiliness and I needed a facial within 10 days of use. Very disappointing as it is oil free and came highly recommended from an expert aesthetician.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  My favorite for summer weather!</li>
