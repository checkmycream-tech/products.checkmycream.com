      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love them!  </li>
      <li>Feels great in the hand and is easy to maneuver.</li>
      <li>I get a kind of carpal tunnel from holding the handle.  </li>

      <li>You can do your own blow outs with these.</li>

      <li>Lightweight and so easy to use!</li>
      <li>I have been so impressed with how much this brush tames my frizz and it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth as well.  </li>
      <li>The barrel that holds the brissels is metal - fine, most of them are, but on the top there is no covering to protect you!</li>
      <li>well I was glad I didnt throw away</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>It works ok</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, it will cause damage but it also does its job well.</li>
      <li>but I think the handle needs some sort of grip to help you hold on to it better.</li>
      <li>i just love this brush</li>
      <li>i purchased this one and am satisfied.</li>
      <li>My lovely hair cutter friend asked me to let her straighter my hair after a cut.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser uses this brush on my hair and I could tell it gave my hair more volume and shine.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
      <li>so I have learned to avoid touching it while in use.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to think of a square brush.</li>
      <li>I have had more compliments on my hair, which hasn&#x27;t changed, since using this brush.  </li>
      <li>innovative and great to straighten curly hair - it is easy to use and allows my hair to dry quickly and shiny!!!</li>
      <li>Love the brush and how smooth my hair looks.  </li>
      <li>I love how smooth my hair is after blow drying with this brush.  </li>
      <li>it is easy to use</li>
      <li>but my hair being as fine as it is</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight, versatile and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been straigtening my super curly hair for years and this has to be one of my favorite brushes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>Fantastic styling tool.  </li>
      <li>It also grabs the hair very well and leaves a nice shine to it.</li>
      <li>My wavy hair comes out smooth.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any problems with my hair being snagged and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and by using this brush, I definitely have more body and fewer fly-aways.</li>
      <li>It navigates through my tangles pretty quick too which is not an easy task.</li>
      <li>The bristles would often get melted quickly.</li>
      <li>There is mild frizz</li>
      <li>It does a very good job of styling my hair even though I am an amateur.</li>
      <li>My stylist uses this brush with a very hot dryer and it has caused a lot of breakage and damage to my hair.  </li>
      <li>My stylist says the opposite is true for him--he finds the handle more comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>my old brush cause I surely needed it.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have fuller and frizzy hair, tried this on the recommendation of my stylist, but I did not see it useful at all.</li>
      <li>Metal gets hot from a hot hair dryer!</li>
      <li>I know square brushed are great, but I think I am going to buy the same one my stylist uses.</li>
      <li>First introduced to this style of brush at my hairdresser&#x27;s salon.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes..bought on advice of hair person at Red Door Spa..</li>
      <li>I ordered the first one and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>Definitely reduces static.  </li>
      <li>Soft smooth blow out.</li>
      <li>The first one lasted about 2 years of using it every day.  </li>
      <li>One note that I would like to add, the metal piece on the end gets hot</li>
      <li>This brush heats up HOT and fast!</li>
      <li>It works a li&#x27;l better if used along with the blow dryer, but if you use it to brush your hair regularly it does not do any wonders.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I can honestly say that I have noticed a big difference in time it takes to dry my hair.</li>
      <li>The metal gets very hot, which the hair stylists love because they can blow dry your hair very quickly, and really pull the hair tight and get it to look good, however when the hair is stretched and over heated, it looses it resiliency and bounce and is very very damaging.  </li>
      <li>Love this brush - I first saw it at my hairdresser&#x27;s when she used it to blow dry my hair.</li>
      <li>I then tested it on my arm to see if it really could be that hot</li>
      <li>You will never go back to the cheap brands.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this brush!</li>
      <li>so I can really tell a difference using this brush.  </li>
      <li>The brushes work with the hairdryer to smooth hair even further.  </li>
      <li>I have cruly hair and my hair is 98 percent of the time straight wavy as I dont like my hair getting tangled when cruled.</li>
      <li>Great brush to add volume and shine to thin damaged air.  </li>
      <li>Tried it this morning and my hair is straight and shiny without frustration.</li>
      <li>Secondly, my hair is MORE STATICKY and NOT AS VOLUMOUS than the many round brushes I have tried.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
      <li>So of course, I want it straight.</li>
      <li>My hair comes out very silky and shiny.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The grip on the brush leaves a bit to be desired.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this brush.. I have cruly hair and my hair is 98 percent of the time straight wavy as I dont like my hair getting tangled when cruled. This brush is supposed to help you get body easily and help hair get dry faster well I was glad I didnt throw away my old brush cause I surely needed it.</li>
    <li> This is the only styling brush you need when blow drying your hair. It&#x27;s light weight, versatile and easy to use. It does a very good job of styling my hair even though I am an amateur. Have also bought the medium size brush too. This brush makes you and your hair look good.</li>
    <li> innovative and great to straighten curly hair - it is easy to use and allows my hair to dry quickly and shiny!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for almost two years now and it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with my hair being snagged and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  My hair comes out very silky and shiny.  My hair is naturally course so I can really tell a difference using this brush.  Thankfully I&#x27;ve never had any problem with burning myself and I&#x27;ve got short to medium length hair.  I&#x27;ve tried other brushes to keep at the gym and none of them compare to this brush so I had to order a second brush just to keep at the gym.</li>
    <li> great brush, great price, great service</li>
    <li> This is the second brush I have purchased.  The first one lasted about 2 years of using it every day.  I love how smooth my hair is after blow drying with this brush.  I never have a problem with my hair catching and tangling on the brush while I am using it either.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this so I ordered it online instead of paying $40 at the salon. It works ok but I think the handle needs some sort of grip to help you hold on to it better. I just went back to using my old round brush.</li>
    <li> This is not large at all, I&#x27;d call it more of a medium sized brush.</li>
    <li> I discovered this brush at my salon. The square shape helps straighten hair and keep it smooth and flat. Feels great in the hand and is easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses these brushes and recommended I purchase a couple.  Love them!  I can finally blow dry my hair and it looks decent.</li>
    <li> I have been using round brushes to style my hair for about fifteen years. This square-round brush is great. Very lightweight, which is important because you have to hold your arm up with the brush in one hand, blow dryer in the other. It gets tiring! I felt less arm fatigue with this item. It also grabs the hair very well and leaves a nice shine to it. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewers worried about the metal sides that get too hot - I don&#x27;t find this brush to be very different from other brushes in this regard. Just as you might burn your skin with a curling iron or flat iron, you must practice the same caution when using any other form of heated styling tool. I consider this  brush to be a \\&quot;heated\\&quot; styling tool because I&#x27;m using the blow dryer along with it.</li>
    <li> Great brush! I have very thick, long, wavy hair and this brush straightened my hair out with ease. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a brush that I can use with my thick, wavy hair. I usually give up with trying to round brush my hair but this brush is the solution. Tried it this morning and my hair is straight and shiny without frustration. Worth the money. In fact, I am buying another one as a back up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, it will cause damage but it also does its job well.</li>
    <li> Definitely reduces static.  I have very thin hair that can stick up on top and this helped a lot.  Sure i still have some bot much less and hairspray controls it now.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my hairdresser.  I like the grip on the handle.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say the square design out-performs a round design.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this brush on my hair and I could tell it gave my hair more volume and shine.  It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The square shape give just the necessary bounce needed when styling versus a round brush.  I highly recommend.  Soft smooth blow out.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to think of a square brush. I have very thick, curly and very long hair. This brush heats up HOT and fast! It navigates through my tangles pretty quick too which is not an easy task. It&#x27;s easy to use and I can honestly say that I have noticed a big difference in time it takes to dry my hair. Great brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been straigtening my super curly hair for years and this has to be one of my favorite brushes. I often go through brushes quickly due to the heat of my blow dryer. The bristles would often get melted quickly. This one has not melted. It does not pull at my hair or get caught in the brush. There is mild frizz but I go over my hair with a flat iron after straightening anyway. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse hair with lots of body and volume and a tendency to curl! So of course, I want it straight. My hairstylist used this brush while drying my hair and it decreases the work, time it takes to style my hair, and frizz factor. I love this brush. A little pricey for a brush, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I learned about this brush when my hair stylist used it on me during a blowout.  Solid and high quality brush.  I also ordered the Medium R350.</li>
    <li> This brush works well for blow drying my hair just the same as my stylist does in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;She wanted me to buy it for $38 at the salon but I like the price I paid on Amazon for the identical item much much better!</li>
    <li> Great product if you are looking for a brush to straighten the hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1.75&amp;#34; based on the reviews.  I have shoulder length hair.  Wish I would have gotten the 2&amp;#34;.  I have very fine hair and the reviews state that the square brush helps with volume, but this doesn&#x27;t work as well as the round brushes that I have.</li>
    <li> Love it! First introduced to this style of brush at my hairdresser&#x27;s salon. I have very fine hair - cut in pageboy style and this curls my hair perfectly no curling iron needed!</li>
    <li> This is a large brush so if you have shorter hair, get the smaller one. It works as it should, use a little product, take your time, and your hair will be full of volume. I opted to get this instead of a body wave. I saved so much money and trouble, this is the answer!</li>
    <li> Round brush that helps straighten.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes..bought on advice of hair person at Red Door Spa..thats what they use there..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent qualit and really&amp;#34;holds &amp;#34; the hair well..My only complaint is that my last brush wore down after&lt;br /&gt;about 4 years..is this normal? Happy to have found these replacements..</li>
    <li> This brush dries my hair faster and makes styling easier. It doesn&#x27;t snag or get caught in my hair the way round brushes do. I think it makes my hair shinier, as well.</li>
    <li> Loved this hair brush! Half the price that the hair dresser was it selling for.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser swears by this square brush.  It seems to do a good job styling hair, though it is hard to pull through thick hair.  I get a kind of carpal tunnel from holding the handle.  This has never happened to me with other brushes while I style my hair, but it happens all the time with this one. My stylist says the opposite is true for him--he finds the handle more comfortable to hold.  So it is just a matter of personal preference, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying it--I think it does the job.  I just have to wrap a wash cloth around the handle, or something, to keep my hand from cramping.</li>
    <li> Great brush to add volume and shine to thin damaged air.  I think this would serve as a wonderful gift for someone too</li>
    <li> Love the brush and how smooth my hair looks.  My only disappointment is that the coating on the handle is already starting to wear off.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I have moderately curly hair (the curls spiral) that I only occasionally attempt to straighten.  It&#x27;s just easier to let the curl have it&#x27;s way, especially when it&#x27;s humid.  My lovely hair cutter friend asked me to let her straighter my hair after a cut.  She used this brush.  I promptly bought it and have found that, on the somewhat rare occasion that I want to attempt to straighten my hair, the brush works beautifully.  I do use it with a hair straightening/relaxing product.  The brush is substantial and well made.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have long coarse hair - it works wonders. You have the duality of the round brush that also works like a paddle. My wavy hair comes out smooth. The best brush I&#x27;ve EVER owned!</li>
    <li> The worst thing about this brush is that it can BURN YOU! The barrel that holds the brissels is metal - fine, most of them are, but on the top there is no covering to protect you! Metal gets hot from a hot hair dryer! I hit my neck on the way to brush my hair after blow drying for only 4 mintues and now have a red ring on my neck from getting burned (it has now been there 20 minutes and is still painful)!!! I then tested it on my arm to see if it really could be that hot and it burned my arm too! I am livid! I use my brushes to straighten my 4 year olds hair often and am so glad I found this out on myself before her!   Secondly, my hair is MORE STATICKY and NOT AS VOLUMOUS than the many round brushes I have tried. I was excited to try this brush with all the great reviews but am so disappointed. I know square brushed are great, but I think I am going to buy the same one my stylist uses.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Lightweight and so easy to use! Highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I have fuller and frizzy hair, tried this on the recommendation of my stylist, but I did not see it useful at all. It works a li&#x27;l better if used along with the blow dryer, but if you use it to brush your hair regularly it does not do any wonders. I&#x27;d rather use my normal round brush than spending money on this one!</li>
    <li> This product may sound a little unconventional, but it really works.  I have very fine hair and by using this brush, I definitely have more body and fewer fly-aways.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer and brushes ever.  The brushes work with the hairdryer to smooth hair even further.  You can do your own blow outs with these.</li>
    <li> My hair comes out so shinny when I use this brush or any of this type from Itools. I don&#x27;t know why but my hair being as fine as it is has such shine when I am done I bought 3 other brushes like this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for one i had lost; it is the best styling brush on the market and i paid half of what was charged in the salon</li>
    <li> This is my second brush. Love this brush - I first saw it at my hairdresser&#x27;s when she used it to blow dry my hair. I ordered the first one and have been using it for years. I finally decided to buy an extra one for travel so I don&#x27;t have to pack and unpack this brush every time I travel.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this brush. bought for $13. my salon sells it for $40!&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping. product as described.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  I have a shoulder length bob.  These brushes give me lots of body and dry my hair quicker.  I found it easier to use one handed than round brushes.  I have it in the two largest sizes.  One note that I would like to add, the metal piece on the end gets hot so I have learned to avoid touching it while in use.  That&#x27;s the only so called \\&quot;flaw\\&quot; in the brush.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this brush with a very hot dryer and it has caused a lot of breakage and damage to my hair.  My hair is also not as pliable as it once was. The metal gets very hot, which the hair stylists love because they can blow dry your hair very quickly, and really pull the hair tight and get it to look good, however when the hair is stretched and over heated, it looses it resiliency and bounce and is very very damaging.  I wish these brushes were banned and not used.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, easy to use</li>
    <li> have had this brush for years - probably 7 or 8 years and the handle just broke off so I purchased this as a replacement.  i just love this brush it is easy to use and i would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this brush. It works great. You dont get frizzies or flyaways. I recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;Try it with the Bio Ionic hair dryer. You will never go back to the cheap brands.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome.  It gives my hair a \\&quot;lift\\&quot; because of the square design.  I can eliminate the step of using velcro curlers to give my hair height.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had used this type of brush, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the exact same one, but I couldn&#x27;t find it any stores - so I ordered it here!  It is so great, I think it definitely is making a difference when I blow dry my hair out straight.  It gives an option of curling and straightening in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Fantastic styling tool.  I will never go back to my round brush!</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I have thin wispy sometimes curly hair and this brush works perfectly to smooth it without pulling.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this brand of brush to me, and I found a great deal on the 1.75 inch size on Amazon, so I decided to give it a go. I have been so impressed with how much this brush tames my frizz and it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth as well.  I use it to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my hair under while drying, and I use a hair shine/anti-frizz serum as well. I really can&#x27;t believe the difference. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have had more compliments on my hair, which hasn&#x27;t changed, since using this brush.  Based off descriptions of brush i purchased this one and am satisfied.</li>
