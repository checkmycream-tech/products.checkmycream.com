      <li>I bought this product to try to make the most out of my wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;d be better off using nothing than this gel cream.</li>
      <li>Love this product for my curly hair.</li>
      <li>this product does help, I love the feel,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>It does look and feel like glue though, so you will want to make sure you wash your hands after using it.</li>

      <li>This product is always consistent and delivers on perfect style and soft curls.</li>
      <li>works great for soft curls</li>
      <li>love all their products, buy them all from the hair color on down this is one of the best products on the market today.</li>
      <li>I have struggled to get my curly hair to actually curl on top and look nice for years!</li>
      <li>Best I have found for making my hair less frizzy but not sticky.</li>
      <li>AMAZING did I &#x27;say&amp;#34; AMAZING this is the ONLY thing in all my life with curly hair that works.</li>
      <li>Anyway, huge fan obvs, hope it works for you too.</li>
      <li>I have that kind of hair that does what it wants no matter what the weather.</li>
      <li>Does it keep my hair frizzy free....</li>
      <li>it was cheap, since it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
      <li>this product has a creamy consistancy and a light stiffening that you can leave in or pic out -</li>
      <li>but I didnt enjoy the pastie smell</li>
      <li>I have liked some Garnier Fructis products, and I really like their scents, so thought I would try this.  </li>
      <li>When I went to shampoo it out of my hair, I had to shampoo twice before my hair felt clean</li>
      <li>However, to get this effect, I have to use WAY more than a quarter-size amount on my chin-length hair -- probably 3 times as much.  </li>
      <li>More of a cream really.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t feel the need to look for anything else :)</li>
      <li>Worked ok on my hair type (very curly)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my hair very curly, the curls stay all day and the next day as well, without being sticky, hard or crunchy, just perfect soft curls that stay in perfect</li>
      <li>This stuff is very greasy and works great for second day hair touch ups.</li>
      <li>This product is also great for people who have thick, wavy hair but want to scrunch it for more curls.</li>
      <li>Very affordable, lasts a long time, smells great.</li>
      <li>Keeps hair in place, looks natural, leaves hair soft and manageable, nice to the touch, washes out easy.  </li>
      <li>I use it with Garnier Fructis Style Curl Calm</li>
      <li>Definitely lasts all day and then washes out nicely.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t too heavy and it gives my curls a very nice definition without taking away the bounce.</li>
      <li>A great consistency that&#x27;s neither too weak or strong, not greasy and not sticky.</li>
      <li>seems to be right.</li>
      <li>Experiment to find the right amount for your hair,</li>
      <li>This cream/gel has just the right amount of frizz control without being greasy, and hold without being crispy.  </li>
      <li>I was aware of the Garnier fragrance when buying this and knew I didn&#x27;t like it, but I didn&#x27;t expect to be walking around in a cloud of it all day long because most hair products aren&#x27;t as strongly fragranced as this one.</li>
      <li>My hair easily takes a curl but can just as easily get flat from shampooing, wind, hat-wearing, etcetera.</li>
      <li>all garnier products, the scent is pleasant, it isnt overly chemically(although I personally avoid using it more than once a week), and doesnt cause hair to be stiff, crispy, or</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on her hair</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love using this gel, especially during the summer while I am using beach waves.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>but it helps if I blow it out or use a hot iron on my hair.</li>
      <li>Take that for what its worth, since I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare to.</li>
      <li>I love Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Gel because it makes my hair&#x27;s curl look more like a gentle curl without looking like a frizzy mess!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Keeps hair in place, looks natural, leaves hair soft and manageable, nice to the touch, washes out easy.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This works great on my wavy hair.  It prevents it from getting frizzy and defines curls beautifully. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> More of a cream really. Use as a finisher after the Curl Scrunch Gel, smoothing over the hair after it is about half dry, to tame frizzies.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and my main problem is frizz and fly aways. This product isn&#x27;t too heavy and it gives my curls a very nice definition without taking away the bounce. Love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  My hair without any product is wavy, but unevenly so -- the back looks more curly, and the sides tend to straighten out as the days goes on.  With this cream gel, whether I let it air dry or scrunch-dry with a blow-dryer/diffuser, my hair has cute bouncy curls that last all day.  My hair is not crunchy like with a regular gel.  If I let it air-dry, there is just a bit of crunch/wet look, but if I run my fingers through it a bit, the crunch is gone, yet the curls stay!  However, to get this effect, I have to use WAY more than a quarter-size amount on my chin-length hair -- probably 3 times as much.  If I use less, I end up with frizz and curls that don&#x27;t last.  This stuff is pretty cheap, so it&#x27;s no big deal to use a lot of it, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed....it was not the gel...it was the cream...which I do not use.</li>
    <li> Garnier Fructis Style Curl Sculpting Gel works great on my baby, fine hair. I live in Florida where the humidity is constant. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is searching for a great product for your hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it with Garnier Fructis Style Curl Calm Down Anti-Frizz Cream for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it by itself or i put some in a spray bottle with sea salt and leave in conditioner for the salty beachy look! Cant beat this stuff and it makes my natural curl REALLY come out! Love All the smells of Garnier! Great! WILL buy again!!!</li>
    <li> very gentle hold, kind of like a leave-in conditioner that keeps things tame!</li>
    <li> This stuff is very greasy and works great for second day hair touch ups. Does not control the frizz at all. If you like greasy hair, this is your gel.</li>
    <li> This gel is more of a cream consistancy, but it still works great! I have a hard time finding products for my curls. They always seem to end up frizzy or wild. This product does a pretty good job of taming my hair. I wish it came in a larger bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on the market to make my hair stay in curls without being frizzy or having the curls fall out after a while. This gel is fantastic, smells good, in your hands it&#x27;s a little sticky, but I just wash my hands after applying to my long dark thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair very curly, the curls stay all day and the next day as well, without being sticky, hard or crunchy, just perfect soft curls that stay in perfect curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this product would have come out a long time ago, because It would have saved me a lot of money on hair product. I will not use anything else, can&#x27;t live without. I also use this with the leave in shine serum by Garnier as well, and I have no frizzyness at all, just shiny perfect curly hair. I get tons of compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Not what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t hold natural curl pattern. My hair is very soft and curly.</li>
    <li> A++ Product as described</li>
    <li> excellent product! will order again!</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy and coarse-ish 2b/2c hair and just started to wear it shorter and wavy/curly every day.  This product does what it says:  combines the conditioning/softness of a cream and the staying power of a gel.  Curls are soft and non-frizzy but not too tight...my routine starts with shine/no-frizz serum right out of the shower on very wet hair first, so that might help.  I don&#x27;t mind the texture or smell but it takes a bit of experimenting to get the amount correct.  I have hair just above my shoulders and a dime-size dollop seems to be right.</li>
    <li> I picked up a tube on sale with a coupon. It sounded like the perfect product with both conditioning and gel which wavy and curly hair needs. Despite having had my hair for several decades, I feel like only in recent years with the help of such books as Curly Girl, am I starting to get a handle on how to take care if it. My hair is something on the 2a/2b spectrum; I&#x27;ve got spiral curls, wavy hair and some areas that are generally straight. The crown has gray (which lucky for me masquerades as blonde) and is very dry, even though I use no heat appliances and wear hats to protect it. My hair easily takes a curl but can just as easily get flat from shampooing, wind, hat-wearing, etcetera. There is a constant struggle between having enough gel/conditioner to encourage curl &amp; keep it healthy-looking and having it get flat and greasy-looking from too much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in it (which tends to accumulate). I tell you all this to give you a basis of comparison for your own hair. So I tried this product and hated it. It somehow made my hair greasy-looking, crunchy AND flyaway! How it managed all that... To be fair in my cruel assessment, I used it a couple times and got the same result. Ick. I&#x27;d be better off using nothing than this gel cream. I gave it 2 stars and not just one because, as some reviews suggest, it might be fine for a different hair type.</li>
    <li> This product is also great for people who have thick, wavy hair but want to scrunch it for more curls. I love using this gel, especially during the summer while I am using beach waves. It does look and feel like glue though, so you will want to make sure you wash your hands after using it. Also if you put too much it your curls can become a little crunchy, so you may want to start off with a little bit and slowly add more. I typically used this on wet or damp hair. Definitely lasts all day and then washes out nicely. I feel like it takes a while for me to go through a bottle and I have pretty thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great product with the right amount of hold. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling crunchy unless you use way too much of the product. And it has a nice smell!</li>
    <li> I have naturally blonde, naturally wavy hair which does tend to frizz.  I have used other Garnier Fructis products and liked them, so I decided to give this stuff a try.  Big mistake.  It managed to kill all the natural &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; (which I like) in my hair and made it stringy and flat.  It also darkened my hair by about ten shades.  (I was verging on mousy brown.)  I tried to run a brush through my hair to try to fluff it up and get rid of the strings, I could hardly get my brush through it.  When I went to shampoo it out of my hair, I had to shampoo twice before my hair felt clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy this stuff again.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product was great! The only thing I had a problem with was that it was not packaged right and was coming out of the package.</li>
    <li> I have thin frizzy dyed curly hair - so you can imagine I need some pretty unique hair stuff. Living in FL with 100% humidity all the time - I have tried pretty much every product on the market - I MEAN EVERY curly haired girl product from the super low budget in my youth to the way high budget now. This is by far the best stuff. I can use just this and no additional product such as mousse or hair creams. Anyway, huge fan obvs, hope it works for you too.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few curly hair products that does not dry my hair out and make it even more frizzy!  It is a must for me at all times.</li>
    <li> I am half white half Mexican and even though I look white have ethnic hair. I used this on recommendation from a friend and my hair has been so greasy and lifeless since I started using this. It compiles in your hair so when you wash it with water you can see white residue coming out of your hair into the drain. Awful, wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Smells good but does not work as I would expect on my African American 4c type hair. My daughter has thick curly hair and it would take a majority of the entire tube to curl her hair.</li>
    <li> After years of searching for a product to keep my curly hair from going frizzy, I found this. A great consistency that&#x27;s neither too weak or strong, not greasy and not sticky.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but still wanted to date my experiences. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a moose or a gel but came across this and decided to buy it for my daughter who has curly hair. The first time I put it on her hair it was right after I washed her hair and dried it. It was damp and I ended up putting a lot of it. The next day her hair was already tangled. I tried again another week or so but didn&#x27;t put as much and it happened again. No matter what amount you put on it gives it a crunchy look and it gets your hair stuck together to the point to where it becomes a ball of hair if you crunch it up like it tells you. I stopped putting it in her hair and tried mine. I have wavy hair and I tried using it to make my wavy hair curly. It failed. It did the same thing, my hair is long and hers is short. So no matter the length or amount it did the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the tangling thing because with a child it makes it difficult to undo. Your hair also ends up feeling sticky and any time you touch it your hands would get that product on and end up being slippery. When I showered my hair again I felt slippery product all near the back of my ears and anything my hair with the product touched. I now have half the bottle which I passed down to my mother who has short curly hair and could manage it better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to long hair (I&#x27;m a guy) and to hair products for curly hair. I&#x27;ve had short hair my whole life and didn&#x27;t even know my hair had any curl until I decided to grow it out the last couple years. My hair is naturally blonde, fine but thick, and my &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; is more of a &amp;#34;wave,&amp;#34; with much more curl toward the ends than near the roots. I bought this product to try to make the most out of my wavy hair. It works decently. I usually use no products whatsoever, and this stuff works as well as any other product I&#x27;ve put in my hair for the same reason. Nothing miraculous or especially great though. Take that for what its worth, since I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare to. It does feel greasy as well and I feel like I had to use more than I would have liked to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the real reason I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars... This product smells terrible! Another reviewer said it smells kind of like alcohol. I would have to agree, but a simple alcohol smell wouldn&#x27;t be all that bad. No, this product smells like fermenting bread yeast in the process of creating alcohol. It&#x27;s awful. The slight tinge of anything that may pass as &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; does nothing to improve this smell. Generally I don&#x27;t mind the smell of GF&#x27;s products. I don &#x27;t love them, but I tolerate them just fine. This product, however, is intolerable. I do not plan on using it again. Good thing it was cheap, since it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Works on my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair and calms it down without that stiff, crunchy tangled feel.</li>
    <li> I have struggled to get my curly hair to actually curl on top and look nice for years! I put this in my still wet hair and let it air dry and I get excellent wavy curls. Granted I just had babies and still take pre-natals while breastfeeding, so we&#x27;ll see how it goes once I stop. :-)&lt;br /&gt;My hair is still a little frizzy but this definitely helps shape the curls!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my curly hair. The price is about $1cheaper than in the store!</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and it did a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too big on complaints  but I ordered something new not used. It was not sealed and had hair on the lid. I threw mine away.. be careful when buying beauty products online. Its a chance we take</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got thin, fine, wavy/curly hair and this product is just way too heavy for me. For years I have mixed gel with a leave in conditioner and thought this would be a similar concept but it seems to never really dry and leaves my hair looking crunchy and over-gelled, no matter how little I use. It also smells disgusting. I know a lot of people love the smell of these products and I actually got compliments on the smell the few times I tried to use this, but to me it smells like plastic and rotting fruit. It makes me nauseous. I was aware of the Garnier fragrance when buying this and knew I didn&#x27;t like it, but I didn&#x27;t expect to be walking around in a cloud of it all day long because most hair products aren&#x27;t as strongly fragranced as this one. If you are at all sensitive to scents I would avoid this like the plague.</li>
    <li> It helps with the frizz but makes my hair feel weird.  I have only used it twice since I bought it &amp; I am not sure I want to use it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It holds my curls without being heavy or slicky.  And when you rinse it out, it leaves your hair soft and conditioned.  Fight the frizz!</li>
    <li> love all their products, buy them all from the hair color on down this is one of the best products on the market today.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this as a cream gel for scrunching, but instead it made my curls flat, hard, and sticky. I managed to salvage it by using it as a regular gel and braiding my hair with it, but I will not purchase it again. It didn&#x27;t smell bad, but it had a very strange texture.</li>
    <li> I almost never leave my hair out or leave it natural. I have to worry about some much frizz. This tames my hair!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY GARNIER SUPPORTS THE GENOCIDE OF GAZA. SUPPLYING SOAPS TO IDF TO WASH THE BLOOD OFF THEIR HANDS</li>
    <li> this product has a creamy consistancy and a light stiffening that you can leave in or pic out - it&#x27;s great for scrunching hair.</li>
    <li> Light weight, yet still a good hold for my curl. I have thin, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I used a bit of this product on my hair last Saturday.  I wash my hair every day but by Thursday I was beside myself!  This stuff does not come out but I was determined.  A wash of white vinegar did nothing, then I tried cider vinegar, still looked and felt greasy.  Finally made a paste of baking soda and water and applied to the scalp while making numerous parts.  Washed after each experiment.  Finally, 6 washes later my hair is clean again.  Wish I&#x27;d never even opened the tube.  I would have liked to write Garnier but there&#x27;s no email addy and I hung up after being on a long hold to their customer service department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this look just stick some car wax on your head and you will be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product: Garnier Fructis curl sculpting cream gel</li>
    <li> Best I have found for making my hair less frizzy but not sticky.</li>
    <li> AMAZING did I &#x27;say&amp;#34; AMAZING this is the ONLY thing in all my life with curly hair that works. It feels good smells good washes off great and the most important part makes my curly hair look beautiful and manageable.</li>
    <li> For those of you, dissatisfied with the smell, or otherwise, of this product...I began using L&#x27;Oreal Bed Head Texturizing Conditioner about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 66,with long, natural curly, red hair(now from a bottle).&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of fighting my curls, I finally decided to embrace them.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea how beautiful my curls really were, before using L&#x27;Oreal Bed Head.  I work a small amount thru my wet hair, &#x27;rough up&#x27; my hair,  with my fingers, and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;In between shampoos, I mist my hair with water, rough it up again (occasionally adding a small amount of the texturizer), and am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;I can continue to have long, controllable natural curls, with a layer trim about every 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I am constantly receiving compliments about my curls(and color, which my hairdresser a/k/a husband does).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fight your curls! Just be sure to get a product that works &#x27;with&#x27; them, yet doesn&#x27;t smell bad or &#x27;feel like glue&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Garnier before the line was available in the US/was sold only on the black market (haha jk). I used their soft curl cream (now discontinued) before I tried this product. My hair is layered, long, wavy, thick, \\&quot;hard\\&quot; as my son says (lol), and color treated. This cream gel amazingly holds curls for TWO DAYS, not in a wet way, and allows them to remain bouncy! It doesn&#x27;t feel great in your palm/is sticky, and smells a lot like glue during application, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger. I scrunch it only on the bottom half of my hair after washing, usually air-dry, then use a curling iron. Whatever excess I have on my fingertips, I use to tame unruly baby hairs.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 7 year old daughter who has very curly very long hair almost down to her waist. We hate using mousse because her hair would feel too &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and gel was a sticky gooey mess that would almost always flake off. This is perfect. It says sculpting gel, but the texture is nothing like gel. I would say its a cross between a cream and a serum. Its very lightweight. I put it on her while her hair is still wet and comb it through with a wide tooth comb. When it dries, she has these gorgeous, perfectly formed silk spirals. Ive been using this on her for about 3 months now and I really don&#x27;t feel the need to look for anything else :)</li>
    <li> I have that kind of hair that does what it wants no matter what the weather. this product does help, I love the feel,&lt;br /&gt;and alittle goes along way.  Does it keep my hair frizzy free.... no, but it helps if I blow it out or use a hot iron on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My hair is very thick and has a natural wave and curl to it. The shorter it gets, the curlier it becomes. The hard part is the curls are not very &#x27;organized&#x27; and they frizz during humid weather. When it is windy, I look like a big fuzzy dandelion going to seed! I love Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Gel because it makes my hair&#x27;s curl look more like a gentle curl without looking like a frizzy mess! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good for curly hair if you want that hold!! and not crunchy either. herbal essences&#x27; curly scrunch gel gets hard and crunchy and weighs my hair down. but this is awesome! i really love it! lays my baby hairs down too. yes i said baby hairs (still got em) lol</li>
    <li> This product is always consistent and delivers on perfect style and soft curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on my very long, thick, wavy hair. It&#x27;s quick, inexpensive, and works, though you have to make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or it will look stiff and obviously gelled (I let my hair air-dry). I will sometimes use more expensive curl sculpting products but this is my favorite among the supermarket brands.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to keep my curls in some type of order.</li>
    <li> I have medium to thinnish wavy-curly hair and this cream gel contolled my frizz and defined my waves nicely. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell either.</li>
    <li> I have natural curl that easily gets dry and frizzy.  This gel makes the curls soft and shiny, has a little hold but not sticky or greasy.  Very affordable, lasts a long time, smells great.</li>
    <li> I have 4z hair (a twa) and this works wonders for softening and styling!</li>
    <li> I have medium length blonde fine thinning hair that has a natural wave, can get curly with the right products, and tends toward frizzy.  I have liked some Garnier Fructis products, and I really like their scents, so thought I would try this.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and my conclusion is that it&#x27;s just not made for fine hair.  It&#x27;s very greasy.  Even when using a \\&quot;quarter-sized amount\\&quot; or less, as the instructions say.  Judging by the other reviews, looks like it works best with very thick, naturally curly, frizzy hair.  Mine does not need control, it needs bounce and volume.  This does the complete opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also gave it to my husband to use on his fairly coarse, medium length, straight-ish hair.  He likes using certain creams and hair lotions that smooth and provide some control, but don&#x27;t make it feel weighed down or sticky or crunchy.  He said it made his hair feel greasy too.</li>
    <li> This gel is really needed thing for my curls, it gave good hydration and hold great shape of curls, will defenitely buy again.</li>
    <li> works great for soft curls</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME.  No joke.  I have natural (i.e. wild) curls. This cream/gel has just the right amount of frizz control without being greasy, and hold without being crispy.  Experiment to find the right amount for your hair, but I&#x27;m telling you use this stuff and you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> I dont have to fight my curls now. No frizz!!</li>
    <li> I like it!!!.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is not stiff when I used this gel, curls are quite natural</li>
    <li> Worked ok on my hair type (very curly) but I didnt enjoy the pastie smell</li>
    <li> Great product for making curly hair have those beautiful, tight, bouncy, ringlet curls. This will also add some curl to wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all garnier products, the scent is pleasant, it isnt overly chemically(although I personally avoid using it more than once a week), and doesnt cause hair to be stiff, crispy, or sticky(this is big ;-))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my 14yr old wants her hair curly, this is her fav product. She uses John Frieda serum for looser curls and John Frieda striaght and heat protect when she wants her hair straight. This is a great addition to her arsenal of products ;-)</li>
