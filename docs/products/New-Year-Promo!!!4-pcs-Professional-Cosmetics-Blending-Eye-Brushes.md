      <li>Overall, I love it!</li>
      <li>Totally worth it</li>
      <li>What I really love about them is the length and the thickness of the brush, they&#x27;re really dense and incredibly soft and really comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
      <li>Super soft, easy to use</li>
      <li>The right size for almost any eyeshadow application.</li>
      <li>These brushes came super fast.  </li>
      <li>When i purchased them i expected to get them in two to three weeks, but a week later they surprising got here !</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;ve got 2 of the brushes set aside for use when the first two wear out.</li>
      <li>iut smells funny...</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist but for the every day woman with every day use these brushes are super soft and do a lovely job applying your shadows.  </li>
      <li>Super soft brushes.</li>
      <li>I used black eyeshadow to test out how it blends and it blends perfectly and softens really harsh makeup.</li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this.</li>
      <li>but they pick up the product very well.</li>
      <li>i was shock because how fast they got here.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t really know what i was hoping to get.</li>
      <li>of a stippling foundation brush, i don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s used for</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much bc of the price</li>
      <li>Also they are very Blendable.</li>
      <li>they are very sturdy none have came apart</li>
      <li>They do smell kinda funny, but they are very soft.</li>
      <li>I have not use it looks high end brush better than what I expected</li>
      <li>These brushes are decent.</li>
      <li>but i have high hopes.</li>
      <li>i highly suggest this company and their products.</li>
      <li>It comes with two blending, 1 tapered like brush and a flat top brush that is essentially a smaller vers.</li>
      <li>The only downfall is shipping does take 3 weeks but certainly worth the wait.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the smell has pretty much worn off with regular use.</li>
      <li>no shedding nice and thick</li>
      <li>The brushes are big but not too big for your eye and the are very soft and fluffy for a great price.</li>
      <li>and I have uses for every single eye brush I will definitely be ordering more brushes from these guys</li>
      <li>They are very soft it doesn&#x27;t soak up all the product</li>
      <li>but I was very surprised..</li>
      <li>its dense and soft.</li>
      <li>pleasantly surprised</li>
      <li>and so soft.</li>
      <li>They are so soft and dense at the same time</li>
      <li>They are really soft and way cheaper than what you would pay for the same quality brush in an ULTA or Sephora&#x27;s store.</li>
      <li>My only problem is that the handles are super long and the brush hairs are pretty thick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love these brushes so much , I have achieved my purpose of buying these brushes. GIRLS why waste your&lt;br /&gt;money in buying expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist but for the every day woman with every day use these brushes are super soft and do a lovely job applying your shadows.  They wash nicely and do not shed.  Fantastic price for a great product.  The only downfall is shipping does take 3 weeks but certainly worth the wait.</li>
    <li> are these dipped in industrial strength paint?!?! they are like super nice quality too but i can&#x27;t apply any kind of makeup to my face without the smell corroding my nose hairs... more like 3.5 stars because the quality is great and hey maybe the smell will wear off eventually. HOPEFULLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. does anyone have any tricks to removing the smell??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (3 weeks later)&lt;br /&gt;the smell has pretty much worn off with regular use. didn&#x27;t even need to wash them... changing it from 3 to 4 stars :).</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are so soft and beautiful. My only problem is that the handles are super long and the brush hairs are pretty thick. Overall, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes I cant wait to buy more. the bristles are so soft and the handles are nice as well. i highly suggest this company and their products.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE these brushes. And I didn&#x27;t have to wait to long for them. And for the price! Totally worth it</li>
    <li> I love how full these brushes are.  The handle is a little to thick for my taste but they pick up the product very well.</li>
    <li> to start! delivery was estimated January 10th - Jan 28th. I said WTF! OMG! I ordered them on Dec 14th. I got them today Christmas Eve all the way from freaking China! So that is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I wish i could post a vid on these brushes. its dense and soft. i have not washed them or applied make up but they feel great on my skin. the handle is glued tight. Seem like great quality for the price! I ordered this along with their Tapered Kabuki, Angled Kabuki along with the 4 piece eye shadow blending brushes. and the same goes for all of them. they are all uniform in quality and texture. so i will probably just copy and paste this for the other ones as well instead of writing a review for each individual brush. they are all great and would recommend them.</li>
    <li> When i purchased them i expected to get them in two to three weeks, but a week later they surprising got here ! i was shock because how fast they got here. now they did come in a small package i didnt think it was the brushes in there but they were even tho the packaging was so/so i fell in love with the brushes they feel nothing cheap &amp; they blend so good!</li>
    <li> I always wanted to get Sigma Brushes but they are so expensive.I took a chance and ordered these.And they are gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.Happy so far.I will be ordering more soon.Also they are very Blendable.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing they came early and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much bc of the price but I was very surprised..no shedding nice and thick they are very sturdy none have came apart and I have uses for every single eye brush I will definitely be ordering more brushes from these guys pleasantly surprised</li>
    <li> They do smell kinda funny, but they are very soft. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but i have high hopes.They look nice as well.</li>
    <li> The pointed brush is perfect for blending concealer under the eye area for older women and I&#x27;m finding that the domed brush is great for blending eyeshadow seamlessly.</li>
    <li> I love how many came in the package and I still have one brush I haven&#x27;t even used yet.  They all have different shapes for different areas for your eyes.  They are really soft and way cheaper than what you would pay for the same quality brush in an ULTA or Sephora&#x27;s store.</li>
    <li> These are the best set of brushes ever! They&#x27;re about the length of a toothbrush and the handle is about 1/2 in width? and so soft. I used black eyeshadow to test out how it blends and it blends perfectly and softens really harsh makeup. What I really love about them is the length and the thickness of the brush, they&#x27;re really dense and incredibly soft and really comfortable to hold in your hand. And the price is amazing for the quality of these :) *It comes with two blending, 1 tapered like brush and a flat top brush that is essentially a smaller vers. of a stippling foundation brush, i don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s used for but I use it for concealer under my eyes</li>
    <li> This is not a set of eye brushes, I got the face brushes...they are good brushes but I ordered the face ones.</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty nice.  Nothing great.  I do not know what I was hoping to buy when I got them.  They didn&#x27;t smell when opened.  They do the job that a blending brush is supposed to do.  I could be too hard on this product.  I just don&#x27;t really know what i was hoping to get.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice quality but they are wayyyy to big. I thought they were eyeshadow brushes but they are about 1/2 inch diameter.</li>
    <li> I like this brush good quality for the price. I have not use it looks high end brush better than what I expected</li>
    <li> These are really nice brushes for the price! I adore them and they&#x27;re just what I needed. They&#x27;re nice and soft. The right size for almost any eyeshadow application.</li>
    <li> (Bf account). Super soft brushes. Haven&#x27;t seen any shedding and blend nicely!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these brushes. I actually use them for more than just eye blending, they are perfect for under eye concealer as well. I have to repurchase more!</li>
    <li> No contouring to any of the bristles. They don&#x27;t seem cut/made correctly. Duplicate brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good, but wished they came in more variety of sizes/shapes. All 4 of these brushes are relatively the same thickness so not seeing the point. Sure, I could&#x27;ve looked more closely, but it should be described better. So, I&#x27;ve got 2 of the brushes set aside for use when the first two wear out. Not the end of the world so not a huge complaint, but just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are outstanding. I use them everyday for my eyeshadows - will purchase again if I need additional brushes.</li>
    <li> I received this purchase...iut smells funny...I doubt I&#x27;m going to even use it...Just not happy with the packaging and everything</li>
    <li> Love these make my makeup look awesome! The pencil brush is kind of a two in one It&#x27;s perfect for a sculpted crease. They are so soft and dense at the same time but as I kept using them they softened some More! In a good way! Buy back ups for sure!</li>
    <li> Love my brushes thanks!!!!  They are very soft it doesn&#x27;t soak up all the product instead it gives a flawless finish!</li>
    <li> Great quality! The brushes are big but not too big for your eye and the are very soft and fluffy for a great price.</li>
    <li> These brushes came super fast.  And they are awesome.  Super soft, easy to use and they give a fantastic look to your make up.  I used one of the dome brushes for under eye concealer and it was truly flawless and perfect I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I am ordering more!  I am in love!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are decent. They&#x27;re 6 dollars and you can tell. I took the brushes out of the package and immediately one of the metal parts along with the bristles fell to the floor... But I didn&#x27;t really expect much from this.</li>
