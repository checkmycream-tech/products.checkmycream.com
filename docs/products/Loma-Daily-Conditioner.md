    <li> Great product, exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s addicted to it.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!! I love it without shampooing</li>
    <li> This is the greatest shampoo. Great for colored hair.</li>
    <li> Do you color your hair? Does the color fade within a few week&amp;#34;? Time to pick up your Loma organic conditioner. You will love the results.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Pearatin products. I purchased the Loma Organics Daily Conditioner thinking it would be the same. It is a good conditioner but I do not like the way it smells. When I used the Pearatin product I loved the way it smelled. I cringe when I use this product now.  Olfactory is a powerful sense and I will be looking for a new conditioner.  Big mistake Loma!</li>
    <li> Loma products are great for my fine, thin hair!  The conditioner is light, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, and has a lovely scent.  I have been buying Loma products (shampoo, conditioner, Pearatin treatment) for years, and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my hair silky and shiny. Great body too. I Ave fine hair and this works well without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this conditioner to anyone looking for a product that leaves your hair soft, manageable and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it cleans my hair without stripping the color.  I can now color every 7-8 weeks instead of every 4 weeks.  My  hair has bounce and is healthy again.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Light fragrance, light weight. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love that it contains no parabens, silicone dioxide, etc. It smells great. It doesn&#x27;t detangle very well for my long course hair but I like that it is not heavy. It is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a shampoo to use with hi-lighted and keratin treated hai.  The keratin shampoos weigh down my hair.  LOMA is the answer!</li>
    <li> I love Loma products and have several friends who now are converted to Loma products.  Great for curly guys and gals.</li>
    <li> I have used Loma shampoo and conditioner fo the last 6 years.  Very good product.  I like that the first ingredient is not water.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner. It smells good and my hair is soft and shiny when I use it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment/delivery. Received what was advertised. I love the Loma Moisturizing Shampoo and Moisturizing Conditioner. Thought I would try the Daily Conditioner. Leaves hair feeling soft and silky. Would also recommend the Loma Oil Treatment (leave-in). My hair feels fantastic after using that and haven&#x27;t had the dry ends like I used to. This conditioner works great, but I love the smell of the Moisturizing Conditioner better.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I also leave it in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t cause it to be greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product.  This light weight conditioner is perfect for my hair.  If you are looking for a deep conditioner, this product is not for you.  This conditioner is a great one to use daily.  Love it&#x27;s citrusy, fresh smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner!  I have long, thick hair and it always feels soft and is free of tangles when I use this conditioner.  It is scented with essential oils that smell amazing.  I get a lot of compliments on the way my hair smells when I use this.</li>
    <li> Bought a smaller bottle through my salon but found the pricing through Amazon was better.  More fabulous product and better price.  This organic conditioner along with the shampoo makes the hair feel full and soft, has a great fruity smell but not over-powering.  Would use this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and did not spill.  I have been looking for a good shampoo and conditioners for my highlights.  I have been using KPak products for 10 years and and when I ran out I decided to search for an organic sulfate &amp; paraben free product.  I ordered the  Loma Organics Moisturizing shampoo and Daily Conditioners after reading so many good reviews so I decided to try this myself.  Both products had great scents.  My hair is fine but coarse in texture and most conditioners weigh down my hair, but this conditioner was not heavy and left my hair silky smooth &amp; not frizzy.  I will definitely stick with this product and purchase more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I color my hair and it stays very soft.  Does not dry out like previously used products.  I greatly appreciate it because it is a gluten free product and not tested on animal.s</li>
    <li> Great product and received in a good timely manner.</li>
    <li> Hair feels soft and shines, it smells very sexy (per my boyfriend)!</li>
