      <li>I ordered this product because I love it and it has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>The many layers required caused the product to flake around my eyes unattractively.  </li>
      <li>free to ask any questions!</li>
      <li>this mascara (waterproof) has been faithful to me :)</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years, love it, it is a mainstay as far as makeup goes, maybelline products are always good!</li>
      <li>I have very light, fine lashes and do a lot of water sports</li>
      <li>Product is fine but shipping was more than the cost of the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised about the amount of women happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>like to bend the brush into a curve to better fit my eye</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good mascara and try most of the new ones.  </li>
      <li>I use it daily and by the end of the day my lashes look good!</li>
      <li>, Very Black is the BEST!!  </li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have believed these positive reviews!!</li>
      <li>All in all am very well satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>, thats the only good thing about it....</li>
      <li>I got it for my wedding day and it didn&#x27;t run at all, and it was extremely hot too!</li>
      <li>Just a great mascara that gives volume and length without clumps or mess.  </li>
      <li>My mom first introduced me to water proof mascara after my dad passed away almost 15 years ago.</li>
      <li>You can even go further if you want and layer on even more</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>The first two or three times you use it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and price points.  </li>
      <li>I have long eyelashes and many mascaras</li>
      <li>It lasts the whole day without smudging or flaking even in the summer time when it&#x27;s hot and humid.  </li>
      <li>I find it as the only true waterproof mascara out there!</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted and for a decent price.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t know how much can be done with them from any product to make them appear longer.</li>
      <li>and I really like it, so</li>
      <li>/&gt;These hold the curls really well</li>
      <li>This is really upsetting.</li>
      <li>It is a really sturdy mascara and takes quite a bit of make up remover to fully remove.</li>
      <li>I have been using this since it was in the light blue bottle and when this was the lone Volum Express, before the Falsies, One By One, Cat Eyes, etc.</li>
      <li>and this really did work.</li>
      <li>The first one is normal, sweeping from root to tip.</li>
      <li>This mascara didn&#x27;t add volume like a lot of the reviews said it would - it actually looks more like my natural lashes with color added to them.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite and have tried 3 of the other newer mascaras, but they do not compare.  </li>
      <li>Great, love it wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued :(</li>
      <li>Love it never use anything else, even though I have tried a lot of other kinds, I can not switch!</li>
      <li>The second I focus more on wiggling it in the roots, then the last I use the end of the brush to get in and separate any lashes that may have clumped up.</li>
      <li>Truly a classic mascara, no frills no gimmicks.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this formula.</li>
      <li>the only mascara that is better than this one is colossal, glam black,  from maybeline too...</li>
      <li>Any other mascaras will smudge right underneath my eyebrows about halfway through the day, like right where the tops of my eyelashes hit.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t get waterproof mascaras because they make the lashes really stiff but this is incredible because the lashes are still soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>makes my lashes super long.</li>
      <li>far as removing it goes, I have a habit of picking of my mascara at night rather than using a makeup remover, and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever found that just comes right off and doesn&#x27;t get all goopy when I do that.</li>
      <li>In comparison to other mascaras I&#x27;ve used (even expensive brands), this product helps maintain the curl the best.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes.</li>
      <li>lashes - just lashes that look a bit thicker and darker that look natural.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t see it sold anywhere else, so I am guessing its really old</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes.</li>
      <li>In fact, I think it might have been a bit old when I received it and</li>
      <li>highly recommend this mascara, but I know mascara is something that is all about personal preference.</li>
      <li>Wasted my money thank u very much!</li>
      <li>you can barely see I have anything on.  </li>
      <li>If I wear other eye makeup with this mascara that I need to remove, I just use coconut oil and it all wipes off very easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but they are so light blonde and hard to see.  </li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t buy this product, I bought it and it was completely dry even though the packaging was completely sealed....</li>
      <li>BTW, I&#x27;m a fan of the VolumExpress Classic only, not the other products in the VolumExpress line like VolumExpress Falsies.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s supposed to be long lasting!</li>
<li> This is like mascara from early 90s or something, just black stain on your lashes, that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump.</li>
<li> My favorite mascara by far!&lt;br /&gt;Since we&#x27;ve moved to the Middle East where lots of things are hard to get and make up usually melts away in just few hours</li>
<li> My lashes are long but they are not curly</li>
<li> I have long eyelashes</li>
<li> For some reason, I keep trying other brands, but I always come back to this one.</li>
<li> and I feel like that helps to coat every single lash.</li>
<li> I will say that it is a very dry mascara and takes some getting used to.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s really thin and feels like it&#x27;s not doing anything, then it gets thicker and drier after that, which is when it&#x27;ll be much easier to build</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s not very waterproof at all and flakes off.  </li>
<li> if you&#x27;re going for a more dramatic evening look, and you won&#x27;t have to wear false</li>
<li> so I really do need something tough to put up with me rubbing my eyes, crying from laughter, etc.</li>
<li> This brand seems to hold lashes in place after curling, rather than weigh them down, which is something that I can&#x27;t find in any other brand/ formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the water proof mascara in the pink and green tube 4 ever.</li>
<li> This mascara looks natural without looking like you are wearing false eyelashes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not totally waterproof! Bring back CG Marathon Mascara PLEASE!!!</li>
    <li> Product is fine but shipping was more than the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> Good! I use it daily and by the end of the day my lashes look good!</li>
    <li> Love Maybelline...the only mascara  I use..for 46yrs</li>
    <li> Truly a classic mascara, no frills no gimmicks.  Just a great mascara that gives volume and length without clumps or mess.  Stays all day without flaking and is truly waterproof.  Works great, love it :)</li>
    <li> This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras. It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup. It doesn&#x27;t clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes. My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove...but it&#x27;s a waterproof mascara. It&#x27;s supposed to be long lasting! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime, this is not for you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a few months, and I like it. I don&#x27;t want &amp;#34;monster&amp;#34; lashes - just lashes that look a bit thicker and darker that look natural. This mascara works for me. Toward the end of the uses, it may get a clump or two on the brush, but I just wipe them off on a tissue. This mascara looks natural without looking like you are wearing false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> And it actually was waterproof! I don&#x27;t use mascara enough to remember I have it on when I DO wear it so I really do need something tough to put up with me rubbing my eyes, crying from laughter, etc. and this really did work. The volumizing part was ok but I do have short lashes so don&#x27;t know how much can be done with them from any product to make them appear longer. All in all am very well satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Maybelline has habit of discontinuing an item which leaves me scrambling to find a replacement. This is my favorite and have tried 3 of the other newer mascaras, but they do not compare.  So difficult to find in the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a few years now and will not use anything else.  It lasts the whole day without smudging or flaking even in the summer time when it&#x27;s hot and humid.  My lashes are long but they are not curly so I have to curl them using an eyelash curler.  In comparison to other mascaras I&#x27;ve used (even expensive brands), this product helps maintain the curl the best.  It will smudge a bit and uncurl with water but you can trust that you will not have raccoon eyes. I always get complimented on my lashes, and this product is the reason why.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever discontinue this product.  BTW, I&#x27;m a fan of the VolumExpress Classic only, not the other products in the VolumExpress line like VolumExpress Falsies. I&#x27;ve tried the Falsies and they flake and smudge a lot!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, so sad I cant buy it at any stores anymore. The best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the water proof mascara in the pink and green tube 4 ever. this doesn&#x27;t cover well nor does it stay on.  you can barely see I have anything on.  the only plus is no raccoon eyes and it&#x27;s gone by bedtime.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara by far!&lt;br /&gt;Since we&#x27;ve moved to the Middle East where lots of things are hard to get and make up usually melts away in just few hours this mascara (waterproof) has been faithful to me :)</li>
    <li> My mom first introduced me to water proof mascara after my dad passed away almost 15 years ago. I&#x27;ve never gone back to regular mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and price points.  Maybelline Volum&#x27; Express, Very Black is the BEST!!  My eyelashes are almost invisible without mascara so I never leave the house with it.  I even give this as gifts to my girlfriends during the summer!  It&#x27;s great for beach and pool time.</li>
    <li> The product arrived damaged and unuseable. The one star Rating is a gift.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, love it, it is a mainstay as far as makeup goes, maybelline products are always good!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with my order but I got a concealer instead and I really like it, so I never even complained.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and even though it can clump a bit, it makes my eyelashes look amazing!  It is a really sturdy mascara and takes quite a bit of make up remover to fully remove.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I love it and it has been discontinued. It is exactly what I wanted and for a decent price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since it was in the light blue bottle and when this was the lone Volum Express, before the Falsies, One By One, Cat Eyes, etc. I just love it. I will say that it is a very dry mascara and takes some getting used to. The first two or three times you use it, it&#x27;s really thin and feels like it&#x27;s not doing anything, then it gets thicker and drier after that, which is when it&#x27;ll be much easier to build volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I layer about three coats of this to get my desired look. The first one is normal, sweeping from root to tip. The second I focus more on wiggling it in the roots, then the last I use the end of the brush to get in and separate any lashes that may have clumped up. You can even go further if you want and layer on even more if you&#x27;re going for a more dramatic evening look, and you won&#x27;t have to wear false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to bend the brush into a curve to better fit my eye and I feel like that helps to coat every single lash. You can&#x27;t do that with the newer rubber brushes like the one in Cover Girl Lash Blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will not budge. I wear it in the summer even when swimming and it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. Any other mascaras will smudge right underneath my eyebrows about halfway through the day, like right where the tops of my eyelashes hit. This one doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as removing it goes, I have a habit of picking of my mascara at night rather than using a makeup remover, and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever found that just comes right off and doesn&#x27;t get all goopy when I do that. If I wear other eye makeup with this mascara that I need to remove, I just use coconut oil and it all wipes off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mascara, but I know mascara is something that is all about personal preference. Give it a try! And remember to try it out a few times to for it to thicken up.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the correct product. Whatver I did receive was old, discolored, openned and dirty.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a while now, and it&#x27;s the only one I like.  Imagine my disappointment when Maybelline discontinued it!  I am so glad that I can still purchase it on Amazon so I can stockpile it!!</li>
    <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t add volume like a lot of the reviews said it would - it actually looks more like my natural lashes with color added to them. It is very difficult to get off, even with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Great, love it wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued :(</li>
    <li> I would not use this simply because it pulls out your lashes and is impossible to remove. I used eye makeup remover  as recommended. I still have it on my lashes after scrubbing it of with a cotton balls. My eyes  are all red now. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I opened the package to use and it was completely dried out. This is really upsetting. Now I have to throw it away. Just save your money and go buy it in a store. Now I&#x27;m out $$ and time.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t run or fade or chip, so it gets 5 stars from me! :D altho its a pain to wash off.</li>
    <li> the only mascara that is better than this one is colossal, glam black,  from maybeline too... i love it so mich...</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product, I bought it and it was completely dry even though the packaging was completely sealed.... I haven&#x27;t see it sold anywhere else, so I am guessing its really old, i&#x27;m really disappointed in this</li>
    <li> i got it on the day it said it would be here it works really good makes my lashes super long. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the length of my lashes</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. I got it for my wedding day and it didn&#x27;t run at all, and it was extremely hot too! I&#x27;m going to go out and buy it in non-waterproof.</li>
    <li> I will never switch mascaras. I have been using this since 2003! I find it as the only true waterproof mascara out there! Through sweat and swimming!</li>
    <li> This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras. It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup. It doesn&#x27;t clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes. My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove...but it&#x27;s a waterproof mascara. It&#x27;s supposed to be long lasting! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime, this is not for you!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s also good pack and ship. But product is not so good. Never buy again. Maybe tried another version of Maybelline&#x27;s mascaras</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for years. For some reason, I keep trying other brands, but I always come back to this one. This brand seems to hold lashes in place after curling, rather than weigh them down, which is something that I can&#x27;t find in any other brand/ formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this product is that it is nearly impossible to get off at the end of the day. I have to use a specific brand (Mary Kay) of eye makeup remover, and it is the ONLY thing that will get this stuff off my lashes. Otherwise I have to literally pull the makeup off with my fingertips, which isn&#x27;t pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised about the amount of women happy with this product.  I find it requires several layers and applications to be visible enough, it&#x27;s not very waterproof at all and flakes off.  Turns out spiky &amp; gloppy bec. of the 2-3 layers required to see it.  Never will I buy this again.</li>
    <li> Hi!let me just get to the point this is the best mascara I have tried I am really really picky when it comes to my eyelashes I have long eyelashes and many mascaras make my lashes droop down..this one actually kept my eyelashes up and it brought out the best of them..it also didn&#x27;t clump like most do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good mascara and try most of the new ones.  I have very light, fine lashes and do a lot of water sports so I look for a mascara that gives volume and is waterproof.  This mascara was waterproof, but I had to apply several layers to get any volume and what I got was underwhelming.  The many layers required caused the product to flake around my eyes unattractively.  Also, it dried out way before it should have.  In fact, I think it might have been a bit old when I received it and maybe that&#x27;s the reason for the flaking.</li>
    <li> Lies lies lies. I shouldn&#x27;t have believed these positive reviews!! This is like mascara from early 90s or something, just black stain on your lashes, that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump. Oh yes it&#x27;s waterproof so it gets a one star, thats the only good thing about it....it definitely isn&#x27;t pretty!!!! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME. Wasted my money thank u very much! Sigh. I want my money backkkkkkkkkk!! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding!!! D:&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve gotten l&#x27;oreal voluminous waterproof mascara instead......</li>
    <li> I only wear Maybelline Vlum&#x27; Express for my waterproof mascara. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands that you buy at the mall but this is a great product and a lot more reasonably priced. Great for humid climates.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara. I usually don&#x27;t get waterproof mascaras because they make the lashes really stiff but this is incredible because the lashes are still soft.&lt;br /&gt;These hold the curls really well but don&#x27;t make the lashes voluminous or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions!</li>
    <li> This mascara I have used for years!! I have long eyelashes but they are so light blonde and hard to see.  This mascara is bulidable, gives length and thickness.  Love it never use anything else, even though I have tried a lot of other kinds, I can not switch!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Completely satisfied.</li>
