      <li>After co-washing, applying the leave-in and shingling in the Curling Jelly, I give a good shake and lightly spray this product onto my hair (not too much, so that it doesn&#x27;t leave white dropplets).  </li>

      <li>my hair is TOTALLY SOFT.  </li>
      <li>when I purchased this product, I was buying it to see if it would help me manage my natural style.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and moisturized without feeling oily.</li>
      <li>I  was looking for a moisturizer that would be  moisturizing enough for the braids but would also be light enough not to oil down the weave by any accidental transference in the process.  </li>
      <li>I have combination hair, which is a mixture of fine curly and somewhat thick and unruly hair.</li>
      <li>I live in the Midwest area, the air is dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not in love with the smell, but this stuff is amazing! I used it while I was wearing a flexi-rod set and it kept my hair VERY moisturized. It will be a staple in my hair routine, along with the majority of the As I Am, hair care line! You can use it on either wet or dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I used it also as a leave-in and i love it! Alternatively, i used it to style the hair and it is OK. Smells nice :-)</li>
    <li> The Coco Shea Spray is a great hair moisturizer. Keeps my natural hair smooth, soft and moisturized. My hair looks healthy and shiny. Love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this product is actually doing anything for my hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change or difference in my hair from using it since 1/10/15. Most likely I will not purchase it again. I thought it was going to be more of a soft oil mist spray.</li>
    <li> Great product, needs better spray button but great product</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product! I love the smell and how moisturized  it makes my hair feel days later. but  that&#x27;s not even the kicker. sometimes I get weave sew ins  with a net. I am a firm believer in taking care of my hair underneath the sew in. I  was looking for a moisturizer that would be  moisturizing enough for the braids but would also be light enough not to oil down the weave by any accidental transference in the process.  this was perfect! I put this product in a small coloring applicator bottle and carefully squirt the braids through the net once a week on sew in wash days.  and when I want an  added boost I add a tad bit of avocado oil or a few drops of tea tree oil in the bottle to help with the itching.  this product can stand alone and also plays well with others. I  order two at a time to always have it handy!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and couldn&#x27;t figure out exactly how to use it....until now.  After co-washing, applying the leave-in and shingling in the Curling Jelly, I give a good shake and lightly spray this product onto my hair (not too much, so that it doesn&#x27;t leave white dropplets).  Once my hair is dry (either naturally or by difusing) my hair is TOTALLY SOFT.  I love love it!</li>
    <li> this stuff is terrible it makes your hair nappy and dry plus it burns.i dont see how this would work for anyone</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work.  Kinky hair often needs nothing more than a good moisturizing spritz of something each day.  This didn&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you can get yourself a spray bottle, some distilled water and start experimenting with conditioners or aloe vera mixed into it.  Great big NO on this one.</li>
    <li> It smells so good. I have had a lot of people come up to me and tell me how good my hair smells. All of them said that it has an earthy coconut smell. Plus, it works great to moisturize my hair. I have a very dry scalp and I find that it gives me some relief.</li>
    <li> Really moisturizes my hair and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle of this stuff!  I love it!  I will purchase it again and again!  It is expensive though but I guess you get what you pay for most times.</li>
    <li> I like this product, Keeps my hair very moisturized. I just wish the bottle was bigger for the price. If you need moisture in your hair, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Great Product, it is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> It smells very nice and worked well on the hair I applied it to.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product line, I received compliments from many about my hair which is natural. I&#x27;ve shared this product w/ other naturals.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, just adds moisture to your hair.  I just transferred the remaining product in an older bottle of this product to the new container.  It was very surprised to see that it looked like blended up coconut in a paste texture with some liquid in the bottle also.  Just made me like it more knowing it&#x27;s real coconut in the spray.</li>
    <li> Best for anyone with frizzy or &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; hair due to over processing and dying. This product has Shea Butter and other moisturizing ingredients. A+++ As I Am is the best I have EVER used.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well I liked As I Am Coco Shea Spray. It leaves my hair soft and moisturized without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is awesome.  I love what it did for my hair.  It gave me the shine that i needed and the softness.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be</li>
    <li> This product does not smell nice. It smells like metal. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve always liked As I Am products. This one is not a keeper.</li>
    <li> when I purchased this product, I was buying it to see if it would help me manage my natural style. I have combination hair, which is a mixture of fine curly and somewhat thick and unruly hair. but none of the products on the market seem to help give me the thre proper mix to help keep my curls without getting greasy or that hard feeling. This product is a winner in my book! I used it along with the co-wash and the leave in conditioner. and used all together work very well with my hair. One I ordered the product it came within the same week I ordered it. the except for the coco spray which came 2 days later. which is fine woth me. I was able to test out each product on their own.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works very well! It provides great moisture for the hair and scalp.  I only wish the bottle were bigger!</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again . Made my hair a little soft but it doesn&#x27;t last at all .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a great touch up for in between shampoo</li>
    <li> I live in the Midwest area, the air is dry and I&#x27;m protective styling till spring.  I gave it two stars because it does moisturize, if your hair likes glycerin and there is moisture in the air.  I saw a lot of complaints of dry and stiff hair and that could be the problem.  But my hair likes it, I just strongly dislike the smell. Smells like burnt plastic and immediately my Mom, whom has a super nose, said my hair wasn&#x27;t pleasant after application of it.  I really wanted to like it but for me the fragrance made me trash it and I know its not a cheap product. I pray they make changes to the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product had a different scent, which I can&#x27;t place. Its light and nourishes my hair, without weighing it down. Will repurchase</li>
    <li> This is great if you have dry hair. This travel size spray is a moisturizer for the dry hair and have just enough oil for dry scalps and can be used everyday.</li>
