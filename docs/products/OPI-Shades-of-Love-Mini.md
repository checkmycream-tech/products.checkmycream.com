      <li>The bottles are mini, but this is great for trying out different colors or getting travel versions of your favorites.</li>

      <li>but ok if you mix them with other colors.</li>
      <li>Opi nail polishes are high quality.</li>
      <li>so you have to layer them, they are not thick cream.</li>
      <li>The nail polish size is ADORABLE - but so small, except for gifting - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for personal purchase.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get a smooth application as the brush gets frayed.  </li>
      <li>classic beige&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Heart:  baby pink</li>

    <li> Great product and fast shipper.</li>
    <li> I like the shades in this package.</li>
    <li> Really nice light colors.  Good for a French manicure.</li>
    <li> QUICK shipping. Just went to get my mail and it was already here. It took about 5 business days to get here. Nail polish bottles come wrapped in bubble wrap. It comes with the OPI box and what goes inside the box to hold the nail polish, both came flat and in the package just find. So you do have to set that up yourself if you plan on giving it to someone, which I found kind of fun. Easy set up. Colors look gorgeous and the bottles are so tiny, it&#x27;s adorable. Since it&#x27;s a gift I won&#x27;t be trying out the colors, but it&#x27;s OPI.... Their nail polish is already known for being great.</li>
    <li> Very Beautiful colors. Opi is one of the Best nail polish I have used.</li>
    <li> Opi nail polishes are high quality. The bottles are mini, but this is great for trying out different colors or getting travel versions of your favorites. I got this set because I wanted a set of neutral / pinky colors for work that are more sheer. All the colors are a bit see through so you have to layer them, they are not thick cream. I think you can wear all of these work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samoan Sand: classic beige&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Heart:  baby pink&lt;br /&gt;Kyoto Pearl: silver pearl&lt;br /&gt;Passion: peach</li>
    <li> Very translucent polish. Need at least 3-5 layers to make color bold and with these small bottles you will probably get only one use out of them.</li>
    <li> I always prefer the minis and this set has great colors!</li>
    <li> Colors not true to the picture but ok if you mix them with other colors.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person loved it</li>
    <li> Love the colors in these minis light pretty shades</li>
    <li> Used in a gift basket when asking friends to be bridesmaids! Some of the colors began to separate slightly soon after I received package, but nail polish still seemed to apply decently. Didn&#x27;t love the colors for myself, but I was giving them away so that didn&#x27;t really matter! The nail polish size is ADORABLE - but so small, except for gifting - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for personal purchase. Could get much more use out of regular sized OPI.</li>
    <li> These are very cute little nail polish sets, I will be giving them as part of my bridesmaid gifts.</li>
    <li> Love the shades. But when they say &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; they really mean it</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and arrived within 3 days of the order. Love the colors and the size of the bottles.</li>
    <li> Love OPI!  Cute sample bottles</li>
    <li> Not bad mini set. Colors are very neutral and blend in with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> The colors are terrible, they do not show at all!!</li>
    <li> Great neutral colors. No misses here.  Great for any skin tone.</li>
    <li> Good product, showed up on time. Bought for my teenage daughter. She loved the nude colors.</li>
    <li> DISAPPOINTED IN THE  OPI Shades of Love Mini</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty-the bottles are teeny tiny, which I don&#x27;t mind, except the brush gets a bit stuck in the nozzle so it&#x27;s hard to get a smooth application as the brush gets frayed.  Still, was nice to try all the colors.  Somoan Sand is a perennial favorite.</li>
    <li> The packaging was a little crushed, but I didn&#x27;t need it anyways.  Great product, shipped fast and used these for my daughter&#x27;s bridal favors.</li>
    <li> Just received and love the shades. Minis are a great way to try them out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OPI so it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
