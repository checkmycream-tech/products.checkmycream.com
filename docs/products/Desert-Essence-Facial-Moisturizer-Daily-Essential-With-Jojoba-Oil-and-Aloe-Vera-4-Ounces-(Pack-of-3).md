      <li>great reason don&#x27;t you think?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>The price is also great for all three jars and they are generous amounts in each jar.</li>
      <li>goes great under makeup-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a senior, and this makes my skin feel good whenever I put it on.</li>
      <li>My fave lotion at a good price</li>
      <li>It feels good on my skin</li>
      <li>But this price is so good, and that&#x27;s just for winter...</li>
      <li>It was a great price and a nice sized jar.</li>
      <li>Her skin has never looked better!  </li>
      <li>I might be able to use it as a body moisturizer, but not what I had intended purchasing it for...disappointed!</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t know these folks, so they didn&#x27;t HAVE to be nice . .  .</li>
      <li>Bought 3 containers of this lotion I liked it until they mildewed.  </li>
      <li>Seems just as nice as lotion that costs 3-4x more at the spa.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful, effective product which I use daily!  </li>
      <li>I love this cream because it is non greasy-</li>
      <li>I apply in the morning, then use some more around the eyes before bed.</li>
      <li>Best facial moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Took care of pimples and made my skin look better.</li>
      <li>Once I apply it, my skin feels much better.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>This is best facial moisturizer I have found for the money.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;That can&#x27;t be you, MAYBE 48 at the most . . .</li>
      <li>I will order more when this cream comes available again.</li>
      <li>The drying and redness that she was suffering from due to the chemicals in ProActive have gone away, and now she just has a beautiful, even skin tone!</li>
      <li>Desert Essence is silky smooth, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  </li>
      <li>Really, this is such a wonderful price...</li>
      <li>After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  </li>
      <li>Paid more at Whole Foods than we do here.  </li>
      <li>I like that it is SPF free because why do I need so much SPF on my face in the winter here in NH?  </li>
      <li>Have been using this more natural alternative for a couple years now.  </li>
      <li>When I saw the deal for three jars I purchased right away.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and works really well, not irritating, and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>It is a great face cream for sensitive skin or for people who want a simple natural product.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face smooth and soft but not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Reasonably safe ingredient list according to the EWG Skin Deep database.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smart if it gets into my eyes accidentally.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is much cheaper than the Whole Foods price.</li>
      <li>It is lightly scented, and is white.</li>
      <li>I had originally bought this product for my daughter to use as a companion to the Desert Essence Tea Tree facial wash.  </li>
      <li>And the main reason I am hooked is that the company does not partake in animal testing.</li>
      <li>My skin breaks out and or/gets red and extra oily with most store products, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get any particular smell from the product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of thick without feeling greasy or like</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to fragrance and this is mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.  </li>
      <li>I use it night and morning and sometimes on my elbows when they get super dry.</li>
      <li>and it made her skin soft!  </li>
      <li>I found this product first at a local health store.</li>
      <li>My face feels so soft, too!  </li>
      <li>It is refreshing for my face especially after I wash my face and the skin feels tight.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now, and like it very well.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a product that was made of natural ingredients and without SPF.  </li>
      <li>my skin is soft and stays soft.</li>
      <li>And at 62 glorious years old, people I never met before have called me a liar to my face.  </li>
      <li>I was one of those &#x27;kids&#x27; that was told I&#x27;d have zits forever,  NEVER use anything that would make your skin soft.  </li>
      <li>would have loved it especially for the price, but my face only gets worse with use</li>
      <li>Very light and non irritating.</li>
      <li>One order has led to MANY RE-ORDERS ........... never greasy, sinks into little  gasp!  </li>
      <li>I like this moisturiser because it us light and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I am so surprised that such a luxurious lotion soaks in my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
      <li>The first one I thought was perhaps because I kept it in my humid bathroom, but the other two were kept in my bedroom and they mildewed as well after only being opened a month or so.</li>

    <li> I am almost out of this cream and I have used it for almost a year. I love this cream because it is non greasy- goes great under makeup- my skin is soft and stays soft. The price is also great for all three jars and they are generous amounts in each jar. I will order more when this cream comes available again. You can not go wrong with this product.  Lynda A</li>

THEN a few years ago, a co-worker said she had never had zits with this and it made her skin soft!  Lo&#x27; n&#x27; behold my Amazon carried this product.  One order has led to MANY RE-ORDERS ........... never greasy, sinks into little  gasp!  winkles n&#x27; in a few days, history.  DESERT ESSENCE, FLAT OUT WORKS. . . . a little dab &#x27;will do ya!

    <li> Best facial moisturizer I have ever used. Took care of pimples and made my skin look better.</li>
    <li> would have loved it especially for the price, but my face only gets worse with use so I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> My fave lotion at a good price</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that was made of natural ingredients and without SPF.  I really like this product.  It feels good on my skin and I am using it day and night.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I like that it is SPF free because why do I need so much SPF on my face in the winter here in NH?  Just wanted some freedom from it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, effective product which I use daily!  Not available here, so your supplying this is essential!</li>
    <li> This is best facial moisturizer I have found for the money.  The Dessert Essence is a quality line of products. Amazon is much cheaper than the Whole Foods price.</li>
    <li> I have been using an expensive organic lotion that I had been introduced to at a local spa, but just couldn&#x27;t afford to continue purchasing it.

    <li> I LOVE this product. I have used it for years and always regret when I have tried other moisturizers. There is nothing out there that provides such moisture while preventing wrinkles. Yes, my secret weapon. And the main reason I am hooked is that the company does not partake in animal testing.</li>
    <li> Have been using this more natural alternative for a couple years now.  Paid more at Whole Foods than we do here.  I am sensitive to fragrance and this is mild enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.  It also doesn&#x27;t smart if it gets into my eyes accidentally.</li>
    <li> Very light and non irritating.</li>
    <li> This product gave me an allergic reaction. My face felt as if it was on fire! Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this product but it smells funky! Definitely not buying this again. I can&#x27;t tell either if it works well on my face, beacuse I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
    <li> I always try to buy organic/natural products before looking at anything else.  Desert Essence is silky smooth, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.  My only issue is that it&#x27;s not as thick as I like during the winter months in New England, a time when my skin can get very dry.  But this price is so good, and that&#x27;s just for winter... I supplement with heavy duty organic argan oil on the dry spots and my skin&#x27;s happy.  Really, this is such a wonderful price... I was amazed after shopping around.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works really well, not irritating, and not greasy at all. a little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now, and like it very well.  I&#x27;m a senior, and this makes my skin feel good whenever I put it on.</li>
    <li> Seems just as nice as lotion that costs 3-4x more at the spa.  Reasonably safe ingredient list according to the EWG Skin Deep database.  I don&#x27;t get any particular smell from the product so I&#x27;m not sure what the \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; reviewer is talking about.  It leaves my face smooth and soft but not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I found this product first at a local health store. When I saw the deal for three jars I purchased right away. This face cream hydrates, does not leave your face greasy, and keeps your skin firm. I use it night and morning and sometimes on my elbows when they get super dry. It is a great face cream for sensitive skin or for people who want a simple natural product.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I use this, the mouthwash, the facewash, and the deodorant. This is a great face cream! It&#x27;s kind of thick without feeling greasy or like your pores are clogged. It is lightly scented, and is white. As soon as I apply it, the aloe vera diminishes any redness or irritation, and the jojoba oil moisturizes without causing my skin to break out. My housemate can&#x27;t believe how polished my face looks when I use this. I apply in the morning, then use some more around the eyes before bed. Get it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought 3 containers of this lotion I liked it until they mildewed.  The first one I thought was perhaps because I kept it in my humid bathroom, but the other two were kept in my bedroom and they mildewed as well after only being opened a month or so.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods. It was a great price and a nice sized jar. However, the product is not good for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and, in the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve had a horrible rash that burns like my face is on fire. I could not figure out what it was until I used some of the moisturizer tonight (to soothe the rash.  After a minute or so, my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire.  I immediately washed it off and applied an ice pack.  It still is inflamed but not stinging anymore.  After research, I realized that it contains sodium hydroxide (or lye) which is extremely caustic.  I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturers were thinking!</li>
    <li> I use it as a daily moisturizer for my face and I like it. I have used Avalon organics in the past and they are slightly exensive as compared to this one.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturiser because it us light and a little bit goes a long way.  It is refreshing for my face especially after I wash my face and the skin feels tight.  Once I apply it, my skin feels much better. The jar will last a long time.</li>
    <li> As a facial moisturizer it&#x27;s not good...my face broke out within a few days of using it...I might be able to use it as a body moisturizer, but not what I had intended purchasing it for...disappointed!</li>
