### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great stuff!  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>i have been a happy girl !!!!</li>
      <li>which is good.</li>
      <li>Because it &amp;#34;sounds&amp;#34; so good.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a winner, top and underneath the eye both.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>But I have learned through the years and trial and error that you can find some pretty darn good products at Walmart and target, CVS, the lower inexpensive lines</li>
      <li>It feels very cool and soothing when applied.  </li>
      <li>Awesome product, starts working within a few days.</li>
      <li>I love the whole LifeCell Line!</li>
      <li>--- All my life I&#x27;ve been a high dollar shopper and had to have the best and most expensive products out there.</li>
      <li>Life Cell is just really really marketing their products right now and have been, and people like myself buy it!</li>
      <li>Notice a real difference in around eyes.  </li>
      <li>and it was beginning to really bother me...</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I have paid much less for better products.</li>
      <li>I have been using Lifecell for the past year and a half and have great results.</li>
      <li>this was a huge waste of money</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old and people say I look like I&#x27;m 50.</li>
      <li>after 2wks of using this life cell under eye treatment my bags have completely gone....</li>
      <li>Easily absorbed in the skin, a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>People with sensitive eyes will possibly get red and dark irritated under their eyes from this new product.</li>
      <li>Even though I am not allergic to them, I get a slight burn in the application of almost every eye cream, but LifeCell Under Eye Anti-Aging Treatment is very soothing always.&lt;br /&gt;S.Beeler</li>

<li> Not anymore effective than less expensive products claiming to do the same thing!</li>
<li> Remember, sensitive eyes, dark circles?</li>
<li> Walmart, Loreal it&#x27;s in a white pot eye cream for dark circles and puffyness</li>
<li> And the other one has caffine in it also.</li>
<li> I love the cold metal applicator!</li>
<li> I have purchased other under eye skincare.</li>
<li> Not sure if I like it.  </li>
<li> But the redness is no good!</li>
<li> Silly, doesn&#x27;t make a difference in how the product works....</li>
<li> Sorry Life cell</li>
<li> I do like this product although it&#x27;s terribly expensive.  </li>
<li> I am going to try it cold, see if that makes a difference????</li>
<li> I had bad bags under my eyes for a while</li>

    <li> Edel H....did not work</li>
    <li> All it did for me is make my eyes puffy.</li>
    <li> dis not work for me. can i send back for refund</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I love the cold metal applicator!</li>
    <li> Notice a real difference in around eyes.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.  I love the whole LifeCell Line!</li>
    <li> this was a totally ineffective product. I have, in my business, tested skin products for years- this was a huge waste of money</li>
    <li> I have been using Lifecell for the past year and a half and have great results. I&#x27;m 70 years old and people say I look like I&#x27;m 50.</li>
    <li> Did not come out because it did not work on my phone. Correctly refunded the price, however, so be deprived of Brooklyn cream arrival.</li>
    <li> Has done nothing for my wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Not anymore effective than less expensive products claiming to do the same thing!</li>
    <li> Sorry Life cell but it&#x27;s over rated!! People with sensitive eyes will possibly get red and dark irritated under their eyes from this new product. I guess it might help with lines??? But the redness is no good! And making my eyes look darker I don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s in my refrigerator now and I am going to try it cold, see if that makes a difference???? Hummm....--- All my life I&#x27;ve been a high dollar shopper and had to have the best and most expensive products out there. But I have learned through the years and trial and error that you can find some pretty darn good products at Walmart and target, CVS, the lower inexpensive lines YES! believe it or not, I have fought it time and time again. But it is the truth!!! The metal tip applicator is just a gimmick! I&#x27;ve seen it before on products. Silly, doesn&#x27;t make a difference in how the product works....Life Cell is just really really marketing their products right now and have been, and people like myself buy it! Because it &amp;#34;sounds&amp;#34; so good. Remember, sensitive eyes, dark circles? Walmart, Loreal it&#x27;s in a white pot eye cream for dark circles and puffyness, it&#x27;s a winner, top and underneath the eye both. Skin Cell you can only put underneath the eye. And the other one has caffine in it also. which is good.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do it for me. I have paid much less for better products.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I like it.  May have caused some eye irritation.  Stopped using it for a while and haven&#x27;t restarted it yet to see if it was the problem or something else.</li>
    <li> I had bad bags under my eyes for a while and it was beginning to really bother me...after 2wks of using this life cell under eye treatment my bags have completely gone....i have been a happy girl !!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It feels very cool and soothing when applied.  I have purchased other under eye skincare.

    <li> Awesome product, starts working within a few days.</li>
    <li> The item looks very different than this picture. It seems not working for me, for such a big price, .......,</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed in the skin, a little goes a long way.  I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I do like this product although it&#x27;s terribly expensive.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she absolutely&lt;br /&gt;loves it!!!!!!</li>
