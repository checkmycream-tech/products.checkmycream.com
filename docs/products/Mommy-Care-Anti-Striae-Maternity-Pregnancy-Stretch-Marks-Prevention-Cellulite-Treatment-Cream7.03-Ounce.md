      <li>Used it during my pregnant and i didn&#x27;t get any stretch mark.  </li>
      <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t have marks there</li>
      <li>My belly is growing very fast, but I don&#x27; t have stretch marks!</li>
      <li>So from my experience, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost, went though about 5 bottles in 4 months.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cream for my pregnant wife, the cream is OK, but it seems there was only 50% of announced 200 ml.</li>
      <li>Everything was great up until I got to week 36 on my pregnancy when upper part of my legs started itching and got covered in stretch marks a couple of days later.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first pregnancy, and my mother had stretch marks when she had</li>
      <li>But if i planned more I would definitely buy this again.</li>
      <li>I didnt buy more because i had to order online and used an all oil based one I could buy locally.</li>
      <li>/&gt;During my first pregnancy I was using Palmers Cocoa Butter Lotion for Stretch Marks.</li>
      <li>on my first pregnancy i didn&#x27;t do anything about the stretch marks and ended up getting them about a week before i went into labor.</li>
      <li>The first pregnancy, I just used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; lotion like shea butter or cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>and I think really helped keep the stretch marks away!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I ran out of this lotion fairly quickly and felt it was priced a too high for what it was.</li>
      <li>I got pregnant for the second time I decided to make a better research on a stretch mark creams because I knew I have sensitive type of skin and most likely will have additional marks on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think this product is worth it &amp; would highly recommend it to all expecting moms.</li>
      <li>Absorbs pretty fast and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>Smells good, goes a long way; would definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money.</li>
      <li>And for me, it really seemed to work.</li>
      <li>I kept my faith even though I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
      <li>I used it sparely but often, and massaged it very intensively into my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft, pretty elastic, not itchy</li>
      <li>I am pregnant with my 3rd and have been lucky to not have any stretch marks in my prior pregnancies.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 5 months now, I am currently 30 weeks pregnant and do not have one stretch mark.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes that this lotion would keep stretch marks away</li>
      <li>i think i stretched more using this than i did my last pregnancy just using vitamin e oil</li>
      <li>After I gave birth and milk started coming my breasts got covered in stretch marks COMPLETELY!</li>
      <li>am now 38 weeks pregnant and have no new stretch marks!</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the smell, it is light and subtle compared to other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>- I would say in large part because I used this product daily.</li>
      <li>if you have a sensitive nose (or stomach) maybe look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ve been using it since 4 months pregnant.so far I don&#x27;t see any stretch mark and not too sticky.</li>
      <li>no stretch marks so far.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind, I gained weight slowly and ate a healthy diet.  </li>
      <li>Besides, if it actually helps tone down the stretch marks, it is completely worth it!</li>
      <li>I got one single stretch mark my whole pregnancy</li>
      <li>Not a single one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this product and I started to use it since week 13 and so far no new stretch marks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this cream before I knew that stretch marks were hereditary. If you want to prevent stretch marks, talk to your mom and pray that she didn&#x27;t have them. (Same with varicose/spider veins, by the way) but I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers said this product has a &amp;#34;pleasant smell&amp;#34; but I disagree. It&#x27;s not awful, but to me it&#x27;s not that great either. As a lotion, it&#x27;s ok. Absorbs pretty fast and is not greasy. But stuff is expensive, too! And I feel like I could have spent that money on baby stuff...or at least a massage for momma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not trying to trash talk those who like this product, so please don&#x27;t hate in the comments. It just didn&#x27;t work out for me. :-(</li>
    <li> For me, the cream lasted about two months.  I&#x27;m currently in my 2nd trimester and I plan on keep using them.  Even some of the stretch marks I had prior to pregnancy have been disapparing.  Loving it so far!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 6 months. Now, I am 8 months pregrent. My belly is growing very fast, but I don&#x27; t have stretch marks! This cream really works!!!</li>
    <li> saw no improvemnet nor prevention of stretch marks from forming at all. i think i stretched more using this than i did my last pregnancy just using vitamin e oil</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0049CEVRI Maternity Stretch Marks Prevention Cream Anti Striae]] I really LOVE this product! It helped a lot by preventing stretch marks on my second pregnancy. on my first pregnancy i didn&#x27;t do anything about the stretch marks and ended up getting them about a week before i went into labor. they were so bad that i had to try and stop it from becoming worse on my second time around. Anti Striae by mommy care did the job!</li>
    <li> Very good, works  great</li>
    <li> When I first bought this lotion I thought I was crazy for spending this much money on a bottle, but 3 bottles and no stretch marks later and I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money. It smells great, is organic and gets the job done. My husband even started sneaking some in because he liked the texture of it! I had to make him stop since a dollop of it is equivalent to the price of gold! Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently 32 weeks &amp; have been using the cream throughout my pregnancy. Everywhere I go people comment about &amp;#34;how big my baby is going to be&amp;#34; basically their way of telling me I&#x27;m huge, but I still haven&#x27;t seen any signs if stretch marks!! I think this product is worth it &amp; would highly recommend it to all expecting moms.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing, it has a  nice smell, nothing like the cocoa butter smell (I hate the cocoa butter cream smell. My skin feels great and no stretch marks so far. Buying another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful. I love the scent so much, and my skin did feel better. I used it sparely but often, and massaged it very intensively into my skin. It helped. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all my mommy friends. I tried a LOT of other lotions and this one was the best. Went on easily, non greasy, absorbs quickly. Light scent. Not sticky at all. And for me, it really seemed to work. I got one single stretch mark my whole pregnancy and it is pretty much very light - I would say in large part because I used this product daily. I think I used about 3-4 bottles over the duration of my pregnancy. But you should also use it afterwards as well. I know a lot of girls who got stretch marks AFTER they had the baby. Crazy, right?</li>
    <li> Started using this lotion twice a day starting at 5 months. Keep in mind, I gained weight slowly and ate a healthy diet.  Zero stretchmarks! Worth the cost, went though about 5 bottles in 4 months.</li>
    <li> love it ♥&lt;br /&gt;the best pregnancy cream !!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It has kept my skin smooth and flawless thus far in pregnancy!  It keeps skin hydrated and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling stretchers lotion I have ever smelt! The small is soft and none offensive like a lot of other creams. It received my itchy belly but I&#x27;m not sure if it really helped with my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to all my pregnant friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this cream during my second pregnancy from week 10 or 11.&lt;br /&gt;I am now 38 weeks pregnant and have no new stretch marks! Not a single one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my first pregnancy I was using Palmers Cocoa Butter Lotion for Stretch Marks. Everything was great up until I got to week 36 on my pregnancy when upper part of my legs started itching and got covered in stretch marks a couple of days later.  Now I have not a nice looking legs and but. :((&lt;br /&gt;For my stomach I was using same lotion and some oil that my mother made.  Luckily I don&#x27;t have marks there but I am sure it is not because of that lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This is not the end of my sad story.  After I gave birth and milk started coming my breasts got covered in stretch marks COMPLETELY! After that I realized that I was wasting my time and my money on Palmers Cocoa Butter Lotion.  Sad part is that I can not get rid of those marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got pregnant for the second time I decided to make a better research on a stretch mark creams because I knew I have sensitive type of skin and most likely will have additional marks on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying Anti Striae Maternity Pregnancy Stretch Marks Prevention Anti Cellulite Treatment Cream.&lt;br /&gt;The price is on a medium level. I liked the texture and smell right away so I decided to give it a shot and I am very happy that I did that.&lt;br /&gt;As I stated before I have no new marks, not a single one! My skin is soft, pretty elastic, not itchy so I am not expecting any surprises for now.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review after I&#x27;ll give birth and will have milk but for now I think this one of the best products on the market now.</li>
    <li> I used this at the beginning of my pregnancy.  The smell is very strong, so if you have a sensitive nose (or stomach) maybe look elsewhere. I did like that it was not as greasy compared to other belly balms/creams.</li>
    <li> Used it during my pregnant and i didn&#x27;t get any stretch mark.  It feels good on the skin. I love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream for my pregnant wife, the cream is OK, but it seems there was only 50% of announced 200 ml.</li>
    <li> I am on my second pregnancy. The first pregnancy, I just used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; lotion like shea butter or cocoa butter. I got really bad stretch marks. This pregnancy, I have been using the Anti Stria lotion and my stretch marks are much less noticeable so far (at 31 weeks). It smells good and feels fabulous. I love it! It seems a little expensive at first, but I only use it when I take a shower and it has lasted a long time. Besides, if it actually helps tone down the stretch marks, it is completely worth it!</li>
    <li> Have been using it since 3 months into pregnancy. I kept my faith even though I really don&#x27;t like the smell. But the marks showed up despite I faithfully use it everyday. So from my experience, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago ( I am now at 20weeks of my pregnancy) from the reviews. I don&#x27;t have pregnancy stretch marks YET so I cannot speak on that part. However I can confirm that the product feels good on the belly, smell awesome and reduces the itchiness.</li>
    <li> I ran out of this lotion fairly quickly and felt it was priced a too high for what it was. The tube didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to notice if it helped in preventing stretch marks or not. I enjoyed the smell, it is light and subtle compared to other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought this once to try and I really liked it. Smelled nice not greasy no burning or itching like others that claim they are organic. I didnt buy more because i had to order online and used an all oil based one I could buy locally. But if i planned more I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and I started to use it since week 13 and so far no new stretch marks. It smells really good which for me is a plus. I could comment at the end of the pregnancy to see if it worked.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, it smells good, has smooth consistence and apply gently on the skin. I hope it will be effective too.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this lotion would keep stretch marks away but, it just didnt work for me. It did have a good smell and it would keep my skin moisturized throughout the day. I just wish I didn&#x27;t spend all that money on this ...</li>
    <li> you will note it as soon as you try it the way you feel this cream you will love it I hace ti say that this and the Trilasting are the best in the market.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant with my 3rd and have been lucky to not have any stretch marks in my prior pregnancies.  This product smells so good and feels amazing on my belly.  i am 30 weeks and have gained 20 pounds with NO signs of stretch marks!!! Ordering my 2nd tube as we speak.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Creme throughout my pregnancy and absolutely love it!! It smells so good, and not too creamy or oily ..feels great as you rub it on. I am 35 weeks and don&#x27;t have a stretch mark yet....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 months now, I am currently 30 weeks pregnant and do not have one stretch mark. The cream is thick and smooth and smells great! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 34 weeks pregnant and still no stretch marks :)</li>
    <li> My wife and I both like the light smell and it works well for my pregnant wife, I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This was THE BEST lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! This lasted for 5 months and I think really helped keep the stretch marks away! Smells good, goes a long way; would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She uses it everyday to avoid future stretch marks. Let&#x27;s hope it works (or I&#x27;ll be back to update my review) ;)</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m so pleased with how quickly this product was shipped to me!  I even went out and purchased some other cream to hold me over, but I ended up not needing it, my lotion arrived so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this *almost* every day, twice a day, since 10 weeks (the recommended start on the label).  Like others have mentioned, it smells great, feels great going on, and you can tell that it really does the job.  I am now 23 weeks and no stretch marks so far.  It&#x27;s my first pregnancy, and my mother had stretch marks when she had me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to Europe for a business trip a few weeks ago, I neglected to put my cream into my luggage which was going to be checked in.  The office at Manchester airport saw the cream in my backpack and said, \\&quot;No, you can&#x27;t take this.\\&quot;  I was so bummed.  I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a replacement for the remaining week of my trip.  I ended up getting some Vichy cream in Paris, but the texture wasn&#x27;t as good, nor did it smell very good.  So I used that for 3 weeks (didn&#x27;t want to waste it), but now I&#x27;ve got my Mommy Care cream back and I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely update this at the end of my pregnancy to report on the stretch marks, if any, then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and i&#x27;ve been using it since 4 months pregnant.so far I don&#x27;t see any stretch mark and not too sticky.</li>
    <li> The smell is good.&lt;br /&gt;I have been used it since about 20 weeks, and i am 32 weeks, no stretch marks, will continue using it.</li>
