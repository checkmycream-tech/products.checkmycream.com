      <li>I have nothing else I can say until I use more of this product.</li>
      <li>it mentions that you are able to apply it while wearing a weave.</li>
      <li>This works like magic.</li>
      <li>Magic, magic, magic is all I can say.</li>
      <li>and I was so excited!</li>
      <li>My 2 star rating is partially because the way the product was received pack and condition was excellent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken a series of pictures to make sure I&#x27;m seeing what I&#x27;m seeing, and it really is quite extraordinary!</li>
      <li>I put the Protective on my nightstand to ensure that it was the first thing I did when I awoke, and also applied it right before I laid to bed.</li>
      <li>The significantly balding area is quickly receding and at this rate, will have full hair coverage by the end of the 2nd month.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t buy my first from Amazon.</li>
      <li>By the first month, I noticed lots of improvement.</li>
      <li>But the first time I tried this, I was amazed.</li>
      <li>I seen results within the first month.</li>
      <li>An it isnt true as the product states that to receive better results to purchase the other products.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say stopped using it</li>
      <li>I noticed real results when I used this.</li>
      <li>the price I would highly recommend this product (although it does seem to have doubled in a month</li>
      <li>so I prepared myself for disappointment pretty much, however, I started seeing a SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HAIR GROWTH IN ONE WEEK!!!</li>
      <li>A week later I am able to easily pinch hair that is close to half an inch long.</li>
      <li>Now 18 months after cancer surgeries have been completed, have started to use the product again and to my amazement, it is working extremely well and quickly after just 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>I can actually SEE the hair filling in and the hair around the braids is busting out the edges Much thicker and softer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>NOW remember I said that the edges of my head have had bald patches for over 10 years; I NEVER expected to Ever see hair there again!</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work since nothing else did, but I have to say I was wrong.</li>
      <li>Then a few years later, I&#x27;ve tried it again and the results are not as evident.</li>
      <li>but it  is extremely thin, breaks easy, and I have bald spots along my hairline.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product was received in good condition, don&#x27;t use it every day but for the timeframe I have been using it I have not seen a difference in my hairline. I would not re-order or recommend this product because I have not seen any improvement. My 2 star rating is partially because the way the product was received pack and condition was excellent.</li>
    <li> When you use a productm you can  tell if its benefitting for reason you bought  it for! Just like I was using something be using! But I stop that too.</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of my hair over four years ago due to constant box braids and a lot of bad relaxers. It has grown back over the years but it  is extremely thin, breaks easy, and I have bald spots along my hairline. I have tried just about everything to make it grow back, but the results were minimal. I had just about given up, until, I read the reviews about this product line. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work since nothing else did, but I have to say I was wrong. In just two weeks of using this product, my bald spots are filling in and my hair is getting thicker. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair will look like two months from now. I say this is a life saver because when I lost my hair I lost a lot my self confidence. I had to wear a lot of bad weaves and wigs, just to cover up my shame. I can finally be the woman I once was. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews..but I wrote this one just to reach out to anyone who has gone through what I have, don&#x27;t lose hope try this product line! Thank you profectiv you changed my life!</li>
    <li> I am waiting to see the results for this product, it will take a while. I have nothing else I can say until I use more of this product.</li>
    <li> I started having bad headaches stopped using. Giving to my sister as always. Can&#x27;t really say stopped using it hummm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 3 months and it&#x27;s working as expected. I have damage due to clip in extensions and have been using this to help regrow the hair loss. I think it took about a month for me to start noticing regrowth and I was so excited! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> After 4 week I start to see  my hair growing. I wll reorder again...I will post again in a month</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of months, and did not notice a change in my hair texture, or thinning or thickness.  My edges never improved. I hate products that do not deliver.</li>
    <li> This works like magic. I&#x27;m on my 3rd pack. Didn&#x27;t buy my first from Amazon. By the first month, I noticed lots of improvement. Won&#x27;t stop using this product until it&#x27;s out of production. This is definitely a 5 star. Magic, magic, magic is all I can say.</li>
    <li> The product works well you just have to be patient with your results. An it isnt true as the product states that to receive better results to purchase the other products.</li>
    <li> You see results within a few weeks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product for thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve tried others and they don&#x27;t compare!  It was received when promised..</li>
    <li> First of all, finding this in stores is almost impossible. My girlfriend and her mom loves this stuff and have ordered it numerous times</li>
    <li> The claim of this product is false no matter what I do with it.  I dis like the smell also</li>
    <li> Have noted that it helps my hair grow back in rapidly, however have to continue using it for the effect to continue. 2012  January 2015 product review update: Product stopped working and so stopped using it. Eventually, found out that I had a recurrence of cancer!! :( Now 18 months after cancer surgeries have been completed, have started to use the product again and to my amazement, it is working extremely well and quickly after just 4 weeks. The significantly balding area is quickly receding and at this rate, will have full hair coverage by the end of the 2nd month. I&#x27;ve taken a series of pictures to make sure I&#x27;m seeing what I&#x27;m seeing, and it really is quite extraordinary! At this rate, I will not need the wigs I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
    <li> At least the first time. I noticed real results when I used this. Then a few years later, I&#x27;ve tried it again and the results are not as evident. That may be due to the damage I&#x27;ve done to my hair/scalp. But the first time I tried this, I was amazed.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing hair weaves for over 15 years. I noticed my hair starting to thin and then go completely BALD at the ages over 10 years ago! In my teens it wasn&#x27;t a big deal because my arrogance would say &amp;#34;I&#x27; don&#x27;t care if it falls out. I&#x27;ll just buy more hair.&amp;#34; Until I pulled my tracks out at 33 and realized that underneath my weave I now look like a damn reversed George Jefferson!! I mean... No Hair! And what I had left was hanging on by a thread.&lt;br /&gt;When I first purchased this product it mentions that you are able to apply it while wearing a weave. I found that I wasn&#x27;t as motivated to use it twice daily as recommended. I happened to get irritated with the weave one day and decided to put my hair in braids. I put the Protective on my nightstand to ensure that it was the first thing I did when I awoke, and also applied it right before I laid to bed. The packaging suggests you may not see results for 6-8 wks so I prepared myself for disappointment pretty much, however, I started seeing a SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HAIR GROWTH IN ONE WEEK!!! NOW remember I said that the edges of my head have had bald patches for over 10 years; I NEVER expected to Ever see hair there again! A week later I am able to easily pinch hair that is close to half an inch long. I can actually SEE the hair filling in and the hair around the braids is busting out the edges Much thicker and softer!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t work for this company, never heard of it until just randomly coming across it on Amazon, and am not advocatingthat it will work for everyone. I have been applying it as directed and can actually feel it tingling my scalp; it is a bit irritating but definitely not unbearable, and in &amp;#34;my case&amp;#34;, Worth It!&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would highly recommend this product (although it does seem to have doubled in a month but hell, even $16 bucks is a steal when you&#x27;re a bald female! Lmao) But seriously, with the results I&#x27;m seeing in one week, I think 6mos of this product and braids will save me from wasting my retirement money on a lifetime supply of wigs!  Lolll save me from wasting my retirement money on a lifetime supply of wigs!  Lol</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! It exceeds my expectations! You will see results with continuous use. I seen results within the first month.</li>
