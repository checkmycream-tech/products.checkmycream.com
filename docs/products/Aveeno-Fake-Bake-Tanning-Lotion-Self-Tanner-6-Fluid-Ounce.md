<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using tanning beds my whole life and worked at one for many years. I am noticing wrinkles already and so I am quitting and have been using fake tanners. None of them last very long and just come off in the shower or just from sweating when it&#x27;s humid. Once was wearing white shorts. It was traumatizing to say the least. I heard of fake bake alonggg time ago and decided to finally try it. I AM HOOKED. I tan pretty easily but it still takes a while to get the color I want. I got it in one day with this stuff. No streaks at all. No orange elbows. Just a perfect dark brown. The pic might not look as even bc of lighting but it is!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! great color, easy application.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve used several types over the years and this one leaves me with the most authentic looking tan. I&#x27;m pale, freckly, and red-headed, and this can make me look like I have a natural tan (I promise)! The only thing is the smell isn&#x27;t lovely, but I mix mine with some lotion (you can use scented but I prefer un-scented) and it tones down the smell. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 8 years.  I have very pale skin.  I don&#x27;t get a tan very easily.  So, for what this product does.. it&#x27;s GREAT for me.  It&#x27;s the most natural looking tan from a bottle I&#x27;ve ever had.  I get compliments too.  I will deal with the messy sheets and applications with gloves.  It&#x27;s better than the alternative!  I would highly recommend using the Skin Smoothie (the orange spray), and even a good exfoliator as well.  Maybe start out with the pack, it&#x27;s worth the money, and that stuff lasts a long time.  I don&#x27;t recommend stocking up on the lotion if you don&#x27;t plan on using it, because it WILL go bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless tanners since I was a sophomore in high school because I&#x27;m naturally light skinned. Not too fair, but not dark enough for my liking. I tried Fake Bake&#x27;s lotion and mousse, and neither exceeded my expectations. The tanner didn&#x27;t apply as nicely as I would have liked. The mousse, however, gave me instant color. Neither lasted more than a couple days, even with moisturizing twice a day. Definitely better tanners out there.</li>
    <li> Product seemed old and was green.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase the fake bake spray and just wanted to see if smoothing the lotion on would be easier... Bad idea!  Had to use almost half of a bottle to get the color out put of just a little bit of the spray version.  The coloring is also no where nears as natural looking as the spray.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Fake Bake! I am  very fair skinned but this product does not  dry too dark, I actually use 2 coats upon initial application.  In my opinion,  the lotion lasts longer and applies more evenly than the Fake Bake Spray.  I can get at least 4 days between applications before I start to notice any fading as opposed to  2 days with any other self tanning sprays.  I would recommend this product to all of my fellow pastey mamas out there!</li>
    <li> I ended up giving this to my sister. The product works, but it was messy to apply. The color didn&#x27;t last very long, and it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to reapply.</li>
    <li> This can be messy to apply but gives me a real tan that last for 3 to 5 days. I have been using it for years. I just always use gloves &amp; apply before bed and It evenly washes off and I am left with a tan. Don&#x27;t worry about streaking. I just quickly apply and it will wash off even. Works best if I have been in the sun just a couple of times before use and I am very fair. It works either way but it bumps up my tan the most if I have a little sun to go with it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. I would never use another! I highly recommend Fake Bake.</li>
    <li> I live in the Sunshine state but can not sit in the blazing sun to get a nice color.  I have used a lot of products over the years and I like Fake Bake better than any of them. It is very thick so I put some in a bowl. I was advised to use a two inch brush for application. That works great.  It does spread the lotion evenly. I am a large person but I used very little and looked great. Put a plastic wrap over the bowl and it keeps.   The color is not orange.  It is much like a South Florida tan.  Sexy, don&#x27;t you know. Bathing or showering does not seem to have any effect but oil or heavy lotions are a no no. Weakens or removes the color. I bought two bottles and am glad that I did.  Thanks to Fake Bake I will be tan all year.</li>
    <li> I have tried many self-tanners and without a doubt this is the very best one out there. No smell, dries fast, lasts as long as a real tan and can be reapplied for depth. Amazon has the best price too. This has an organic ingredient that brings your own melanin to the surface which is why it looks so natural.</li>
    <li> This tanner was very easy to apply and did not make skin look at all orange or leave streaks  used it on my feet and it looked 100% natural  Everyone thought it was a real tan. I did not use it on my face.</li>
    <li> Great buy, I have used this for years, none better. Thanks for speedy ship and great pricing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and if you have fair skin, this is the MOST realistic tan ever.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used, and have tried many over the years. It dries quickly, does not rub off on my clothes, and, best of all, it looks NATURAL. No streaking, no splotches, just nice even tanned looking skin. Price is not an issue as a little goes a long way. No orange &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; look to it at all. This is not your mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;QT&amp;#34;. Awesome product, and will keep ordering it as long as they keep making it. I may even use it all winter it looks so good!</li>
    <li> This is the first and only self tanner that went on without streaking, gave me a nice brown instead of orange color, and didn&#x27;t show up dirty and dark on m elbows, knees, feet and ankles! I have never had a fake tan this good and it was sooo easy. Yea, it does make you smell, so definitely do it before bed or when you wont be going anywhere, but all of the other self tanners smell too. It&#x27;s definitely worth it for the fabulous color!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Fake Bake. I buy it every year!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. I&#x27;ve noticed such great reviews so I finally decided to purchase this. 2 words...LOVE IT! I will definitely purchase again. The smell may not be too pleasant but I don&#x27;t really mind. It looks like a natural tan :)</li>
    <li> Best tanner on the market! Gives the most realistic color and easy to use, color with one application. Wouldn&#x27;t spend a summer without it!</li>
    <li> Fake Bake products are my favorite!  I have had melanoma so cannot be in the sun but like the look of a tan.  This result is better than any spray tan or other product I have tried.  I use this as well as the Fake Bake Flawless and really like the result.</li>
    <li> This product has worked great for me for over 2 years.  It&#x27;s a good deal to purchase it online and put it on yourself.  The salon&#x27;s that do spray tans use this and charge people $50 for one spray... you can use this product over many times, so it&#x27;s worth it!  Your skin appears tan and not orange.  It works perfect</li>
    <li> I have used self-tanner for years as well as belonging to tanning salons using spray tanning and fake bake is superior to all other methods I have tried!</li>
    <li> Takes way to long to do this.  The stain it made on my sheets and does not come out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I would say it is only splotchy if you don&#x27;t apply it correctly. I always put regular lotion on my feet, knees, elbows before applying to get a smoother outcome. I like to use both this and the spray. The lotion does not smell as bad as the spray.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner out there no smell dries fast and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes</li>
    <li> This product did decent as far as my being able to tell a difference within just an hour or so. But it is very messy and its very time consuming. It takes way longer to absorb than other self tanners I&#x27;ve used with very little difference in &#x27;tanning&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Did not have a good experience with this product at all. I have not used a tanning lotion since I first started take tanning (5-7 years ago.) I now use foams from St. Tropez. So when I saw this for a great price I wanted to try it out. Wow was my experience bad. I tried using it with a glove as I did not want oompa-loompa hands, as I used to get from lotion tanners. It went through the glove, unlike foam. And it was so thick and disgusting on my skin and was not absorbing in a short time period like my foam ones do... Not sure if i just got a bad one, but I had to remove the tanner with 2 towels because it was so bad. Haven&#x27;t used it since!</li>
    <li> a little disappointed in product</li>
    <li> I love this product, the best self tanner I have used. Smells weird but I have gotten use to it</li>
    <li> I have used this for years because you can see it as you put it on, it does not look orange or fake, it does not damage your skin like the sun, it makes your teeth look whiter, and gives you a healthy sunkissed glow....and that is what we all want!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  A little goes a long way and it looks very natural :0)</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Fake Bake&#x27;s Flawless tanning spray. My husband&#x27;s skin is fairly pale, so I thought I would try the original Fake Bake for him, hoping the tan would turn out a little more subtle. We recently went on a cruise to Mexico, and he wanted to have a little bit of color before we left. I put the lotion on him a couple nights before we left, and I assured him that he would have a great tan by morning. The tan came out more subtle than I had expected, so we applied a second application the next night. After the second application, my husband finally looked like he had a tan, although it was a bit more orange-y than I thought it would be. Fake Bake Flawless has always turned out very brown and natural looking, but this one was slightly more orange than I would prefer. The color was definitely better than a lot of other products I have previously tried. My husband did receive compliments on his tan from my family and he was happy with it. In the future, I will continue to purchase Flawless.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff except it tints my hands a little but i don&#x27;t mind.  best fake tan i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Overall, it was an ok product. I&#x27;m new to self tanning and still haven&#x27;t found the perfect one. I tried Fake Bake, I love the color indicator which helps you see where you&#x27;ve put the product but it gets EVERYWHERE! Rubbed off all over my sheets and pillow (it does wash off). Also, after you take a shower the color indicator washes off and the color wasn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d hope. If you&#x27;re looking for a light \\&quot;glow\\&quot; you make like the product. But even after 3 or 4 applications, it still wasn&#x27;t dark (i&#x27;m light-medium toned). I also started getting the \\&quot;lizard\\&quot; effect while it was fading. Overall, it just ended up being too much work to maintain... still looking for the perfect one...</li>
    <li> Dis not like the results.  Turned gteen within 6 months</li>
    <li> No one knows its a fake tan!!! OMG this stuff is the bomb! I look like I&#x27;ve been tanning, it doesnt leave a streaky or orange look at all!! I&#x27;m officially going to continue to&lt;br /&gt;buy this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two years and by far exceeds any other self tanner on the market. No streaking and the tinted color helps guide one on application. They have even provided handy gloves to keep from tinting ones hands. Oh, if there is product left at the end of the season just pop it in the fridge to preserve it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several tanning lotions and this one is by far the best! I&#x27;m very fair and this lotion doesn&#x27;t streak or turn ORANGE on my skin. This was a huge drawback from other lotions. I exfoliate first in the shower, then I apply vasoline  on dry spots( elbows,knees,toes,outer edge of foot,hands) and then apply the lotion. If you are looking for a deeper tan, then apply 2-3 days in a row. It usually lasts about a week if you don&#x27;t exfoliate daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self tanners and this one is worth writing about.&lt;br /&gt;The end result is by far the best I&#x27;ve experienced, the color looks very natural and even. I&#x27;m fair skinned, and no orange!&lt;br /&gt;The application process is messy though-- the color of the product is very dark (espresso), and if you don&#x27;t wear the gloves that are provided, you will have a hard time washing the palms of your hands. It has that usual self tanner odor, but it does go away after you shower. If you apply Fake Bake before bed, you will need to change your sheets. Follow the directions and you will have a very pretty tan that will last several days.</li>
    <li> This item comes with plastic gloves, so it is meant for people who want a serious tan and are willing to spend time accomplishing &amp;#34;the look&amp;#34;.  I just wanted something that would give a glow to my skin and that I could administer quickly.  I gave it to Good Will.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of years now.  I prefer not to do tanning beds and want the brown legs for summer!  One application and you are instantly tanned!  Do wear the gloves and refrain from white clothing.  This can stain.  I prefer to shower and then apply....let dry and then dress.  If you apply a small amount daily it works great.  No streaking and looks very natural</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of this product. It smelled awful and got EVERYWHERE even after 2 hours after application. I was very disappointed in this because the product rinsed right off and was splotchy. In my opinion I would say do not buy this product. Despite the smell and lack of results I kept reapplying everyday for a week and still it left little to no results. I have fair skin and this did nothing for me. I was very sad this did not work out as expected if you have a strong nose and hate things that make your skin smell like a garbage can do not buy this. My experience may be different than most but who knows maybe I just got the bad one of the bunch. I usually love Aveeno but this product not so much. If you must try this than test out the spray Fake Bake instead and USE GLOVES.</li>
    <li> Realistic color and no offending odor.</li>
    <li> Great color for instand tan. You put on as much as you like for as dark as you want. It gives a real look and makes your skin feel soft, but it does wash off in the shower/bath.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for a couple of years ,when I do not get sun and use this it looks&lt;br /&gt;nice  UPDATE ..this last order i used the lotion and after a couple of days i turned orange&lt;br /&gt;so I dont know if my skin changed or the lotion  .I Love the face one it works very well</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t mess around, you have color at the first application. Be careful how you apply. It&#x27;s a natural looking color and lasts through many showers. Love it.</li>
    <li> nothing better that I have found on the market!</li>
    <li> I used to love the Fake Bake Flawless Darker spray, but this is just as good! it&#x27;s a beautiful olive color. the only reason I am giving it a four is because the lotion is a tad on the runny side, so if you&#x27;t not careful too much dumps out of the bottle (which has happened to me quite a bit), but it&#x27;s a great quality self-tanner!! Also, the smell is kind of gross, but there is pain in beauty, right??</li>
    <li> nice color, nice product, My only complaint is that it comes off and gets everywhere, Than more comes off in the shower but after the shower some stays on. Might buy more...</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is very effective.  I get asked all the time if I have been to the beach!!  Very easy to apply.  No sun for me ever again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and am always looking to be tan safely have used probably 30 different self tanners in the last few year&#x27;s I have spent anywhere from 10-50 dollars on different products and this one is AMAZING, I can&#x27;t believe it took so long to find it. It goes on very dark so it&#x27;s nearly impossible to have streaks. It will leave your hands dark if you don&#x27;t wear gloves but if you scrub well after It dries just fine. I HIGHLY suggest this.</li>
    <li> Bought this one also for my daughter, she was going on vacation and did not want to look pale, she loves Fake Bake</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter likes this self tanner.  It seems to work well. She does not look like she has a fake tanN Disposable gloves are needed to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Easy to apply and leaves a wonderful light tan color.  I use at night and let it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; overnight.  If you want a darker color, you will to reapply the next night.  A lot of tanners have a nasty smell, even after showering but this is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> It all seems to wash off.</li>
    <li> The product was okay. It doesn&#x27;t stay on and will rub off on your clothes although it does wash out. I&#x27;ll pay a little more for St Tropez because I know it works for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner out there. I have using self tanner for years since I am sooo pale and never tan just burn and peel.  Lots turn orange and streak and its uneven. this is the absolute best self tanner out there and all is will ever use. I am totally hooked!</li>
    <li> This stuff is like a miracle. So much better than any I&#x27;ve ever used. Just make sure if you don&#x27;t have a mitt that you have rubber gloves!!  Great price too and it doesn&#x27;t wear off weird like a spray tan does.</li>
    <li> I liked this tanning lotion even though I was afraid to use it after reading about the staining issues, which by the way, I didn&#x27;t notice since I sleep in sweats and long sleeved tops that are dark in color. The nice brown color you get immediately upon use (it&#x27;s there as a guide so you don&#x27;t miss spots) is really nice...you could go out right after if you wanted. I also thought it had a very light, pleasant scent. But wearing gloves is an absolute must...I didn&#x27;t believe it would stain so fast, so when I got to my face, I took off the gloves and sure enough, it stained my hands within a minute! I had no bad skin reactions from using this except is seemed to dry my skin; using a good lotion for days afterwards is helpful. I have a slight yellowish tone to my skin so the brown I got once some of it rinsed off the next day was a bit more yellow/orange than I had hoped, but I think getting a little natural sun with this will make it look perfect. I highly recommend this and am thrilled with the price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> have used this product for years with good success</li>
    <li> I use to use this all the time however the product has changed.  I put it on and it smears, hard to get it on evenly.  The next day I had a somewhat orange color to my skin. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Easy application and natural results... fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for over 30 years. I&#x27;ve tried them all from the beginning. The last one I used religiously was Zia but they stopped making it so I was forced to look for another self tanner. This has the best color hands down. It&#x27;s messier to use but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s not that bad. Just have some old washcloths or towels on hand and make sure you&#x27;re gloves fit. Although I do appreciate the gloves they give you, they are a tad too large for me which gives you lines and streaks from the wrinkles in the gloves. If this is your case, I suggest going to the local beauty supply and getting a box of gloves that are your size. It really makes a difference. I also do a light lotion underneath on my legs first but make sure it&#x27;s dry. Having a fan in the bathroom really helps, especially in the hot summer when you&#x27;re sweating as you&#x27;re applying which can really jack up a fake tan. I lotion my feet also and and use just a dab of Fakebake or a &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; self tanner on the tops and feather down into the ankle area. Same with the tops of the hands. I do those last after I&#x27;ve taken off my gloves and washed my hands. Using the top of one hand I blend down onto the other hand and vice versa. Take a  damp Q Tip and wipe the knuckle areas off to avoid any dark lines and also around those old neck rings. Lastly, to avoid any rubbed off white spots in front of the arm at the elbow (we call them kites because of their triangular shape!) or back of the knee use some body powder. It really helps to keep it  dry as the color is developing.</li>
    <li> loses efficacy after being opened for a week or more.</li>
    <li> A little messy but the best color I have found</li>
    <li> Love this product. By far the best self tanner on the market. I like that it is a cruelty free product. Use it several times before you give up on it. You will be able to get past the smell, and texture of the liquid. The tan you will be able to achieve will be worth the trials and errors.</li>
    <li> Not a good choice if you&#x27;re going out in rain or humidity....This self tanner literally lays on top of your skin,It does not stain the skin what so ever....It rubs off on all of your clothes and rolls off of your skin the instant water touches it....I will never purchase this stuff again.Was a waist of money!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanner out there! The smell is not bad compared to others. The color is beautiful and everyone always thinks I went away. Not orange or streaky! So easy to apply and dries quickly. Others cannot compare!</li>
    <li> I always use Fake Bake Tanning Lotion and I&#x27;ve only had positive experiences with it. I apply the lotion to my face and body after exfoliating my skin in the shower and before going to bed. The color has always been even and never streaky. My sensitive facial skin does not react negatively to the tanner. The color guide helps when applying the product and washes off in the morning and a nice, glowing tan stays. The tan does not look neither fake nor orange, but like a week of vacation somewhere nice. I am very pleased; excellent product for little money. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001183N8G Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion, 6-Ounces]]I liike this product - it does give a nice tan - be very careful and use gloves.  It&#x27;s messy to use.</li>
    <li> I used this on myself before I got married. Now, I did get a little color, but I had to spend hours drenched in this goo. It got all over everything!&lt;br /&gt;It did give me a nice little base, but the effort was ridiculous. I had to scrub in certain areas...daily... where it decided to be darker!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re willing to try it, please use it a week before your event because it does leave deposits on your skin. This way, you&#x27;ll have time to scrub everyday on those areas.</li>
    <li> Great looks natural ! I use it on my face and haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it got SO many rave reviews, however, I personally do not care for it.  I used it only on my lower legs and feet because I wanted to see the difference it might make.  Was not impressed at all.  I followed the instructions and used it lightly on my feet, however, after rinsing it off the following morning, my legs and especially feet look quite orange and dirty, and splotchy in places.  I&#x27;ve used other cheaper products from drugstores that gave much better natural results with no streaking or splotches at all.  So disappointed with Fake Bake!</li>
    <li> It works great.. You don&#x27;t turn orange with this product</li>
    <li> Love the fake tan.  Looks natural.</li>
    <li> Just go get a spray tan. This stuff is as hard as heck to put on urself. It doesnt darken your skin but not significantly. Would be good to use in between spray tans i guess.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I&#x27;ve used. Good tan color, not orange, in 4-6 hours. The dark color of the lotion makes it easier to see where you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
    <li> Have to be careful but it&#x27;s awesome for a quick color. Would recommend this product to all my friends. Thanks</li>
    <li> Best tanner out there!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Provides natural tan appearance. Apply night before, lasts 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> This is the Best fake tan I&#x27;ve ever had. No streaks ,easy to apply. I just love it. You won&#x27;t go wrong using this.</li>
    <li> It was better than I have ever used BUT if you have freckles on your skin it tends show them more clearly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to rate this product. My skin is not perfect, and no matter what product I use to make it nice and smooth I can never completely achieve the wanted results. Because of that issue this Fake Bake self-tanning lotion didn&#x27;t work for me. Unfortunately, every little imperfection was accentuated/darkened by it. I won&#x27;t use this product again (nor any other self-tanning product), but I would probably recommend it to people with flawless skin.</li>
    <li> I have used many self tanners and even spray tanning booths. This product by far gives the most natural look when used properly. Always use the gloves that come with lotion and rub in until even then wipe areas that tend to &#x27;collect&#x27; self tanner, knees, elbows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Do not be afraid of how &#x27;dark&#x27; lotion appears, it just helps so you can see it as you apply it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible..I sent it back!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that great to me.  It has a thick, heavy consistency that takes a long time to dry. I would not recomend putting it on if you are in a hurry to get dressed (the Fake Bake Mousse is a better choice-it dries quickly) or going to something where you are wearing dress clothes because it (like every other self tanner) will rub off on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, which sounds somewhat negative (just being honest), if you want a product that works, looks great, and lasts this is it. I have dry skin, and when I use this product it makes my skin feel great-because of it&#x27;s consistency I don&#x27;t know how  it would do for someone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love fake bake products! My skin is very fair - like look at all those blue veins,  pale. Fake bake is the only product I have found to give me a tan, without spots, streaks, or turning me into an orange oompa loompa. I hate the smell, and having to soak in it all night, but when you wake up in the morning and rinse off, you will be 100% satisfied with your new color. The color will last all week too. To get the dark tan I desire, I will put this product on for 3 days in a row, then I will put it on once a week to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot handle leaving this product on over night, it is not for you. BUT if you&#x27;re ready to trade in the vampire skin, you&#x27;ll love fake bake.</li>
    <li> Product seemed like it was old, had a bad smell, and a weird greenish color. Had to throw it out.</li>
