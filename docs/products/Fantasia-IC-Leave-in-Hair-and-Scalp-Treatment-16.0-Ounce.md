Ever since I started using this product, it has improved the condition and overall health of my hair after a few and regular uses immediately after washing hair and pretty much any time.

    <li> I just love this product! It makes my hair soft, shiny and allows my wavy hair to be at its best. It doesn&#x27;t make it limp like some other conditioners do. This company does not test on animals and that was a big plus for me. It is hard to find a product that is not tested on animals that works as well as this one does. My hair looks very healthy and I would be lost without this product!</li>

    <li> Let me start by saying I am a loyal Fantasia IC product fan.  This leave-in and the Pure Tea Shampoo were my first introduction to the Fantasia IC product line many, many years ago.  I absolutely love this hair treatment and the way it makes my hair feel and shine.  It is loaded with healthy ingredients and designed to continue conditioning your hair after leaving it in to provide superior shine/sheen and encourage new growth.  I initially began using it when my hair was relaxed and not color treated.  I currently use it on my semi-permanent color treated below shoulder length natural hair.  The product is designed to work on relaxed, color treated, damaged, dry, bleached, and sun damaged hair.  Make sure you buy the 16 oz bottle which lasts longer.  I buy it now from amazon since my local Sally&#x27;s no longer carries.  This stuff really works!!!!</li>

It makes me want to try it on my own hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent price very satisfied with the quality of the product. i plan to buy again any time soon.</li>
