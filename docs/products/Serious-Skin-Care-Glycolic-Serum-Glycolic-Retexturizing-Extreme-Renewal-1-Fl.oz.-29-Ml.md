    <li> Product works ok, I did not have significant improvement in overall skin texture or appearance.</li>
    <li> I like the product but do not like the packaging. Prefer just a squeeze bottle and no pump.</li>
    <li> The products have done wonders for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Morning Magic is just as the name MAGIC to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serious skincare Glycolic retexuring make my skin feel so fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;KUDOS to both products.</li>
    <li> When used with the glycolic cream it makes the skin much firmer and supple.  Gives a younger and clean skin look.</li>
    <li> Great quality and service. Received it in timely manor. Will buy again from this vendor. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Seems to do what it claims, retexturizes and smoothes out the skin, light tingling sensation upon first few applications. Too intense for me to use every day, I used it every other morning under a moisturizer. Slightly sticky, not too bad..</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum glides on the skin. It dries quickly, too.  I use it twice a day usually, but especially at night under the A Defiance Retinol Night Cream.  My skin feels really soft in the morning. It has a pleasant smell as well, and I am sensitive to fragrances. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for me.  I was looking for something to calm my skin and make it glow.  I am now using an acne cream.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had heard that serums are better for the skin. The skin seems to really like this serum.  It drinks it up and looks firmer.</li>
    <li> I actually use this stuff to control my hormone related adult acne. It is a great exfoliator, and it does a nice job of keeping my skin smooth and clear. I ran out, and I noticed the difference within a few days. My skin started breaking out and was more oily. Great product!</li>
    <li> Works great at exfoliating skin &amp; lightening spots etc. I use this all winer along with the glycolic cream to counteract the damage the sun &amp; hormones do to my skin in the summer. In a few weeks my skin is always smooth &amp; clear.</li>
    <li> Love all the SSC products! If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use everyday. Great for acne prone, older skin.</li>
    <li> The product shipped on time and I like it -  though have not noticed a distinct change in my skin I know that it will over usage. It is a good product.</li>
    <li> As I get older my skin is harder to keep looking good,  but this product works.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Thank you again the shipper so prompt. So very happy I can continue to use a product with out financing it!&lt;br /&gt;Works gently with super results and I am 57&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I used to use Peter Thomas Roth and I find this serum to be just as effective and a much more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have bought this serum twice now, I like it so much.  My skin tolerates using it both in the am and pm. I like that it makes my skin look great and is still affordable.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I am using the retinol serum now, but I will probably switch back to this in the summer. It really brightens the skin and fades discoloration. Also, my skin has been sensitive to all other glycolic acids I have used before, but not with this one. I was impressed! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery.  Only been using for a few days so haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.  Feels nice though!</li>
    <li> Smells weird but seems to work well. Its not oily and leaves skin soft. I use it at night before bed, my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>

    <li> I received my order very quickly and love the product.  I am 52 years old and have always taken good care of my skin but my skin seemed to had reached a plateau.  I did research online and decided to add glycolic to my regimen.  I decided on Serious Skin Care because it was affordable, and WOW WOW WOW!  I have been using the glycolic line for about 2 weeks and I am already seeing the difference in my skin.  My face is so much brighter, my pores are almost invisible, and my skin stay&#x27;s moisturized all day long.  Since I started using the Serious Skin Care glycolic line, I have had several people comment on how beautiful my skin looks.  I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> Love the application, the feel,I even love the bottle.  My skin feels smoother........cant wait till I use it long enough to give better feed back.</li>
