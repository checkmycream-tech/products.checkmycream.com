      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The liner is not as opaque when you start using it, but as you keep adding layers, it gets darker and the ink comes out more on the brush.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite eyeliner</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I went by this recommendation from a makeup blogger.  </li>
      <li>I love it and it helps.</li>
      <li>It makes a very fine line and is easy to apply to my non-dominant eye.</li>
      <li>Goes on very fine and precise</li>
      <li>it easy to make lines you want using it...</li>
      <li>Comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
      <li>it makes it so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It used to be easy to apply and did not smear as i was applying.</li>
      <li>but it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>However, if you use it as much as I did (because I loved it) it&#x27;ll run out fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>the black is very nice and it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all!</li>
      <li>I can make precise cat-eye with my eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>The brush tip has a super fine point, so it makes doing your eyeliner really precise.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it is the real thing (be careful of knock-offs!)</li>
      <li>Nothing special or specular about it.</li>
      <li>I just wish its color was more intense.</li>
      <li>The pigment is not super great but good enough.</li>
      <li>It was good while it lasted! :/</li>
      <li>it is well worth a try.</li>
      <li>just how I like liner and it dries super fast and stays on all day and won&#x27;t smudge!</li>
      <li>It did however get good reviews, so perhaps this product is not right for me.</li>
      <li>Its felt tip is so thin that it&#x27;s easy to control the width of the line, which is especially important when creating a winged effect.  </li>
      <li>As far as being a good liquid eyeliner, it is only O.K.</li>
      <li>Application was effortless, the point is soft, but accurate when lining.  </li>
      <li>The first month or two I started using it was bliss.</li>
      <li>The texture is perfectly smooth, and it lasts all day, looking the same as when I first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
      <li>thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I love the precision I get with this, easy to use like a marker but still with the brush tip in order to get a super thin line.</li>
      <li>The first Dolly Wink eyeliner i purchased was amazing, hence i came back for it the second time.  </li>
      <li>The lines weren&#x27;t fine enough for me with the others.</li>
      <li>it has such a fine brush</li>
      <li>Nice skinny felt tip that releases as much or as little product as you desire</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
      <li>I needed an eyeliner that would stay on all day, but very soon after application it starts flaking off.</li>
      <li>Even though it isn&#x27;t waterproof it never has once smudged on me and I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>If you mess up, it&#x27;s pretty easy to wipe off if you do it fast, but after awhile it will set and you won&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off!</li>
      <li>Well with this Dolly Wink liquid eyeliner you can go over the other eyeliner and make it precise!</li>
      <li>The only good thing is that the tip is very thin so you can draw very fine lines if you want to.</li>
      <li>I had really high expectations about this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t get the same experience as i did the first.  </li>
      <li>Also very easy to remove with a wet napkin or wet q-tip as it isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
      <li>The packaging was adorable and the thin brush really caught my eyes!</li>
      <li>You know at times when you put on your eyeliner and the liner is not quiet a straight line?</li>
      <li>and I am sensitive to some eyeliners.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super black and lasts all day on me, despite my oily lids.</li>
      <li>i bought this in japan at first time, i like this brand, while this one a little different with the one i bought in japan.</li>

<li> I am asian with eyelids that doesn&#x27;t allow eyeliner to stay on for very long.</li>
<li> The pen lasted me about a couple of months with daily use until it started to dry out.</li>
<li> it was very thin and easy to draw with.</li>
<li> This eyeliner lasts quite a long time on the eye.  </li>
<li> I suggest buying it from an Asian market who sells it locally, or other online vendors.</li>
<li> Also, it is pretty expensive compared to the price in Japan which is only around $10USD.</li>
<li> As i apply the eyeliner, the tip of the pen appears to flatten, which makes the line wider than expected.  </li>
<li> I am disappointed, because i really like it the first time</li>
<li> that&#x27;s easy to control and can make a very thin line with!</li>
<li> Stays on dark, doesnt flake.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit pricy on Amazon.</li>
<li> The brush ends stay firm and dont stray away like some other liquid liners do.</li>
<li> To me it seems almost watery black not truly black</li>
<li> may be a little pricey</li>
<li> Sometimes it smeared a little.  </li>
<li> It dried up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Either i got a dried out eye liner or this product is way Overrated</li>
<li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
<li> and I use it everyday and it still hasn&#x27;t run out.i</li>
<li> tends to move all over my eyes giving me the dreaded panda eye effect) and the applicator is thin enough to give you the lines where you want them, but allows you to build it up to a thicker line if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
<li> But it dried out quickly after that. :(</li>
<li> I am terrible and lining my eyes, but this product makes it so easy!</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Either i got a dried out eye liner or this product is way Overrated - I&#x27;ll stick with kat von d trooper</li>
    <li> it easy to make lines you want using it...no wonder everyone recommended it...i definitely buy next time and i probably buy the pencil one too!!!&amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. (from cali). Has a very precise brush tip applicator, even though it looks like its a felt tip. The brush ends stay firm and dont stray away like some other liquid liners do. Stays on dark, doesnt flake. Comes off easily with makeup remover. Great if you like to do a winged liner look.</li>
    <li> I love Dolly Wink liner!  Its felt tip is so thin that it&#x27;s easy to control the width of the line, which is especially important when creating a winged effect.  This eyeliner lasts quite a long time on the eye.  Best of all, it is the real thing (be careful of knock-offs!) and it arrived a week earlier than projected!</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best, most precise liquid eyeliner I have ever used. I will definitely re-purchase when it runs out. Absolutely fantastic.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite eyeliner in the world to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smudge (I have oily skin and any liner I use tends to move all over my eyes giving me the dreaded panda eye effect) and the applicator is thin enough to give you the lines where you want them, but allows you to build it up to a thicker line if that&#x27;s what you want. It may be difficult to use to line your lower lash line but, practice and it&#x27;ll be perfect. I prefer this over any eyeliner pencil, gel and any liquid eyeliner that I&#x27;ve used (which is a lot). However, if you use it as much as I did (because I loved it) it&#x27;ll run out fairly quickly. But I will repurchase this because it is my go-to eyeliner for every occasion.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love all The Dolly Wink Products, and i am so happy that i found My favorite liquid eyeliner for a more reasonable price! :) it works very good, and stays on without smearing or smudging throughout the entire day and LOOKS very good as well~ the shipping was awesome as well, and got my eyeliner 3 days before its estimated delivery date! i will continue to buy it from this seller! thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner because many have recommended on YouTube plus the cute packaging was adorable to me. As far as being a good liquid eyeliner, it is only O.K. Nothing special or specular about it. It is very small and is comparable to a pen. The only good thing is that the tip is very thin so you can draw very fine lines if you want to.</li>
    <li> You know at times when you put on your eyeliner and the liner is not quiet a straight line? Well with this Dolly Wink liquid eyeliner you can go over the other eyeliner and make it precise! I love it and it helps. It&#x27;s very thin and it helps to get those smaller areas of your eyes.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite eyeliner but it is easy to use. The pigment is not super great but good enough. Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all and I am sensitive to some eyeliners. The pen lasted me about a couple of months with daily use until it started to dry out.</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations about this eyeliner. The packaging was adorable and the thin brush really caught my eyes! The first month or two I started using it was bliss. Honestly I could create amazing looks with ease! But it dried out quickly after that. :( Also, it is pretty expensive compared to the price in Japan which is only around $10USD. It was good while it lasted! :/</li>
    <li> Aside from the veryy cute packaging, the eyeliner works great! it was very thin and easy to draw with. the black is very nice and it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all! lasted all day!   may be a little pricey but it was a great buy. it is well worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have searched forever for a waterproof, stay put eyeliner and FINALLY!  I read everything from makeup alley blogs to best selling.  Tried department store, drug store.  I am so glad that I went by this recommendation from a makeup blogger.  Superior quality, my eyes didn&#x27;t burn.  This STAYED PUT all day, no flaking, no smearing.  Comes off with makeup remover.  Application was effortless, the point is soft, but accurate when lining.  Color is deep, stays all day.  SO happy with this purchase.  Would buy before I run out of this.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> The brush tip has a super fine point, so it makes doing your eyeliner really precise. The liner is not as opaque when you start using it, but as you keep adding layers, it gets darker and the ink comes out more on the brush. If you mess up, it&#x27;s pretty easy to wipe off if you do it fast, but after awhile it will set and you won&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is absolutely amazing. It makes a very fine line and is easy to apply to my non-dominant eye.</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid liner I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t flake,and stays on for more then eight hours. It also does not smudge.since it has such a fine brush it makes it so easy to apply. I ordered this eyeliner 3 months ago and I use it everyday and it still hasn&#x27;t run out.i would recommend this eyeliner to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this eyeliner, from the packaging to the formula. I love the precision I get with this, easy to use like a marker but still with the brush tip in order to get a super thin line. It&#x27;s super black and lasts all day on me, despite my oily lids. I would definitely repurchase and recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read good reviews about this product, this is why I purchased it. I am asian with eyelids that doesn&#x27;t allow eyeliner to stay on for very long. I needed an eyeliner that would stay on all day, but very soon after application it starts flaking off. I have to reapply constantly throughout the day. Since I&#x27;ve used the product I was not able to return it. Lesson learned — don&#x27;t by make-up you&#x27;ve never tried before online. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 days and tried a couple solutions to help eyeliner stay on longer, but nothing helps. This product was a waste of money. I do not recommend it. It did however get good reviews, so perhaps this product is not right for me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love and recommend this product! Goes on very fine and precise just how I like liner and it dries super fast and stays on all day and won&#x27;t smudge! Even though it isn&#x27;t waterproof it never has once smudged on me and I have very oily skin. Also very easy to remove with a wet napkin or wet q-tip as it isn&#x27;t waterproof. Will definitely repurchase once mine runs out, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> The first Dolly Wink eyeliner i purchased was amazing, hence i came back for it the second time.  However, I didn&#x27;t get the same experience as i did the first.  It used to be easy to apply and did not smear as i was applying. It dried up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second time around was the opposite.  As i apply the eyeliner, the tip of the pen appears to flatten, which makes the line wider than expected.  Sometimes it smeared a little.  I am disappointed, because i really like it the first time and now i&#x27;m torn if i should go and purchase again.  Maybe i just got a bad batch? Either way, i&#x27;m only giving it a 3 start for being neutral.</li>
    <li> I love the skinny felt-brush tip! Finally I found an eyeliner that&#x27;s easy to control and can make a very thin line with! I just wish its color was more intense. To me it seems almost watery black not truly black and deep!(If this makes sense!)</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is bang on. I&#x27;ve tried different brands from the drug store to more expensive brands like MAC and I still couldn&#x27;t find the perfect eyeliner. The lines weren&#x27;t fine enough for me with the others. This one is small, but still packs a punch. I still have mine after 6 months and I use it every day. I can make precise cat-eye with my eyeliner. I love this. It also lasts all day without smudging or fading. I could even use it in 40C humidity in the tropical countries when I was on vacation! My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit pricy on Amazon. I suggest buying it from an Asian market who sells it locally, or other online vendors.</li>
    <li> i bought this in japan at first time, i like this brand, while this one a little different with the one i bought in japan.</li>
    <li> I am terrible and lining my eyes, but this product makes it so easy! Nice skinny felt tip that releases as much or as little product as you desire depending on how you angle it. The black is very dark and it never smudges (a HUGE issue for me with other eyeliners) and lasts until I wash it off. I know it is bad for you, but sometimes I leave it on for two days straight and it doesn&#x27;t fade! Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is perfect for drawing fine lines. The texture is perfectly smooth, and it lasts all day, looking the same as when I first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
