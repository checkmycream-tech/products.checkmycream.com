      <li>And as such it is an all-out excellent device for cleaning teeth.  </li>
      <li>The stickers allow children to customize the brush so that they take more ownership of it and are (hopefully) more eager to brush&lt;br</li>
      <li>Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser]] which I love.  </li>
      <li>Would purchase again for sure.</li>
      <li>so I cannot say if this is more compact or not.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Because I have enjoyed using Oral B for many years</li>
      <li>naturally we were already using them and when she discovered that she was quite happy.  </li>

      <li>Alert sound also lets kids know when they&#x27;re finished brushing.</li>
      <li>At the end of the minute/two minutes, the brush makes a cheerful chaime for a job</li>
      <li>but now that I&#x27;m seeing how good of a product it&#x27;s been and the good habits it is instilling in the young ones I&#x27;m a little more okay about it.</li>
      <li>We already own an adult Sonicare electric toothbrush, but it&#x27;s much more powerful than the one for kids, so I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>Plus kid friendly stickers to decorate it with.</li>
      <li>When I got the opportunity to get this one for the kids I was excited.  </li>
      <li>They can also continue brushing if they want to clean for longer</li>
      <li>It is important to teach toddlers the basics of good oral hygiene, so that cleaning their teeth and gums becomes second nature.  </li>
      <li>my personal opinion, but between 4 and 6 years of age would be the perfect time to introduce a child to a Sonicare Electric Toothbrush along with a Star Chart (behavior chart) based on how well our six year old adapted to it.</li>
      <li>A staple product in our household for many many years thus far.  </li>
      <li>It just works at keeping her entertained and with a clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>have purchased additional heads so that the all of the kids can use this cool brush.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;She loves it but is still trying to wrap her head around \\&quot;two full minutes\\&quot; of brushing.</li>
      <li>We used the toothbrush on our 4 year old and he didn’t complain and said he liked it.  </li>
      <li>and luckily she enjoys using it.</li>

      <li>Phillips has put a lot of thought into this product which makes it worth every dime.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume it would be really nice for kids though, with the smaller angled grip.</li>

      <li>I am always looking for a way to make \\&quot;Pop-pop&#x27;s house\\&quot; fun for when the grandchildren come to visit from out of state.  </li>
      <li>If you shell out the money for it, your kid will love it, and will probably like brushing more than with any other toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>It feels like it is going vibrate crowns right off.  </li>
      <li>liked that we were able to customize it with one of eight different designs, About the only con is the cost of refill heads, but really when compared to the cost of having just one cavity filled, the refill heads are a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You charge it until the blinking light becomes steady</li>
      <li>This is a great option for adults with small mouths as well.  </li>
      <li>Grip is a good size for our kids but probably a bit big for our 3 1/2 year old.</li>
      <li>In high mode, not only is the brushing more vigorous, but it makes a congratulatory sound and shuts off after the 2 minutes recommended brushing time.</li>

    <li> It is important to teach toddlers the basics of good oral hygiene, so that cleaning their teeth and gums becomes second nature.  One tool to make brushing enjoyable and effective is the Philips Hx6381/07 Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  It has a number of cool features that make it attractive and practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush can be left in its charging stand 24/7, so you never have to worry about buying batteries or losing power.  The brush head is soft and compact and requires just a small dab of toothpaste.  Among the bells and whistles is a \\&quot;Kid Pacer\\&quot; that emits a beep reminding the child to move on to another quadrant (you can teach the kids what a quadrant is while you&#x27;re at it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two power settings (the low mode is suitable for younger children) and stickers to personalize the easy-to-grip brush handle with colorful images.  Be aware that the toothbrush comes with one brush head.  When the head wears out, you will must buy a replacement.  Of course, you still need to show your kids how to floss, but the Sonicare toothbrush takes some of the tedium out of a necessary chore.</li>
    <li> Having spent thousands on orthodontics for our daughter we were motivated to protect our investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I go in for a check up my dentist asks if I am using a sonic toothbrush as it is much more effective in&lt;br /&gt;maintaining good oral hygiene than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my dentist recommendation I got this Philips Sonicare for my daughter. Like most electric toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;it is very easy to use and get used to. The addition of the music is a nice touch as are the sticker packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it but is still trying to wrap her head around \\&quot;two full minutes\\&quot; of brushing. It seems like a long time but&lt;br /&gt;the music actually helps her brush longer without complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been really happy with this Sonicare toothbrush. I&#x27;m thrilled to have one for my boys. My wife and I have been using Sonicare for a year or two now and have been extremely happy with the results. This kids version is similar to the adult, except that it has nice kid-friendly sounds that tell them to switch parts of their mouth as they brush (it divides the brushing time into four segments, so that makes it seem shorter and also ensures that no areas of the mouth are missed). This brush comes with an ascending timer, so it starts shorter so kids get used to the brushing signals and then it slowly lengthens the amount of time they brush, working them up to the dentist-recommended two minutes. There is a setting to change the brushing intensity from low to hi, which is nice as kids get used to the sensation. This version has some interchangeable stickers that make the brush even more fun for the kids. The brush only comes with one brush head. You can purchase additional kids brush heads if you use it for multiple children (we do). We actually used adult replacement brushes for our two older kids, and those that are compatible with our Sonicare Flexcare brush are fully compatible with this kids brush. This is a really nice brush, at a good price (though look out for the replacement head cost).</li>
    <li> This is a very fine kids toothbrush from Sonicare. My three kids (ages 11, 6, and 3) can all handle it and enjoy using it, each with their own individual brush head. It has served as a solid introductory electric toothbrush for our kids. The vibration is milder than on the adult models and therefore less alarming and/or unsettling to younger children. Would purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned anything that gets a kid happy or even remotely excited about brushing their teeth in the morning or before bed is a great thing. Getting in that habit is very important, next comes the flossing habit but let us take it one step at a time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller handle makes it easy for younger kids to be able to handle it while it is not so small that older kids pre-teen have an issue with it. The 9 year old has no issue using it and luckily she enjoys using it. It just works at keeping her entertained and with a clean mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the bristles are a bit soft but she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it and it still seems to work. No bad breath issues and after using some dye to check she&#x27;s getting them clean she&#x27;s happy and excited that she has clean teeth. She&#x27;s been using the higher speed setting and there has been no issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various stick on skins are pretty cool, she got to select what she wants her tooth brush to look like. Another win for keeping kids interested in keeping their mouths clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pacer feature that basically tells you when you are done with a &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; (section) of your mouth and then it&#x27;s time to move to the next area. It&#x27;s good for getting into those habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It increases the time that it runs over the first several brushing to get the person used to brushing for the proper amount of time and not just wham bam done like many people get into the bad habit of doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you resume use within 30 seconds it will just pick up where it left off for its internal clock for the brushing time/quadrant times. Another nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little annoyed by the price of this item at the beginning but now that I&#x27;m seeing how good of a product it&#x27;s been and the good habits it is instilling in the young ones I&#x27;m a little more okay about it. It seems to work quite well and as I&#x27;ve already stated a couple times it is another thing that gets the little ones just that much more excited about cleaning their mouths and keeping that bacteria away. Anything that can prevent getting cavities at an early age and later on having to get false teeth is a good thing in my mind.just that much more excited about cleaning their mouths and keeping that bacteria away.

    <li> My first electric toothbrush was a Sonicare and I&#x27;ve had a couple replacements over the years.  I currently use another brand, but I use the [[ASIN:B00CUG270S Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser]] which I love.  The newest rechargeable toothbrush to enter our household is the smaller [[ASIN:B00G5L867C Philips Sonicare HX6311/07 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Kids]] which is the cutest of all.  It comes with a single soft brush head in the small size for kids around 4 years of age but larger brush heads are available for older children and of the adult size brushes are the most widely seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has a small charger on which it sits and it takes about 24 hours for a full charge.  One of the special features of this version is that there is a ramp up period which is the default setting, where the child starts with a one minute cleaning and it automatically ramps up to two minutes over fourteen days.  This can be reset if you&#x27;re not interested.  sThe blue color is very pretty, the texture is comfortable, and if the child wants to, they can apply one of the eight enclosed water resistant stickers on the face  plate.  There&#x27;s also a sheet of small stickers if they want to have some fun.  We have one now on the front of the charging base.  Since the toothbrush alerts the child when it&#x27;s time to move through the four sections of their mouth with an audible tone, it gives them something to look forward to.  They can also continue brushing if they want to clean for longer than two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a two year warranty, but in the box I received is a card offering an additional six months that&#x27;s valid through 12/31/2015 with online registration.  Of course, we did that.  We change all our brush heads every 3 months or so and are disciplined in cleaning them well daily.  This version comes with a cap for the brush head which is pretty standard but there is no travel case for the entire device.</li>
    <li> The brushing action is gentle, but through, and my six year old took to it like a duck to water, without any fear of it at all. In fact he liked it so much that he brushed with it 7 times during the first 48 hours, and we had to figure out how to fit extra stars on his &amp;#34;Star Chart&amp;#34; which we started for him at the same time that we introduced this new toothbrush to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that we were able to customize it with one of eight different designs, About the only con is the cost of refill heads, but really when compared to the cost of having just one cavity filled, the refill heads are a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my personal opinion, but between 4 and 6 years of age would be the perfect time to introduce a child to a Sonicare Electric Toothbrush along with a Star Chart (behavior chart) based on how well our six year old adapted to it.</li>
    <li> A staple product in our household for many many years thus far.  We have used the sonicare series for a very long time and our teeth are healthier thanks to it.  Lets face it, no one likes to visit the dentist but it is one of those things we have to do in order to keep our oral hygiene at its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package contains everything you need to get started: The brush base, one brush head, a charger base, and 10 stickers so as to be able to customize the brush and make brushing a little more entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kid friendly features: There are two modes on this brush.  One high and one low.  The low mode basically is set for a 1 minute brushing cycle which gradually increases over time to the full recommended 2 minutes.  The high mode is set at 2 minutes.  Further the brush has a mode Philips calls &#x27;KidPacer&#x27; which uses audible tones to remind the child to move to a different section of the mouth.  When the 2 minutes has been achieved the kids are given a audible tune and the brush turns off....another thing that they don&#x27;t need to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dentist started offering the Sonicare series for sale about 2 years ago and she swears by them....naturally we were already using them and when she discovered that she was quite happy.  She offered us some product for sale but we naturally declined and compared prices.  Oral hygiene wise the entire family has been doing well with only a small cavity for one of us adults....age related. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price on these products along with the ability to use Subscribe and Save for the brush heads, which should be replaced every 3 months or so....it makes it easy - just setup a subscription and the brush heads are delivered to your door at a reasonable price with a subscription discount.  Yes, the cost is higher than ordinary brushes, but the results with Sonicare will impress you to the point that you will wonder why you didnt get them sooner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have three children, 17, 12 and 12 and it can be quite a task keeping up with their brushing habits.  The Sonicare makes it easy...its something they don&#x27;t have to think about because this is now a tool that does the work for them...well most of the work.  Our 12 year old daughter had to get braces and brushing is a task....not with Sonicare though...we simply acquire specific brush heads for brace brushing and she is a happy camper....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent in every regard.12 and 12 and it can be quite a task keeping up with their brushing habits.

    <li> I am always looking for a way to make \\&quot;Pop-pop&#x27;s house\\&quot; fun for when the grandchildren come to visit from out of state.  They of course bring their own toothbrushes but this it makes brushing all the more special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Philips Sonicare for myself and swear by it.  When I got the opportunity to get this one for the kids I was excited.  Phillips has put a lot of thought into this product which makes it worth every dime.  Here are a few things that I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It is the perfect size for smaller hands&lt;br /&gt;*  It comes with different programs for smaller children and steps up the time and power gently over a set period&lt;br /&gt;*  The stickers allow children to customize the brush so that they take more ownership of it and are (hopefully) more eager to brush&lt;br /&gt;*  You can have the brush remind children the brush all four part on their mouth&lt;br /&gt;*  It will alert the user when either 1 or 2 minutes have elapsed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased additional heads so that the all of the kids can use this cool brush.  I think that Philips hit it out of the park with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality toothbrush that will be a hit with your kids.  This is a great option for adults with small mouths as well.  The variety of included \\&quot;skins\\&quot; was a nice touch for kids.  Adults, don&#x27;t worry, the \\&quot;skins\\&quot; are optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterthought: I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with crowns or other complicated dental work.  It feels like it is going vibrate crowns right off.  They still hurt.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush for kids or adults! Really feels quality, has a nice weight to it. I have cheap Oral B and feels cheap, this is much nicer. It has Sonic vibration which the Oral B does not. I like having two speeds, and the alert that tells you when its time to move on to your next section of teeth. Yes I&#x27;m an adult and yes I&#x27;m using it, and yes again it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume it would be really nice for kids though, with the smaller angled grip. Plus kid friendly stickers to decorate it with. The timer is great for kids so they know how long to brush each area. Plus the lower speed option for young children. I do wonder how much replacement heads will cost. It does seem very well built, I expect to have it a long while. It feels more effective than the Oral B I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> This is the child-friendly version of the normal Sonicare electric toothbrush.  And as such it is an all-out excellent device for cleaning teeth.  If you shell out the money for it, your kid will love it, and will probably like brushing more than with any other toothbrush.  It&#x27;s hard to argue with brushing when your teeth are so obviously getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main feature of this brush is a slightly smaller handle than on an adult-sized Sonicare.  It&#x27;s not small, though.  It&#x27;s a kid-grip friendly rubbery blue handle, with a removable face plate that can be decorated with one of the included 8 stickers.  There&#x27;s also a second sheet of stickers that can be used to decorate the rest of the brush or just for further personalization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ours came charged enough to use right out of the box, which is what my daughter wanted to do.  The included instructions are a little sparse and it was kind of confusing to determine what the lower button was for (the top button obviously turns it on and off).  I really could have used some sort of &amp;#34;WELCOME CHILD, TO YOUR NEW TOOTHBRUSH!!!&amp;#34; guide or pamphlet.  Instead we were digging around on the flimsy 4-language instruction paper, trying to figure the thing out.  Basically though, the brush has two child modes - a one minute timer that vibrates at a lower level, and a two-minute timer that vibrates a little more vigorously.  You can choose one with the the bottom button, and both modes have an ease-in period, where the vibration is ramped up across the first two-weeks of brushing.  At the end of the minute/two minutes, the brush makes a cheerful chaime for a job well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a single brush head.  The stem it mounts to looks the same as the one on my adult Sonicare, and I&#x27;m sure you could swap it out/replace it with any Sonicare brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a premium piece of hardware, and it feels as well-made as any Sonicare I&#x27;ve seen.  it should last for years and years, and the charge should last weeks at a time.  You and your child will not regret getting one.arge should last weeks at a time.  You and your child will not regret getting one.</li>
    <li> When we first started brushing our kids teeth we used just a regular baby toothbrush with soft bristles. When we had to get our kids to do more independent brushing we switched to an electric toothbrush because it got them interested, like the [[ASIN:B002DGCRNC Colgate Kids Sponge Bob Powered Toothbrush, Extra Soft Bristles, Colors and Styles May Vary]]. My boys are 3 and 5 years old and for whatever reason we&#x27;re back to simplistic brushes like [[ASIN:B00E4DEKDC Colgate Kids Twin Pack Toothbrush, Transformers]] that the dentist gives away after their bi-yearly cleanings. We already own an adult Sonicare electric toothbrush, but it&#x27;s much more powerful than the one for kids, so I don&#x27;t recommend it. (It feels like someone sanding the floor but in your mouth with a buzz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare for kids comes complete with:&lt;br /&gt;+Hygenic travel cap&lt;br /&gt;+Brush head&lt;br /&gt;+Handle with soft grip&lt;br /&gt;+Power on/off button with battery charge indicator&lt;br /&gt;+Removable panel with replacement stickers (8)&lt;br /&gt;+Brushing mode button with mode lights&lt;br /&gt;+Charger&lt;br /&gt;+Panel&lt;br /&gt;+stickers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit we have is for 4+ so our brush head is quite soft. Alert sounds let kids know when to move onto brushing other parts of their mouth (the instructions include how you should move about brushing inside your mouth). Alert sound also lets kids know when they&#x27;re finished brushing. Grip is a good size for our kids but probably a bit big for our 3 1/2 year old. It&#x27;s not terribly heavy, but much more than an old fashion toothbrush. I do like the sticker options (as do my kids!), but I wish they included a superhero option -- even just a generic superhero would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids did enjoy using this toothbrush. No telling if it&#x27;s just the novelty and it will wear off soon. So far I&#x27;ve been very impressed with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> If you had removed the &amp;#34;for kids&amp;#34; in the title, this Sonicare is just as good as any in their &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; line. However, the little features that Philips added to make this kid friendly just makes it even more awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect out of the Sonicare line. On the non-slow start mode, the motor hums semi-loudly (at least for something you stick in your mouth) and the bristles vibrate rapidly. There are audible beeps for when you&#x27;re approaching the 2 min mark. The rechargeable battery and charger stand work flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little added bits - such as the slow start and &amp;#34;time to change area&amp;#34; notifications make this a great little brush for kids who are just learning to brush on their own, or for those older kids who have started to slack off in their brushing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of a sticker to change the look of the toothbrush is a little gimiicky feeling to me, but kids may love it. It comes with a standard set of 8 &#x27;faceplate&#x27; stickers and a bunch of small add-ons. There&#x27;s only one included faceplate panel though, so even though the stickers are removable, it&#x27;s still a one-use per sticker situation (in other words, you can&#x27;t put a sticker on multiple faceplates unless you buy more).</li>
    <li> Everyone in my house has used Oral B toothbrushes for a long time and this is our first experience with Sonicare.  I really can only compare and contrast this Kid’s Sonicare with our experience with Oral B as both are higher end electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare toothbrush vibrates a lot.  While the Oral B toothbrush has parts that spin or shake, the Sonicare seems only to vibrate – and quite a lot too.  We used the toothbrush on our 4 year old and he didn’t complain and said he liked it.  He told me he likes his new toothbrush too.  Overall, I would say this toothbrush gets his teeth clean and I am very confident that the claims about this toothbrush cleaning better or more than a manual toothbrush are all true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of this toothbrush is very similar to the Oral B electric toothbrushes we have.  I haven’t seen the adult model of Sonicare so I cannot say if this is more compact or not.  It seems like the stickers make this more of a kid model than anything else as it isn’t exactly a small toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have enjoyed using Oral B for many years and I am very used to the brush actually moving (and not just vibrating), I will stick with my Oral B for my own person use.  Having a brush that only vibrates might be safer for kids to use on their own than something that spins and could potentially damage their gums though.</li>
    <li> We got this toothbrush for our 10 year old son. He had been wanting an electric toothbrush like his parents for some time. This is the same brand as we use and we are just as pleased with it. Our son loved the fact that he could personalize it with stickers and skins.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has two intensity settings and are easy to switch between. The charging base has a small, sleek design that takes up minimal counter space. The toothbrush seems to hold a charge for quite awhile, which is handy for a couple of days of traveling. Otherwise, we keep it on the charger. Replacement heads are easy to find. Very satisfied with this toothbrush and now the rest of the kids want one!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome toothbrush! My 6 years old son loves using it. The little ding lets him know when to move the brush to a new spot, and the timer ensures that he always brushes long enough. We still help him brush, just to make sure he&#x27;s getting all his teeth, but this is one powerful little toothbrush. Absolutely recommend this if you&#x27;re interested. It&#x27;s pretty pricey for a kids toothbrush, but Sonicare is definitely a brand you can trust. My husband&#x27;s been using a Sonicare brush for years and has never had an issue with it.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Hx6381/07 Sonicare for Kids uses the same sonic technology as the adult Sonicare. However, it is designed for kids and differs from an adult Sonicare in the following ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Smaller Brush Handle...&lt;br /&gt;so smaller hands have no problem wrapping around the handle to maintain a firm and comfortable grip. The back of the handle is also rubberized and textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Softer Bristles...&lt;br /&gt;are gentle on gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Dual Power Button (Button On The Bottom)...&lt;br /&gt;lets you select High mode (for older children) or Low mode (for very young children).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) Faceplate With 8 Colorful Stickers Included&lt;br /&gt;The optional faceplate has an adhesive surface on its reverse side. You have to first peel off a protective wrap to expose the adhesive surface before you apply the faceplate over the toothbrush handle. Next select and peel off one of the 8 stickers and apply it over the faceplate. The faceplate has a notch on its bottom right to allow you to easily pry the faceplate off if you decide to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonicare has ALL the features of the adult Sonicare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Quad-Pacer&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare marketing has decided to rename its Quad Pacer feature \\&quot;Kid Pacer\\&quot; in the kid&#x27;s version of the Sonicare. They are essentially one and the same feature. The Quad/Kid Pacer feature is a 30-second timer that lets you know when to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Easy Start&lt;br /&gt;The power slowly ramps up over the first 14 brushings to allow the user to adjust to the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Pause-And-Resume&lt;br /&gt;The timer lets you to pause it so you have time to spit. The timer will pick up where it leaves off if it&#x27;s resumed within 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;If you want to introduce your little one to sonic brushing, this is the toothbrush to get. It&#x27;s also a wonderful tool for helping him/her establish a lifetime of good dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to set up. You charge it until the blinking light becomes steady, you adorn it with one of the many stickers that comes with it (you can change them later), and you pop the head on and go. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this for kids, are the brushing modes. There is a high for more &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; kids. In high mode, not only is the brushing more vigorous, but it makes a congratulatory sound and shuts off after the 2 minutes recommended brushing time. In the low mode, brushing is finished after one minute. Over time, in low mode, the completion time increases to 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each 1/4 division of the full brushing time is marked by a series of reminder tones. It reminds the child to switch to a different quadrant of the mouth. Finally, there is a default easy-start feature which gradually increases the brushing power over the first 14 brushings. This can be disabled.</li>
    <li> My son has been using the HX6311 since 2011. The warranty on Sonicare units are two years, and I&#x27;ve been getting about three years out of them. The one thing I haven&#x27;t noticed on this model in the specs which isn&#x27;t of concern for me since my son was a previous user is the ramp up. The HX6311 was listed as having a 90 day slow increase in brushing. I don&#x27;t see that listed with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly this model is listed on the box as being for dentist office distribution only, not for resale. Maybe this only applies to the Vine model which I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is the best part of the Sonicare system. Not so much the quadpacer at the younger age, but the simple fact that it has a timed feature, so they brush for the required amount of time. As they age, you can begin working with the kids on breaking down the mouth into quads for the 30 second breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operationally this lives up to the same expectations as all other Sonicare models. This comes with more stickers than its predecessor which my son will appreciate out of the box and quickly forget about. His next model should be an adult unit since these are designed for ages up to 10. I don&#x27;t know that there is any difference operationally really since they all oscillate at 31,000 RPM. In other words, make sure they turn it on IN their mouths or you&#x27;ll have a real mess.</li>
