<li> Tames my processed long blond hair.</li>
<li> and I have just enough left for maybe 1 or 2 more washes-depending on whose hair get&#x27;s washed next  :(  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure I can find something else less expensive...</li>
<li> I use it when my long hair gets dry from processing.</li>
<li> so maybe that&#x27;s why this hasn&#x27;t worked like I expected.</li>
<li> It helps condition my hair and leaves it softer, and smoother, which can be a challenge with my long, thick, and coarse hair.  </li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t build it up on you hair, weighing it down..</li>
<li> This made my hair feel silky-smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
<li> Relatively inexpensive as the quantity of conditioner needed is very small.</li>
<li> It lasts for months, which completely justifies the cost of this product vs less expensive versions you can buy at Walmart.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve gone longer then usual for a touch up</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think anything can fix my hair from the extremely hard water in Santa Barbara,</li>
<li> I have relaxed hair and use this product at least 4 times a month.  </li>
<li> my daughters have thick AA hair</li>
<li> A television hair stylist told me she uses and saw dramatic changes in hair quality.  </li>
<li> So I tried it after a bad color treatment ruined my hair.  </li>

    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s the cheaper alternative I found to oleo relax by kerastase.  It helps condition my hair and leaves it softer, and smoother, which can be a challenge with my long, thick, and coarse hair.  I&#x27;m asian, and I&#x27;m one of those few without the super straight and sleek hair types.  I have wavy hair (if I let it grow and naturally dry), and this products really babies it.

    <li> Love this hair mask leaves hair soft and has helped strengthen my hair</li>
    <li> Used this once a week for hydrating hair masque and try to leave it in 10-20 min and it lasts about 6 months with one jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product; smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> Ths stuff is fantastuic, it will revive your hair to a smooth healthy look, even if your hair is damaged or dry. Love it.</li>

    <li> It made my hair nice and shiny and smooth.  I have wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product. Relatively inexpensive as the quantity of conditioner needed is very small.</li>
    <li> Need to improve your hairs shine, strength and all around health.  Try this product!  A television hair stylist told me she uses and saw dramatic changes in hair quality.  So I tried it after a bad color treatment ruined my hair.  I&#x27;m on my third jar! LOVE IT!  My hair has improved greatly.  I now order 2 and 3 jars at a time!</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and use this product at least 4 times a month.  It delivers excellent results.  This product makes my hair soft and manageable. I use this as a deep conditioner in addition to my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner products.  I just purchased my second jar and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world!</li>
    <li> Fantastic deep conditioner! Leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel silky-smooth without weighing it down.  It does have to sit for a little bit, but it&#x27;s a perfect excuse to spend a bit of extra time pampering yourself in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years.  My hair is extremely dry and most conditioners leave my hair oily and flat.  I cannot guess how many products I tried before my hair stylist recommended this product. My hair absorbs this product, moisturizing my hair without leaving an oily look.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good restorative treatment for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair mask for years, ever since discovering it at my hairdresser&#x27;s salon.  It works great on my hair, which is thick and course.  It lasts for months, which completely justifies the cost of this product vs less expensive versions you can buy at Walmart.  Definitely worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful conditioner. My hair was still frizzy after weekly uses. For me the product was great initally, then, after the end of the weekI needed to condition again. it doesn&#x27;t build it up on you hair, weighing it down..it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have lasting power..  Maybe that good or bad...guess it depends on what you wanted.</li>
    <li> I have thick blonde hair and this conditioner is amazing. This conditioner was recommended by my hair dresser and works really well without being greasy.  I also have allergies and many hair products have scents that that bother my allergies - this product does not cause me any issues and just smells fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product for dry, colored, curly Hispanic hair like mine. It nourishes my hair like no other!</li>
    <li> this Masque definitely does it&#x27;s job well!</li>
    <li> Works well as a deep conditioner once a week.  Makes hair silky.</li>
    <li> my daughters have thick AA hair and I have a perm and I literally used this tub once on each of us and I have just enough left for maybe 1 or 2 more washes-depending on whose hair get&#x27;s washed next  :(  smells really good but for the amount you get I&#x27;m sure I can find something else less expensive...</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. I&#x27;ve gone longer then usual for a touch up so maybe that&#x27;s why this hasn&#x27;t worked like I expected. It smells nice though. I will update at a later day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think anything can fix my hair from the extremely hard water in Santa Barbara, CA but it&#x27;s a nice temporary fix and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> this is a great moisturizing masque for way less than other ones that i have found just as helpful</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair.  Helps with hydrating a lot.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Tames my processed long blond hair. Good stuff and I recommend.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;masque&amp;#34; for hair is volumizing and non greasy....I really love it!!!  Would recommend to anyone, a great quick fix for hair!!</li>
