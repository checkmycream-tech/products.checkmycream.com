      <li>VERY happy with this!</li>

      <li>Great product, works well.</li>
      <li>Very happy with my purchase work perfectly fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>will buy here again if the price is good</li>
      <li>I thought that this would be a good replacement and its not.</li>
      <li>The stamper also works really nicely.</li>
      <li>and we havent had any more issues.</li>
      <li>Its a WAY better scrapper and stamper set.</li>
      <li>Love the scraper its metal.</li>
      <li>very cute and awesome idea but nails almost never turn out and terribly difficult to get looking nice and use.over</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>For me, the scraper works best when the side with less dots is facing me.</li>
      <li>The silicone stamper works just fine</li>
      <li>It can pick up intricate designs and applies it perfectly to the nail with a little bit of practice.</li>
      <li>popped the ends out and filled the body with cotton balls then but</li>
      <li>I was excited when I received it in the mail.</li>
      <li>so EXCITED to use them</li>
      <li>it transferred the stamps pretty easily and comfortably.</li>
      <li>It can pick up full length nail designs also, with out any problems.</li>
      <li>Works OK sometimes, but not like the real brand name Konad.</li>
      <li>She is very artistic and now can design her nails in many different ways!</li>
      <li>The scraper is junk, we had better luck with an old plastic gift card.&lt;br /&gt;The stamper works, but after awhile the ends start to push</li>
      <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything about the metal scraper blade; like most, I prefer using an old credit card or gift card to scrape with.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is a great product and work really well.</li>
      <li>I actually prefer this stamper more than my Konad stamper, but the scraper doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was shown</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it a star is because the stamper is ok, however, it seems too rubbery.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!</li>
      <li>I havent dont much design transferring</li>
      <li>This product works really well.</li>
      <li>i was happy with what I got but for some reason the larger side of the stamper didn&#x27;t have  a stopper in it when you pressed it to the nail like the small side</li>
      <li>I also wish the color of the rubber stampers were clear or white, to make it easier to see the image on the stamp clearly so you can judge better how to place the stamp correctly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scraper works really nicely and it can define really small stamping lines.</li>
      <li>but the few ive done were fine.</li>
      <li>it came early.</li>
      <li>Something about this stamper makes the polish dry extremely fast, rendering what you picked up unusable.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m a long time stamping fan</li>
<li> It was the inly thing missing to have everything complete.</li>
<li> but this is my first time using this brand of stamper , and I was pretty disappointed.</li>
<li> Came and works just as expected.</li>
<li> Not to waste my money back on this.</li>
<li> This product met my expectations, received sooner than expected.  </li>
<li> Both ends of the stamper are not glued into the pink handle, so when you go to lift your stamp from a plate, the polish in the plate will make the red or green rubber stampers stick to the plate and pull out of the handle.</li>
<li> It was due to arrive on April 23 but hasn&#x27;t come for a week, it now says it will arrive on May 11th.</li>
<li> the rubber part would always fall in the the hallow middle, but green side workswonderfully for small designs</li>
<li> I am not very happy with this but only because of shipping procedures.</li>
<li> I cant see the design over the dark green to check if it smudged at all</li>
<li> Although the green side is too small and dark.</li>
<li> (plus shipping, but hey, I still got it for less than $3!)</li>
<li> Also, the shipping took about a month and a half!</li>
<li> You have to push REALLY hard and damage your design plate in order for it to work and even then it scraps it very unevenly.</li>
<li> hard to use</li>
<li> AT Least I HOPE ...</li>
<li> i had forgot how hard this product and the products plates are to use!</li>
<li> Too bad, the few times I did manage to make it work</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried nail glue, Crazy glue, and Elmer&#x27;s, and nothing will make the stampers stick in the handle.</li>
<li> This is very frustrating!</li>
<li> all bad product!</li>
<li> The stamp didn&#x27;t work at all and the scraper was horrible.</li>
<li> The rubber parts would fall off and the scrapper was horrible.</li>

    <li> Great product, works well. I am not very happy with this but only because of shipping procedures. It was due to arrive on April 23 but hasn&#x27;t come for a week, it now says it will arrive on May 11th. Other than that it is a great product and work really well.</li>
    <li> The scraper is junk, we had better luck with an old plastic gift card.&lt;br /&gt;The stamper works, but after awhile the ends start to push in.&lt;br /&gt;We popped the ends out and filled the body with cotton balls then but the ends back on, this seems to be the trick and we havent had any more issues.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. It did not transfer the stamp. The rubber parts would fall off and the scrapper was horrible.</li>
    <li> I purchased this stamper and scraper set because I lost my KONAD scraper. I thought that this would be a good replacement and its not. The scraper doesn&#x27;t scrap off all of the nail polish off of the design plate. You have to push REALLY hard and damage your design plate in order for it to work and even then it scraps it very unevenly. I would recommend buying the KONAD brand. Its a WAY better scrapper and stamper set. The only reason I gave it a star is because the stamper is ok, however, it seems too rubbery. The design smears because the rubber is too sleek.</li>
    <li> Scraper does not work. I just used the straigt edge of the plastic packaging and that worked better.&lt;br /&gt;Stamper does but not well.</li>
    <li> Dont works the image stay in the stamper and does not the nail. I dont like it. Not to waste my money back on this.</li>
    <li> Works OK sometimes, but not like the real brand name Konad.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Stamper for a set a plates that I won. The Price was great! Who can beat getting what you want for a Penny?!?! (plus shipping, but hey, I still got it for less than $3!) I got it sooner than was predicted, which was great!</li>
    <li> I actually prefer this stamper more than my Konad stamper, but the scraper doesn&#x27;t do the job. The plastic from the stamper comes off but with that low price I&#x27;m not complaining. Also, the shipping took about a month and a half!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time stamping fan but this is my first time using this brand of stamper , and I was pretty disappointed.

    <li> Came and works just as expected.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase work perfectly fine</li>
    <li> DONT BUYS THIS!! THE STAMP AND SCRAPER DIDNT WORK AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> Something about this stamper makes the polish dry extremely fast, rendering what you picked up unusable. This is very frustrating! Maybe I just have a defective stamper, but no matter what side I use, it&#x27;s the same result.</li>
    <li> VERY happy with this! Easy to use. Although the green side is too small and dark. I cant see the design over the dark green to check if it smudged at all</li>
    <li> I bought this again because i lost mine i had forgot how hard this product and the products plates are to use! very cute and awesome idea but nails almost never turn out and terribly difficult to get looking nice and use.over all bad product!</li>
    <li> The silicone stamper works just fine I have no complaints about that. However the scraper that comes with this product is total garbage. All it did was scratch my plate. I ended up just going to my local hardware store and bought a razor blade for about 1$. The razor blade works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This product works really well. For me, the scraper works best when the side with less dots is facing me. The scraper works really nicely and it can define really small stamping lines. It works best when you apply a lot of pressure. The stamper also works really nicely. It can pick up intricate designs and applies it perfectly to the nail with a little bit of practice. It can pick up full length nail designs also, with out any problems. Bonus it came early. Definently would buy again</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations, received sooner than expected.  Love the scraper its metal.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!! i bought this product in May and i have yet to pick up a design on the stamper .i would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Exactly what was shown</li>
    <li> The stamp didn&#x27;t work at all and the scraper was horrible. I think the company needs to make some changes on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. She is very artistic and now can design her nails in many different ways!</li>
    <li> Hey..&lt;br /&gt;I havent Actually Got the Item YET But i have the Shany plates and im so EXCITED to use them i think the stamper will work perfectlly &gt;&gt;&gt; AT Least I HOPE ... i cant wait</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to manage to get this to be perfect and have nessed up some really good polish</li>
    <li> The product came within 7 days after ordering and the product work. I havent dont much design transferring but the few ive done were fine. will buy here again if the price is good</li>
    <li> hard to use but I will practice.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received it in the mail. It was the inly thing missing to have everything complete. It works well, but the scraper can/needs to be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> i was happy with what I got but for some reason the larger side of the stamper didn&#x27;t have  a stopper in it when you pressed it to the nail like the small side did so the rubber part would always fall in the the hallow middle, but green side workswonderfully for small designs</li>
