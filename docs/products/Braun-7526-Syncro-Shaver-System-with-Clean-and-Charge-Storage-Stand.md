<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Last model I had was great. This newer model is made cheap. Trimmer is terrible which is what I mostly use.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t let you charge the battery unless you use the cleaning option at the same time. I don&#x27;t use it that much so I have to clean it unnecessarily just so the battery is charged. I guess they get you to buy more cleaner that way.</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of great reviews since the product was introduced nearly 15 years ago.  I wanted to add my own review to specifically address the quality of construction and how the product has fared over a 12 year period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right, 12 years ago I was merely a college student looking for a quality electric razor to last me through the remaining 2 years of school.  I wanted something slick and cool - something that would make me feel like a man whenever a woman would make her way into my bathroom and see my awesome manly arsenal of beauty care products.  I am not sure if that last sentence made any sense.  Anyways, I purchased the highest model at the time, which was the 7570, very similar to this model except it included an LCD display to let you know how much charge was left.  I opted not to go with the cleaning stand, and so my 7570 had to endure main cycles of shaving without proper cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is made in Germany, and man, does Braun make a quality electric razor.  Over the past 12 years, this shaver has traveled with me to 17 different countries, and endured at least 4000 start/stop shaving cycles.  It has supported me on 240v power when I lived in SE Asia for a couple of years, and 120v for the remaining 10 years in the states.  It&#x27;s gone with me to weekend Vegas trips back in college, and shaved me clean for my wedding day, and to this day it goes strong and holds a charge well - easily a week or more between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incredible thing is that it almost looks as good as it did from day one, with the exception of some wear on the shaver head, and fading of the factory text on the back, everything else works nearly as good as new.  Over the last couple of years I have debated changing it to a newer model.  In fact, I&#x27;m an electronics junkie,and if you look at some of the reviews I&#x27;ve made, you&#x27;ll know that I won&#x27;t hesitate to spend thousands on the latest gadget.  I was itching to find an excuse to replace this shaver, but I seriously cannot find a reason to do it.  In fact, I fear that the newer models may be less durable than these older ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutter and shaving block are also of excellent quality.  I have a rather thin beard/mustache, so I probably don&#x27;t put it through the abuse that some of the other burly guys do, but I think I&#x27;ve only changed it something like 4x over the last 12 years, and normally out of guilt for using it for so long as it still seems to cut very finely the day before replacing it some 3 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this is one of those products you are happy to own, and thankful to the manufacturer for engineering.  With everything being Made in China and failing after a short period of time, it is refreshing to know that there are some solid manufacturers out there that are designing, engineering and manufacturing everything in-house.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun Shaver 10 years ago! Only recently replaced with a newer 7 series model. I wanted to write this review to join the folks who have similar experiences. However, many did not experience or mention that the Clean&amp;Charge unit is not as durable as the shaver itself. The shaver is rock solid! Even the plastic foil protection cap is still working fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only piece within the shaver not working anymore is the battery. For almost 7 years I have never used the cord for shaving, but only for charging! All cordless shaving! Then, 3 years ago, the battery died, did not provide the power for a close and quick shave, but the shaver still served connected to power supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, again, the Clean%Charge unit failed after 5-6 years of use. It suddenly stopped working. Presumably it was an electronic malfunction. I had to replace it and paid $60 for a new unit! Clearly it was cheaply manufactured and was not comparable to the shaver it comes with. What a shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great Braun shaver overall, replaced with another newer 7 series.</li>
    <li> I have tried several electric shavers, but was always disapointed with the way it performed. In the past I&#x27;ve used norelcos, including the model with the shaving gel.  While it made shaving more comfortable, it did&#x27;nt give me a close shave, and it caused all the hairs to get glued to the blades. So I switched back to the mach 3, which shaved real close, but left razor burn all over my chin.  &lt;BR&gt;   &lt;BR&gt;After buying the Braun 7526, I was shocked by how close of a shave I got.  Takes off three days worth of beard very easily.  Also, the cleaning system does a great job.  Atfer the cleaning cycle, you can take the foil off and you will not find one single hair. Also, it leaves the razor smelling lemony fresh.  All in all, the best electric I&#x27;ve ever had, cuts almost as close as a blade, but no irritation.  Also like the light that lets you know when it has a low charge on it.  The battery life is great.  Tested it out, and it went over three weeks before the red light came on.  Highly recommend to anyone looking to ditch the blade or their norelco!</li>
    <li> I started shaving with an electric razor at age 11.  That is all I used until I turned 18 and shaved with a blade for six or seven years.  I just loved how close a blade got--maybe I used cruddy electrics, or whatever, but I hated dealing with the cleaning, and they never felt very close.  But my wife bought me this wonderful gizmo for christmas (maybe it&#x27;s because I was shaving only every other day dur to skin pain!), and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to blades.  After two weeks, I think my face has adapted to the razor, and it shaves 99.5% as close as a blade, but with way less irritation and time expenditure.  Now I can shave every day and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!&lt;BR&gt;Now, this gizmo is fabulous due to the cleaning stand.  It is so simple to use and it really isn&#x27;t as expensive as some of those people out there want to say it is; you can get 2 refill cartridges at target for like ten bucks, so really, five bucks a month for an always clean razor?  Can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;BR&gt;Now, I know the 7680 has a fancy LCD screen, but why do you need that?  You don&#x27;t.  Save the money and get the 7526.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.  (Caveat:  my wife got mine at BB on humongous sale)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews here saying that this shaver is not as good as the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; systems.  Well, the fact is, some people just prefer the shave they get from one shaver or the other.  I&#x27;ve used both, and for me, the foil type shavers work better.  They shave closer and shave with less irritation.  I do agree that not all shavers work well on all types of beards, or all parts of your face.  For me, this shaver not only shaves closer, but is easier to keep clean and the charging system keeps the battery in better condition so it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;I use the cleaning system once a week, and every day after shaving, I simply open the foil shaving head part way (not removing it all the way) and run it for a few seconds to clear most of the hair out of the head.  I thought I would like the \\&quot;rinse under water\\&quot; types better, but keeping the shaving head dry actually makes it easier to keep clean, and keeps it smelling clean.&lt;br /&gt;I just returned from a week long vacation and the battery lasted the entire week without charging.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has read each of the reviews, you must ask yourself how long the people reviewing this product have owned it.  I owned one for about a year, and I can honestly say that it is an over-priced peice of junk.&lt;br /&gt;First, the refills are hard to find, and you can&#x27;t use the cleaner/recharger without the refills.  Second, it takes up a lot of vanity space.  Third, and most important, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the razor and I loved it.  Six months later, it needed a new shaver head replacement.  Six months after that the shaver started vibrating excessively, it sounded more like clippers than a razor.  It was the end, it was broken.  A replacement shaver costs $70 or more... I decided to buy a Norelco...</li>
    <li> OK.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;d like to give a small background.  I was a long time blade-only user.  Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 Turbo gave me the absolute closest shave I&#x27;d ever gotten when combined with Gillette Edge shaving gel.  My biggest problem - the blades price.  $15 for 4 tiny lil blades?  WAYYY too overpriced.  I must have spent about $120 on blades alone.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;d tried the rotary type and other of the in-line type of electric shavers.  The rotary kept snagging my hairs, and the inline didn&#x27;t cut at all.  So I was a little apprehensive about going back.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;m an African American whose facial hair grows rapidly.  I find I have to shave twice a day.  As a working man, I often don&#x27;t have time (and am too lazy) for that.  So I picked this up at Rite-Aid (who has it for $30 cheaper than Amazon).&lt;BR&gt;My first impression was that it felt very well put together, and smelled very nice.&lt;BR&gt;I need to put this up for the African Americans out there, because in order for this shaver to earn its keep, there are some things you need to do first, or it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;First, you need the right electric pre-shave cream.  I use Williams &amp;quot;Lectric&amp;quot; Pre Shave cream.  It makes the hairs very easy to shave.&lt;BR&gt;Second, you MUST shave with a razor the very first time.  Especially if you&#x27;re prone to razor bumps.  The blade is designed to help get rid of the bumps.  If there&#x27;s bumps, the foil will not cut close at all.  After you do the first shave with a razor, then use this for maintenance, and I guarantee you that it will do its job.&lt;BR&gt;Third, DO NOT wash your face beforehand; wash it after.  if you wash your face beforehand, the hairs soften and get harder to cut.  Since we have curly facial hair, it will naturally aim for your face instead of straight out.&lt;BR&gt;Fourth, after shaving, wash your face with a good face wash, like Clearasil or something.  IT will clear off the dirt, oil, pre-shave, hairs, and everything else.&lt;BR&gt;Fifth, finish everything off with a good aftershave. &lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve done all of that, use the razor as a routine.  I use it twice a day, I clean it once every two days.  There&#x27;s no need to use the cleaner EVERY day; that&#x27;s how you run out of fluid fast.  In fact, I just use a compressed air can (keyboard cleaner) to clean between the blades.  Works just fine for me.&lt;BR&gt;I have about 5 more steps to my routine.  Here&#x27;s what I do (to make sure my face is the ultimate snooth it can be):&lt;br /&gt;- preshave lotion&lt;BR&gt;- shave with electric shaver&lt;BR&gt;- wash with Clearasil Daily Face Wash&lt;BR&gt;- quick Stridex pad over shaved area (dries out any remaining oil)&lt;BR&gt;- all over astringent (I use Sea Breeze) until there&#x27;s no dirt on the cotton ball&lt;BR&gt;- all over Clarifying Toner (makes sure my skin tone remains consistent, I use Clean &amp;amp; Clear)&lt;BR&gt;- aftershave (I use Gillette)&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s a lot, but my face looks strides better when I go the distance like that.  I could always half it and just do the minimum, but my face doesn&#x27;t look anywhere near as good as when I do all of it.  Besides, it takes me all of 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Although this is the first and only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned (up til this item, I had been using a Gillette Sensor Excel and other razors since 1987), I won&#x27;t go into too much detail since plenty of others have already done that. So here&#x27;s my personal &amp;quot;Pros and Cons&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;1- No sink or water necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2- No messy shaving cream/gel necessary.&lt;br /&gt;3- Convenient. Shave anytime, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;4- Nick and cuts are very rare.&lt;br /&gt;5- Sideburn trimmer is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;6- Battery seems to last quite some time before needing recharging.&lt;br /&gt;7- Cleaning process is slick. It really removes every little bit of hair from the unit.&lt;br /&gt;8- Blades last at least year. I&#x27;m still on the first set (I shave 2-3 times per week).&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;1- Takes a lot longer to shave with than using a blade -- usually 5 or so minutes! You have to go over the same spots multiple times. Even then, some parts (like my jawline) feel scratchy no matter how many times I go over it.&lt;br /&gt;2- Decently close shave, but not as close a blade. So stubble returns more quickly. Which in turn means you shave more often. Other times, you feel like you have to grind the thing into your face to really get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;3- Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut longer whiskers that are lying flat. Blades always get those.&lt;br /&gt;4- Requires charging.&lt;br /&gt;5- Requires cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;6- Cleaning carts are $5 a pop. You can try refilling them on your own like a previous reviewer mentioned. I tried it and the results were not good.&lt;br /&gt;7- Cleaning process is noisy.&lt;br /&gt;8- Fragile. I&#x27;ve read that if you drop it once on a hard floor, it&#x27;s history.&lt;br /&gt;9- Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the Cons do outweigh the Pros. Hope this helps you make your own decision. Would I do it again? Most likely, no. When I travel, I still take a blade. It&#x27;s lighter, cheaper, doesn&#x27;t need recharging, and I won&#x27;t care if it gets dropped, broken or stolen.</li>
    <li> I recently got this shaver and am very pleased with it. The battery life is great and it gives you a nice clean shave. I especially love the fact that it cleans itself. The lubrication it uses emits a very pleasant lemony  scent. One thing that I do not like about the razor is that the cleaning cycle is kind of loud, but other than that this razor is a great product and helps cut down on the time you spend shaving.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7526 shaver is outstanding.  My previous experience with electric shavers was a number of years ago, and I was never satisfied with the round-headed shaver I had selected.  I went back to blade shaving.  After concluding that technology had likely changed enough to warrant trying an electric shaver again, I selected the Braun 7526 with Clean &amp; Charge Storage stand.  Everything indicated that it was to take a week or more for my face to adjust to electric shaving.  In reality, it took about 3 days, and I was very pleased with that.  Also, I find that I get shaves closer than with a blade.  I also like the ease of being able to \\&quot;hit the 5:00 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; before going out in the evenings -- and doing so rapidly and with ease.  The shaver is incredible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are problems with the bow arm of the Clean and Charge System.  After having my FIRST shaver for a week, the arm would not stay engaged with the shaver.  I returned it to the store and obtained a new unit.  (Kind of nice in a way because I could not return the cleaning solution, so I had an \\&quot;extra\\&quot; one of those!)  After using the new shaver and cleaning/charge unit for a month, the same problem developed with the arm.  I called Braun, and was advised to take it to a local authorized repair location rather than exchanging it again.  While not stated directly, I got the impression that Braun knew of a minor defect with this unit and was more confident that the repair location would have the repair pieces that were more likely to result in a permanent solution.  I took it to the repair location where I was informed that many of these have been brought in for repairs, and that Braun does know of the problem.  I&#x27;m waiting to see if this repair process will solve the problem for good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the shaver so much that I&#x27;m willing to go through the hassles with the cleaning system to get the problem solved.  Braun customer response via phone was quick, courteous, helpful.  A previous e-mail to them went unanswered.  I firmly believe in the cleaning system -- when it is functioning properly, it is great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who would have thought there would be so much to say about a shaver?  If you read all of this, I hope it was helpful!</li>
    <li> Why I need a shaver if I have to use a blade to finish the bad job? Avoid Braun shavers! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have hyper sensitive skin, and this shaver did not work for me. I tried using it a few times and did I not get a good shave out of it. It irritated my skin and I eventually just got rid of it and went back to razors. I</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is not perfect or as good as some reviews claim it to be. The braun 6000 series (now obsolete after this product came out) gives a much better shave believe it or not and the foil is shaped better than this one giving an easier shave to the face. Also I didnt like the fact that the braun 7526 has a cradle charger which means it cant be used as a corded shaver if the charge was low. You have to wait for it to recharge again which doesnt take that long but if you are in a rush often to get to work or dont wanna wait around than this can be an annoying problem compared to just plugging one in such as the braun 6000 series razors could be used as cordless or corded and and you can finish up without wasting any more time. As far as the actual shave the 7526 can give you a close shave but I have to go over the same spot several times to get it and this causes more skin irritation. This is not a bad shaver but is not nearly as good as the 6000 series designed brauns. Right now it sits unused for the most part as a backup shaver or emergency shaver in case my braun 6520 fails at some point. I truely believe that Braun made a mistake by making their 6000 series razors obsolete to this one because I and I know many others find the 7526 to be not as good and wouldve liked to see stores still selling the 6000 brauns. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> First, I generally distrust all electric razors as gimmicks.  I had tried the cheapies (and got what I paid for) and a more moderately priced one (and didn&#x27;t get nearly what I paid for!) and gave up on electrics all together.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I got this Braun.  My wife had been noticing how badly and how easily I get razor burn from blades.  Needless to say, I was noticing too, so I decided to go on Amazon and see what razors had the best ratings, for an acceptable price.  I found this Braun and decided to go ahead and try it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a TERRIFIC razor!  Now I heard that electrics don&#x27;t get as close as a blade, but this is just about as good.  My beard (which grows every which way but straight) took to the razor very quickly and nobody notices a difference in my shave, which is good because I&#x27;m really anal about it.  And no razor burn!  The only thing I have a hard time getting with it are the whiskers that grows around the bottom of my Adam&#x27;s Apple.  So I keep a simple Bic blade to nick those off.  All in all, this is worth the $$. The cleaning system is very nice as well, but I&#x27;m most impressed with the actual razor itself.  I&#x27;ll NEVER go back to a blade again!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Braun 7526 self cleaning synchro shaver after owning many braun shavers in the past. The most frustrating problem that I encountered was the housing that contains the shaver for storage and cleaning. After 1 1/2 years the arm that locks the shaver in place would not stay down and lock the shaver into position. The locking mechanism simply wore out from removing and replacing the shaver after use. Once the arm is unlockable, the shaver cannot be cleaned or recharged in the housing. You have essentially lost cleaning and charging capability. I was very disappointed that the locking mechanism was so poorly constructed. There is no solution but to purchase a whole new shaver and cleaning housing.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 7526 to replace a 3-year-old 7526 that died. Dropping it once probably did not help things! The NiMH batteries in this shaver are great. I was still getting 14-15 shaves per charge after 3 years, the same as when it was new in 2006. The shaver itself does a good job and is very comfortable to use. It rarely ever \\&quot;pulls,\\&quot; which is a problem I had with other brand shavers. The new one seems even smoother and better than the first one, so they may have improved the model a bit in the interim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 7526 now for 5 yrs and have not had one problem and I have to shave almost daily because of my thick beard.  I&#x27;ve gone several days and still no problems (may take a little longer.)  It&#x27;s also very convenient for me- I can save time by using my commute to shave (no mirrors, cream, or water needed.)  When I get home I plug it in the cleaning-charging station and it&#x27;s ready to go again in the morning.    This is the first electric razor i&#x27;ve owned and will never go back and I&#x27;ll stay with the Braun brand--- great product.</li>
    <li> There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I&#x27;ll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery.</li>
    <li> I got this razor before I went to college about 6 years ago. I first used it and I loved it; close shave, clean feeling.  Unfortunately I started to get very bad razor burn from it after a bit.  Didn&#x27;t know what it was from.  I went back to a regular blade for years. One day I found the razor again and decided to give it another shot (years older and wiser;) ).  I noticed I never changed the blade, so I did that, and tried it again and it worked like it was new again. I also noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting as close as a regular blade until I started using pre-shave.  As soon as I started the pre-shave the irritation and the \\&quot;closeness issue\\&quot; went away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just make sure you keep it clean, keep the blade fresh (I think once every 18 months), and use pre-shave!</li>
    <li> Hands down no contest game set match. This little unit is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Yes, the replacement cartridges are going to add up. So what. Try and you&#x27;ll never regret it.</li>
    <li> How could this be an out of stock item, perhaps it is because of the sale price. This is crazy I worked all day cannot make it to your crazy store sales for people to fight and act crazy... I guess I need to find a new store on line!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a razor for years, after using a couple of cheap (&lt;$50) shavers in the past.  I thought I would spend the extra money and get this shaver for Christmas, and I&#x27;m not sorry.  This one is well worth the money.  If you are or have been frustrated by inexpensive shavers, try this one.  I&#x27;m on my second day, and I&#x27;m getting shaves almost as close as a blade.  Given the 2-3 week break-in period, things can only get better.</li>
    <li> Within months the cleaner assembly started failing and would not accept the razor. It was repaired under warranty but after a few months the same problem has rendered the cleaning system useless again. Otherwise its a good razor packaged with a useless gimmick. When it did work he cleaning cartrdiges were expensive. Save your money and avoid this fiasco.</li>
    <li> The razor is very nice, but I got some razor burn after my first shave.  Hopefully it will go away in a week or two and hopefully it will also shave closer.&lt;BR&gt;All I want to do now is find out how the hair clippings are cleaned from the unit, where do they go out of the razor??  They can&#x27;t fit thru the little foil holes, can they?</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable razor that I have ever used.  I have tried a variety of razors over the years.  Because of my prominent Adam&#x27;s apple, it was very hard for me to find an electric shaver that felt comfortable.  The Panasonics and the Norelcos always irritated my neck area.  That was even after using them exclusively for several weeks.  Fortunately for me, I found this Braun.  I have been using this for two years.  So far, it has performed very well.  The Panasonic Wet/Dry gave a closer shave.  But it also irritated my skin the most.  The Norelco that I had before also shaved very close.  But I had a hard time shaving my neck area with it.  So, I finally gave the Braun Syncro a try.  After a while, I started getting the most comfortable shave ever from an electric.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself would get 5 stars.  However, the cleaning system that came with it is a bit expensive to maintain.  The cleaning cartridges that the cleaning system uses can get expensive.  I suggested to Braun that perhaps they should sell a reusable plastic cartridge, along with a liter (or 2) of the cleaning fluid in bulk bottle.  The consumer could simply empty the plastic cartridge and then refill with fluid.  That would save the consumer quite a lot.  The cleaning system does a good job of cleaning, lubricating, and recharging the razor.</li>
    <li> After using a rotary shaver for a few years and being disappointed with the closeness, I decided to pay extra for a Braun to compare.  So far, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the shave -- it actually does get closer than a blade (for me), and one touch cleaning is a nice feature.  The main problem is the lack of space in the head for clippings and the tendency for them to fall out, making a mess of whatever you&#x27;re shaving over.  Forget shaving in the car on the way to work!  Cleaning it every day minimizes the problem, but it makes me wonder... was this an intentional design flaw by Braun to increase sales of the cleaning cartridges?  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m african-american and my beard growth is light but this shaver can&#x27;t cut it.  It misses any hairs that don&#x27;t stand straight out.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using a 15 year old Norelco that won&#x27;t hold a charge.  The Braun looks great but it&#x27;s a waste of money.  I plan to donate mine to Goodwill or Salvation Army.</li>
    <li> I said I would only write a review about the Braun if I thought it gave me a great shave.  Well, it came through.  I have owned different Remingtons for about 20 years now and they gave me OK shaves. I have used disposable razors in the past and other than having to wear toliet paper on my face, they also give great shaves.  But with the Braun, I don&#x27;t have to wear any. In my opinon it was &amp;quot;as close as a razor&amp;quot;, its quiet and the cleaning system gets rid of all the hair, making it look and feel like new.  The owners manual claims that you only have to replace the blade and screen at about 18 months, try that with any other electric razor.  I have used it for about a month now and I can&#x27;t see going back to my Remington.  If you&#x27;re like me and worry about spending the added money, don&#x27;t, this has been an investment I&#x27;m happy I made.</li>
    <li> The Braun Synchro System line consists of several models: 7570, 7546, 7526, and 7505. The top of the line is, naturally, the 7570. I suggest you go to [...] to see the spec comparison, as this site does a good job of showing you the differences. In a nutshell, they ALL have the same motor and cut exactly the same. The differences are in the number of indicators (the 7570 has an LCD screen), some additional chrome trim, and the inclusion of the cleaning system (the 7505 comes without it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the 7526. At the time I bought it, there was quite a price difference between the 7526 and the higher 7546 and 7570 models. The 7526 comes with the cleaning system, while the 7505 does not. Other than that, the 7526 simply has only one LED indicator to show the remaining charge, and no decorative chrome trim on the head. Quite frankly, I see no need to get the 7570 in order to see exactly how much charge I have left, how long the cleaning system has been running, or how many hours I&#x27;ve spent shaving! All models will show a flashing red light when the charge is low. At that point you have two shaves left. Simply plug it into the socket when you&#x27;re done and in about an hour or two you are fully charged. How hard is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I bought the 7526, the 7570 shaver is essentially the same unit, so this review will apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details on the shaver itself: The Synchro System has a new high speed motor, and I think it is the fastest one for a shaver under $200. I find I get a very close shave, when using traditional foil shaver techniques (see Epinions.com website). Also, a single charge seems adequate enough to operate the shaver for two weeks. The motor and battery are light weight, so this shaver is not heavy, and it fits nicely in your hand. Three usage settings are available: 1) pivoting head, 2) locked head, and 3) trimmer extension. I use all three at various times--once again, Braun thought this out very well. It is also fairly rugged, but the plastic can crack if dropped from 4&#x27; or more onto a hard tile surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system: I find this device very ingenious, for a variety of reasons. First, it really does clean the shaver well. Second, it isn&#x27;t overbearingly loud. And third, it has indicators to show when cleaning and charging are done. The fourth is revenue. Braun was very clever about this. If men are only going to spend money once every two years on the foil and cutter block, how could they make more money? Well, this cleaning system is the key. If the cleaner is used the way Braun recommends, you end up replacing the cleaning cartridge every month. The smart thing to do is buy the \\&quot;value pack\\&quot;, which brings the cost down to about $5 per cartridge. How do you know when to change it? Well, the cleaning system will tell you. It detects when there is a high amount of particles in the solution, or if the solution is too low to flow through, and will flash the red cartridge light while simply not running until you replace the cartridge. The cleaner unit itself is slightly big (about 12\\&quot; tall x 5\\&quot; round), so you may have a little difficulty finding a place for it. And don&#x27;t think of bringing it with you when traveling! (You don&#x27;t really need to clean everyday anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I found a trick that Braun will despise me for. You can minimize the use of the cleaning solution and save big $$$. How do you do this? Well first of all, after each shave I dump my \\&quot;whisker debris\\&quot; down the sink, like you would normally do with the Flex Integral. It doesn&#x27;t take long--simply pop off the foil, tap it in the sink, blow on both sides of the cutter block, replace the foil, and you&#x27;re done in 10 seconds. This reduces the number of particles in the cleaning solution. So, why use the cleaning system at all, you may ask? It does do an excellent job of cleaning the cutter block, and whisker dust that is stuck on it and within the head and foil holder. A tedious task, even once or twice a week. Whendo I use the cleaning system? Well, usually whenever the shaver needs to be recharged. At this point, I take out the cartridge from my drawer, remove the top plugs, and slide it into the cleaner. Then I slide in the shaver and let the cleaner do its work. When the cleaning and charging is done, I remove the cleaning cartridge, reseal it with the plastic plugs, and put it away. This way the solution level does not get low from evaporation! Clever, eh? The only catch is that if you try to charge the shaver while mounted in the cleaner without the cartridge, it will not work. But you can always plug it in directly, without the cleaner. Anyway, that&#x27;s my trick for getting around one this somewhat minor drawback. Some have said it&#x27;s nice to have a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; shaver to use each time, but I find the cleaning process works well enough to use once per charge (just dump the whisker debris after each shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If price is no object, get the 7570. Otherwise, I recommend getting the 7526 if you find it priced low enough below the 7546 and 7570. NOTE: I paid $139 for my 7526 in 2000.usually whenever the shaver needs to be recharged.

    <li> I bought this razor 2 months ago and have been very impressed with the closeness and ease of shaving.  Almost exactly close as a blade but with no water, cream or mess.  However in the last couple of weeks the part that latches the shaver in only will stay clamped occasionly.  When I went to the store to exchange it I noticed there was a new model (8500 series) which did not even have the defective part as part of the unit.  My suggestion is to buy the new model that won&#x27;t break on you.</li>
    <li> The good news: I like the shaver. I get a close, comfortable shave, and the shaver feels good to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bad news: The cleaning/charging stand lasted about 3 months. The latch broke that holds the shaver in, and so it can&#x27;t be cleaned or charged in the stand. I contacted Braun, and apparently, I&#x27;m not \\&quot;technically inclined\\&quot; enough to replace the entire charging stand. I have to send it in to a service center, wait 4 weeks or more, and have them send me a new stand back.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOT recommended.</li>
    <li> I had never owned a electric razor before and after reading reviews of three different ones, I bought the Braun 7526.  It shaves almost as close as a razor blade.  It took me about a month before my beard  got used to being shaved with the Braun 7526.  Now the shave is very good and I use much less time with no mess.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use the clean &amp; charge system every other day and the cartridge lasted for two months.  I noticed my face getting dry, so now I do a regular shave every Sunday.  Doing this cleans up some hair that the Braun 7526 can&#x27;t get and adds the moisturizer to my face that&#x27;s needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the Braun 7526, the price is right, it feels good in my hand and it lets me know when to clean, charge and change the cartridge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note: I did completely read the instruction book (four times) that came with the razor and I advise you to do the same.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
    <li> I have used Remington and Norelco for years and went to Braun for the self-cleaning feature.  After about the third shave, I started getting closer shaves than I had ever gotten with the Norelco or Remington.  I was extremely pleased with the effortless cleaning and good shave for about four months, but then the shaving head began to sound like a chain saw.  I shaved on that way for another three or four months before buying a replacement cutter head and foil thinking that would fix it.  It didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my Norelco to keep from waking everyone in the house in the morning.  Maybe I just got a lemon, but I&#x27;m going to try something else before I try Braun again.</li>
    <li> I brought this shaver because I liked a very old (circa 1988) Braun shaver that I still have and that still works and on the strength of the Amazon user reviews. But I am underwhelmed, and now--6 months later--I see several mediocre reviews here! I agree with them. It does take a long time to shave, and I don&#x27;t find that the shave is very close, especially on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning stand is nice, and hopefully it won&#x27;t break anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I am asking too much from an electric. I bought a standard Norelco first and returned it for the money back guarantee. But my very old Braun did much better.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 1 year, and I need to shave every day.  It is good and is alot beter than any razor I have ever used, even the mach 3.  It has its draw backs, but is a good shaver.  I have been in the navy for 4 years now and I have to shave every day.  It does miss alot of spots on your neck that a razor would get, but it is so fast and eazy to use you can touch up on thoughs spots with the trimer quick.  A invalid complaint some people have is that it costs money for the cleaning filters, well, it costs money for shaving cream and disposable razors too.   You do have to change the foil after about 8 to 10 months unlike the 18 month time table they give, but the cleaning filter for me lasts alot lot longer than they state in the directions and I clean it every time I use it.  It is loud when cleaning, but oh well.  Oh, on heavy beards, this thing works outstanding.  I have gone over 5 days without shaving and this thing just powered through everything.  I dont have as thick of beard as some people, but I am up there and this shaver does have power.  When I am out to sea it works great, even without cleaning in the provided equipment, but you do need to plug it in to get the power you want, all and all a great shaver and worth the hundred bucks you are going to spend, I shave every day and recomend it.</li>
    <li> This razor does everything it should and does it well. Braun makes the best razors around. &lt;br /&gt;However, I had this 9 months and the storage stand wouldn&#x27;t stay clamped. Hence, the cleaning system won&#x27;t work. The company that repaired it said that they have fixed over 300 of these in the past 3 years. Evidently, the alcohol affects a mechanism inside the base.</li>
    <li> This Braun electric shaver gives a very close shave once your beard adjusts to it. It takes a few shaves for this to happen.I also like how clean and fresh the shaver smells after it goes through the clean and charge cycle.  Its modern technology is truely amazing!!</li>
    <li> Seems sturdier than the 7505.  Don&#x27;t know if the clean n&#x27; charge actually is necessary.  It does clean the razor, but so does the brush that&#x27;s included.  I take out the cartridge after each use and recap it.  Seems to last longer that way. I also just use the brush two thirds of the time. Razor works really well.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, I too have a broken charging base. It will no longer suck the cleaning fluid up into the cup to clean my razor. I have used it for approximately 1 year. I will not be purchasing another BRAUN product.</li>
    <li> I have used a blade all my life and will never go back! I love this razor. I refil the cleaning cartrige with alcohol and spray lubricate the razor with Remington SP-4 Shaver Saver. Works Great. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver is a replacement for another model. I like the cleaning feature, which allows the consumer to pick which or all function(s) the cleaning unit allows. Very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone who uses an electric shaver. Plus the price was the lowest I could find on the internet for being new.</li>
    <li> Lasted over 14 years!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin, and a light beard, and had never found an electric razor that gave me anything like a satisfactory shave. I stopped looking about 3 years ago. &lt;br /&gt;The reviews of the Syncro were excellent, so I thought that I would give it a try, and it really is great. I like to have a very close shave, and was very happy with the results from the Mach 3, and this is almost as good. Plus it&#x27;s a lot more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner makes things easier, although I&#x27;m not sure that it is a lot better than just brushing the shaver out. At least this way you know that it is getting properly cleaned. &lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the cheaper version without the extra power indicators. The cleaning/charging unit is too big to travel with, but you can just take the cord with you, and it works with both 110 and 240 volts. I don&#x27;t really see why you need a charge indicator - most people charge it overnight, and keep it fully charged that way. If you&#x27;re away from electricity for a long time, chances are, you&#x27;re somewhere where they don&#x27;t care a lot about your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;So I am going to stop using a blade, which makes my life a lot better, and I will shave more frequently, which will make my wife&#x27;s life better. This one really does work.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used them all. I&#x27;ve owned Remington&#x27;s and Norelco&#x27;s, linear and rotary, and I&#x27;ve even owned other Braun&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this when I dropped and killed my Braun Flex Intergral Ultraspeed (which used to be the best electric razor ever, in my opinion). The thing is amazing. It shaves even closer than my old Flex Intergral.&lt;br /&gt;I only have two gripes with it:&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;Two: I with they had re-designed the pop-out timmer. It seems like an afterthought, and you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re trimming while you&#x27;re using it. If you use it, as I do, to clean up the back of your neck between haircuts, you had better be careful.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver as good as any on the market, but one has to keep in mind the cost of cleaning fluid and screen/cutter replacements( three in two years of daily use).&lt;br /&gt;After the third screen broke, I switched back to Norelco...</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about a week ago and it is incredible. I&#x27;ve used blades for the past couple of years mainly because I wasn&#x27;t able to find an electric that got my beard anywhere close to the smoothness that a blade can do. This shaver really impressed me. No more bumps from the blade and a shave that is just as close! The cleaning system is awesome too! It is noisey when it&#x27;s cleaning but only a bit louder than when you&#x27;re shaving with it, and for an electric it&#x27;s quieter than most.       I would definately recommend this to anyone considering switching from blades to an electric!</li>
    <li> I have used corded shavers for 20 years.  The rechargeable ones never seemed to have the same power as the corded models.  When my last remington died, I gave this model a try.  It works exceptionally well easily matching the power of any of my corded razors.  While there are alwasy a few stray hairs that you have to touch up with a razor with any electric shaver, this Braun dramatically limits the amount of touch up necessary to where most days I don&#x27;t bother.  The cleaner, while it appears gimmicky, is really nice.  It does a great job and leaves a nice smell on the razor.  You also don&#x27;t need to use it every day.  Battery life is also very good.  I&#x27;m averaging about three weeks between charges.    Update:2010 still using the same shaver.  Unbelievable.  I have to hand it to Braun.  I have never had a shaver last 7 years.  Still going strong and am still very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement in shaving quality in comparison with their previous model that I used for several years (Flex Integral, 6xxx).</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shaver!  Always gives a great shave and it&#x27;s a pleasure to start each day with a sanitized, fresh-smelling shaver.  Others in their reviews have complained about the cost of the cleaning solution - about $5 per month according to manufacturer&#x27;s suggested use.  I&#x27;ve found, however, that the solution lasts much longer than that if you simply get most of the whiskers out of the mechanism before each automated cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Just press the buttons that release the foil (don&#x27;t remove the foil all the way, just loosen it) and then run the unit over the john or a waste basket.  After you&#x27;ve disposed of all the whiskers, re-attach the foil and run the unit in the cleaner.  The solution lasts twice as long this way, with very little effort.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I had been using a Mach 3 Turbo, which provided a wonderfully close shave and left me hesitant to switch to an electric razor.  I have previously given a test-run to a friend&#x27;s Norelco razor and wasn&#x27;t impressed, it didn&#x27;t get nearly as close as my razor.  Because of that experience, I naturally assumed that no electric razor could provide me with the closeness of a natural razor.  But, for quite some time I&#x27;ve had my eye on this model - which is the same as the more superior 7680, minus the LCD screen, which definately isn&#x27;t worth an additional $50.  Well, after finding the item on sale - but still with a price tag that was a little more hefty than I had ever imagined spending for a razor - I finally convinced myself to give it a try.  I&#x27;d have to say that it provides me with the closeness of blade - without the hassle.  The cleaning system is incredibly nice, and also effective.  I&#x27;d have to say Braun has one incredible product here, and I would definately buy another in the future without any question.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great, but rather than sheduling your cleanings, as I&#x27;ve seen in some reviews, it&#x27;s much simpler and cleaner to just pop it in the stand a let it clean itself after every use. Unfortunately, this necessitates a cleaning cartridge replacement every month at about $7.00 a pop. The cleaning solution is just alcohol with a little scent and lubricant added. I refill mine by rinsing out the old alcohol and stubble with water, then I refill it with fresh, cheap, isopropyl alcohol, and pour in a little Rite-Aid preshave lotion for the scent and lubrication. I&#x27;m good for one more month. It works great, and smells better than the original solution. So I don&#x27;t mind letting it clean itself after every use.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my son since he has begun his career as an attorney and needs a nice clean shave. He is very happy with the shave and says that it is very close except for some of the neck hairs that seem to get missed. He also likes the automatic cleaning mechanism on this razor because he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it at all. Very good product.</li>
    <li> -&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This unit *will* fail eventually.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 of these.  The heads will shave nicely at first, even with the spewing of shavings and the razor burn, but eventually the mechanism will fail as has been stated here in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The normal quiet humm will turn into a rather irritating buzz.  It appears that the mechanism that moves the blades back and forth is the culprit (The unit is difficult to open, so this can not be verified).  The blades will start out covering the entire width with a quiet humm, when the mechanism breaks, the blades stick in the middle 40% and just buzz.  The shaver will *almost* shave at this point, but it will take much longer and will hurt much, much more as you attempt to get the thing to actually shave.&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised to see so many reviews here (as compared to other shavers listed here).  I agree with the 5 star reviews -- the unit is nice (as I said, I have had 2, and 4 Braun shavers all together), but the mechanism on the syncro is just faulty so I am forced to give a 1 star rating from my experiences with this line!  If they didn&#x27;t fail, then I&#x27;d give it a 5 star rating, as the points listed in the 5 star ratings are true while the unit is functioning properly.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is just my opinion from my experience.  Your mileage and beard way vary.  No, Braun, I do not want a complimentary replacement -- I am switching brands.  For now.&lt;BR&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll try another Braun (model) in another few years, if the reviews don&#x27;t list so many mechanism related failures.&lt;br /&gt;Scott</li>
    <li> I recieved one of these for Christmass in 2002 and for the first 6 months it was great. Close shave (although not as a close as a $1.00 disposable blade but convienient) and east to use. However, at 6 months the foil somehow got a hole in it. I didn&#x27;t notice it and the first pass of the razor left a long bloody scratch in my face. The new foil and blades were about $30.00. About 6 months later the same thing happened, then in April 2004 the cleaner stopped working. Counting up the refills and the repairs this thing has cost be almost $100.00 in a year, almost the cost of a new one. Feels like this little scheme is a revenue stream for Braun. I would seriously pass on this unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shavers for years.  I thought they gave me a great shave and I liked being able to just rinse them out under the faucet.  The results with my Panasonic were very good, although not quite as close as when I&#x27;d occassionally use a blade.  I got this shaver because of the cleaning system.  Even with my Panasonic shaver I found I got a better shave when it was well cleaned.  This Braun shaver surprised me at how great it is.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost 3 weeks now and it consistently gives me the BEST shave I&#x27;ve ever had... including better than a blade.  I read all the reviews here prior to purchase and questioned if it would be as good as my previous shavers, but I&#x27;ve been very impressed.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I Read some of the reviews - good and bad- and decided to buy this for my husband for Christmas. He just loves it. He&#x27;s had no problems at all so far, and he loves getting a clean razor every day. I would recommend this product very highly.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor 8 months ago.  After 4 months, the shaving screen began to come apart and had to be replaced.  After 6 months, the device that provides the electrical connection to the razor would not stay down, and cleaning / charging would stop.  A little piece of paper to provide more friction seemed to solve the problem.  And now, the razor starts cleaning at any time, whether the razor is in the stand or not, spewing cleaning solution everywhere until its unplugged.  When the razor is in the stand, it won&#x27;t clean or charge.  The shave was OK, but nothing special, and I will never by a Braun product again.  This thing is junk.</li>
    <li> It has been many at least 40 years since I have owned and used an electric shaver, but this has to be the best on the market. It tells you when it needs cleaning, and when the charge is getting low, it tells you how many minutes of shaving time remain. It also does a very good job in getting close shaves with no irritation to the skin. Recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about a year and a half and have changed the cutting block once, so I think I can say that I&#x27;m speaking from experience. The hairs that this shaver cuts are indeed cut very close. Unfortunately, it only cuts about half of your remaining hair in each pass, so you never get all of your stubble removed. You end up isolated stubble here and there, smooth skin in between, and irritated skin everywhere from making so many passes (at high pressure). I bought this for the cleaning system, thinking it would be cleaner and save me time in the morning. It may be cleaner, but it actually takes longer to shave. I&#x27;ll be buying a Norelco that I can rinse with water and save my skin and the money I would otherwise spend on cleaning cartridges.</li>
    <li> If I had to do it over again, I would have bought a Norelco. My old Norelco needed new blades, and this razor was deeply discounted, so I decided to give it a try. I have used this shaver for a couple years now. After around six months, the foil developed holes in the corners and needed to be replaced. A new foil cost around $30. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun cleaning solution is not good. With my Norelco, I rinsed it under the tap. With this Braun, you need to run it though this noisy contraption that takes up space. The cleaner requires alcohol, which needs to be replaced every few months because the filters get clogged with hair. Another reviewer gave instruction on how to empty the container and refill it with oil and alcohol, which is what I do, but it is not enjoyable. This Braun cleaner is significantly worse than just using tap water for the Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Near the end of a shave, the shaver starts dropping little hairs all over the sink, even though I keep the shaver clean. Occasionally, the foil head pops off and little hairs go flying everywhere. I never had this problem with the Norelco.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes me a couple minutes longer to shave with this Braun than it did with my Norelco.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver works, but it is a maintenance hassle and is definitely not as good as the high-end Norelco (which costs twice as much). For a product I use every day, I should have spent the extra money for the better product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am a lightweight shaver.  I received this shave as a birthday gift.  I had to return the first on after 2.5 months at Target.  Fortunatly the gift receipt lasted 90 days.  The cleaning base broke but I think I waited too long to change the cleaning cartridge and it stopped up the unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second unit has lasted over a year with no problems.  It is really noisy and sometimes I have to wait to clean it until the weekend when the wife and I wake up at the same time.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution is more alcohol than lubricant, but if you wait a few seconds and let it heat up, it gives a nice Lemony scent while you shave.  This is the biggest plus since I can&#x27;t stand smelly shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do not have to shave but once every two days with a razor since my stubble grows so slow.  I have to shave every day with the Braun electric because it does not shave that close.  It leaves random hairs to be caught next time you look in the mirror and think, how did that hair get that long?? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I had a preference, I would have liked a different gift and just used a razor with gel for a cleaner cut.  I give it three stars because for an electric shaver it sure beats a straight edge while on vacation.</li>
    <li> 2 stars for the cleaning system, cuz THere is a difference than braun 5790 cleaning system. (finally a cleaning that actually works!)    One star for the trimmer that also \\&quot;quite\\&quot; works, a better than trimmer in braun 5790 that never worked, however still not perfect.    However, first thing one look for in a shaver is how good is it at shaving. This one is no better at shaving than braun 5790. The hair that braun 5790 could not get on my neck, braun 7526 is not better..    Anyway, for me, Braun 7526 does better job in shaving than Gillette M3Power. (I have thick dense beard, I need to shave everyday, and I still need to shave everyday, however, with Gillette M3Power, in the afternoon I had my beard grown again. now with Braun 7526, I have a closer shave, and it takes till next morning so my beard grows again). One star is added here.    two years ago, I bought from bestbuy braun 5790 with replacement plan (only $10 for a two year replacement plan). B4 the two years ended, I took advantage of the replacement plan and got braun 7526, thinking it would be a far better upgrade. (not up to my expectations as an upgrade in shaving).    5790 to 7526, u would think there is a lot of changes and improvements, but not really!</li>
    <li> This shaver is terrible. It does not shave nearly as close as a blade and I need to use a blade to \\&quot;finish\\&quot; my neck, under nose and side burns. What a waste of money....</li>
    <li> Similar to another reviewr, I&#x27;ve also had the shaver for about 1.5 years, and the arm on mine broke, making the cleaning mechanism non-functional.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the shaver. I would buy one of braun systems where the cleaner does not have the little arm that extends up. Maybe that will solve the problem.</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned and it lives up to the reputation. It gives a great shave, and I love having a clean shaver after every use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a year and half, and it&#x27;s the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.      This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve had where I&#x27;ve truly been able to get rid of my blades shaver -- before I always kept them around to take care of stubborn hair my electric would miss, but not with this one. The cleaning and charge mechanism is a great bonus too.    My only complaint has been the lifespan of the foil that covers the blades.  My first foil last almost a year -- as expected. I then changed the foil and blades as recommended by Braun.  My replacement foil, however, has lastet less than 6 months.  Parts of the foil are cracking and falling off, leaving the blades exposed.    My Recommendation: Great Shaver... but keep plenty of cleaning solution, and maybe a spare blade and foil set as backup.</li>
    <li> As others have reported, base quit working and left me with several spare expensive tanks.  The self cleaning isn&#x27;t worth the cost of the replacement tanks, especially when the base fails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this model since 2004.  After 6 years I&#x27;m just now starting to look for a newer model simply because the batteries eventually age to the point where you only get 5-6 shaves out of a charge instead of 10-12 (which will happen with any device that uses irreplaceable, rechargeable batteries).  However, the shaver still runs fine and definitely has lasted me longer than I expected when I bought this.  I could probably go another couple of years before replacing it if I didn&#x27;t have the urge to get a new one.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well, ergonomically designed.  Cleaning system more effective than manual cleaning.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had a previous razor of the same make and model. I also have an expensive Norelco razor too but this Braun 7526 is a great product. It shaves close and also fast which my Norelco doesn&#x27;t do well.  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> This model gives a good, overall shave. I still have trouble on my neck area, but this has been typical of any electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned. The REAL reason I bought this was the self cleaning system. It works as advertised, but like so many other reviews I&#x27;ve seen, the locking mechcanism that supplies power to the razor, while its cleaning failed. There are a couple of work-arounds, but for $100, I expect the unit to perform longer than a year.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for three years.  It has just died.  The battery got extremely hot just before it quit working.  Luckily, I came home and noticed it.  It had a burned electrical smell.  I&#x27;m not saying it would have caught on fire, but who knows. Also, the charging stand broke after using it about two years.  It would not lock down on the razor. I was able to charge the razor by plugging the cord directly into it. I could not use the auto cleaning feature as well. The razor worked well for me and gave a close shave.  It shaved closer than the Norelco&#x27;s that I have had.  The Norelco did shave faster with less passes and still keeps on working after many years.  The Braun just doesn&#x27;t seem to have good quality for the high price. I expected it to last longer than it did.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical.  From the item description, it was difficult to tell how the cleaning system worked.  I was concerned that I&#x27;d extract the shaver from the cleaning base and have a wet or messy shaving head, but that&#x27;s not the case.  After each cleaning cycle the shaver head is dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;You simply insert the shaver into the cleaning base, engage the electrical connection, and everything is automatic.  Cleaning solution is pumped up from a cartridge resevoir and passed through the shaver head.  All whisker debris is rinsed away and captured in the cartridge.  The shaver head is simultaneously lubricated.  When all is complete, the shaver is as clean as new, and ready for the next shave.  The entire process takes about 15 minutes.  It works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridges are good for about 30 cleaning cycles. An indicator light on the cleaning base will alert you when it&#x27;s time to replace the cartridge.  You simply pop out the old cartridge, and replace with a new one.  The old one goes into the trash.  Cartridges are sold in packs of two, and cost $5-$6 per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, this model #7526 is about $50.00 cheaper than the more expensive model with the graphic display.  I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want to spend the additional amount for the more expensive model.  As far as I can tell the only difference between models is that the more expensive model graphically indicates how many minutes are left in the cleaning cycle, or how many minutes are left before the battery needs recharging. The model 7526, lets you know when it&#x27;s time to run the recharge cycle by illuminating a red LED.  It&#x27;s all you really need.</li>
    <li> Hey, this thing shaves close! I&#x27;ve had this shaving system for around 8 mos. now and am still very happy with it. My biggest concern before buying (believe it or not) was speed. I started shaving my head around a year ago (if you&#x27;re going to go bald you might as well just do it!) and that&#x27;s a lot of territory to cover every danged morning! Well, it is about twice as fast as my old shaver(s). Seems to have slowed down a tad after a couple of mos., but maybe it&#x27;s just a perception thing. The price of this shaver has come down substantially since I bought it also. ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there is very little reason to not get this great razor now- except one, which with a little guile I have solved...&lt;br /&gt;Those cleaning cartridges are an unadulterated rip-off. But, guess what? All they are is denatured alcohol and a little machine oil (and fake lemon scent). Just take your spent cartridge, clean it out real well, being careful not to damage the nylon screen and let it dry. I just go outside and spray out the old whiskers and stuff with the hose. Pay a visit to your friendly local hardware store and get a small, cheap, ten-year supply of denatured alcohol. Drinking alcohol, if it&#x27;s 100% pure would be even better but much more expensive. All denatured alcohol is, is drinking alcohol with poison added so you can&#x27;t get drunk on the cheap! Then add a teaspoon (more or less) of fine machine oil and fill the cartridge up to the level of a new one and voila- problem solved! I use sewing machine oil because of its fine quality, which you can get at the -you guessed it- sewing machine or yardage stores. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with this except don&#x27;t be ... like me and try to add real lemon juice to restore the lemon fresh scent! It only gums things up! Besides the alcohol smells just fine!&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it. I hope this helps. Have fun and knock yourselves out!</li>
    <li> Have owned at least 3 Braun shavers over the last 15 years and this one is the best yet.  Drives (and sounds) like a Ferrari compared to my old razor.  Very close shave with minimal effort.  I was unsure about the self-clean feature but now wonder how I did without it.  It is a pleasure to have a fresh razor each morning and I appreciate not having to clean it out myself.  Would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a great shave and a great product.</li>
    <li> The shaver itself is nice.  Not as close as a blade, nowhere near as close as the Gilette Mach III that I&#x27;ve been using, and it certainly has a problem with beard stubble, because it doesn&#x27;t grow straight out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost 6 months, and I have to admit that, some days, I want to toss it out the window.  The tidy hum it used to emit as it went about its business is now a deafening roar.  It&#x27;s not very powerful, despite the noise, chattering and shuddering on standard face stubble, and the deafening noise gets worse when it does so.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s obviously a terribly loose fit of the cutter block on the head:  if I hold it tightly, the noise drops considerably.  I&#x27;m amazed that a company like braun could put out a product that falls apart so easily, but, then again, isn&#x27;t the warranty only 3 months?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not kidding:  it&#x27;s so loud that, if I&#x27;m on night shift and use the cleaner to clean this chainsaw of a shaver, I&#x27;m almost afraid I&#x27;ll get a noise complaint from my landlord.  It&#x27;s that loud, and it&#x27;s only getting louder with each week.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t mind replacing the unit every 6 months, then definitely get this shaver;  it&#x27;s very quiet when you first get it.  Me, I&#x27;m about to toss the whole thing out the window and chalk it up to a learning experience.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get something from another company.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  After more than a year I haven&#x27;t a single complaint.  I tried electrics years ago, but always found them wanting in some respect.  This razor consistently gives me a good shave.  &lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that Braun has provided the means to keep the razor working well.  The screen and oscillating blade can be replaced. Braun recommends replacing after 18 months of daily use.  I have been using the original for over a year.  I&#x27;m still happy with the results.  &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system also helps to keep the razor working well.  Just put the razor in its cradle, and, once a week or so, run the clean/charge cycle.  The razor comes out sparking and even smells good.  The cleaning system saves you the trouble of opening the razor and using a brush to clean it out.  The cleaning system is important because Braun recommends shaving when your beard is dry.  So even if you shave before showering, the head won&#x27;t accummulate oils from your skin.  &lt;br /&gt;In summary, it looks to me like the compulsive krauts at Braun have thought-through the whole shaving process and created a razor that will provide a good shave for years to come.</li>
    <li> After about a year and a half with this unit, I have gone through two cleaning stands.  The latch breaks after a few months making the stand a pretty paperweight.  Braun has tacitly acknowledged this design flaw by introducing the Activator model without a latch on the stand, using plain old gravity to hold the razor in.  What a concept. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have broken your stands and don&#x27;t want to shell out for a new razor, you can hunt around online and find a new replacement stand for $40-$50 as I did.  Unfortunately it may not last you much longer than the first. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this razor in December and have been using it daily since.  I don&#x27;t know if it is just the way my skin is, but the shave is not as close as I thought it would be and usually in the lower neck region, it leaves groupings of hair unshaved.  I will use this until it dies, but I don&#x27;t know if I would ever buy another one.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine, but; the charger/cleaner broke after 1 day use.  My latch too would not latch!!  I cound not reach Braun for a replacement sooooooooo I&#x27;ve been stuck with this piece of junk for well over a year.  I use a piece of tape to hold it down, real swell!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had his old one for 11 years and it finally died. I hope to get 10 more years oUT of this new one I got him for Christmas after much searching for this exact razor</li>
    <li> Ok, so I broke down and bought this razor.  I had used a Braun all through college and it failed last year on me (hey, it lasted 8 years).  So when I went shopping I picked up a Norelco instead.  Which worked great at first.  But recently was having problems (wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge, even though I would conditioned the battey, discharge all the way then recharge).  So I went shopping.  I have seen this razor advertised and even looked here at the other reviews.  I thought to myself, &amp;quot;How could a razor be that good.&amp;quot;  Well all the reviewers are right.  Its the best that I have ever used. &lt;br /&gt;First about the razor.  It is similar to the flex series except this one also pivots from left to right.  I didn&#x27;t think this would make a difference but it does.  The battery in the unit is a Ni-Metal Hydrid battery.  That means the battery won&#x27;t build a memory (same battery used in the new digital cellphones).  So you can charge it anytime without worrying about the battery building a memory.  They said to discharge the battery about every 6 months to condition it, I can handle that.  And it works great.  Haven&#x27;t had a good shave like this since I used the Sensor Excel.  It has 50 minutes of use time, which is good for a two week vacation without even having to take a charger.  And the case is very nice for the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Now about the cleaning stand.  This is where I was sceptical.  So the first time I used the razor (I didn&#x27;t have a heavy growth that day but was shocked on how much the razor did find).  I put it in the base, set it on clean and showered.  After I got out of the shower it finished cleaning.  So I took it out and looked at it, did not see a THING (I looked at the blade before cleaning so I could see what it would remove, there was a lot there).  I looked in the cleaning solution tray and it had a lot of stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY drawback is that you have to buy cleaning about every month or two, but I saw Bestbuy was selling the solution and you get2 refill tanks for 8 bucks.  I have spent more money on more stupid things.  That is a very very small price to pay for the automatic cleaning function, cause it cleans it so well, it looks like it has never been used.&lt;br /&gt;Now my girlfriend wants to see how this thing works on her legs lol.  I am going to buy my father one next week for fathers day.  It will be great for him because he has arthritis and the automatic cleaning function will be great for that.  &lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about it, drop me an email.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly thick beard and this guy just takes it off as smoothly as a blade. I have had a previous Braun, a couple of Norelco models, and an overpriced Panasonic in the past. This one is by far the best. And despite having thick hair, I also have sensitive skin. I get virtually no irritation from this model.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner works extremely well, and will probably prolong the life of the unit, though the darn solution can be expensive and hard to find. Buy 2 boxes whenever you see it. The cleaning cycle is a bit noisy, but only for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The only functional drawback is that the shaver does have some difficulty doing my neck hairs which tend to grow every which way. I have never had an electric that did a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; job on them without a bit of effort, and this one is no exception. It does, however, do a better job than any of my previous models.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a close shave, but don&#x27;t want a blade, consider this model. The Braun 7570 is the same shaver with some additional information displayed on an LCD panel. The blade and screen are the same. This \\&quot;option\\&quot; carries a hefty price tag which is why I went with the 7526.</li>
    <li> Okay, maybe that&#x27;s a little overboard, but I cannot believe what a difference a shaver can make.  I cannot imagine going back to my old Braun shaver after having used a self-cleaning system.  Other electric shaver manuals recommend cleaning the shaver every day, but how many people actually do that?  Having a fresh, clean foil against my face every morning feels so much better, especially since a doctor once told me how much bacteria can be transferred to a shaver in just one shave (put it this way, I will never, ever, borrow a friend&#x27;s shaver again)!&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, this shaver gives me closer shaves than even the triple bladed, titanium edged, flexible, pivoting, lubricated, turbo-charged razor that I have.  This is especially apparent under my chin, where I have these wierd, sideways growing whiskers that are otherwise impossible to shave close.  I kept my super-razor, though, because the trimmer on the Bruan cannot get my sideburns or neck hair as neatly groomed as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;To all disposable Bic users out there, [$$$] is not too much to spend on a shaver, if you personally can afford it.  The quality of the shave and the improved hygenics easily make this worth every penny.</li>
    <li> From the time I first started shaving, and I&#x27;m 51, I&#x27;ve always used a Norelco.  The head on this shaver is a little thinner and that is taking some getting used to.  I do like the shaver as it gives a very close shave, and when you&#x27;re done you drop it in the cleaning module, lock it in and away it goes.  It cleans, lubricates the shaver, and even leaves it smelling pleasant.  Nice shaver, and a good gift.</li>
    <li> This gives the best shave out of any electric that I&#x27;ve tried, and is rated highest in performance by consumer reports as of november &#x27;03.&lt;br /&gt;However, within 1 year of use something inside the cleaning apparatus malfunctioned, and within 2.5 years something inside the shaver itself malfunctioned.&lt;br /&gt;The malfunctions were not serious, and would be easy to fix, if not for the fact that both devices are apparently designed to be very difficult to take apart.  Perhaps a schematic of the devices would make this easier, but none seems to be available.&lt;br /&gt;I assume that they were designed this way in order to generate revenue for the repair business, or because it is cheaper to produce the devices in this way.</li>
    <li> First of all, shaving in the morning is what I do... and I am normally tired and ready to get the process over as soon as possible.. most electric razors do not let you do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most electric razors you have to really spend a lot of time below the chin and along the neck... getting the shave &#x27;just so&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this razor really does a good job, and  you can tell that they company spent a lot of time doing to R&amp;D on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other well talked about part of this razor is the cleaning part of it.  It has been talked about at great length in the reviews before me, but let me just add this.. IT IS EASY, IT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A HURRY AND FOR PEOPLE WHO HATE MORNINGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you fall into the category of &#x27;only coffee starts my morning&#x27; and want an easier, clean shave.. fork out the bukkos and buy this razor!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun</li>
    <li> The shaver is good, but I had to get rid of that awful automatic cleaner/lubricator; it was full of isopropyl alcohol and it made the bathroom smell like a hospital. Plus, it got stuck &amp; wouldn&#x27;t open to replace the little tanks of alcohol-cleaner. The whole cleaning apparatus broke apart &amp; made a mess.</li>
    <li> If you like gadgets and a great shave, this one is for you. Recenty swithched from rotary type--this is far superior--as close to a blade as it gets. The automatic charger /cleaning resivoir works to resolve clogging whisker build- up. Excellent design and a good value.</li>
    <li> First, I claim partial responsibility for the thing falling apart.  I should not have put it in my carry-on without wrapping it in something soft.  Anyway, when I got home from a trip the switch fell off, then the piece under the switch fell out, and then, well it got messy.  Unfortunately, it was the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor.  However, if it can&#x27;t take a little shoving around on a plane, well I&#x27;m avoiding Braun for awhile.</li>
    <li> Braun, a German company with a good reputation.  Thought I&#x27;d give this razor a try.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A terrible decision!  If you want a close shave, this is not the razor for you.  My old, $49 Remington and Norelco razors shaved much closer, much quieter, and much less expensively.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of German engineering.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but having bought this product and not wanting others to go through what I have, I thought you might want to read this before you buy: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been a Norelco user for the past 8-10 years, having seen this product, I thought it was interesting, given the high amount of positive feedback and thought I would give it a try.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Positive:  &lt;br /&gt;It is true, that you do get a fresh smelling shave, actually feels like a new shaver everytime you shave, but only after you plug it through the cleaning system.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  &lt;br /&gt;Very Noisy, Cleaning takes a long time - i tried cleaning it a few times, took at least 15min + and its sound is pretty annoying &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not a good shave: does not get the neck very good, the norelco has a much closer shave &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bulky unit- the recharge stand is huge - takes up a lot of space &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Refund policy - Amazon will not let you ship the product back if you want a refund due to shipping of alcohol (the cleaning solution that comes with the kit) Hence, you better be sure you don&#x27;t want to return it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would stay away from this product and if you really want to buy it, I suggest you go to an offline store to really check out the product, at least you can return it there.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for a few years now and it&#x27;s still doing a great job... as long as you weigh down the top plug with something.  See, after a while the plug will simply not connect with the shaver, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to recharge it.  Meaning you won&#x27;t be able to shave.  Meaning people won&#x27;t love you anymore and you&#x27;ll live the rest of your life alone all because of some cheap bit on a $100 shaver.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I use electrical tape.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s rock solid.  I&#x27;d even go so far as to say it&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, minus the aforementioned downside.</li>
    <li> I have had difficulty shaving with other electric shavers.  I decided to purchase this one because of family recommendations.  I have to say that this shaver works better than the remington titanium that I own.  I do not have irritated areas with the braun than with the remington.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me a 7526 system many years ago.  Don&#x27;t remember exactly, but about 5 Christmases before we moved here, and I&#x27;ve been here 13 years.  I have bought numerous replacement heads and each time the shaver performs like new.  From time to time I use  a regular razor with shaving cream, but not often.</li>
    <li> This past Christmas my wife bought me the new Braun 7526 Synchro System Shaver from Amazon... Those of you that have been keeping company or married for a number of years know that shaving is very personal undertaking and is not an activity of daily living you wish others to intrude upon. So,when the new Braun showed up under the Christmas tree, this user was very suspect of what might happen to his face; having had other electric shavers, including Braun models, that gave wonderful moments of skin irritation. What a surprise with this new Braun. Without any reservation I can say this the finest electric shaver I have ever used! It is first shaver that I have found that shaves the neck area without turning my skin a rosey red. I need not speak of the integrated cleaning system, as others have reviewed those aspects in some detail; other than to say it works and works very well. So, if you have a a tough beard and tender skin, this is razor of choice for you. I can recommend it without any reservation. As a bonus, I did not have massage the truth to the wife about her Christmas present to me. Buy one. You will just love it.</li>
    <li> I have used several Braun shavers for several years. I just got this one (3/29/01) and found that it is better than all of the others I have used. I did find that it is not worth having the charger/cleaning stand. I don&#x27;t need to do this level of cleaning very often so I will keep it sealed up and only use it once a month or so. It takes up too much space for my useage.  The one thing I am not happy with is the switch lock. My first model would slide to on in my travel bag. The last on had a positive lock. This one is not very solid and can be push on with out much effort. I hope it doesn&#x27;t run down while I&#x27;m traveling!</li>
    <li> I bought this system (...). Its great. Not having to clean it is a big, big plus. I never cleaned my others and they seemed never to work right.  You think there might have been a reason for that??  This one always works fine and it is the closest shaving shaver I have ever had without any skin irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Its priced too high here. I bought mine at a (local) store in Minnesota for (...).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used a rotary for about 10 years. I always had to take it apart every night to clean the blades for the next morning. This takes about 5 - 10 minutes every night of somewhat vigorous cleaning. 365 days a year for 10 years. I thought, &amp;quot;Isn&#x27;t there an easier way?&amp;quot; I saw this Braun shaver and thought, &amp;quot;this might be an answer to my prayers&amp;quot;. It gave a good shave. It makes short work of a two day beard much better than the rotary I had. &lt;br /&gt;It is noisy when it is in the cleaner. You should close the bathroom door so you don&#x27;t annoy the people you might live with. After a few months the unit started grinding in the cleaner and jammed. I took it to a repair shop. The tech cleaned it and showed me that I still need to clean it manually with a brush first, then put it into cleaner. The shaver had jammed because it was full of whiskers. I had been expecting the cleaner to do all the work. After shaving I&#x27;d just put the unit in the cleaner mechanism. The cleaner is a bath for the blades. If you don&#x27;t clean the blades with a brush first you&#x27;ll just be washing the cut whiskers. Ok the blade mechanism is simple and is very easy to brush clean.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this shaver when it was relatively new. It was hard to find the cleaning cartridges. I ended up buying them online and paying shipping. It is also noisier than the rotary while shaving. Close bathroom door for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Then unit started ripping my face. I looked and saw that the blades were cutting me through a hole in the protective screen. I don&#x27;t think anyone dropped it to break the screen. I think the blades cut through the screen or perhaps the screen is weak. I&#x27;d already spent quite a bit for this shaver and cartridges so I tabled the shaver and went back to the rotary.&lt;br /&gt;I then started using a twin blade manual disposable razor with shaving cream on weekends to get a closer shave. I had gone to electric shavers years ago because you could shave dry and my face seemed sensitive to manual blades but with shaving creams and new sensitive lubed manual blades the manual razor is actually comfortable and quick. When I&#x27;m done I just rinse the blade under the tap. No cleaning the blades with a brush. No taking apart mechanisms. I can use a blade for 5 days. I&#x27;ve been using the disposable razors now every day while the electrics sit on the shelf. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever go back to the electrics. The Braun does have an excellent pop up razor that makes short work of body hair. The best I&#x27;ve ever used for that but I&#x27;m now using the disposables every day for regular face shaving.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for nearly 8 months and I love it! This product was given to me as a gift to replace my old electric shaver that wasn&#x27;t doing the job. Now, I can truly say that the Braun gives me the closest shave of any electric shaver I have used. Say goodbye to your blades!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, but the Braun doesn&#x27;t irritate like some electrics can. It is very quiet and easy to operate. It is comfortable to hold, too. Cleaning is a cinch....but with the automatic charge and cleaning system, you don&#x27;t even have to agonize over getting the cutters super-clean. Just let the machine do the job for you every few weeks to get it good-as-new.&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver is so good that I have trouble finding anything to criticize. One drawback is that the entire unit (cleaning/charging base) takes up quite a bit of counter space. But, that is a minor complaint for a product this exceptional. I would definitely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone interested in a new electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I had been a Braun user years ago, but switched to a Norelco a few years ago because I felt the old Braun was too irritating. I never felt the Norelco shaved as closely, and maybe that&#x27;s why it was less irritating. Be that as it may, I recently switched to the new generation of self-cleaning Brauns and I am absolutely thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;The shave I get now is almost as close as a blade, but because the self-cleaning mechanism also lubricates the blades, I am getting *none* of the irritation I used to get. In addition, the handy base not only contains the cleaning solution and performs the lubrication, it also handles battery maintenance by monitoring your usage pattern and adjusting the charging schedule accordingly, including periodic and fully automatic complete battery discharge &amp; recharge, which will result in longer battery life and longer cordless cycles.&lt;br /&gt;About the only 2 things I don&#x27;t care for are the very bright blue light on the base which is even a bit too bright as a bathroom nightlight (I&#x27;ll get used to that, I&#x27;m sure) &amp; the ever-present, light machine oil odor the cleaning solution imparts to the bathroom in general and to the razor in particular.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the 7526 model is a good bit cheaper than the newer 7680, but lacks only its LCD display, which I find little use for personally.</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun shaver now for about 2 years.  When I first got it everything was great; good shave, the cleaning stand works well and I was very satisfied.  However as time went on the screen that protects your face from the blades has become loose, mine actually had a hole wear through it.  I replaced the blades and the screen with the kit from Braun, this helped a little but the screen was still very loose and rattles around while I shave.  This makes it sound something like a chain saw and about as comfortable.  The only thing I can do is to physically hold the guard down while I shave, this helps but the shave is still poor, and I get nicked quite often when shaving.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall I am not happy with this product, and will probably not buy a braun again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a mach 3 in the shower for years until my folks grabbed me one of these bad boys. I actually bought my dad one a year or so ago and he seemed to like it but has some weird fettish with doing a normal razor shave. Regardless, it took 2 weeks for my facial hair to get used to the electric shave, but after that, i noticed killer results. my girlfriend was very impressed with the results as well. if you want to get some, go get one of these (sorry i had to say it to be goofy)&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people complain about the cost of the cleaning solution replacements for this model, but if you think about it you would probably spend around 2 or 3 bucks on a bottle of shaving cream every month (and after shave) so it all evens out. i also like the lemony fresh smell it leaves when its done cleaning. i feel like i&#x27;m in a mr. clean commercial or something and it makes me want to ... well i don&#x27;t know what....&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I don&#x27;t use the clean feature after every use, i just hit the charge/clean button twice to charge it only (they probably put the clean option first to milk you and make you use more cleaning fluid).... but i only clean mine once or twice a week tops and it seems to be fine.  but then again i&#x27;m not exceptionally hairy. i guess if you are hairy like a bear you would best clean it daily.&lt;br /&gt;side note, this razor looks cool. i have had girls compliment me on it. I know its trite, but everything helps in this day and age. Something about space age bathroom devices might turn the ladies on (or males if you are so inclined).&lt;br /&gt; I tried out a few other electric razors, but they don&#x27;t compare to this. I am looking forward to replacing my foil in 3 or 4 months to see if it really makes a difference. but until then, i&#x27;ll continue to be content with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;there is another model with some silly lcd display, but i dont think you need it, unless you are one of those people that think devices with more lights or buttons make em better. i hada professor in engineering school who used to remind us that a device was always better if it had more buttons!! :-) THat was sarcasm.&lt;br /&gt;happy shaving...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know of an electric shaver made by anyone that can truly compare to a blade. Having had 4 electric razors over the past 25 years, (high end Norelco and Remington,) I am happy to say that this is, by a consideraable margin, the best electric razor I have ever owned. &lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this razor to anyone looking for the closest possible shave an electic razor can perform. If you want the best product in the market, THIS is it. I have always enjoyed the convenience of an electric shaver and &#x27;settled&#x27; for a reasonably close shave. This shaver does a superb job at giving me the closest shave an electric razor has ever provided. I am truly impressed by Braun&#x27;s self cleaning feature leaving my shaver ready for a great shave the following day.&lt;br /&gt;J&amp;amp;R Music Shipped the item quickly and in great shape and I recommend dealing with them as well. This and several items I have purchased from J&amp;amp;R always ship quick and arrive promptly in excellent condition. &lt;br /&gt;If you have an electric and want the best, or are a newcomer to electric shaving, this will not leave you wanting.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband who has the thickest beard in the world, and WOW, he loves it. Says it takes longer to shave but the shave is closer. The clippers on the side is the best he&#x27;s seen, and he&#x27;s been shaving for 40 years. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the last few reviews and not purchase this shaver. At first, I was incredibly impressed with the shaving performance of this instrument. Expect to replace the Foil and cutterblock after 6 months, which is falsely advertised in their product manual as being 18 months. I take care of the shaver as instructed by the manual and was very happy until replacing the foil and Cutterblock.  I didn&#x27;t care about purchasing the pricy accessories (foil/cutterback and cleaning solutions) as long as I get a good shave. Advise to everyone; please reconsider buying this product because you&#x27;ll be paying for a great 6 month shaver.  I will be returning to the manual shaving until I find a better lasting method.</li>
    <li> OK now, don&#x27;t get too excited about the Braun 7526. It looks fancy with all its features, such as automatically cleaning itself, but guess what - it misses out on one much more important aspects - providing a good shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used a Remington R-845 razor prior to the Braun. It usually sells at aroung $35 (or some $70 lower than the Braun). I decided to upgrade and was tremendously disappointed. The Braun cuts my face almost every time I shave and doesn&#x27;t shave as closely! The neck is especially problematic - the Braun leaves almost everything on even after going over the area for minutes. I found myself going back to the Remington  for this area, which is obviously ridiculous.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the Braun looks very sturdy and is a good piece of machinery with all its lith indicators and good materials used. However, unless your beard is really soft and your skin is totally insensitive to cuts - it is not a good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun&#x27;er for 13 years. First unit was a modest single blade, which lasted 5 years before I gave it away. Second model was the 6525 Flex Integral and it lasted 8 years till the batteries died as well as the circuit board. Both units saw international use with 220 voltage w/o a hitch. They have provided close and comfortable shaves with the convenience of portability, so I naturally look to Braun for a replacement.     So here I am with a new Syncro 7526 with its fancy Charge/Clean unit. Very clever indeed! After 3 weeks of use, here&#x27;s my opinion...     - The rather noisy C/C unit is too flimsy to be sporting the Braun badge. Thus, the abundant amount of refurbished 7526 WITHOUT C/C unit. Braun has improved on the newer Activator by eliminating the troublesome locking arm.     - I like the alcohol solution for the fresh, lemony scent. But alcohol is more a solvent than a lubricant. Exposing the foil &amp; cutter block to it on a regular basis speeds up wear/tear. Good business model for Braun, costly for users. To extend the life of each cartridge, some users recommended removing it and replacing the cap between cleanings to prevent evaporation. Too much fuss for me.     The convenience provided by the C/C unit is good for those with a lot of facial hair and require daily cleaning of the shaver. But for a light/moderate grower like me, it isn&#x27;t necessary. Once a week, I remove the foil &amp; cutter block and rinse them under the shower head. Let them sit on the sink ledge to dry. Reinstall and lube with a silicone spray and it will make the foil &amp; cutter block last much longer than 18 months!    Now the shaver...  Over all an excellent unit! I like the tapered body, materials and color scheme. The plastic panels could be thicker though. The motor is faster than the 6525 and the shaving head now oscillates as well as pivots. The foil and cutter block are almost the same as the 6525. The cord (made in China) houses the voltage adapter, which was in the shaver housing for previous Brauns.     Charge...  Like my 6525, recharging takes 1 hour and holds 50 minutes or about 2 - 2.5 weeks of daily shaving. Running down the battery before recharging helps maximize its life.     Conclusion...  The Shaver is excellent (4.5 stars) but I&#x27;m returning it for the 7505 model (sans C/C) because of the flimsy C/C unit (1.5 stars)... and I don&#x27;t really need it anyway. The motor, battery, shaving head, foil and cutter block are the same for across the Syncro line.     EDIT (Jan 2010):  Not digging the C/C unit, I returned this package and bought just the shaver. It&#x27;s seen 5 years of use w/o any problem. Power discharge is very consistent and when fully charged, it feels as new. I do regular *complete* discharge and recharge to refresh the battery. Discharging the battery completely causes the PC to recharge very slowly (up to 3.5 hrs), which puts less stress on the battery and extends its life. Changed from 4 to 5 stars. Good work, Braun.</li>
    <li> I have been using  it for last 14 months. It is the best shaver I ever had. It works great and gives a close shave. The clippings do fall off though. It is as good as new after every cleaning cycle. The screen is filmsy, it broke and had to be replaced. &lt;br /&gt;The plastic push down part broke recently. It seems like a design defect. The newer model got rid of it. I would recommend newer 8585 over this model.</li>
    <li> I bought the 7526 shaver and am very dissappointed.   The worst &lt;br /&gt;problem is the shaving head doesn&#x27;t stay on.   It&#x27;s very &lt;br /&gt;difficult to use when the shaving head pops off.   The head &lt;br /&gt;attachment system if very badly designed.   No matter what  &lt;br /&gt;I do the shaving head won&#x27;t stay on.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If I had known that I never would have bought this shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the reviews below: This is a great electric shaver -- if you&#x27;re willing to spring regularly for new parts. I&#x27;ve had mine for about two years, and can report: The foil on the shaver really does wear out about every six months, not every 18 months. And to replace it, you have to buy both the cutting block and foil at a cost of about 30 bucks. And the charging/cleaning system -- a concept which, for my money, makes electric shaving worthwhile, won&#x27;t last. The charging arm at the top more than likely WILL break, and you either have to go through the hassle of having it serviced, or buy a new stand for about 40 bucks through Braun. If all that is worth the convenience of using this otherwise nice shaver, it&#x27;s for you. If not, save your money.</li>
    <li> Shaving closeness except for the neck (haven&#x27;t found anything that does that completely). Good.  Battery life very good. So far I&#x27;ve had eleven shaves w/o recharge. Durability Very Good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   Every shaver is a compromise. This one is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> The only electric I&#x27;ve ever owned is a low end Norelco cordless I got for Xmas some 15 odd years ago. It was OK, but I switched to blades not long after. Disillusioned with the ever increasing cost of blades and the fact that I couldn&#x27;t shave two days in a row without slicing myself up, I recently pulled out the old Norelco. It&#x27;s still OK shave-wise, but the battery will (obviously, after so long on the shelf)no longer hold its charge. &lt;br /&gt;So, what to do with an Xmas gift card is the question. It really was a toss up between a comparatively priced Noelco and this Braun. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned Norelco already and Braun is a quality name, so I decided to give this shaver a shot.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed. More than impressed, I&#x27;m shocked at how close this braun shaves. OK, it takes about 7 or 8 minutes of intense shaving to get a close one, but I&#x27;ve only had it a week. As close as a blade? No. But darn near. I had no idea an electric could shave this close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t bash the other brands. I haven&#x27;t tried the new models. Maybe they&#x27;re as good. I don&#x27;t know. This Braun is Great! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The quality shave is all that matters to me. Everything else that comes with the shaver is gravey. The cleaning system is awesome. I doubted a bit so after a shave I peeked inside to see how stubbly it was. Pretty stubbly. Then I put it through the 15 minute cleaning cycle and peeked again not expecting much. Wow! Sparkling clean (and smelled nice to boot).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This ex-blade user is simply amazed. I just hope it holds up over time and with the reputation the Braun name has, I have no reason to believe it wont.</li>
    <li> For years I only used razor blades. However, after having read many reviews for this shaver I decided to be bold and give it a try..........and I&#x27;m glad I did! This shaver gives a most close and comfortable shave. It is easy to handle, caused little face irritation, and is ergonomically top shelf. Plus, it cleans itself when placed into the holder as well as recharging. I am never going back to blades again. If you are looking for a new shaver or want to try an electric one, this is the one to get. It is worth every penny. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This thing works great. I&#x27;ve been using electrics in the 30-60 dollar range for about twenty years, throwing them away when the heads got dull, always had the five o&#x27;clock shadow at 10 am...I always chalked it up to the fact that my beard is pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to spend the extra cash for something decent, it&#x27;s fast, shaves a lot closer and has already outlasted three of the cheap razors.  The self cleaning unit is coool....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still have to zap those stray neck whiskers with a regular blade, but I can live with that...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to talk about the specs since it&#x27;s all there. &lt;br /&gt;This is a coool shaver. &lt;br /&gt;It shaves really close. &lt;br /&gt;In most cases one reason you choose manual rather than automatic shaver is because it cut&#x27;s loose while manual shaver cuts very clean.  We use automatic shaver becuase it is convenient regaredless of that loose cut.   &lt;br /&gt;But I think this shaver cuts pretty clean compared to other items I have used before. &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> So far my experience with this Braun shaver has been great.  I love the feel in my hand, the quiet motor, and the smooth but effective way it trims my beard, whether one day old or three days old.  Some shavers tend to catch and pull the hairs if shaving two or three days later.  One or more reviewers complained about the noise of the cleaner, which seems silly.  It&#x27;s not that loud, unless you like to shave just before you go to sleep.  And as for the expense of the cleaning fluid, you really can just blow out the shaving head and tap the cover in the sink a couple of times, only running the cleaner every few days instead of every day.  I took it on vacation for 10 days and didn&#x27;t need the cord.  It&#x27;s got my vote.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver as a gift about 18 months ago, it was my first electric shaver. This unit has always had problems with areas like the neck. I always have to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; by hand to get a consistent close shave. Most recently, the arm that holds the unit in place for cleaning and charging stopped working. I did a little research on the web and this is a VERY common problem for this model, but of course Braun hasn&#x27;t done anything to help their customers with this defective product. You can purchase a replacement part for about $14, or spend $40 on a whole new base. But quite frankly, since I never really got a good shave from the thing, I&#x27;m going to toss it and try another brand.</li>
    <li> I recently talked my girlfriend into buying the most expensive shaver I have ever owned. I used to own a Remington and threw the thing away when the battery could not be changed. It only takes me a few minutes and I am done shaving now. the Syncro is so much faster and I am so sorry that I hesitated to think about changing name brands. I looked at the other models and thought wow for a few dollars more it can clean itself. I am so impressed by such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> i shave everyday and clean it everyday. had the thing for bout a month and a half and still haven&#x27;t replaced the cleaner thing.  despite what fluid is in there, it does a great great job cleaning the shaver and it smells like lemony-fresh or whatever. so it&#x27;s so nice. &lt;br /&gt;the best thing is, it does shave as close (if not closer from running over your grill again) than conventional mach 3 shavers.  what i&#x27;m saying is, it is a solid investment. buy it at like nordstrom if you nmust, and simply return it if you don&#x27;t like it (if you do, return it anyway and go online to get it).</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that the cleaning cartridge contains alcohol - this item is NOT returnable to amazon.  Period.  It does state this policy under the &amp;quot;shipping restrictions&amp;quot; link in the description - so I do take responsibility for not having read every single link in the description.  However, I do think the link would have been more properly labeled &amp;quot;shipping &amp;amp; return restrictions.&amp;quot;  Never during the entire check out process was it made clear that the item was not returnable.&lt;br /&gt;While the customer service lady was very nice and sympathetic, there was nothing she could do.  Just to warn others who are thinking of purchasing to make sure you really want it before buying!</li>
    <li> It broke in 37 days.  Certainly not because of over-use either.  Absolute piece of junk.  I&#x27;ll not buy any more Braun products period.  The company should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> I just switched to the Braun shaver after using two different models from Panasonic for the past 12 years.  I just shaved for the first time with the Syncro and it absolutely shaved my face the best I have ever had from an electric shaver.  I haven&#x27;t tried the cleaner yet, but I am already glad a made the purchase.  I highly recommend this product especially if you are already an e-shaver user.</li>
    <li> I feel that this razor is as good if not better than the Mach3 which I previously used. It is fast, cuts close, and it always clean thanks to the cleaning station. I do feel that it is very expensive but in my eyes was worth it because I no longer cut myself with a blade and I am able to shave quicker than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun Syncro Shaver System with the 7526 shaver for 3 months now.  I&#x27;m 100% pleased with it.  I&#x27;ve had screen or foil head shavers and rotary shavers from Norelco and Remmington - none come close to this shaver for comfort and closeness.  &lt;br /&gt;I researched this shaver a lot before buying; cost of cutter block, replacement foil, cleaning solution refills, etc.  Having replacement parts available online at [...] was a timesaver buying cleaning refills.  Buying 6 boxes of cleaning refills with 2 in each box for $60 and free shipping was cheaper than Walmart.  A refill lasts me ~1.5 months.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver holds a good solid charge for 4-5 days.  I&#x27;ve taken the shaver with me to work so I can get rid of &#x27;5 o&#x27;clocks&#x27; when I have late presentations or meetings.&lt;br /&gt;The charging and cleaning base is great.  I manually clean the cutter and foil every 2-3 days but my cleaning cartridge has been  full of shaved facial hair both times I&#x27;ve changed it.&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium to heavy beard.  This shaver out performs any other shaver I&#x27;ve had since quitting blades when I was 21.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wanting this shaver but not sure about it&#x27;s cost buy the shaver only for $50.  You can buy the charger and cleaner stand later for $40 + s/h at [...]</li>
    <li> I received a Braun 7526 system as a Father&#x27;s Day gift in 2003.  I had asked for it because I liked the idea of an electric razor that would always be clean and ready to use.  Having used the razor for about 9 months now I can say that it provides a decent shave.  It is not as close as a blade, but it is better than some other electric razors I have used.  I also like the fact that the razor is clean every time I use it.  The system also probably saves me a minute or two each morning.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the admitted convenience of this razor comes at a high price.  As others have mentioned, the cleaning process is very loud, which is a problem in my house where I must get ready for work before my wife has to get up.  The cleaning cartridges are also expensive ($8 - $10 per two-pack depending on sales) with each cartridge lasting me about 5-6 weeks.  This week the Clean &amp;amp; Charge Storage Stand broke, so the razor will no longer charge.  Although I understand it can be replaced, this will also be expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I think this comes down to a question.  Is the admitted convenience of this system worth its noise and overall high operating expense?  If I had to make that decision today for myself I would have to say no.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Syncro 7526 razor for nearly 1 1/2 years now.. a few months ago the &amp;amp;quot;charger/cleaner&amp;amp;quot; base broke and couldn&#x27;t be fixed... with the year warranty up, I now have just the razor, and have been manually cleaning it daily..       Just a few weeks ago, I noticed that my facial hair felt like it was being pulled rather then cut.. I examined the foil head and noticed that there were a few holes in it.. hence the pulling rather then cutting..       It&#x27;s kind of disturbing when buying a product you spend roughly $100 for and in just over a year it starts to fall apart.. Now I&#x27;m having to go through trying to find a replacement head for it.. and so far around town it&#x27;s hard to find.. I&#x27;m figuring I&#x27;ll have to go online and purchase the replacement parts.      All in all this is a nice razor.. I&#x27;m sure I just got a lemon.. that one out of a million bad razor sets.. but I must admit this has left a bad taste in my mouth for the Braun name.      I&#x27;ve had a Norelco electric razor prior to this but gave it to a friend when I &amp;amp;quot;upgraded&amp;amp;quot; to the Braun 7526.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric razor since I was 17 (I am now 45).  My sweet wife gave me a Braun 7526 Synchro razor last Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used.  The lagrer holes in the foil coupled with the longer hair trimmer bar between the cutters will take on almost anything.  All the other electrics would occasionally miss a hair that was a tad longer than the rest an would lay down under the cutter.  Not this baby - a clean shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expecially like the charging and cleaning systems.  Cleaning a razor is a pain.  I just drop this one in the stand and it takes care of itself.  The cartridges come in a two pack for ten bucks and last me about 6 weeks each (12 weeks per box).  That figures out to about 16 cents a day to have someone else clean your razor and do a better job than I would have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had problems with batteries, too.  Either the razor goes for awhile and then runs down in the middle of a shave or I forget and leave it on the charger too long.  This razor signals you when you need to charge it and the stand will automatically take care of the procedure for you; you just have to hit the button to \\&quot;charge\\&quot;.  All this adds up to no dead or overcharged (damaged) batteries.  My only complaint about the 7526 is that the blue \\&quot;charging\\&quot; LED is really bright.  At night I can see the flash light up the inside of my bathroom like a beacon.  Which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if my bed wasn&#x27;t near the bathroom door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor is more expensive than most, but if you pick up the box and wonder if the Braun Synchro is worth the price - it is!</li>
    <li> I no longer get neck rash after shaving, and with the self cleaning unit, this is the most efficient shaving system I have ever used.  I moved from a Remington rotary shaver, and this is far superior both in comfort and smooth results. &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this item as a gift for my husband. He says it has never done a good job of shaving his neck area. Recently, it stopped working correctly, seemed to jam and was difficult to turn off. Bought my husband a diffent brand of razor. He is MUCH happier with the new brand. No more Braun shavers for him!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about 10 years ago now, from a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this review more as a testament to Braun&#x27;s German made shavers, than necessarily as a review on this particular shaver, because you can&#x27;t buy this model any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s survived 10 years... of morning shaves... of being packed in luggage and thrown on airplanes or taken on trips in a car trunk.  Probably a drop or two.  It still feels SO solid in my hand, not cheap at all.  Shaves wonderfully; I replace the cutter/foil system about every 18-24 months.  Cleaning system still works great.  Every mechanism and button works just as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a beautifully engineered product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will reiterate, this shaver was made in Germany, before Braun started shifting production to China.  Their higher end shavers are still made in Germany.  I have a little bit of experience with a Chinese Braun as well, and it has been OK too, but it&#x27;s not 10 years old yet.  So YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get another 10 years out of it.  :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband after doing a lot of research online. I read reviews that mentioned the bases breaking. We&#x27;ve never had that problem and I purchased it well over 2 years ago. We&#x27;ve had no issues with the shaver system what so ever. I was a little skeptical and worried that I may have made a mistake when I bought it. However, it is like new still and no problems what so ever. We replace the cartridges when it says to replace them, clean the shaver regularly and it even sits on the counter where children might be tempted to drop it off the counter or push buttons. It still works like a champ and is safe enough to sit where little hands might have access. I am pleased with it and so is my clean shaven hubby.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s second Braun Shaver.His first one he had for 10 years and dropped it.He loves it, and the advantage of self cleaning is great to him.He states that he will continue using the Braun 7526, until they are no longer made.</li>
    <li> Pro  I have owned this razor for 5 years with no problems or repairs (thank goodness because the word on the street is that Braun is a nightmare with their customer service and repairs).  I never have to clean the razor unless on vacation.  I don&#x27;t get razor burn, unlike the \\&quot;lift and Cut\\&quot;. Battery life has been great, after five years I can get four shaves out of one charge.  Smooth skin after 9 to 15 min. of shaving (depending on how lazy I was between shaves) even with hair longer than  1/8 inch.  It seems to work better when the wiskers are long.  Side burn trimmer is a champ almost strong enough to mow the yard.  The width of the trimmer is also great for a once over straight line side burn. The foil collects almost all whiskers so the late dash to work \\&quot;shave and drive\\&quot; is not a problem.  The cost of the cartridge is very small compared to the feeling of a clean and smooth shave EVERY time.  Cons  I suggest buying an extra foil for stand by.  When the foil wears out (for me, between 6-8 months) it will definitely let you know with red slashes down the neck and face.  If you clean or charge your razor at night the super bright blinking blue light might wake you up (could be corrected by closing the door, I know).  Overview  I know that in this day in age, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; and for that I can see the cost of this razor and cleaning fluid.  I have used many other name brands and believe that this 7526 Braun should be considered the work horse of all time, Like the Ford F-250.  I highly recommend this razor to every one that inquires about it and that is why I am writing this review.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a good close shave and for that I am pleased.  However, the best part is the clean up.  After shaving, just place the razor in the cleaner and push clean and charge and you&#x27;ll be all set for your next shave.</li>
    <li> I have had the Braun 7526 for about three weeks.  It has a very smooth operation, and the cleaning system is excellent.  It of course does not give as close a shave as a blade, and I was not expecting it to do so.  But as my skin adjusts to the new shaver it does appear to shave closer now than when I first began using it.  I highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> These razors have a thin piece of foil under the blue power switch. It is attached with melted plastic and is prone to coming loose, rendering the shaver useless. If the metal under the switch happens to stay put, the razor will probably last a long time. If not, you will be very annoyed, like many other Braun customers.</li>
    <li> Buy the 7526 with the Clean and Charge. It gives the smoothest shave. I owned a Norelco but it never performed this well. The clean and charge unit really does make it convenient to clean and charge the shaver. I recommend that you follow the cleaning instructions in the manual completely because this improves the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> This razor didnt even last a year. First the charging unit broke and then the razor itself died and couldnt even use it plugged in. On top of that every couple of months you would need to by expensive cleaning cartridges which makes this shaver a very expensive poorly made and underperforming waste of money. I will not use braun again nor could i reccomend them. Stay far away from this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver as a replacement for a Norelco 6705X, which I hated (I&#x27;ve also reviewed that shaver). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the shaver that I should have bought in the first place.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and love it.  I get a nice close shave every time with no cuts or rash like I got with the Norelco.  In the time I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve replaced the blades/screen once.  I think I paid about $20 for the replacements.  It works as good as new.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the cleaning/charging stand as a few other reviews have.  Mine works just fine.  Like the recent reviewer that uses this shaver on his head I also use it for hair care.  I&#x27;m not completely shaved (yet).  I&#x27;ve got a Braun clipper that I use to maintain a \\&quot;high and tight\\&quot;.  I wasn&#x27;t satisifed with the 0 length for my sides (I like &#x27;em clean, where the clipper leaves stubble) so I&#x27;ve been using the 7526 for \\&quot;cleanup\\&quot;.  All in all, this is a very good shaver.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> From my experience this shaver best serves its purpose as an \\&quot;I&#x27;m late for work and gotta shave quick\\&quot; shaver.  The shave closeness on my face is no doubt the best I&#x27;ve experienced with an electric shaver but the neck leaves much to be desired.  The cleaning ability is the strongest feature of the Synro.  Overall good shaver for occaisional use but not strong enough to replace the blade for every day use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a fetish for as close a shave as possible, because I deal with clients and the public a lot, and I like the look of a clean, close shave. That&#x27;s why for years I have tried one blade razor after another, going from single blades, to double, to triple, and having the ones with lotion on the blades, skin guards, etc.. I&#x27;d get the close shave I wanted, but there was always the occasional face-cutting the blades involved, and I hated the scabby face look even more than a bad shave. I&#x27;d tried electric shavers off and on over the years, but never really felt that I was getting the close shaves I wanted. This Christmas, however, my wife purchased this product as a gift for me, and so as not to appear ungrateful, I agreed to give it a trial period. To my amazement, it really does give a very close shave. Technically, it may not be as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s very good, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself. Additionally, I like the idea that the shaver cleans itself after every use, because I hated taking the others apart, and using that little brush on the hair inside. Being a confirmed gadget person, I would have liked the top of the line model with the elapsed minutes of shave time, but my wife is much more practical, and she&#x27;s right that it&#x27;s an unneeded luxury. I do not expect to go back to blade shaving in the foreseeable future, if ever. I like this product!</li>
    <li> I can only give this shaver 4, maybe 4 and a half stars because it does not shave as close as a blade. With that said...this series of Braun shavers is still probably the best on the market. Here&#x27;s my take on its pros and cons: &lt;br /&gt;PROS: The Braun name means quality and reliability (2-Year Warranty). The self-cleaning system is ingenious. It&#x27;s easy to use, and  there&#x27;s no mess, unless you spill the cartridge of course, or  you knock the unit&#x27;s stand over. I read somewhere that these Brauns carry 8500 RPM motors. This speed is probably optimal for avoiding skin irritation. There are shavers with faster motors (up to 13,000 RPMs) out there,  but with the increased speed comes a higher likelihood of skin irritation, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The shaver provides a close shave, but not as close as a blade.  The cleaning process is a bit loud, but the cleaning process   only takes 15 minutes. The unit is quite bulky. Forget about bringing the unit on the road. &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridge must be changed every 8 wks. That&#x27;s $- $ per new cartridge - comparable to what you would spend  with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Someone probably mentioned it already, but to obtain the shaver and the cleaning unit, the 7526 is the most economical model that you can buy. The more expensive 7546 and 7570 models are not mechanically superior - the only additional feature they provide is more precise info about how much time is required for the unit to charge completely. This is a luxury that most can live without, especially for an additional $-$.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anyone. It&#x27;s as close to perfection as you can get right now in an electric shaver and will make some guys throw out their blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 30 years. For the entire time I&#x27;ve used an electric, primarily Norelco rotaries. However, some months back I decided to try the Mach III blade. I found the shave so superior to my Norelco that I switched. But after about six months I got tired of the inconvenience and mess. I decide to try the Remington TCT 3 because they offered a 30 day trial period. The shave was okay, but couldn&#x27;t compare with the Mach III. Braun also offered a satifaction guarantee so I thought I&#x27;d give the Sycro a try. WOW! I don&#x27;t know why it works better than the Remington. Both have similar foil systems. Maybe that four way action really does make a difference. What I do know, is that the Braun is even better than the Mach III. I can actually get the elusive &amp;quot;perfect shave&amp;quot;. Even on my neck! For the first time in years I can get a shave that lasts all day. I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this razor. I would recommend it without reservation. And to top it all off, you get the Clean &amp;amp; Charge Storage Stand. If your thinking that this feature is no big deal, maybe your right. You can certainly continue to clean the razor the traditional way. But for my money, I think it&#x27;s VERY cool. You pop the razor in after a shave, and next morning it&#x27;s ready to go. No muss, no fuss.</li>
    <li> I bought the top Philips model in Germany, where my old Braun after 6 years finally broke down...it sucked - I payed about $160 for it and used it twice...it sucks! When I got back...I bought the Braun 7526 - I would have never thought that such a clean shave is even possible with an electric shaver - it&#x27;s awesome worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Braun razors having used two of them over the last decade. They give the best shave but I was always a little dissapointed that the quality of the shave would deteriorate as the blade/foil combo aged. Every time I got a new blade and foil I would vow to handle it very carefully but after a month or two that new razor closeness was gone.&lt;br /&gt;When my last Braun died I looked over the choices and decided to give the &amp;quot;clean and charge&amp;quot; system a chance despite my misgivings about the greater cost and complication. Now that I have had this razor for three months I can report that the system really works. My shave this morning was just as nice as my first one with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I think there are two reasons for this improvement. First, the razor is cleaned better every day than I _ever_ did and, second, the delicate foil is not subject to my clumsey handling. &lt;br /&gt;If you like Braun razors I recommend this &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; as an improvement.</li>
    <li> I have bought at five high quality electric shavers for mu husband, and none were satisfactory - until I bought the Braun Synchro Shaver 7526.  My husband has a very heavy beard, but this gives him a VERY close shave, better than any other electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been free&#x27;d from the tyranny of my old shaver. I had no idea how bad my old shaver was until I bought this shaver (although the fact that my old shaver was grinding my face into hamburger meat everyday was a slight clue).  This shaver cuts my beard clean in about a third of the time it took with my old shaver (without the normal collateral damage that I&#x27;m used to).  Great product!  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on the Braun 7526 Synchro Shaver &amp; Cleaning System.</li>
    <li> If you pop the cover off after the automatic clean, it looks perfectly clean inside, like it has never been used. It really works.  I feel better having a really clean razor on my skin.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like to shave. I have a heavy beard which never comes fully clean with a razor. Even when I do everything right (wash face first, apply good shaving gel, use a fresh razor, apply light pressure, etc) I am always left with rough spots and stubble. That is, until I tried this Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Put simply, it works! I can not believe how close of a shave was possible until trying this unit. The area above my upper lip is perfectly smooth. My chin no longer has stubble. I&#x27;ve learned that if I lightly shave in different directions across my neck, it also comes clean. This shaver is insane (in a good way :)&lt;br /&gt;An added benefit is I no longer have to buy those Mach3 razors at $2 a piece any more. I bet you&#x27;re asking, though, \\&quot;But don&#x27;t you end up buying cleaning solution every month?\\&quot; No way! There are 3 things, mentioned by other reviewers here, which can easily extend the life of the cleaning solution:&lt;BR&gt;1. Just manually clean the razor every day.&lt;BR&gt;2. Use the cleaning unit every other day.&lt;BR&gt;3. Put the lid back on the cartridge after the cleaning cycle is complete.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving still isn&#x27;t a favorite activity, but at least I can now get a satisfying, smooth shave without a big production every morning.</li>
    <li> Big peice of junk, if you have a thick beard. The only way it would cut my hair is if I went over it dozens of times. The only good thing about this shaver is that it&#x27;s self cleaning. Otherwise sand paper would give you a better shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver ever; it consistently delivers fast, close and comfortable shaves.  I have a bad combination; a heavy beard and sensitive skin; so much so that many brands of electric shavers give me razor bumps, particularly down where my beard line meets my throat.  But this system has never irritated my  beard and the cleaning system keeps the shaver working extremely smoothly.  I&#x27;d do a testamonial commercial for Braun if they&#x27;d let me.  Worth every penny and more!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away by its performance. &lt;br /&gt;The shave is a reasonable quality, about the same as the $60 shaver I already owned. &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning feature is nice though but I don&#x27;t yet know how long the cartridges last.</li>
    <li> I have use this daily since mid-2001. I think they make this to last so they will have consumables (blades, cleaner packs) customers for life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Batteries still take a strong charge, and everyting else works just fine. I just ordered a new set of blades, and considering the track record on this, I doubt it will be my last.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric razor and does the best job as far as electrics.  The cleaning system is great.  However, my handle latch broke on the system, but no big deal I suppose I just tape it down with some scotch tape (use a strip or two.)  The cleaning refills you don&#x27;t have to keep buying, you can actually just refill one with alcohol and keep using one.  All that is in thoughs refills is alcohol and fragrance.  You also don&#x27;t have to have the cleaning system at all, you can just clean the old fashioned way w/ the brush and Remington Shaver Spray.  All in all though, great razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 10 years and it still works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;One of the few products i can say this about.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.  This is my 2nd razor, same model, about 10 years apart.</li>
    <li> I had this shaver years ago and decided to go to one you can rinse with water. I figured I would save money by not buying the cleaning solution. I went back to this one because I did&#x27;nt find one that shaved as good. This razor shaves close. I&#x27;ll pay for the solution because of the fact that you just but it in stand, turn it on and your ready for your next shave with a clean shaver. When you turn on the cleaning unit it will be noisy in the begining. Overall a good shaver. Can also be cleaned manualy.</li>
    <li> I was given a Braun 7526 as a gift a few years ago. Just over three years later there is something wrong with the razor and it does not work. I&#x27;ve replaced the blade and screen every 18 months. Just before it was time to replace the blade/screen there was a new noise. I hoped that it was the blade/screen that was the problem. After I replaced the blade/screen the noise continued and it does not cut my beard well. There is something wrong with the razor itself.    My next question is will I get another Braun razor. At this point I don&#x27;t think so. I have used an electric razor for years. The one I had before the Braun needed a cord. The Braun was cordless. I liked the cordless aspect. The Braun was self cleaning. I liked the self cleaning aspect, except that the cleaning solution is expensive. I changed the blade/screen every 18 months. I guess if the razor itself had kept working I&#x27;d still be using it to shave. At this point I&#x27;m looking at spending between $100 and $200 to replace my razor if I buy another Braun. If a three year life span is acceptable then I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another.    As a side point I&#x27;ve been a using safety razor since the Braun stopped working, and I&#x27;d forgotten how close the shave is when you use a safety razor. I realize now the Braun did not shave very close. I always needed a safety razor for my neck because the Braun didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for many years. This shaver shaves much closer than the Norelco and I don&#x27;t get small nicks under my chin and neck anymore.&lt;br /&gt;If you hate cleaning your shaver, the Clean &amp;amp; Charge stand is great. After the self cleaning cycle, I took the foil and cutting blades apart and could not find a trace of stubble. But, if you take out the cleaning solution reservoir out, you can see all the stubbles that have been cut on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s a great deal</li>
    <li> After researching a replacement for my Norelco, I decided to take a risk and try the Braun Synchro- the reviews sounded good and the cleaning concept was cool, so despite having used Norelco&#x27;s for 20 years, I bought the 7526. WOW !  Great shave, long charge, great choice.  A couple of tips for you: 1.-Put the caps back on the cleaner insert after use- that stops evaporation and extends life by 50% 2.-Clean unit only twice a week-daily is overkill and not needed, time is money, folks. 3.-Use a preshave, easier on skin. 4.- this unit ROCKS !!</li>
    <li> I tend to be a blade user since I never found an electric which can give me a close enough shave.  Unfortunatly, I&#x27;ve a difficult face to shave and blades usually made me end up looking like a war victim.&lt;br /&gt;After a friend purchased a Braun 7505... and really liked it, I decided to try the 7526 (same shaver, but comes with the self-cleaning system).  I paid $119 at RiteAid for the unit.&lt;br /&gt;While no electric razor will give a shave as close as a blade... the Braun gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric.  It&#x27;s close enough for me, that I don&#x27;t need a blade anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the ease of use and cleaning is outstanding.  As pointed out by others, the cleaning system is a nice touch, but can get expensive... but as one astute person noted, if you seal your cleaning solution after each use, and clean it every 4 weeks, the solution should last years, instead of days.  (his suggestion... simply recap the cleaning solution after you run it through the cleaning cycle - which the manual itself recommends doing every 3 or 4 weeks).</li>
    <li> This shaver works just great! It gives a much closer shave than    a Norelco, which I had used since I was a teenager. I went through 3 of those. This is a superior design, and hugs the skin to give that close shave. It cleans itself wonderfully, and that in itself is worth the price. If you ever have had to take a Norelco apart to clean it, then you know what I&#x27;m talking about...   The only drawback to this is the cost and frequency of having to replace the cleaning cartridges, but it still is well worth having to do that.   I would recommend this to anyone shopping for a new shaver.</li>
    <li> We bought this shaver for our son&#x27;s 21st birthday.  He just loves it.  The cleaning system makes it practical for men in a hurry to keep the unit clean and sharp.  The only down side is the cleaning trays that need to be changed regularly to keep the unit working properly. A suggestion would be to buy a few to keep on hand so you aren&#x27;t caught without one.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me the 7526 system for Christmas. I promptly charged the shaver and tried it out. The first couple of shaves have been excellent, much closer than the old Braun I&#x27;ve used for almost 10 years. My old one didn&#x27;t have the pivoting head, and its body was shorter, so I&#x27;m still adjusting my technique to the new shaver.&lt;BR&gt;The cleaning system is a nice idea, but I think the price and limited availability of new cartridges will prove to be its greatest liability. The recommended replacement schedule of the cartridge (monthly for daily cleanings) is a pretty obvious marketing gimmick.&lt;BR&gt;My greatest frustration is with the charger/cleaner stand. I used it without incident for two days and it worked wonderfully.  But on the third day, the mechanism that locks the shaver in place refused to stay put. I repeatedly removed and replaced the shaver in its stand, but still cannot get the thing to lock down. Seems that the plastic mechanism is pretty flimsy. I&#x27;ll send the base to be fixed, but if it breaks again, I&#x27;ll just pitch the base and clean the shaver manually. I cleaned my old Braun shaver once a month (at best) and it lasted for years.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on Ebay and originally learned of it off a commercial...The first couple days of use were hard on my skin but after that, I have to admit, I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave.  If you love gadgets and big boy toys, than this is an item for you.&lt;br /&gt;  My favorite things about this shaver is not only the close shave, but it&#x27;s auto-clean feature which cleans the blades in rubbing alcohol.  It&#x27;s very cool.  One thing else I learned ,after I bought the product and read the info. packet, is you don&#x27;t even have to worry about the batteries going bad after a couple of years like my Norelco, the system keeps track of your shaving routine and will discharge the battery and re-charge itself so it is ready to use when you need it...&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars and I my confidence in Braun products from here on out!</li>
    <li> I purchased my very first electric - been shaving with Gillettes for 20+ years. I loved the look of this shaver, the sound, and especially the cleaning system. It shaved baby smooth on my cheeks, although I did have a little tingle for a few hours afterward. But it had a heck of a time on my neck - I am now learning that the hair on my neck grows in a swirl pattern. Nonetheless, I made too many passes over my neck - the shaver seemed to leave strays down there. It resulted in significant razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I unfortunately returned the Syncro and purchsed a Norelco Spectra. What a difference. Its very close on the cheeks, but I don&#x27;t believe AS close as the Syncro. But it does an outstanding job on the neck - no irritation. And VERY quiet (I thought it was defective at first.) I would suggest that if you have not yet pruchased this Syncro, then wait. Purchase the Spectra, try it out for 3 weeks. Then buy the Syncro and try it out for 3 weeks. (You have a 60 day money-back guarantee with the Norelco.) Then simply return the one of your choice. It&#x27;s a little more out of pocket initially, but for something that we use every day and as important as many of us feel this is, it might be worth the experiment. I wish I had done it. But anyway, I am now happy with the Spectra, and happy that I don&#x27;t have the hassle of normal razor shaving every morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 7526 for almost two years now.  The shave is average, but the cost of consumables has been what I feel is high.  Besides the cleaning cartridges (at approx $4.50/ea), I&#x27;ve had to replace cutterheads twice in the two years.  The foil wears through exposing the cutters making replacement necessary.  Given their replacment cost, I figure they should last longer than 8 months.....  I&#x27;d been a Norelco user for a long time prior to the Braun, and I&#x27;ll soon be switching back....</li>
    <li> Call me naive, but when some people and ads say that this can give you a shave that is as close as a traditional razor, I believed. Unfortunately, it was not so. I used it for about month before I sent it back to Braun for the refund. I would go over my face multiple times and it still could not get to the point where the hair is just slightly below the skin like a razor can. On the positive note it&#x27;s very easy to clean and use regularly. If you are one of those people that have a hard time shaving with a razor without cutting yourself, I would whole heatedly recommend this but it&#x27;s still no &#x27;razor close&#x27; shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant of electrice razors, I had a real cheap one (20$ or so) when I first started shaving, and instead of cutting the hair it decided to pull it out. I read the reviews from amazon, and besides a couple poor ones about the foil and blade wearing out earlier than 18 months, i was sold. &lt;BR&gt;I got it home, and it works great, didnt pull a single hair out, cut just as close as my manual razor, the cleaning was quiet in my opinion, and i had no skin irritation. One thing i noticed was that the foil got kind of warm, and it kind of smelled like burning motor. Perhaps this is normal on the first time, or every time? (10 minutes of use) Let me know please. Other than that, as long as i dont burn it out, I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun 7526 for 6 months. The shave was very close. The cleaning unit is nice and the smell is good - it&#x27;s like you are using a new shaver each time. This was a replacement (and a good replacement) of the older Norelco Microaction. However, after 6 months the hole appeared in the foil. Well, if you do not press hard, it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face. However, after a couple of weeks the hole became larger and, finally, the sharp pieces of foil suddendly started to stick up. It left a couple of deep scratches on my face. Braun&#x27;s warranty doesn&#x27;t cover the foil and cutter block, but they agreed to replace mine free of charge. Nice customer service. So, I am waiting for a replacement and have to use my older Norelco. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews and many also point to the holes in the foil. They make it very thin to give you a close shave...but it comes at a price: it becomes very fragile. Be careful with it. (They should sell the foil separately from the cutter because of this).&lt;br /&gt;But I would still recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have had the shaver for one year and receive a good, clean, close shave every time.  Since this is the number one concern for me I give this shaver a 4. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I only need to shave about 2-3 times a week, the cleaning solution has lasted all year and only last week starting blinking.  Unfortunely, the shaving head also broke on me at the same time.  No big deal, because Braun recommends that you replace them every year anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My wife used to mention how much room the charging base takes up on the counter when I first got the shaver, but she has either given up or just accepted it.  I do agree that it does take up a bit of space.  If you have little counter space in the bathroom, I would suggest you find another spot for the charging base to sit or think twice about purchasing this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that the cleaning processing is a bit noisy, but no big deal in my house.  There is a slight odor also, but I kind of like it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good points include:  Clean and Close shave, easy to clean, easy to find replacement parts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bad points include:  Noisy cleaning process, expensive replacement parts (shaving head), charging base takes up alot of room on bathroom counter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good all around shaver...I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver when it works.  After a couple months of owning it, the motor became extremely loud and shaved poorly.  I took it to a certified repair shop, and got in line behind all of the other model 7526 shavers that also had this problem.  It got fixed in about a month, and it lasted about another year or so when the new motor also went out.  This seems to be a chronic problem with these shavers.</li>
    <li> I was quite skeptical about this shaver because I had never used an electric shaver but after using it for 2 weeks, I am glad I bought it. At first I was thinking about buying a Norelco (manufactured by Philips) but due to a very bad experience with Philips in the past, I decided on the Braun 7526. Besides that, Braun is a Gillette product, which is the leader in this field and has been a very dependable brand for many years.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To be honest, when I bought this shaver, I didn&#x27;t think it would shaver as well as it does. I was pleasantly surprised how close of a shave this little guy gives. I used to use Gillette MACH3 razors but because I have very sensitive skin, I couldn&#x27;t shave with a traditional razor everyday or else I would get razor burns and skin irritation so I was forced to shave once every 2 days. Since I have started using the Braun 7526, I have had no irritation and my skin feels smooth and clean. After the first time I used this shaver I asked my girlfriend to feel my skin and tell me if she could feel any difference- she couldn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only does this shaver give you a close shave, it self cleans itself so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning after you use it. Inside the shaver is a \\&quot;smart logic chip\\&quot; that detects your shaving patterns and optimizes the performance and battery. Cleaning cycle is 15 minutes long and it is rather noisy when the unit is being cleaned. Since this is my first electric shaver, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with. Personally, it does not bother me so I have no complains.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this shaver... so far. If something goes wrong, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Buy it - you won&#x27;t regret it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have used electrics for many years, as well as some periods of blade shaving.  I have a very, very thick, tough beard, and EXTREMELY sensitive skin (great combination, no?).  Anyway, this shaver gives me a perfect shave with no irritation.  It&#x27;s the Holy Grail!  A few specific comments: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1)  Many people have commented on some difficulties with flat-lying or stray neck hairs.  This has never been an issue for me, and the Syncro gets every last bit of stubble everywhere for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m afraid that I disagree with Braun about shaving before showering (they recommend it, I disagree).  What works best for me is to shave AFTER a hot shower, and WITH a liquid pre-shave.  I also spray lube the shaver head before shaving.  If I do those things, my face feels glass-smooth after shaving, with no cuts, scrapes or irritation of any kind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3)  I have had this shaver for quite a while now, and the only drawback I have found is that the screens seem to wear out a bit too fast.  I only get about 5-6 months out of each screen.  Not a big deal, and again I do have a very tough beard and spend about 7 minutes a day shaving (longer than most men, I think) which is a combination that probably wreaks havoc with the screens.  Still, I wish the screens lasted a bit longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4)  I haven&#x27;t replaced my Syncro with the Activator because I am 100% satisfied with the Syncro, and also because the multi-directional pattern on the Activator looks like it&#x27;s designed to catch solve the \\&quot;stray hair\\&quot; problem - which is not an issue to me.  I doubt the Activator shaves any closer (I don&#x27;t see how it could!). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5) I totally and 1000% disagree with the various guys who post comments that say that an electric can&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.  My experience is actually the opposite.  With an electric, I shave right up into the grain, and since my skin isn&#x27;t being destroyed in the process, I can shave extremely close.  With a blade, I have to be SUPER careful and never shave into the grain (and only make so many repeat swipes with the blade).  So a blade razor for me is one big compromise between closeness and comfort -- in other words if you have sensitive skin you can&#x27;t use a blade to its optimal closeness because it does too much damage.  Not so with the Syncro guys!!  Use it to shave as close it can, and it still doesn&#x27;t harm your face.  Better than a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product without reservation.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> When I first got this shaver, I was so happy with it! The cleaning system is well thought out and works well. Cleaning supplies are probably good renewable income for the company...marketing genius. However, after I had owned this system for about a year, the charging handle that comes down onto the shaver from above would no longer stay connected. The latching mechanism broke and I could no longer charge or clean the system without manually holding the charging handle down. This effectively renders the system useless unless you want to manually clean the shaver yourself. I see that the newer designs no longer use this mechanism and the shaver merely sits in the cleaning well. I assume they charge from the side. Something to think about...</li>
    <li> This product surprised me. I didn&#x27;t expect a difference by just a adding a self clean feature. But man this is a good shave. It even feels clean as you shave. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t seam to pick up the neck hairs as well as my last Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for about 8 years now and this one really takes it to the next level. Perhaps my biggest complaint with electric shavers has been cleaning them--no more with this new Braun. My only complaint is that I only was able to shave and clean one time before the cleaning unit broke and I had to return it. Needless to say I am still waiting to get a new one back. Overall I am very happy with this new product.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best shaver I ever owned. Quiet motor, close shave, great feel on the face. The cleaning system is amazing. This is the shaver that you want.</li>
    <li> There are places where an electric shave just doesn&#x27;t cut it. It does not give as close a shave as a razor. But, for an electric it is pretty good-a decent shave and a nice self-cleaning system. After 2 months I am still using it, but I could easily see going back to my regular razor. &lt;br /&gt;The main advantage over the manual razor is that I don&#x27;t have to bother with washing and shaving cream. This is especially convenient if I want to shave in the afternoon to get rid of that 5:00 shadow for an evening out.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it again, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it - not much of an advantage over a blade. But since I have it, I use it.</li>
    <li> Does the cleaning system work? Yes, and that is the best part about this razor. You still need to take off the screen and brush out the major amounts of stubble, or it doesn&#x27;t clean effectively. Pleasant-smelling lemon cleanser also lubricates the head (and freshens the bathroom!). &lt;br /&gt;The shaver does a much poorer job at getting close than my previous &amp;quot;lift and cut&amp;quot; razor. It does get fairly close, just not &amp;quot;like a blade&amp;quot; close. Neck area is hard to get done well. Also, it irritates my skin more than the &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; type. I do NOT have sensitive skin. Thick beard, yes, sensitive skin, no. &lt;br /&gt;The shaver dumps stubble all over the place during a shave after more than one shave... If you use it in the car on your way to work, better make sure you clean (empty the stubble) it every day (definitely NO need to run it through the base&#x27;s cleaning cycle every day-although, it DOES make it smell nice). I run it maybe every 3rd time to once a week.  I previously had a wet/dry razor, also, which shaved closer wet, but not dry. Also, it irritated my skin more than the Braun. I like the charging base (the blue light that stays steadily lit when choosing both &amp;quot;clean and charge&amp;quot; makes a good (if somewhat dim) nightlight).&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m going back to an expensive model &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; razor once this one starts wearing out.</li>
    <li> As a life-long Braun user, I&#x27;ve owned a Syncro for 2 years now.  It has its good points, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, because of the high cost of upkeep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Good:  nice, close shave, recharges very quickly, handy self-cleaning system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Bad: because of the much smaller cutting block, shaves take MUCH longer than with older Brauns (2-3 times as long.)  Also the cleaning cycle is very noisy, and the cost of the cleaning cartridges at $5 a pop can add up quickly.  I extend the cartridge life by a month or two by adding Isopropyl alcohol when the red light goes on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:  The cutting block is a small, cheap piece of plastic with tiny little pieces of metal foil embedded for blades ,  These buggers break off very easily, and often do so within the first couple of months of routine shaving, rendering the shaver ineffective, with shaves taking even longer than the usual 5-7 minutes.  A new block costs $20-25.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband last Christmas.  The razor works great but we have had to get the clean &amp; charge base repaired 3 times in less than 1 year.  The service time from Braun is awful.  We have been waiting 3 weeks so far for our 3rd repair and my husband has been cleaning the razor manually which is a pain over long periods of time and the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well when it is cleaned manually.  I am disappointed in the reliablity and the length of time it takes Braun to get the problem resolved.</li>
    <li> After using a Norelco shaver for 7 years (with no problems), I decided to try the Braun after reading the good reviews.  I purchased this system because of the cleaning system and other features.  After using the shaver about 8 times, the switch broke off and I could no longer turn it on.  I checked the Braun website and found no local service centers.  Instead of returning it for a full refund like I should have, I decided to mail it out for service on the other side of the state (after calling the center and them telling me it should be an easy problem to fix). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months now, and still no shaver.  After repeated calls to the serving location, I&#x27;m still being told that they&#x27;re waiting for Braun to ship them the parts.  Repeated emails to Braun are still not being answered and getting through on the phone is impossible.  This is my first experience with Braun and most likely my last. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, if you experience a problem in the first 30 days, return it instead of trying to get it serviced!  This may be a decent shaver, but not worth the hassle.  I&#x27;m going back to using a Norelco!</li>
    <li> Product was in brand new condition, and showed up far sooner than I had expected.  Completely professional from start to finish.  I highly recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as a gift a couple of months ago.  The cleaning system is overrated.  The alcohol burns and only lasts a few weeks before having to be replaced (at $15 a pop).  The shaver itself is not bad, but it has cut me way too many times.      I prefer an electric shaver so that I can get a clean shave while I&#x27;m bleary eyed in the mornings.  But the poor design, especially the middle portion of the floating facade which is stationary, is the cause of the multiple cuts i&#x27;ve received.      I would not recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit about 3 years ago after finally deciding to make the jump to electric.  For about 18 months, it performed great -- good, close shaves and no trouble out of the cleaning/recharging stand.  Then the wheels started to come off the bus.  The first part to fail was the mechanism that releases the foil screen.  There are two plastic \\&quot;buttons\\&quot; on either side of the razor just below the screen, and pressing them will release the screen.  One of the buttons broke.  Not a huge deal in and of itself but certainly frustrating considering this was a $140 razor (at the time) and it was only 18 months old.  The next thing I noticed was the razor was no longer being adequately cleaned in the stand.  Even after running through two or three consecutive cycles, there was still a substantial amount of stubble around the blades.  Last to go was the mechanism that holds the foil screen in place.  One of the clips either broke or just wore out, resulting in one side of the foil not being secure.  The result?  The razor would end up pulling rather than cutting at least once per shave.  After putting up with this for the better part of a year, I decided it was time for a replacement.  I opted to go with the Panasonic Vortex HydraClean ES 8077S rather than another Braun.  When the Braun worked, it worked great.  I just didn&#x27;t think the high price was justified by the lack of reliability I experienced; after all, the razor had something wrong with it for 18 of the 36 months I used it.  I think I can find another brand that will hold up better than this one.  We&#x27;ll see if Panasonic is it.</li>
    <li> Been using Braun for 30 years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Cut really well and self cleans.</li>
