<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The threads were less than stellar. I was unable to get this more than 1.5 turns onto the shower nozzle. No, I didn&#x27;t cross-thread it. This is just not a high quality product. I was very disappointed. I think that for those that are able to get it attached, it would be quite useful.</li>
    <li> Just wish there was a pulse to it. Works great. Good pressure. I use it to floss teeth &amp; clean ears.</li>
    <li> I love this product, wish it was detachable so I could use atbthensink too &amp; that it had a little more power but other than that I love it and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long..</li>
    <li> The product looks good, to bad I can,t fit in my shower.</li>
    <li> Good but not as strong as the kind that has an electric pump. I get the feeling there is a limiter on how powerful the spray will allow, not sure why that would be but that is the feeling that I get. I&#x27;m pretty  happy for the most part though. Good design, strong plastic parts and was very easy it install.</li>
    <li> Bummed this does fit on our shower head</li>
    <li> i thought this would be a great idea not bad but also not the pressure i would like  i would say a 3out of 5</li>
    <li> This is the most effective oral irrigator I have used so far. Water Pik does not really do a good job. It is also messy on the sink counter with water spurting all over. I use the H2Oral Irrigator while I am in the shower. Hook up is easy. No need to have a PhD to do it.</li>
    <li> A cheap way to keep your teeth perfect. The dentist never had anything to complain about with this water floss. Build quality is good and will last. If the tube becomes loose, just snip off the tip and it&#x27;s good again. Else, just use some glue or a tightener.</li>
    <li> best way to clean your teeth while taking a shower.</li>
    <li> Hooked and using.&lt;br /&gt;Stream of water is a little fine but works good while in shower.&lt;br /&gt;No more mess all over the bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Very weird feeling, but once you get into the rhythm and use is often, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Easy to install, simple operation....and cleaner than the portable counter top models.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, easy to remember every time you take a shower!</li>
    <li> Looking for an oral irrigation system.&lt;br /&gt;We have zero counter space, and the idea of a water tank that needs to be cleaned to prevent bacteria build up, gross.&lt;br /&gt;This one works great. Use in the shower using warm shower water. Easy to use, easy to stay on daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;Has a holder for the tips, very simple pressure -on/off and stays neatly in place for zero interference during shower use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate flossing, I mean seriously hate it. So in search of good dental hygiene I was told to get a water pick of some kind. I&#x27;m a multitask-er and I have limited counter space, so this was a good option to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I grab my shower in the morning, I just take care of my flossing needs too. The pressure is great for me as my shower as ample pressure normally, and the control for the pressure in the handle of the device works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine trying to use it while not taking a shower, that seems... silly. Like why would you buy one to chill in your shower if you were going to try to use it at your sink?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, highly recommend for those who don&#x27;t mind taking care of their teeth while taking a shower. Pressure is great, it was easy to install and it comes with a lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> I have 62 psi water pressure in my house, this thing is a powerhouse its easy to change the heads and the stream is so good if you drop it looks the run away fire hose from cartoons! If people say this is weak it has to be their water pressure and most have 60 to 70 psi</li>
    <li> This is our second one and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This was so easy to mount in my shower, and using it regularly has given us great results at our dentist!  Great gum health!</li>
    <li> ahhh, works as advertised but I took it down and tossed it.  To much of a pain to stick my head in the shower after I eat and wrap the shower curtin so it won&#x27;t spray all over the place.  Bought a Sonic Care instead.</li>
    <li> Only regret is not buying this sooner.</li>
    <li> This was a great, economical introduction to oral irrigation.  I have been using this since the first of the year, to deal with a temporary bridge that isn&#x27;t supposed to be flossed.  I like oral irrigation so much now that I think I&#x27;ll keep it up even after my dental work is completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;In shower, so the initial mess of the learning curve is contained.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install and use (be sure to use plumber&#x27;s teflon tape!)&lt;br /&gt;Strength of the water stream is variable&lt;br /&gt;Low cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (as opposed to other brands):&lt;br /&gt;No pause button&lt;br /&gt;Only one kind of tip&lt;br /&gt;Not a water saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was initially messy for this novice, so I was glad it was in the shower.  There were no instructions for the proper way to irrigate, but I found online videos to help me.  As for initial tickling, the instructions advise using a less forceful stream until one gets used to it; tickling was never an issue for me.  And yes, you do stand under a running shower while using it--there is no other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to review this product after my next dental appointment, but a drought has been announced in my area, so I must take shorter showers now and so eventually I will be buying a countertop model.  I must say, if I had started with a countertop model, I would have been discouraged from all the mess while I was learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should echo that this is not a substitute for flossing. But I sure do this more often than I am supposed to floss!  I really enjoy the process and look forward to using it every morning.</li>
    <li> Works great and has become a routine. Can&#x27;t imagine using a water pik outside of the shower.</li>
    <li> It feels cheap, but I have not had any issues with it yet. This gets the job done and was cheaper than the $80 one the dentist was trying to push on me.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. So convenient, and no bulky gadgets on your bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> The units hose has come lose at the shower head connection after one week, making this irrigatior useless. I&#x27;m not sure if there is I&#x27;ll fix this, but I&#x27;m returing this product for a refund.</li>
    <li> This product is so convenient and easy to use you will enjoy your showers even more. Shower fresh feeling in your mouth. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need to floss but is a great way to promote healthy gums and feels amazing when done! It is so easy to install/setup you will feel like a pro! It even comes with teflon tape to prevent leakage. Comes with four different colored water&#x3D;pic heads for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Love this product, just what I was looking for, works well. This is very easy to use in the shower. Have had plug in flossers and found they didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still looking for someone to give this to.  It didn&#x27;t fit my shower head.  Wish I had returned it right away.</li>
    <li> Great installation. easy and neat. The only problem is that the spray isn&#x27;t as strong as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; water-pick. Still, can&#x27;t wait until I hear what the dental hygienist says at my next appointment now that I&#x27;ve been massaging my gums so regularly.</li>
    <li> Works great and for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I purchased two,one for my 14 year old son who just got braces and one for myself. I was not sure how this product worked as I had never used one myself but here&#x27;s the deal....I am so glad I ordered this because using it in the shower is the best way. I can only imagine the mess everywhere if I had purchased a countertop model.It is so easy to use. I like the pressure control because this type product does take some getting used to, I guess because it is new to me, but oh so easy.... As for installation it looked easy- but I watched my plumber friend hook it up so he had no trouble at all.</li>
    <li> I saw this at a friends house this past year and was amaized.  I went to Amazon and looked for it and there it was.  I have now bought 2 of these because they are so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good little product.  Easy to attach to the shower head.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and the quality hasn&#x27;t changed and it is essay to adjust how hard the water comes out.</li>
    <li> Works Great!  Not cavity in years since I started using these devices in the shower - This model I like much better because you can adjust the flow.</li>
    <li> What i like----its easy to use, its convenient--in the shower, and it forces good habits.  There are 4 tips of different colors and a little hanger to conveniently (with special supplied adhesive tape) install in shower.  There is a diverter valve at shower head that you turn it on, and divert water to it/vs shower head.  Its a great product, and priced very well, especially compared to electric water pik machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like- nothing enough to deduct even one star----the force that the water comes out is limited to the shower, and is either extremely strong, or not strong enough.  I think the heads wear out quickly because they start out spraying a stream of water that literally would take paint off the walls to now, after a year, it isn&#x27;t stong enough.  This is a minor issue because its still plenty strong.  The one main complaint i have is you cannot put any mouthwash, or things like peridex (chlorhexidine) which is used for peridontal disease, or post op for dental/oral surgery.  AAlso the dentist who put my implants in told me to be sure and use a &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; and add chlorhexidine to it.  That impeded my ability to use this and I had to buy a machine with a tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its priced right, has a nice long hose, and works well.  I&#x27;m being very picky with my 2 &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; but i wanted to express the only 2 issues I have with this and I will repeat that they are minor complaints.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> Great...I can floss teeth while showering...as a busy man, it not only shaves time away from the sink; but since I&#x27;m in the shower I actually get a longer period of flossing my teeth.  Win-Win.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy electronic water piks anymore...buy this and if you turn it on full blast you can clean other stuff with it to.&lt;br /&gt;This was reccomended to me by my Dentist originally and she is generally a good judge of cleaning methods.</li>
    <li> got it and am now using it.  but i&#x27;ve just ordered the new model waterpik to replace it.  good idea and simple design and excellent price but teeth are important components of your body and deserve better.  consider that when you get old, the only pleasure you have left is eating.  had the older model cordless waterpik, which required charging every week, but did a great job.  that broke after a couple of years - the pump/pulse mechanism started making loud internal banging noises.  i&#x27;ve ordered the new model waterpik with the better looking design.  both are cordless, which is what you want because  these are best used in the shower.  i like the waterpik because it has the power my teeth need and i don&#x27;t like wasting time with an inefficient technique.  i shave in the shower (like einstein) and have honed my routine over many years, so am cognizant of time.  this shower powered \\&quot;irrigator\\&quot; is not very powerful and does not pulse, which i think you need.  they say that the waterpik action is better than flossing but i doubt the irrigation approach could come close to actual flossing.  also considered the panasonic but that seems to need batteries and cannot take rechargable batteries (according to the manual), so that will not work.  also do not like the design and read a review that said it lacked power.  panasonic is always a good choice for products because you can count on their build quality, but the design falls short here.  probably their next model will take over the top ranking.  waterpik has been in this business for a long time and i am  a big believer in experience.  i assume they have have approached the problem scientifically (which i like) with research on what pulse power is optimum and then designed to that standard.  the big advantage over the prior model is the new ergo design and the new rechargeable battery unit, which reviews say last much longer than before.  while i have your attention, let me also recommend the [[ASIN:B00170ZWEG New Wave Shower Filter]] for $30.  this is a must have.  without it your skin is absorbing the chlorine equivalent of four glasses of tap water per shower.  chlorine comes out of solution with agitation and heat, i.e. showering.  i guarantee your skin will be noticeably softer after one week.  like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  more importantly, you will live longer.  UPDATE: i recently got the new model waterpik and it is not so good.  not recommended.  i think the older model was better (now at half the price).  will probably return this one and get the old model waterpik.  the problem is that these should be used in the shower and the new waterpik does not have a rubber cover for the recharging input.  they saved 1/10th of a cent and they built-in planned obsolescence.  the old model does have this.  reviewers have said that the new model dies after awhile not so much because the battery wears out (although it seems to), but because the contacts get corroded and the battery will not fully charge.  so this is not a customer-centric design.  furthermore, i believe it uses up the water supply faster than the old model. (i know i am going on about a different product here but it is in the same water irrigation category)  the water reservoir is larger but, on high, does not last as long (42 seconds).  this would not be such a problem since, in the shower, you can fill it up during use if you cup your hand over the fill hole, but the fill opening is small and not well placed.  with the old model this \\&quot;active\\&quot; filling was easier as the fill opening was at the top and larger.  another disappointment is that the new model does not seem to deliver the water quite as strongly.</li>
    <li> The dental shower irrigator is simple to install and simple to use! The adjustable pressure valve allows for gum sensitivity... it&#x27;s just like flossing with water. I recommend this system to those who feel they don&#x27;t have time or space on their counters for a needed oral irrigation.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this!!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> it, cleans, but not pulsate.  like I said it&#x27;s okay, but not great.  not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;nothing else to say now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Waterpik before, so I have no frame of reference as to how strong the stream of water is supposed to be, but on that front, this is: not very. I can&#x27;t imagine that it would dislodge anything stronger than a stray, whole leaf of spinach stuck to a tooth. Worse, it was the biggest pain to screw onto the shower head imaginable. Despite the broken blisters I got on my hands trying to unscrew my first unsuccessful attempt at joining this item to my showerhead and making sure it was tight the next time, water continues to seep or spray from the joint (even with plumber&#x27;s tape--NOT included), probably accounting for the lackluster spray I finally did get. If the jet of water becomes TOO strong, however, the removable applicator tip they supply you with shoots right off of the hose. You have to physically hold the tip and the end of the hose together in order to get any kind of strong spray. This is probably going right back (although I should mention that the seller was very speedy in delivery; I don&#x27;t fault them for this at all and, depending on how they handle the return, would not hesitate to use them again--edited to add this).</li>
    <li> Sturdy unit, hoses and connector feel like quality.  I like the color coded picks for each person. Doesn&#x27;t take the place of flossing but cleans good, feels good, tickles a lot at first.  Would buy again, or suggest someone should get.</li>
    <li> This item good in theory and worked fine, but the pressure out of my was not good enough for my needs .</li>
    <li> there was no water pressure at all. returned item and bought waterpik. you def get what you pay u for here.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of water flossing but I prefer this the most. You can adjust the power easily and the mess is in the shower&lt;br /&gt;not all over the sink. In the past when I used one it actually help improve my gums. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This water pick is awesome.  It was easy to hook up to the shower, and it works really well. I wanted to wait to post my review until after I went to the dentist - and the results were good! At my last dental cleaning, I had a lot of plaque build up, and bleeding gums (gross) I then used this for 6 months and just went to the dentist again, I had very little to no plaque, and no bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I always was forgetting to floss every day, and I know I would be way more inclined to use it while I&#x27;m in the shower - and its true, I use it every day for like 30 seconds and have had great results. Also, it has no effect on the water pressure of your shower so don&#x27;t worry about that. It also cleans the grout rather nicely :)</li>
    <li> No matter what my husband did this product leaked &amp; leakage was not contained within the shower area. Returne item.</li>
    <li> Awesome easy to install and works well.</li>
    <li> This product is well built and performs well. I wish it had a tiny bit more pressure. I won&#x27;t know the actual results until I have my next oral exam. But so far I am very pleased and would recommend this product to friends and family</li>
    <li> pretty awesome, lol you can even clean your belly button.. ( words from the Boyfriend lol ) I really like having this, I water floss everyday now :)</li>
    <li> This unit was easy to install, it includes everything you will need. It does a better job than dental floss.</li>
    <li> I love this.. so much better then having the clutter on bathroom counter.. just take a shower and water pic your teeth, since you have the water on anyways while taking a shower, why not multi task..</li>
    <li> I used to have a waterpik that I had to setup everytime I wanted to use it. With not a lot of countertop space it became a chore. This handy thing is plugged in line with the shower head and I use it every time I shower (at least once a day, LOL).&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it helps to let your mouth fill up with water while using it to reduce the tickle sensation. Also don&#x27;t turn up the pressure all the way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the mess the typical water pik makes on your counter.  My co-worker told me about this and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> So far so good! The biggest problem we have had was the kids fighting over the colors! easy to assemble. easy to install. easy to use. easy on my bank account!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made of plastic but seems to be working just fine.  Easy to install.  A lot more convenient to do it in the shower then try to keep the water from running down your front over the sink.Don&#x27;t know if this will hold up long term but for the price why not take a chance?</li>
    <li> Bought 2 years ago and still works great</li>
    <li> The whole thing isn&#x27;t exactly high-end quality, though it isn&#x27;t expensive either. But it is decent and very easy to install and it really works great. (Don&#x27;t know for how long—we had it for a few days only.) So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like it, it works great, I highly recommend this product it makes flossing easy and it has cut down my plaque so I do not have to go to the dentist as often.</li>
    <li> Anyone interested in healthy mouth and gums should make the small investment in this&lt;br /&gt;Dental Shower H2Oral Irrigator Flosser.  It&#x27;s so very easy to use, right in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;There is no excuse not to have clean teeth and mouth any longer. A little effort goes&lt;br /&gt;a long way. Every 6 months at our dental check-up and teeth cleaning, the dentist&lt;br /&gt;notes how great our teeth are.</li>
    <li> The appliance works as advertised, but the adhesive tape isn&#x27;t holding very well on my tile wall.  So, make sure you have a shiny smooth tub wall to put it on.</li>
    <li> Very low quality, however (so far) seems to work okay. I bought to use in place of my WaterPik, which takes time and some effort to use. Being able to use in the shower sounded like a good idea so I  bought it to give it a try. Needs a valve to divert the entire pressure of the shower to the irrigator.</li>
    <li> I  am much more in love with this product than I expected to be. Honestly, I feel like it has helped me avoid extra trips to the dentist. I did not take very good care of my teeth when I was young and am now paying the price with many cavities and a couple of crowns. Fortunately, I&#x27;ve at least realized at the age of 42 how important good dental hygiene is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not ever claim that this replaces floss, but it definitely gives you a great second round of thorough in-between and gum cleaning. I use it in an apartment shower that has water restriction taps and it still puts a good amount of water pressure in the spray. I do usually have to &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; the wand a few times to get the most pressure coming out, usually just testing it on my hand as I adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and used one of the counter top Waterpiks as a kid, you&#x27;ll wonder why it took so long for somebody to think of this. The only negatives are that it adds a couple of minutes to your shower time and here in CA, it&#x27;s not the most drought-friendly product.</li>
    <li> This works GREAT!!! My wife and I use it every day!! Great!!</li>
    <li> tickles my gums too much to use. I have no problems with the regular water pik</li>
    <li> First of all.......I have the shower breeze both sink and shower units...I really like them, but I wanted another shower water floss for the other bathroom shower.....This is EASY to install and it does work, but only satisfactorily....The reason is that you don&#x27;t get NEARLY the pressure that you do with the other shower breeze I have. To be fair, this is somewhat effective and I&#x27;m going to keep it because of that...This may actually be perfect for some people who don&#x27;t like too much pressure, but after having used these types of things for a long time, my teeth and gums are not ticklish anymore and the more you use these, the more pressure you like....to an extent of course, because you don&#x27;t want to do harm, but you get a sense as to how to use these properly after having used them a while.....I&#x27;m not sure how this will hold up....I like to floss my teeth for a while with these and it sure wastes a LOT of water because I have to use this one twice or three times as long as the shower breeze to feel like I&#x27;ve even accomplished anything........I think there is another product called shower floss. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet......But consider the other two either shower breeze or shower floss.</li>
    <li> The product works, but the pressure isn&#x27;t what I would want. It is easily installed and does come with 4 &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34;. I was thinking the picks would be different types but what I find is it&#x27;s for multiple people (4 of the same). But overall I like the product.</li>
    <li> Used 4 times stopped working.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This thing works great last check up perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Love this and would recommend everyone who uses a water pik to try one of these. You never have to worry about the running out of water....</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Keep in mind the cost of this product is less than $25.  I see this as a great value.  First, I would like to say there is plenty of pressure.  In fact, you can adjust it to your liking.  Maybe, some people would like more, but it has plenty.  Very easy to install, I took about 2 minutes and did not need any tools.  Does exactly what I need it for and I highly recommend this to all shoppers.</li>
    <li> hardly a drop out of the end</li>
    <li> I bought the H2Oral Irrigator to replace my Shower Floss, which broke after several years of good use. The H2Oral Irrigator is about $7 cheaper. That&#x27;s the good news. The bad news is that even at full flow, the H2Oral Irrigator doesn&#x27;t deliver enough pressure to be a good gum massager--I&#x27;m used to a much higher pressure. In addition, even when the Irrigator is fully on, water is still pouring out at high volume from the shower head, wasting gallons while you&#x27;re flossing. (Yes, I tried actually soaping and showering with one hand and water flossing with the other at the same time--good luck with that! Just more wasted water.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference seems to be that the open/close valve for the H2Oral Irrigator is located at the bottom of the plastic tube, near the mouthpiece. On the other hand, the open/close valve on the Shower Floss is up near the shower head, at the top of the plastic tube. This means when you turn the valve way open, water actually STOPS flowing out of the shower head, and you can get quite a bit more pressure for cleaning and gum massage. (It may take you awhile to work up to higher pressure as your gums get healthier.)</li>
    <li> greatest waterpic I have ever used</li>
    <li> This is so much easier to use that the water pic next to the sink.</li>
    <li> This is my thrid Dental shower H2Oran irrigator flosser over the last 4 years and my husband and I love it. We love being able to use in the shower and keep teeth clean. Using this flosser improved my gums and took them from a 5 to a 3 which is super important for gum strenth and it proves to the benefit of deep and thorough cleaning. I highly recommend this to help w/ gum disease and sensitivity and strengthening of deep gum pockets.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  My teeth are cleaner with out the mess of a standard water pick.  Stream can be strong or weak depending on your preference.  Installation was easy.</li>
    <li> so glad that i got my shower irrigator flosser because it does the job. The best for braces. I feel as if I just walked out of the dentist office.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good if you want to keep &amp;#34;the mess&amp;#34; in the shower.  But it doesn&#x27;t pulse so it is a very poor substitute for a water pick.  Even though I still have this in my shower I haven&#x27;t used it (since my initial &#x27;testing&#x27;).  I use my water pick every time I brush as part of my pre-brush regimen.  Don&#x27;t settle for this, get a real pulsing water pick with a &#x27;tank&#x27;.</li>
    <li> It wouldn&#x27;t go onto our shower head.  I tried all the adapters and no change.  Looks like it is about a few millimeters off</li>
    <li> This took some getting use to for me since I have very sensitive teeth so I had to start with low pressure and gradually move my way up.  I do not know how anyone uses these water picks over their sinks, they are so messy!  I think using it in the shower is the only option since water gets everywhere.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to irrigate both his ears to get rid of ear wax, and also to use on his teeth. In 2 weeks, his ears have no wax. That alone is worth the purchase. The doctor&#x27;s office charged $128 and didn&#x27;t get the majority of the wax out. The amount of water pressure the shower has is probably responsible for people liking or not liking this product. We have been able to regulate the pressure and everything works well.</li>
    <li> Love this wet floss. I call it wet floss because it&#x27;s essentially doing what flossing does but better. Had no trouble putting together. Water pressure is adjustable on the actual hand held unit. So much better than the counter units. I can&#x27;t believe they sell this for so little money. When you compare to others that serve the same purpose there is no comparison. Price is excellent and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Love it. Installs easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It does have an adjustable strength of spray which is nice, but using in the shower isn&#x27;t ideal - no mirror.</li>
    <li> Easy to install on shower head and works great. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This unit works pretty well. As pressure gets a little high, the attachment pops up a little but it can be held on.</li>
    <li> I use distilled water in my &amp;#34;Hydro-flosser&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER use tap water, which is loaded w/ toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and use</li>
    <li> I work in the Dental field and am addicted to shower flossing, waterpiking and flossing...it totally pays off. I een got my husband using the shower flosser and it is amazing, he actually does and I&#x27;m happy because he does not make a mess since he is already in the shower. Worth the buy. The only negative is that the holder does not stay on the wall to save it&#x27;s life so my flosser just hangs there but that does not bug me at all. Happy flossing!</li>
    <li> This is great way to use a pick without the messy. I got it on recommendation of my hygeinist because I don&#x27;t floss as much as I should. It doesn&#x27;t replace flossing but helps not get that look when I go to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Works great. No issues. Love the idea</li>
    <li> It sprays a constant stream at regular faucet pressure. Buy a Waterpik instead if you want higher pulsating pressure that cleans better.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for flossing in the shower.  Easy to install and works like a charm.  Much less expensive than Waterpick, but works as well without mess.</li>
    <li> not at all alot of pressure and rough to use because when you use it  tickles your  mouth and startles you because you don&#x27;t expect to feel such an intense tickling sensation in your mouth... it no longer at use in my home</li>
    <li> My husband loved this as well as I.  It works even better then the one we have had placed on the sink. Saves room and time.  Works so well when showering and even feels cleaner.  Just had a dental checkup and no cavities and commented on well and healthy my gums are.  Think of time you have to use when filling up the one on the sink and then empty, clean it all the time and clean the implements too.  This hooks up to your shower in under 5 minutes so simple and easily.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper and in my opinion better than a typical waterpik. We bought a waterpik first, and were surprised by how loud it was, and it was frustrating to have to keep refilling it. The water came out too forcefully, and doing it over the sink you have to keep your mouth shut around the waterpik wand to avid spraying water all over the mirror and countertop, pausing every few moments to spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I typically brush my teeth in the shower anyway, and this cheap little guy installs right into the shower head and has a little easy to stick on mounting thingie for the shower wall.  It turns on with just a little twist of the handle, and you can adjust the pressure however you like - from a gentle drip to a HOLY OW THAT&#x27;S WAY TOO HARD spray, and since you&#x27;re already in the shower, no need to keep your mouth shut or worry about water getting everywhere.  When I was using a waterpik at the sink, the process would take a few minutes. With this, the post-brushing irrigation process takes 30 seconds and I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> my son says it tickles more than it sprays,  he will use it but it tickles and not much pressure</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist tells me this gadget does NOT take the place of flossing. Using floss removes the sticky plaque that will harden on your teeth. So don&#x27;t toss your floss, but do use this baby. Your teeth will feel so darned clean afterward, and you&#x27;ll clean along the gumline like never before. Just use some common sense and don&#x27;t turn it up so high you&#x27;ll hurt yourself with it, and be careful where you aim it (you could put your eye out!). I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the water pressure or temperature of my shower while I&#x27;m using it. It&#x27;s  great. Go ahead and get one.</li>
    <li> I stopped using the water pic because of the mess I made all over the sink and my face when I used it.  My Dental Hygienist recommended the H2Oral Irrigation System that you install in the shower.  Tried it.  Love it.  No mess cause you are in the shower.  Easy to install -- even I could do it.  Reasonable price also.</li>
    <li> Love it, works well and saved $$ over leading brand!</li>
    <li> Works great and cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my ShowerFloss irrigator. After 12 years of daily use, one of the piks had broken and I couldn&#x27;t find replacement piks on Amazon.  I decided to buy a complete new unit and thought this brand would be similar. But I was mistaken. The design on this is such that you cannot get sufficient pressure to the head without unscrewing the control to the point that it comes out in your hand. This renders the product useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After becoming frustrated with this product, I took the trouble to look up ShowerFloss on the internet. They sell the complet unit on Amazon, but to get the parts it appears you have to go to their website. They maintain a basic website that allows you to order any part of the irrigator at a very reasonable cost.  In their design, the control is at the shower head, not in the handle. It provides plenty of pressure and never comes unscrewed. It is a very basic and functional design that lasts for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought the ShowerFloss at the recommendation of my hygienist. It was invented by a dentist in Atlanta, and at the time you ordered it by mail. After using it for some time, my gums greatly improved, and I never had another cavity (just one old one that needed replacement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shower irrigator is an excellent invention that makes it easy to floss while you are in the shower. No mess and no use of precious real estate on your sink counter. Installation is easy, but takes a little handyman skill. You need a good pipe pliers, some teflon tape, and a modicum of know-how. Usually someone in the family can do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For those who experienced &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; of the gums, my advice is just keep at it. Everyone feels this at first. After a few weeks it goes away, and you can use higher pressures that cleanse and massage more effectively.  In my experience, the ShowerFloss brand is the way to go.</li>
    <li> worked great, arrived super fast, and no more mess in my bathroom from a water-pic My husband loves his too</li>
    <li> I am willing to try just about anything that encourages my 9 year old son to exercise good dental hygiene.  He doesn&#x27;t like the sonic toothbrush or the plastic dental picks with dental floss so I decided to buy this water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install unscrew the shower head, screw the flosser base onto the inlet pipe and screw the shower head onto the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use Turn on the shower, adjust the stream by turning the knob on the flosser and place into your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective Does a good job of removing debris and detritus from between teeth; nicely massages gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality iffy Seems to be cheaply made and expensive for an over $20 item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pulse option You can only adjust the water pressure, you cannot get a pulse mode which I  think would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No shower shut-off You cannot turn off the water at the shower head so you have no choice but to be taking a shower while using this device.  Wastes water and I believe it  reduces the top pressure ability too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs higher maximum pressure I wish you could make the water jet stream stronger than the maximum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with this purchase, it is effective and simple to use and it is something I plan to use daily.  I believe my son will find it entertaining enough to use also.  Along with watermelon flavored toothpaste  and super soft  toothbrushes, maybe he will still have teeth when he grows up.</li>
    <li> it does what it says...simple operation, easy to hook up (depending on your plumbing ability).&lt;br /&gt;no pulsing action, just a steady stream of water.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my wife and I recently moved and we had a shower pick before, and it was still packed away in a box we couldn&#x27;t identify and we missed it.  The H2ORAL IRRIGATOR is very similar to the Water Pick, except the valve used to turn it on and off is located on the irrigator pick itself and not at the shower head.  This requires the irrigator to be turned in order to turn it on and off.  This twists the water line and is awkward.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My dental hygenist approves of my efforts which include the H2Oral Irrigator rather than the much more expensive well known brand.</li>
    <li> Whole family likes it. We use it every day.Will probably order another one for the other shower soon...thanks so much</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.Decent boxing.Use thread tape/plumber putty to install.Works great easy to use.takes a little practice to not over power your gums and teeth.only needs 1/8, 1/4 turn at a time.Insert the Pik Nozzle and give a lil twist to seat.Kids Totally dig it.</li>
    <li> I have one in my home and wanted this for the RV.  it works well and is convenient to use.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Saves me on dentist bills and leaves my teeth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Not very fancy but definitely does a awesome job for irrigating!</li>
    <li> I think this product is quality and well executed. You have adjust the water temp before engaging it because the low flow means that adjustments take forever to take effect. In addition, you can&#x27;t run it at full pressure, it would pressure wash your gums right out of your mouth, so it&#x27;s definitely something you can use to full effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t use it all however, it tickled my mouth so much I just couldn&#x27;t stand it at all. If you don&#x27;t have that problem then I recommend this. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  Not a lot of pressure and you waste an awful lot of water because the shower is running while you are flossing!</li>
    <li> The pressure is not what I thought it should be</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dental hygienist.  Said it was good for people who don&#x27;t floss regularly.  So much better than having a countertop appliance that takes up space.  It connects easily to the shower head.  Works great and my mouth feels really clean after every use.</li>
    <li> Wish it had more adjustment.</li>
    <li> works pretty good, but I wish it would have more force.  I believe the regular classic water pick sprays a heavier stream.  However, this one does good getting food practicals out of teeth.</li>
    <li> Product leaks not work well</li>
    <li> I used mine for about a month and it did a great job cleaning my teeth and around my gums. My only issue is that now the nozzles no longer stay in place when the water is turned on. Even on low setting they pop out enough that water sprays all over from the connection. Since it was fairly inexpensive I don&#x27;t feel like I lost much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEE REVISED COMMENT. I discovered the problem and it was my error.</li>
    <li> I am accustomed to a Phillips Sonic Water Pic that pulsates with a STRONG jet of H2O.  However I do not like that I must refill  the reservoir multiple times to properly irrigate my teeth, and it makes a huge mess on the mirror and around the sink, and it is a rechargable battery unit, so must remain plugged in to electricity to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dental Shower H2Oral irrigator Flosser isn&#x27;t as strong and does not pulse, but the convenience of having it in the shower somewhat balances the lack of power. I will continue using it and experiment to try increasing the H2O jet intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an easy installation and has 4 different colored Flossing wands and clear instructions about how to turn  the H2O stream on and off  and how to change the water jet intensity.  At $20.00, it is a good value compaired to the $75.00 I paid for my Sonic Flosser. There are no batteries, no moving parts, so should last.</li>
    <li> I use this item every night and it has helped tremendously well for my teeth and gums and I will continue to use it as long as I have teeth</li>
    <li> this was easy for this senior lady to install by myself and it works great in the shower as my dentist asked me to purchase one ! It comes with mounting holder too. a good buy and free shipping too  T Anne Knoxville tenn.</li>
    <li> great product. easy to install</li>
    <li> It works really well and there is no reservoir to get dirty. The shower water running through keeps it clean.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money it costs.</li>
    <li> These work great inside the shower! This is the second set that I have bought.You end up having no mess from water spray happening to your bathroom counter top and surrounding areas. You also do not have to put up with a boxy container sitting on your bathroom vanity. Works great.</li>
    <li> These are great. Always has helped keep the the dental bills very very much lower than prior to using the shower picks. If you have a family USE THEM&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Quality product. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.. Makes a huge difference with your gum hygiene. I recommend ~ but only if you do not have sensitive gums..</li>
    <li> This was a great gift for my daughter and her family. They love it.</li>
    <li> This product is just as advertised.  I knew what i wanted and I got it.  I am v3ery pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> worked 3 times then stop working.was unable to fine what was stopping the water from going threw. i wish it worked.</li>
    <li> This is the very best shower water floss her out there. I recommend this to everyone of my patients. I am a dental hygienist. It is been proven this year that high powered water can stimulate the bone to grow back around your teeth and gums. This one is great because you can still shower and it doesn&#x27;t cutThe water off while you&#x27;re using it so you&#x27;re not standing there freezing while you&#x27;re using it it actually let you use the shower water at the same time some of the other brands shut the shower water off while you&#x27;re using it and you&#x27;re standing there freezing. This is so inexpensive so convenient it takes five minutes to install. I cannot highlyrecommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Better than expected product</li>
    <li> Took forever to get the tip on. Seems cheap not as well made as my last one.</li>
    <li> STILL NO SURE HOW TO SET IT UP</li>
    <li> Went from sensitive gums to not so sensitive in two weeks.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to install!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my big girl panties on and removed my shower head, applied a new layer of that white tape stuff, and put the very snug oral irrigator head on. I applied more white tape stuff and reattached the shower head with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure is strong, much too strong on the highest pressure, but that&#x27;s the beauty of the valve. The holder sticks nicely on my bathroom tile and the irrigator is easy to use. Just a really fantastic piece of equipment!</li>
    <li> This irrigator tickles sooo bad that it&#x27;s unbearable.  Great concept.  Extremely easy installation.  Tried to withstand the tickling sensation, but its too much.  Even turning down the flow of water doesn&#x27;t take it away.</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive and good way to irrigate while showering.</li>
    <li> Just what I was wanting.  I do wish the adhesive for the backing was of better quality, since I&#x27;ve just had this for a few weeks and it&#x27;s coming off the tile already.</li>
    <li> Best flosser in the world</li>
    <li> Cheap.  All plastic.  No valve to divert water flow.  The previous one I bought was metal with a valve to divert the flow of water for a more powerful stream.  Couldn&#x27;t get shower head to seat correctly on plastic threads.  After repeated attempts the threads were beyond usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d look for something of higher quality if a first time buyer.  I like my older model better even though the valve failed after a couple years.  I think I&#x27;ll just replace the valve and re-install the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Don&#x27;t wait around to do this project like I did.  Waited to too long to be able to return it, so I&#x27;m out $23.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to everyone!</li>
    <li> So far there are no problems, it&#x27;s easy to install, and works well.  It is cheaply made, but that is reflected in the price, so you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to install and use. Absolutely no mess while using. easily adjustable to your sensitivity level.</li>
    <li> Seems to be okay except for a small dribble around the adapter fitting.  Used plumbing tape trying to stop the dribble.  Maybe the water pipe is the problem</li>
    <li> Finally could not again repair the plastic tubing on my ancient Teledyne Water Pik. Even though I loved my Water Pik for many, many years, I will not miss it taking up room on my tiny bathroom countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my old age I have gotten to where I do as much as possible (shave, brush teeth and now H2Oral irrigate my teeth) in the shower. A little research and review reading lead me to this appliance and so far I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure can become painful when I shut off the shower head completely so I can only partially shut off shower head to increase the pressure to level equal to the Water Pik. And while I do slightly miss the messaging feeling imparted by the pulsating of the Water Pik, I cannot tell any difference in the effectiveness of the cleaning.</li>
    <li> The set up was very easy and it only took a few minutes. The adjustable pressure is great and we don&#x27;t have to share a water pik attachement. It also doubles as a tile/grout cleaner :).  We no longer have any water pik mess on the vanity mirror. I have a dental check up coming up soon, and I trust that the Dental hower H2Oral Irrigator has done its job well. My son has braces and says that it is much easier now to keep his teeth clean, especially around the brackets.  We plan to purchase an additional set for my second shower.</li>
    <li> Hello to the world of the %%</li>
    <li> Produces a powerful steady flow without disturbing the flow of your shower head. The unit is easily screwed inline to you existing shower and provides a wonderful water-pik like experience at a low cost. It also comes with four heads so a family can use it and put the unused heads on the included wall mount. Great product that does exactly what it advertises, revitializes gums, and provides some floss-like action.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she loves it. It does what.it says and it helps her keep her gums healthy.</li>
    <li> This item came very quickly in the mail. it does what it says it supposed to do and you can adjust the flow of the water depending on how nay times you turn the actuator.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea.  Works well and so convenient.  I saw it at my daughters&#x27; and ordered mine right away</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but needs more pressure to rally be effective.</li>
    <li> I had chronic pain on the left side of my mouth for years.  Within a week of using this, the pain had almost disappeared.  I have been using it for several months now and the pain has totally disappeared.  We like it so much that we bought a second one to put in our RV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one fell of the wall within days and I had to use Contact 3M strips to rehang it.  On the second one, I did not use the hanger for over 24 hours after hanging it and it has stay put now for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning now because it is so easy and unlike the counter water devices, I&#x27;m already wet so no added mess.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next dentist appointment to see if this worked even better than flossing.  It certainly means I am much better about thoroughly cleaning between my teeth every day.</li>
    <li> I moved from my old house and left these and can&#x27;t do without them, they are the solution to daily flossing!</li>
