      <li>I&#x27;m most impressed by the fact that I no longer see a bunch of hair in the drain after I wash my hair, so those argan stem cells must really be doing their job!</li>
      <li>so if the results change I will update my review but so far, I am happy!</li>
      <li>I like that this shampoo is natural but it is not in my opinion the best out there.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and it makes my hair feel very clean!</li>
      <li>Most of the ingredients are organic, and your hair will look soft and healthy and smell great!</li>
      <li>The volumizing one is pretty good and has a nice mint smell, but volumizing shampoos always leave my hair a bit static-y.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love Acure Organics shampoos and conditioners..except this one (the Lemongrass version).  </li>
      <li>I love lemongrass.</li>
      <li>repurchased it so many times.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re into earthy smells you will love this.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I went for it and bought the pair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lemongrass scent is lovely and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>sure what else you could ask for</li>
      <li>Rather needed more conditioner after using this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It still smelled like I&#x27;d just stepped out of the shower, and my hair was perfect, soft, smooth, and not oily at all, despite having slept on it all night.</li>
      <li>On top of that, nobody with this hair type had reviewed this product.</li>
      <li>Run a brush through it, though, and my hair is healthy and shiny without looking greasy and unwashed.  </li>
      <li>I have been alternating using this shampoo and the baking soda wash/vinegar rinse now for over a year and my hair is healthy and shiny</li>
      <li>Smells great and lathers decently.</li>
      <li>Smells so nice and clean, and lathers well.</li>
      <li>this shampoo and the conditioner, I was able to comfortably go a day without showering.</li>
      <li>but it also dries out easily...</li>
      <li>The one for curly hair was okay, but isn&#x27;t great for daily use for me.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, nice clean smell, very nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll buy more of this.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and really wakes me up in the morning.</li>
      <li>it is gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great, it&#x27;s plant based and actually lathers quite well.</li>
      <li>This shampoo makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
      <li>found Acure Organics thanks to nomoredirtylooks.com, and they reviewed a different product, but I know the authors of this blog don&#x27;t bother with items that aren&#x27;t good for your body and good for the Earth- both of which are important to me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo is gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>I love all Acure products for their natural yet effective ingredients.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy at first because I have very fine, oily hair and some shampoos and conditioners</li>
      <li>right now it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>and I am super happy that it is free of potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>/&gt;VERY environmentally friendly, made of organic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;m at a Thai spa whenever I use this shampoo which leaves my hair clean and voluminous.</li>
      <li>but it still looks clean, so</li>
      <li>It makes your hair look and feel clean without drying it out or making it look greasy.</li>
      <li>What a wonderful shampoo - just the right amount of suds - kind to my long hair - terrific fresh herbal scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also glad the price was fairly reasonable as \\&quot;good\\&quot; toxic chemical shampoos can run $20 and up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more, and I&#x27;m excited to try more things from Acure after this.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo because my hair feels clean, light, soft, and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The lemongrass scent smells refreshing and clean, and the argan oil is moisturizing and rich in antioxidants which leaves your hair feeling soft, silky, and shiny!</li>
      <li>This shampoo is great- limited ingredients and very natural and keeps your hair feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>Super annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>will say that I bought this shampoo as a result of high ratings, but those ratings were mostly from people who were looking for organic shampoo.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo after my daughter told me how much she liked this brand.</li>
      <li>(it made my whole car smell like the stuff while it was in the package from Amazon!!).  </li>
      <li>Love the way it smells and leaves my hair really soft.</li>
      <li>No tangles and had a pleasantly fresh smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell and it makes my hair feel very clean!</li>
    <li> I like that this product is natural.  It has a great smell.  But it leaves my hair a bit dray and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo after my daughter told me how much she liked this brand. I ordered the Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo after reading a couple of reviews that said this was a better formula for thick but fine hair. I have tons of hair but it is fine and can easily be overwhelmed by products and go limp. Since my hair has turned gray and I have gotten older (61), my hair and skin have become drier and I needed a shampoo that would hydrate the dry the ends of my hair without weighing it down. I thought this would be the perfect shampoo, but it turned out not to be. It cleans well and though my hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily, it lays very flat on my head and the ends stick out real straight. It has zero body! I don&#x27;t know if it is the shampoo or the conditioner, but it gets oily near the scalp by the second day, but the top of my hair feels like straw. It seems to work ok on my husband&#x27;s hair and my daughter still loves her regular formula, just the Argan and Stem Cell, but I do not like this shampoo at all.</li>
    <li> Light but, substantial...works good and smells good.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and leaves my hair really soft.Will keep buying this product for as long as I can</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, nice clean smell, very nice.</li>
    <li> Smells good and cheap!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING.  It also works really well and I am super happy that it is free of potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Not all things organic are good, this one dried out my hair terribly, will not use it again, was hoping for more and got much less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky...right now it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Lathers almost as good as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; chemical-laden shampoo without all the nasty chemicals and lathering agents.  The lemongrass scent is lovely and not overpowering.  I have been alternating using this shampoo and the baking soda wash/vinegar rinse now for over a year and my hair is healthy and shiny (I have blond highlighted hair).  I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner with this shampoo - just blowdry BEFORE you brush/comb and the tangles just fall right out.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is gentle and effective. It resides with several other Acure products in my bathroom that I love, especially the face brightening scrub!</li>
    <li> I try not to be so metrosexual when buying my products, but I was trying to find a product that was natural and left my hair feeling soft and healthy.  This did it in one shower. My wife picked me up some Aveda shampoo a while back. It made my hair feel like straw and would just be tangles. My hair isn&#x27;t super long, but maybe 2 inches in some spots. It was just a pain getting through it.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff (used with the conditioner &amp;#34;Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Conditioner - 8 oz - Liquid&amp;#34; by Acure Organics) got out all the tangles and it lays flat. It still has it&#x27;s body to it, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it just feels smooth and not so dry.  Great scent as well.  It&#x27;s not perfumy; it just smells natural. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo, my chemically treated hair was soft and silky smooth. No tangles and had a pleasantly fresh smell. I&#x27;ll continue using this because I feel it will do no harm to my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It isn&#x27;t in the EWG cosmetic database, but all of the individual ingredients are, and it looks like a pretty safe product. It is the only natural shampoo I have tried yet that lathers well. It lathers just as well as your typical chemical ridden shampoos. I tried the one for curly hair (I don&#x27;t have curly hair, was just trying it out), and the one for volumizing. The one for curly hair was okay, but isn&#x27;t great for daily use for me. That one left my hair looking a little greasy. The volumizing one is pretty good and has a nice mint smell, but volumizing shampoos always leave my hair a bit static-y. I didn&#x27;t try the volumizing conditioner, maybe that would help. The lemongrass shampoo however works really well for my hair - thin, flat, straight, tends a little bit towards oily. I generally don&#x27;t use conditioner, but sometime do, and my hair always looks and feels clean after using this shampoo. It also smells really nice. I like the smell almost as much as the Aveda products that I used before I learned about the EWG, and I would say that it works just as well. It is a little pricey, but no worse than Aveda products were, and I would be more comfortable if the product itself were in the EWG, but I still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smell was way too strong!! Gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my hair is not as oily as it used to be but without an itchy had from being dried out. I also like that it lathers well and has what seem to be natural and healthy ingredients. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the smell does not last very long. It seems like after an hour of being out of the shower, my hair starts smelling like it is unwashed and dirty even though it doesn&#x27;t look it. Most shampoos have a scent that usually stays in my hair for an entire day, but not this shampoo. It smells unwashed but it still looks clean, so I don&#x27;t know what is going on.</li>
    <li> I have short, fine hair. Normally have to wash it daily. With this shampoo, I&#x27;ve been able to skip a day!</li>
    <li> I love all Acure products for their natural yet effective ingredients. I feel like I&#x27;m at a Thai spa whenever I use this shampoo which leaves my hair clean and voluminous.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I was frequently having issues with dry, flaky scalp and this shampoo has cured my problems! The lemongrass scent smells refreshing and clean, and the argan oil is moisturizing and rich in antioxidants which leaves your hair feeling soft, silky, and shiny! Love the fact that this shampoo gives a slight tingling sensation on your scalp when you apply it which feels energizing and rejuvenating during your shower!  Perfect shampoo for everyday use or for those like myself who have dry hair, colored hair, and/or use heat styling methods. Most of the ingredients are organic, and your hair will look soft and healthy and smell great!</li>
    <li> Cleans gently&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;Does not strip hair of moisture&lt;br /&gt;VERY environmentally friendly, made of organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what else you could ask for</li>
    <li> Acure does it again! This shampoo smells great, it&#x27;s plant based and actually lathers quite well. Try this shampoo you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and the fact that it does not strip my color.</li>
    <li> Really delicious smell, it hasa refreshing ginger and lemon scent. My hair is greasy on roots and dry ends, it Works very well for me balancing this condition, and keeping clean the scalp. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a natural shampoo that actually lathers and makes my hair feel clean instead of heavy and gross.  It also smells great, like a very citrusy green tea or something to me.  I have extremely fine/thin hair and it gets very oily at the roots so I have to wash my hair every day.  I also have some natural curl that tends to make parts of my hair unruly and frizzy and this shampoo works really well for that too.  I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to more natural bath products as much as possible and shampoo/conditioner has been the hardest by far.  For years I&#x27;ve had to use head and shoulders clinical strength because of seborrheic dermatitis and this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that I can use in place of that and not have severe problems with my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the conditioner and it is really great too.  I&#x27;ve been using herbal essences long-term relationship conditioner and I get very similar results without all of the chemicals.  I can only use the conditioner on the ends of my hair, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal because I&#x27;ve never been able to use any conditioner near my scalp.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I was with this product.  I didn&#x27;t even get to try it because the scent was so bad and overpowering.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and it lathers up great. But really, the smell is the best part.</li>
    <li> I like that this shampoo is natural but it is not in my opinion the best out there. I was a bit disappointed after using it as my hair didn&#x27;t seem too moisturized or silky. Rather needed more conditioner after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this! It smells amazing and I love how soft it makes my hair. I can leaven hair unwashed for up to 3 days, and usually my hair is disgusting and greasy after one.</li>
    <li> I love Acure Organics shampoos and conditioners..except this one (the Lemongrass version).  The scent is very distracting and I don&#x27;t like it at all.  It smells like my father-in-law&#x27;s Old Spice cologne.  Even after my hair dried, I could still smell it.  Other than that, I love the Acure Organics line!  I will just stick with the Argan Oil version.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful! Smells so nice and clean, and lathers well. I can&#x27;t say the same for the conditioner, which smells like a dollar store lemon cleaner, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It&#x27;s rated at a 2 at EWG (10 being highly hazardous and 0 being low hazard). I do a modified curly girl method because I have wavy hair and I only shampoo once every 2 weeks. This shampoo works nicely for that and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to price and the fact that it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this daily unless you have very oily hair and/or have a deep wallet.</li>
    <li> I bought this not knowing what to expect. My hair is colored and dry but I sweat at the gym and use dry shampoo and regular shampoo was not cleaning it. So I got this and am very happy. It is not over drying it and smells so good. I plan on buying it again. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> I have stick straight Asian hair that tends to be oily at the roots, dry at the ends, and fall out too much in the shower with bad hair products.  It is difficult to find a natural shampoo that can meet my hair needs.  I love this shampoo because my hair feels clean, light, soft, and shiny.  I still have a few strands that fall out during washes but much less than before.  And my husband and I like the fresh, earthy smell.  I wash my hair every other day and my only complaint is that my scalp feels oily by the end of the unwashed day.  If you have oily hair, you probably cannot miss more than one day of cleaning and I predict that this shampoo may be too heavy during the summer months.</li>
    <li> My hair is happy and this stuff smells AMAZING!  I find myself wanting to wash my hair more often just for how great it smells.  Also, my hair is shiny, much less frizzy but not weighed down.  It&#x27;s my new fav!</li>
    <li> Pros: Smells great and a small amount really does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They should offer more economical size as the product is too expensive</li>
    <li> repurchased it so many times. it is gentle and effective. my hair is fine, highlighted, dry ends. works very well.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! It smells amazing and really wakes me up in the morning. Item arrived on time- no problems</li>
    <li> The worse I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair turn very dry.  I got itchy and break out scalp.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful shampoo - just the right amount of suds - kind to my long hair - terrific fresh herbal scent. I also bought the companion conditioner - my hair actually feels silky now - the ingredients are excellent.. I use the Mandarin orange skin lotion by Acure and am very happy. Quality products with organic ingredients. Good prices too.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Especially the spa aroma of it. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo more than any other natural shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s been fantastic for my hair, which is naturally thin and oily.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to get away from the shampoos with fifty ingredients that strip my hair of everything, but other natural shampoos I&#x27;d tried just left my hair feeling and looking limp and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair air dry after showering, and if I don&#x27;t brush it once it dries, even this shampoo will leave it looking gross.  Run a brush through it, though, and my hair is healthy and shiny without looking greasy and unwashed.  It smells great, a little goes quite a long way (use too much and it can be a pain rinsing it well enough to reduce the oily feeling) and is a product I finally feel good about putting on my hair.  I wish it came in bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> This shampoo dried my hair out and made my scalp break out. It definitely removed oils and impurities, but at the expense of the health of my scalp and hair. My hair did not have a particularly pleasant scent from washing with this shampoo, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I bought this shampoo as a result of high ratings, but those ratings were mostly from people who were looking for organic shampoo. One of my close relatives is a cosmetologist, and she was unimpressed by any standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps people with different hair/ skin types will have better luck, but I will not be using this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair look fantastic. I&#x27;ve been real into organic and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products over the past few years, so I decided to try this out. I&#x27;ve done some research on shampoos and this seems to be one of the safest out there (with the exception of 1 or 2 ingredients).    I&#x27;ve used all of the major brands: Pantene, Dove, Herbal Essence, L&#x27;oreal, Equate, Head and Shoulders, as well as some specialty kinds such as Regenpure DR and Revita. None of them make my hair look and feel this good. Unlike most shampoos the scent in this shampoo actually lasts. I wash my hair at night and just wet it in the morning and I can still smell it.    It makes your hair look and feel clean without drying it out or making it look greasy. It smells great too. Give it a try, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair.  So thick it&#x27;s hard to get my fingers through and you can imagine trying to wash it.  It&#x27;s been hard finding a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo that isn&#x27;t like putting petroleum jelly on my hair since many of them do not lather....or rinse out well.  I washed my hair with the Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo this morning and was pretty impressed.  It lathered and washed out nicely.  The smell is fragrant (it made my whole car smell like the stuff while it was in the package from Amazon!!).  I really like it for this first time use.  I&#x27;m also glad the price was fairly reasonable as \\&quot;good\\&quot; toxic chemical shampoos can run $20 and up. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll buy more of this.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent when you first wash your hair but a day later I have dirty smelling hair and scalp buildup so I have to wash my ahir every other day.  Used this with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo after recently switching to organic and all natural products its hard to find ones that are effective. This one is washes great and love the Scent. Over all great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried the entire Shampoo/Conditioner line that Acure Organics sells and I have to say that they are ALL fantastic. Best Shampoo&#x27;s/Conditioners I have tried and the ingredients are just great. Very much recommend.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo. It lathers more than expected, it does not have harsh chemicals (EWG rating 2) and my hair feels as clean and appears as shiny as when I used products from the drugstore. I have noticed that this shampoo DOES NOT wash out hair products all that well. Sometimes I put hairspray in, especially when I leave my hair wavy, and my hair feels gross and sticky even after washing. I will still use this product, I may just have to deal with it!</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers decently. It leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy. I have straight hair of average thickness (not fine but not thick either) that doesn&#x27;t need conditioner and it seriously leaves my hair in what feels like its most natural state. Slightly moisturized but not flat or greasy, slightly volumized but not rough or dry. I&#x27;m most impressed by the fact that I no longer see a bunch of hair in the drain after I wash my hair, so those argan stem cells must really be doing their job!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it has brought back the health and vibrancy to my hair.</li>
    <li> Nice natural and gentle clarifying shampoo. If you&#x27;re into earthy smells you will love this.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after reading the positive reviews.  I recently swapped sulfate based shampoos with more natural products.  The lemongrass and argan stem cell ingredients drew me to the Acure line.  The scent is spot on lemongrass, and the shampoo lathers well.  Unfortunately immediately after using the Acure, my head began to itch uncontrollably during the night.  I experiment with other shampoos, and the scratchy scalp occurred only after using this product.  Because it&#x27;s currently winter, the dry LA desert air could be exacerbating the irritation.  I put the bottle away and I&#x27;ll try it again in July.  For now I moved on to Avalon Organics and I have no problems.  The Acure has far more natural ingredients so hopefully it will work out in warmer season.</li>
    <li> We have hard water and recently nothing has been working to make my hair feel clean &amp; help with my oily scalp. I&#x27;ve tried six shampoos and nothing worked. I try to use eco-friendly products and I needed something different right away. This smelled so invigorating. I love lemongrass. It worked well on my hair. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so if the results change I will update my review but so far, I am happy!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great- limited ingredients and very natural and keeps your hair feeling very clean. I&#x27;ll keep ordering this for the foreseeable future!</li>
    <li> I switched to using organic products for all my body care needs about a year ago, and since then, I&#x27;d been using Intelligent Nutrients Harmonic Shampoo and Conditioner. Both are great products, but I like to switch things up after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I found Acure Organics thanks to nomoredirtylooks.com, and they reviewed a different product, but I know the authors of this blog don&#x27;t bother with items that aren&#x27;t good for your body and good for the Earth- both of which are important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy at first because I have very fine, oily hair and some shampoos and conditioners make it A LOT worse. On top of that, nobody with this hair type had reviewed this product. I bit the bullet and bought it. I used both the shampoo and conditioner yesterday at around 3 PM, and woke up this morning at around 10 AM with perfect hair. It still smelled like I&#x27;d just stepped out of the shower, and my hair was perfect, soft, smooth, and not oily at all, despite having slept on it all night. I felt like I&#x27;d just walked out of a salon!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I went for it and bought the pair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more, and I&#x27;m excited to try more things from Acure after this.</li>
    <li> Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo - 12 oz - Liquid is very good. Good price and good size. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the matching conditioner! I had to find something organic for a camping trip. At first, I tried the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap &amp; Shikakai hair rinse, which my hair absolutely hated. On my second try, I found this! It&#x27;s lightweight, but also keeps my hair moisturized enough, which is no easy task - I have fine (thin strands), but thick (a LOT of them) hair, so it tends to get weighted down and fall flat...but it also dries out easily...but it also looks greasy within a day of not washing. Super annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this shampoo and the conditioner, I was able to comfortably go a day without showering. Then when we went camping, we got burglarized of about 75% of our stuff, including this, so I got to test how well the effects lasted for 4 days. By the last day, I did feel gross, but not nearly as bad as it would have been with my regular s &amp; c!</li>
