      <li>It makes the stones soft and easy to pass.  </li>
      <li>The health of your alimentary tract is critical as that is where all nutrients and toxins are exchanged, so you need to keep that system in tip top shape.  </li>
      <li>I just did a liver flush last night and got out many stones.  </li>
      <li>I was especially interested in the efficacy of this cleanse as I am a practiciing RN who has recovered hundreds of patients who have undergone laproscopic or open cholecystectomy...</li>
      <li>is the link for interested readers can find the information from quackwatch dot com.</li>
      <li>This is the third time I have used this product over as many years in a 3 to 4 day liver cleanse.  </li>
      <li>the stones are bright green, all shapes and sizes and float.  </li>
      <li>I stopped the liver/gall bladder cleanse after the first day because this product irritated my disgestive system</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s exactly as described...</li>
      <li>, I wont take this unless last resort (needed)&lt;br /&gt;I threw away my money and time because I can do better cures</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Super phos 30.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SUPER PHOS 30.</li>
      <li>Before trying again I used Super Phos 30 with apple juice and this time around I passed several dozen stones which was very exciting.</li>
      <li>Help them transition into taking an active role in learning and educating their patients in simple natural proven and effective healthy healing.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product and it absolutely worked.</li>
      <li>product when diluted in (the pulpy type of) apple juice really begins the recovery process.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Surgery pays the hospitals and doctors very well.  </li>
      <li>Yes, manic acid can dissolve stones but it is very lengthy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so relieved and would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>have gone really well.</li>
      <li>I just recently did my first cleanse adding Super Phos 30 to the routine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many other products to soften and break up stones but never got results like this.</li>
      <li>Also, you can replace the Classic Coke with Grapefruit juice if you are adverse to drinking soda...</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t mess with you enamel  :)</li>
      <li>High cholesterol keeps the pharmaceutical companies in business....</li>
      <li>Seems a little more concentrated than another brand I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>home made veggie soups, beetroot juice,alfalfa,artichoke tapenade etc. are supporting companions for super phos.&lt;br /&gt;I could not manage to swallow a whole quart of apple juice a day but managed maybe half a day.&lt;br /&gt;No cheese, butter or junk</li>
      <li>If I feel courageous in a few months, I will try another dose---and if my observations change I will update with the latest results.</li>
      <li>This is my 3rd day drinking SUPER PHOS 30 mixed in organic apple juice</li>
      <li>I did have results from drinking only 3 ounces of fresh-squeezed lemon juice mixed with 3 ounces of cold-pressed olive oil [and drank quickly out of a straw to minimize the taste].</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon &#x3D; 1 apple a day so very good supplement, doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and the only thing that really feels like it &amp;#34;cuts thru.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Oh and chinese bitters really help to.</li>
      <li>could any medication or liquids come in direct contact with Gall bladder, leave alone stones.</li>
      <li>I was told by doctors that I would need to get my gallblader   removed, but I wanted to try a natural cleanse.  </li>
      <li>It is used with other common products in the cleanse and has never failed to aid in the passing of many liver clogging bile stones.  </li>
      <li>However, the one time I tried it was an interesting (but not necessarily pleasant) experience.</li>
      <li>This product left me so nauseous that I nearly passed out.</li>
      <li>all necessitating the unwanted experience and sacrifice caused by pain, time in the hospital, huge expense and potential for serious complication.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My colonic therapist told me about this effective gallbladder/liver cleanse.  It worked perfectly as she said it would and so easy to complete.  I was especially interested in the efficacy of this cleanse as I am a practiciing RN who has recovered hundreds of patients who have undergone laproscopic or open cholecystectomy...all necessitating the unwanted experience and sacrifice caused by pain, time in the hospital, huge expense and potential for serious complication.  No surgery is without the risk of anesthesia and surgical complication which could potentially be fatal.  So why doesn&#x27;t the medical community promote this simple cheap effective way to keep our gallbladder&#x27;s free of stones which leads to healthy cholesterol levels and general wellbeing????  It&#x27;s all about greed.  Surgery pays the hospitals and doctors very well.  High cholesterol keeps the pharmaceutical companies in business....Statins (Lipitor, Crestor etc.) are probably the #2 money makers in this country and the most deleterious to your health.  So, buy some Superphos 30 liver flush today (the big bottle) because you should do this flush quarterly.  And don&#x27;t for a minute think you don&#x27;t have gallstones.  Today, with the American diet being what it is...nutrient devoid and genetically engineered....everyone has gallstones and is at serious risk of eventual complicating disease.  The health of your alimentary tract is critical as that is where all nutrients and toxins are exchanged, so you need to keep that system in tip top shape.  So learn and act on taking control and maintaining your health.  You are your own best care giver. Very few American doctors today understand or are willing to learn what the body needs to take care of itself. So please pay it forward and tell someone about this cleanse today, including your Doctor.  Help them transition into taking an active role in learning and educating their patients in simple natural proven and effective healthy healing.  Look forward to reading your comments after you do this simple gallbladder/liver cleanse.  Ps...the stones are bright green, all shapes and sizes and float.  I excreted about 20 stones...and look forward to my next cleanse.  There are other formula&#x27;s, however, I found this one to be so simple, I didn&#x27;t look further.  Also, you can replace the Classic Coke with Grapefruit juice if you are adverse to drinking soda...if not, this is a good time to consider transitioning out of that toxic habit.

    <li> I am so thankful for finding this product. Six months ago I discovered that my chest pain was actually a result of my gallbladder.(And I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s!)People recommend surgery as though the gallbladder is a useless organ.On the third day of using this product, as well as a laxative, I finally saw the pain and flushed it. I can finally work without feeling like I&#x27;m going to have a heart-attack. I am so relieved and would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Do not believe the negative review posted here. This product is extremely effective when used as directed. I had followed the instructions in The Liver and Gallbladder Miracle Cleanse: An All-Natural, At-Home Flush to Purify and Rejuvenate Your Body but had failed to pass any stones. Before trying again I used Super Phos 30 with apple juice and this time around I passed several dozen stones which was very exciting. If you are severely blocked like I was then you will probably need  Super Phos 30 also to help release stones. This product will improve your health if used as directed.</li>
    <li> Been taking good results, it is worth.</li>
    <li> I was told by doctors that I would need to get my gallblader   removed, but I wanted to try a natural cleanse.  I tried this product and it absolutely worked. It&#x27;s   Very bitter but not so bad when you dilute it with   apple juice.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Almost killed me, product was horrid and stained my teeth, caused nausea , vomiting and a hospital stay. Gallstone sufferers beware!!! Amazon kindly refunded my charges (Amazon is AWESOME).\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I would say buy this stuff if you do liver flushes if not stay away.  I just did a liver flush last night and got out many stones.  This stuff is great for doing the coke flushes.  It makes the stones soft and easy to pass.  Oh and make sure you do a parasites and colon cleanse before doing the liver flush.  Good Luck and best of health.  Oh and chinese bitters really help to.</li>
    <li> A great supplement to help flush the gall bladder and liver during a cleanse.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done approximately a dozen liver cleanses, following \\&quot;Hulda Clark Protocol\\&quot; over the last two years.  I just recently did my first cleanse adding Super Phos 30 to the routine.  I removed more stones using the Super Phos 30, than in my five previous best cleanses combined.  I am not exaggerating, and I did nothing else different in my routine.  I won&#x27;t do another liver cleanse without Super Phos 30.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have used this product over as many years in a 3 to 4 day liver cleanse.  It is used with other common products in the cleanse and has never failed to aid in the passing of many liver clogging bile stones.  Everyone needs a liver cleanse.</li>
    <li> did not help me I was misable , and do not ever want to do that again, thanks and have a great day</li>
    <li> Seems a little more concentrated than another brand I&#x27;ve used before. Worked great. Would recommend to others for liver gallbladder cleanse</li>
    <li> Works wonders at cleaning up my gall bladder and liver, can feel the difference, i mix is with fresh apple cider from the grocery store</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described. Have not had a chance to try the product yet but confident that will be of great benefit based on other reviews.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for liver and gallbladder flushes. I&#x27;ve used many other products to soften and break up stones but never got results like this. I highly recommend Super phos 30.</li>
    <li> I bought this for cleanse&lt;br /&gt;it not a good idea, this has might contain phosphoric acid&lt;br /&gt;like sodas it destroy the enamel on your teeth by a chemical reaction&lt;br /&gt;same for your body, it dissolves minerals and calcium&lt;br /&gt;teeth are bone.&lt;br /&gt;maybe it will dissolve stones in your gallbladder&lt;br /&gt;if you need to take this product do it only for 3 day cure with straw&lt;br /&gt;I would first balance my saliva ph to 7.5 with baking soda and good diet&lt;br /&gt;I recommend cleanses such as apple cider vinegar, distilled water and&lt;br /&gt;Livatrex Liver and Gallbladder Cleanse Detox!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YJM4JM/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s06_i02?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;instead, I wont take this unless last resort (needed)&lt;br /&gt;I threw away my money and time because I can do better cures&lt;br /&gt;there are to many positive results posted for this item&lt;br /&gt;this seeps into the teeth structure and causes havoc&lt;br /&gt;do not thy it semi diluted, only fully diluted as the instructions say, if you must&lt;br /&gt;I would like my money back because of the wrong appearance of this product as posted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im editing my review. This should not be sold on amazon. This very acidic and very strong. Did I mention wrong. Your body is not a rental car. Don&#x27;t buy this. There is no correct warning posted. My entire leg and teeth hurt a lot for 2 weeks by taking a sip It wont wash away. Minus -8.</li>
    <li> Followed directions for 4 days instead of recommended 3. It had no effect. I had an ultrasound recently that revealed gallstones so I know I have them. Will maybe try it again in a month or two.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised as a cleanse.  Worked great with apple cider and cleansed my liver and gall bladder.&lt;br /&gt;Just great!</li>
    <li> I stopped the liver/gall bladder cleanse after the first day because this product irritated my disgestive system and I suspect it changed my electrolyte balance in an adverse way. It is affected the enamel on my teeth even though I did my best to avoid the product touching my teeth. I would not recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon &#x3D; 1 apple a day so very good supplement, doesn&#x27;t taste bad, and the only thing that really feels like it &amp;#34;cuts thru.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> this product helps my liver/gallbladder cleanses to be more effective.  get more stones and chaff out.  Now I won&#x27;t do one without this stuff.</li>
    <li> It really works. I didn&#x27;t even follow a liver cleanse, other than using this product. I&#x27;m on only day 1 and I&#x27;ve flushed out over 30 some gallbladder stones. I&#x27;ve been having excruciating pain with my gallbladder and people keep telling me I need it removed for a reason. I however believe our organs serve a purpose and God designed them to heal. I&#x27;m amazed at how I&#x27;m already feeling better. It hasn&#x27;t been super painful either. I highly suggest this product to someone wanting to feel better again. I&#x27;ve been battling with digestive problems for awhile now, since I&#x27;ve had my son. I&#x27;m all about early healthy and living a clean life.</li>
    <li> I learned about SUPER PHOS 30 in the \\&quot;21 Pounds in 21 Days\\&quot; The Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Diet Detox book. This is my 3rd day drinking SUPER PHOS 30 mixed in organic apple juice and I didn&#x27;t think it was really working and didn&#x27;t expect to actually see green pea-shaped stones but now I&#x27;m a believer, it&#x27;s exactly as described...green, various shapes, with soft to moderately firm texture. I did have results from drinking only 3 ounces of fresh-squeezed lemon juice mixed with 3 ounces of cold-pressed olive oil [and drank quickly out of a straw to minimize the taste]. I have to share that at the time of my doctor&#x27;s exam, I showed my detox book and asked about the Gallbladder/Liver flush and to my surprise, was told in disgust to trash the book. Sadly, these medical doctors are only taught to cut limbs and prescribe medication which is a money making business. Kudos to Liba RN for taking the time to share, explain and write the review in great detail... it&#x27;s all about the $MONEY$. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SUPER PHOS 30.</li>
    <li> I have used this prduct several times for a liver flush. It definitely gets the stones out of the liver. However, no instructions came with it. I had to use instructions from a previous purchase.</li>
    <li> I used this during a 3-4 month detox. After a few uses, it got rid of a lump I had on my neck ever since I was small.  Follow instructions and DRINK WITH A STRAW so it doesn&#x27;t mess with you enamel  :)</li>
    <li> I felt great after using the product.  Word of caution:  take it at home and only if you don&#x27;t have plans of going out or on a date.</li>
    <li> works well to soften those lover/gallbladder stones for removal. Recommend if doing a liver flush for good effect. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was having some problems with my gallbladder due to taking calcium blockers for blood pressure. Did the Super Phos Thirty Gallbladder and Liver Flush and haven&#x27;t had any problems since and that was over 6 mo ago.</li>
    <li> A hereditary gallbladder problem is no fun. Coasting along just fine, skipping meals, eating in a hurry, fast food....then ugh, the awful pain in the side, the bloated feeling, the sense of nausea, and &#x27;omg....it&#x27;s baaaack!&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;This product when diluted in (the pulpy type of) apple juice really begins the recovery process.&lt;br /&gt;Also home made veggie soups, beetroot juice,alfalfa,artichoke tapenade etc. are supporting companions for super phos.&lt;br /&gt;I could not manage to swallow a whole quart of apple juice a day but managed maybe half a day.&lt;br /&gt;No cheese, butter or junk food.&lt;br /&gt;The little plastic medicine cup was broken in shipping, but i had another one around.</li>
    <li> money wasted, i don&#x27;t recomend to buy it,  useless product. better consult your medician for recomendation to use better products for improve your health.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT TO USE FOR CLEANSING THE LIVER AND GALLBLADDER. THE CLEANSING HELP WITH MY ECZEMA. THE ITCHING GOES AWAY. TRUE TESTIMONY.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this worked or not since I did not see any evidence one way or the other. I tried it only once so maybe I need to try it some more times. However, the one time I tried it was an interesting (but not necessarily pleasant) experience. Per the instructions, I mixed a dosage with Apple juice, and drank the required quantity as requested. I felt  discomfort (along with an increasing feeling of being sore) during the recommended number of days I took it. Once I stopped taking it, I just felt sore (no discomfort). Not sure if this soreness is a sign of cleansing. If I feel courageous in a few months, I will try another dose---and if my observations change I will update with the latest results.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to have surgery to get rid of gall stones, took the super phos, it cleaned my bladder and destryed kidney stones to boot. Nothing short of a miraculous product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and it does perform as described when taken as directed.  The package arrived fast and the packing was secure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband as he has gall stones. He followed the directions as given in the bottle. It did not help.&lt;br /&gt;He followed the directions to the tee and still his Ultrasound shows presence of gall stones. Moreover, he had severe vomiting after taking the medications for three days. He lost appetite and it took more than a week for him to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did some research and we found there is no way could any medication or liquids come in direct contact with Gall bladder, leave alone stones. Yes, manic acid can dissolve stones but it is very lengthy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link for interested readers can find the information from quackwatch dot com. Search for gall stone flush. They are non-profit organization and they are not associated with pharmaceutical company or any health organization.</li>
    <li> This product gives me a bad stomach ache every time I take it, and the Co. will not return it! I am not satisfied with that decision.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. I have prefromed two gallbladder flushes using this product and both have gone really well. I am happy with the results and will continue to use it. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This product left me so nauseous that I nearly passed out. Lost control of my arms and legs and had to call 911 (which took a while becausey mind wouldnt let me press the right numbers) i honestly thought i was having a stroke. Not blaming all of that on the product, docs didnt know if that was the cause of my symptoms. I&#x27;m not writing this review to scare people away, it seems to have worked for some people. Just wanted to share my story as a warning about ingesting things you buy online. My experience didn&#x27;t go so well</li>
