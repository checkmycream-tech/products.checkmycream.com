<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it smells, and I can&#x27;t seem to find the right dosage for my hair. I always end up with it being too greasy or still frizzy. Doesn&#x27;t matter, the smell is like, I don&#x27;t know, campfire or something. Not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price, love the free lip moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Seems a little bit more watery than previous argan oil I had from different place and less moisturizing.</li>
    <li> my skin is absolutely glowing.  Great value for a great product.  Use it every night as my facial moisturizer.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use them as an eye oil and make lotion bars.It&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is the real deal.  Nice big bottle at a price you can actually afford.  I leave it on my bedside dresser and slather it on my face, hands, feet, arms everywhere!  Nice natural scent no perfumes, 100% organic, cold pressed made with the good stuff.  I now have my acne prone son using it on his face with great results, as a lot of the acne skin care products can be very drying, and because it&#x27;s all natural it doesn&#x27;t cause further break outs.  Will defiantly buy this product again and again and again!</li>
    <li> My hair has been really dry lately and I was looking for some treatment. I feel my hair has improved already. You can also use this product for your skin. The only reason I don&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because of the smell of the oil, it smells like mild olive oil which I think is normal because it is pure oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product by Beauty by Earth. I  really recommend it. Argan oil is suitable for all skin types.!!! Just try it.!!&lt;br /&gt;You will love it.!!!</li>
    <li> I live in the southwest and I have found argan oil works great to moisturize my skin.  I had ordered a different brand previously, but it was out of stock. Although this was a couple of dollars more, I was pleasantly suprised to find a larger size bottle as well as lip balm included.  I would have given this 5 stars, but it seems to be a slightly heavier oil than the brand I was previously using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used argan oil for almost 2 years now. I use it solely for my skin, i.e. around my eyes, on my forehead and on my hands specifically for fine lines. I decided to give this brand a try because I wanted a larger bottle and the price was right. 4 ounces will last you a long time!!!! So don&#x27;t be discouraged if for some reason, you think this is expensive. A little goes a long way. For this oil specifically, it absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I did notice this oil has a specific scent to it. Hard to describe but almost plant like smelling. I have not encountered this with other argan oils but it does not detract me from using it. The scent actually dissipates quickly and you literally cannot smell it after a short time. I also like the lip balm that came with it. Natural peppermint smell. This is overall a great deal.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I use every day on my hair. It leaves it soft and manageable. Simply can&#x27;t beat the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Beauty by Earth Argan Oil.  It is not one of the very expensive argan oils, but it isn&#x27;t too thin like the cheap ones.  I have purchased the very cheap argan oils only to discover that they are so thin that they run out of the dropper before I squeeze the bulb.  This one is very close in quality to the very expensive oils.  It has no scent and lasts well.  I AM STICKING WITH THIS BRAND!</li>
    <li> I like this better on hair than on my dry skin.  The jojoba oil ordered at same time is getting more use.  I love the free lip stuff!</li>
    <li> As others have written this is not greasy at all, after a few seconds. I have not noticed better skin, but I do like the feel of the product on my skin. It does have a bit of a funky smell, but it goes away quickly. I hope to see some results after more time has passed. I have Rosacea and flaky skin and hope this can help me a bit. Great customer service and packaging.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I came across the youtube videos for Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Argan Oil. I have sensitive acne prone skin and finding products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, or contain tons of mystery chemicals is hard to do. This stuff is a miracle in a bottle! My hair is much softer, my face is softer and I have no breakouts or clogged pores. I have been using this on my stomach at 7 months pregnant to help with stretch marks. It absorbs FAST and I love the applicator pump on the bottle. I use it daily on my nails and they are stronger haven&#x27;t broken or peeled since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Argan Oil, I have bought their Konjac sponge and can&#x27;t wait to try their lip balm!</li>
    <li> Love this, since using it my hair is so much soft. This bottle will last a long time as a little goes a long ways. The chap-stick that came with is my favorite chap-stick i have tried yet. Very much recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;VE USED ORGANIC ARGAN OIL MADE BY MODEL AND ENTREPRENEUR JOSIE MARAN AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HERS BUT AT $109/4 OUNCES THE PRICE WAD JUST TOO MUCH FOR FOR MY BUDGET  SO I COME TO AMAZON KNOWING  I COULD EXPECT A BETTER DEAL AND SO I PURCHASED THE BEAUTY BY EARTH BRAND BUT THE PRODUCT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME IMPURITIES OR ITS NOT ORGANIC BECAUSE AS I STARTED TO USE IT, IT BEGAN TO MAKE ME ITCH SO AT FIRST I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT I MIGHT HAVE EATEN BUT BY THE THIRD TIME USING THIS PRODUCT I WAS CONVINCED IT WAS THIS BRAND OF ARGAN OIL.IT ALSO MADE MY ECZEMA WORST THOUGH THIS COMPANY CLAIMS THIS PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED FOR THE RELIEF OF ECZEMA.AS MANY OF YOU KNOW SO VERY WELL, YOU CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ THESE DAYS!! I HOPE I CAN FIND A BETTER BRAND SOON .😞</li>
    <li> This works great on my oily skin!</li>
    <li> Awesome product of high quality. I will definitely purchase from Beauty by Earth again</li>
    <li> Best argan oil I have ever bought! Since getting it, I&#x27;ve used it basically every day and it always leaves my hair and skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> this is very good oil</li>
    <li> Beauty by Earth is a fabulous company that sells fabulous, quality products.  You have made the right choice if you purchase products for you skin, and overall well being from Beauty by Earth.  The recipe book that comes with these products has the most amazing recipes and you will see the benefits when using these home made products immediately.  Do yourself a favor and purchase Beauty by Earth Argan Oil.  You will be very thankful :)</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail today and love it! I was worried how it would smell since it is unrefined and organic. I am pleased to say there is little or no smell.  Maybe a very faint nutty odor but I wouldn&#x27;t have even noticed if I wasn&#x27;t tying to perceive a smell.  I love the feel and how it absorbs.  Also the pump dispenser works great unlike some I have tried in the past.  Speaking of...Yes I have purchased the Josie M. Argan oil before but stopped buying it because it is ridiculously overpriced and I felt is was probably refined.  I bought this after being so impressed with the natural lip balm made by this same company.  It is a 4 pack variety of pear, green tea, acai with goji, and pomegranate.  I ended up buying 3 more of these packs (along with this argan oil) in case it disappears off amazon plus my family members keeps taking them lol (they love them also)  Anyway I love these products even though I didn&#x27;t get the 72 hour sale price I see online today for cyber Monday.  Maybe I will buy another one ;)</li>
    <li> This has to be a miracle oil.  I have good skin to begin with, but I am starting to age and show some sun damage.  I also have combination skin, which means it&#x27;s hard to find a product that moisturizes your dry spots without making the rest of my face look like an oil slick.  This Argan Oil makes my entire face soft without making it greasy.  My age spots are starting to fade and the few lines I have are softening.  It also conditions my hair without making it greasy.  The bottle is very generous for the price.  I will purchase this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Greet nationurial  beauty  , quick result,  quick shipping .</li>
    <li> I use it on myself and my daughter after swimming and it makes our hair and skin moisturized without any greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> The best Argan Oil I&#x27;ve used. Absorbs quickly leaving your face as soft as a babies and you&#x27;ll see a difference in your wrinkles quickly. I&#x27;m 63 and my mother is 90, we both love it.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this Argan Oil.  I have used josie maron oil for years, but it is expensive. Thought I would give this a try and feel it is too good to be true.  It is a great value and it works as good or better than Josie Maron.  The lip balm was a bonus and I didn&#x27;t think much of it until I tried it...wonderful!  Great discovery, especially in this dry time of year it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Great product, I like it because  it has a pump, I use it as a makeup remover and moisturizer. All I can say save you money this is the answer  to all skin issue, blackheads, breakouts and ets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil for years on my skin and hair, and this oil feels light and smells wonderful.  The product came in an attractive box, perfect for gift giving, the bottle/label is also very appealing to the eye.  I received my Argan Oil by Beauty by Earth in just a couple of days after I bought it online, even close to Christmas.  I would recommend buying from Beauty by Earth to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Shipping was fast. I use this as a carrier oil with some of my essential oil blends. Soaks in quick and leaves my skin soft!</li>
    <li> This is my very 1st essential oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now. I&#x27;m so impressed! The changes were quick. My face is smoother &amp; glowing. I have a very oily skin but when I put make up on, I don&#x27;t necessarily need to retouch. I don&#x27;t use my regular moisturizer &amp; night cream anymore. I also keep using it on my hair &amp; wow! It makes my hair shiny &amp; healthy. I&#x27;m actually due for another permanent straight but looks like I might not need it yet. This argan oil is totally worth it especially of the fall/winter weather, for all seasons! I love that they have eBook. I&#x27;ll be working in their recipes in the future. It would be really great to use natural &amp; organic products. The free lip balm was a great plus. I was lucky I was able to purchase it during their 2 of 72hr Sale. I gave the other one to my mom &amp; brother for them to share &amp; experience the magic it brings. But I wish it have a built-in dropper though but overall I will stick with Beauty by Earth Argan Oil &amp; I&#x27;m looking forward to try their other products. I hope they will launch more organic oils in the future. The customer service is really great too. They quickly respond to my email. They&#x27;re very friendly. Best of luck Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice oil, very smooth and nongreasy on the skin and no strong fragrance. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it in my hair and on my skin</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Everything I have ordered through this company has been excellent at a great value. Highly recommend! Makes my curly (chemo curly) hair soft and frizz free without making it greasy. Also feels wonderful on my face. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love that it&#x27;s all natural and a good price.</li>
    <li> Great product-will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> I initially sought out Argan oil for hair &amp; scalp care but, had no idea it was so versatile!  As it turns out, it&#x27;s now my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; for face care. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is great. I have paid much more for argan oil and it was not any better than this.  Good price.  I use on face and body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It makes my frizzy, dry hair come back to life. The only reason I gave four stars was because it does NOT come with a free audiobook. I went to the website the package directed me to in order to receive my audiobook, entered my email, and nothing. I even called the company&#x27;s customer service line to ask them where the audiobook was and no one picked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Five stars for the product&lt;br /&gt;  One star for false advertising</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is perfect for my hair and skin.  Highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle makes it worth purchasing again.  Highly recommend it over the eye dropper versus that other manufactures sell.</li>
    <li> My dry skin loves this Argan Oil!  I use a few pumps at night along with my usual moisturizer.  My skin absorbs it beautifully, and for the first time ever my skin is still nourished in the morning.  I love all the Beauty by Earth products.  The company has found the key to providing great products which are great for our skin and the environment, and deliver great results.  And, the peppermint balm is a fabulous add-on...yum!</li>
    <li> Love! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. My hair was absolutely fried from coloring, styling and a few weeks at the beach. I had the driest, frizziest hair with tons of breakage and didn&#x27;t think that anything would work. I applied just a pump and worked it through my wet hair and what a difference! Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day I reapplied throughout the week and it kept my hair healthy feeling and looking. As some other reviews stated, it has the same effect on skin and cuticles. I like the fact that it&#x27;s a completely natural product as well. Every woman needs this in her daily beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> Use a little on your face and it&#x27;ll moisturize perfectly. Use upward strokes while applying. Beauty By Earth...best Argan oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. It keeps my face moisturized without feeling greasy or any irritation. By the way, I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> Too oily!!&lt;br /&gt;I was not very fond of this Argan oil as it made my hair feel and look incredibly oily. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return it but was a few days outside the 30 day return policy :-(</li>
    <li> Seems alright.  Did&#x27;nt seem to sink into my skin the way it should, and left an oily film.  The oil was clear and runny, and smell more of soured coffee than it did of &amp;#34;nuttiness&amp;#34;  The smell dissapated quickly enough that it didn&#x27;t give me a headache, but when I first pump it into my hands it seems kind of strong.  Will probably try another brand next time.&lt;br /&gt;The chapstick seems off to me.  I received an email from the company stating that they were 4 person operations (2 friend&#x27;s and their spouses) but the tibe itself is packaged like mass-manufactured goods ( has the barcode-type expiration printed like laser printed on the bottom) and normally this wouldn&#x27;t bother me but balm is REALLY pepperminty. I mean, burn-your-lips and make your mouth feel like you ate a mint pepperminty.  Again, wouldn&#x27;t be as worrisome if peppermint oil was listed as an ingredient.  Which it isn&#x27;t.  Beeswax, sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, lanolin, vitamin e and aloe extracts, shea butter and cocoa seed butter, and then &amp;#34;FLAVOR&amp;#34;.  But they don&#x27;t go into specifics as to what this &amp;#34;Flavor&amp;#34; is.  It may be synthetic peppermint  or something of the likes, or worse.  Just odd to me that its supposed to be so natural, but then they throw a vague, unexplained &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; in the ingredients list.  And like I said it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but its sooo strong.</li>
    <li> This 100% Argan oil is fantastic! Highly recommend it as it has done wonders to my hair, which tends to be a bit frizzy and dry. It is a game changer!</li>
    <li> I use Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil , &amp; this oil is identical . Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it daily for my face and my hair.</li>
    <li> The real thing. My skin and hair is in much  better condition because of this argan oil. Definitely reccommend.</li>
    <li> Thought it would not be really really oily it is!! Quite oily feel.</li>
    <li> I am a believer in this Argan Oil! It has definitely made a difference in my face. I use this only at night because it would be too oily to use during the day. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this product! i always used face moisturizer on my face and my face would get oily throughout the day. i was a bit nervous to try Argan oil on my face instead of moisturizer because i thought it would make me break out and make my face oilier but it did the exact opposite. my face is nice and smooth and much less oilier and it didn&#x27;t cause any skin reaction at all. i started using it as a moisturizer for all over and I&#x27;m in love! it also came with a complimentary peppermint lip balm which works amazing and tastes great! i will definitely be ordering from Beauty by Earth again! :-)</li>
    <li> I love the oil and the the lip gloss.  It keeps my skin and lips soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this oil. I use it daily. This is my second bottle because my sister used it and she loved it too. I gave her the bottle so am back for another. With so many companies out in the marketplace selling oils I did a ton of research and chose InstaNatural and am very pleased. With a money back guarantee you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Was a gift and they loved it...</li>
    <li> This product was received exclusively for reviewing purposes. The evaluation of the product had been conducted independently with no external influences from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is presented in a well labelled thin cardboard box with basic instructions on the side along with an approved link to the company&#x27;s website along with a more detailed eBook link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a 120ml amber glass bottle with a pump action nozzle delivering an adequate amount of liquid with each squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being organic and cold pressed I had high expectations from this Argan Oil and I certainly wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I found that adding the product to my hair improved its appearance somewhat but it was its effects on my face and hands that was the most impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product made my skin look shinier, younger and healthier upon contact and although I don&#x27;t have any skin problems as such I would be confident in this products ability to have a positive affect on target areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: 4.5/5</li>
    <li> we use argon often but this is first time from this azon company. we love the oil and the super fast delivery</li>
    <li> The oil rubs right in with no residuals and I feel like my skin just sucks it up. Oh the Chapstick by this brand is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I love this! The same day I got it I used it on my face and the next day I noticed my skin looked smoother and less worn. I was really impressed by that as I use all kinds of natural things and this was really impressively fast at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally my son had scratched his leg pretty badly that day and I didn&#x27;t want it to scar or anything and I used this oil on his leg. It was also red. The next day with cleaning it and using the Argan oil, it was notably better and wasn&#x27;t red anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this product and have used it many times so far. This was my first time using Argan oil and am very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived so fast and was packaged in an attractive box that was fun to open :)</li>
    <li> I use this oil by itself and mixed with other oils, it goes on great without making my skin oily. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have recently started using this for my hair and face.  I immediately felt my face feel better and moisturized, but not in an oily way.  My hair looks less frizzy and is easier to control.  I love that it is a completely natural and organic way to care for my body.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> OMG !!!&lt;br /&gt; Im  a guy with problem skin. I absolutely love this, i used many brands before but this was a game changer. I been using it for about a month and half. MY skin looks much more bright and flawless i still get pimples , like now i would say i have 4 zit on my face. This stuff is wow!! It totally made a different to my acne scars. 2-3 drops of it my face every day-night keeps my face really less oily. This went well with my skin regimen. Really is amazing. My bottle still have alot in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for any skin regimen!!!</li>
    <li> So great for my dry heels and cuticles!  I love that it is a natural product and I don&#x27;t have to worry about what&#x27;s in it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this since I had purchased argan oil for my hair before and the results were greasy, sticky and clumpy curls. I decided to try another brand, this one, because I had heard about the effects of argan oil even though the first bottle had sorely disappointed me. I put this on my face last night and it soaked right in. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy effect, it leaves a soft soothing look and feel. I woke up in the morning and I didn&#x27;t have my normal sleep wrinkles. So I tried it on my hair and got a few compliments at work. I have long thick, curly dry hair and if I don&#x27;t put anything in it then my hair just sort of hangs in frizzy wavy clumps. Instead my hair looked shiny and soft, with gentle even tendrils. It was lighter and more youthful looking all day. I had my 20 year old hair back instead of my 35 year old hair. I would add a picture here but I don&#x27;t know how to do that. Thank you for selling such a nice oil. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely amazing! The number of uses is endless. i love the ideas they give you on the bottle! This is a product I am now hooked on and will be a lifetime customer!!</li>
    <li> An oil that the skin can really absorb.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this brand. The oil goes on like silk and my skin absorbs without a greasy afterfeel, common in grocery store brands.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it on my skin for new surgical scars and for dryness. I use it on the dry ends of hair as well. I like the pump, no spills!&lt;br /&gt;Loved the lip balm bonus item. Will definitely choose this company again.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  It adds the perfect amount of moisture to my face without being greasy!  Also feels wonderful in my hair :) I added it to a spray bottle and just spray it on with my toner every morning.  You don&#x27;t need much so it lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. It has a very light and smooth texture. It&#x27;s my first time trying it and I&#x27;ve used it on my face and hair. It has very little smell and you get a large amount for the price.</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil on my face at night, and I&#x27;ll never go back to using some weird night treatment lotion. Oil is all you need!  It absorbs well and I&#x27;m not super greasy in the morning. I also use it in my hair, and its great for removing eye makeup. My husband loves it and probably uses it more than I do. I&#x27;ve tried to get him to use a face lotion, but he will only use this oil. I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past, and this one seems to be very good quality. You only need 4-5 drops to cover your face, and 4 oz. lasts a looooong time.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Love this store and their products.</li>
    <li> Works great! Really all natural Argan oil, high quality- not cheap stuff. You can use it for a bunch of stuff</li>
    <li> I purchased argan oil from Beauty By Earth a few weeks back and I have been using it daily and I LOVE this product. I have been using it for stretch marks which have visibly improved. I also use it as a daily moisturizer for my face in the morning and at night with my night cream. I love the way my skin feels since using the argan oil, it&#x27;s smooth, not oily at all and lines and wrinkles I noticed before are fading. Thanks so much for this fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Great value bought one as a gift and one for myself. Smells light and soaks in quickly is really great quality.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It is all natural and 100% Argan oil--no fillers or additives.  I use it on my hair to tame flyaways.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t take much product and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  Also, I use it as a moisturizer and it works great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or skin greasy either.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a smell which is nice.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> My skin is responding well to it&#x27;s use.  I hope with continuous use, it&#x27;ll be clear and radiant in no time!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I started using it as soon as I received it and put it on my face at bedtime, as a serum, under my moisturizer. I look glowing! I almost took a &amp;#34;selfie&amp;#34; last night because I feel like my skin looks better with this product. I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of oils and moisturizers to help heal my skin after pregnancy, but nothing has worked--until now! After I had my baby, my skin felt like it had been stretched beyond repair and I thought it would always look thin and papery. I am happy to say, I was wrong! After just a few weeks of using this oil once a day, my skin is tight again and well on its way to looking better than ever! I am SO happy with this product. Other stretch mark creams I tried were full of toxins, and many of them were goopy and stinky so I  always felt icky after putting them on. This oil feels amazing as you put it on, has a very light natural smell, and is absorbed quickly by your skin, so it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky so you can get dressed after you put it on. Fantastic. I will for sure be ordering more. :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and they also sent me a free lip balm that I am now totally obsessed with. It is so moisturizing and smells and feels delicious. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I started using it on my little sister&#x27;s dreads (which usually look very dry) and they are becoming glossy and stronger.  It absorbs right into the hair and does not leave it feeling coated or greasy!  Lovely product!  Glad to find it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and has multi-uses. So far I have used it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- in my hair as leave in conditioner&lt;br /&gt;- my on dry feet&lt;br /&gt;- at night on my face&lt;br /&gt;- on my baby&#x27;s bum&lt;br /&gt;- baby&#x27;s dry feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are pretty much instant, no more dryness and it results in soft skin!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> This oil is really nice! My skin feels amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and all over my body each day and once it soaks in, after a couple of minutes, my skin feels like complete silk. It also gives me this really pretty glisten and glowy look, but doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I love it!</li>
    <li> This oil smells very bad (fishy). Not sure if it’s old or just smells bad in general. Can’t comment on quality, etc..  as I wasn’t able to use it. I am surprised that nonbody commented on the smell as it’s very strong and unpleasant.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff!  There are 3 main things that I like about this Argon Oil product:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The smell is very faint and pleasant, a little undertone of nut but it is light!  Other Argon oil products that I have sampled smelled strong and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I like the dispenser pump.  It kind of shoots the oil out, which sounds a little weird, but otherwise the oil would ooze down the side of the pump rather then go directly into my hand.  This dispenser does a good job of getting the oil where I want it - into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;3.  This is a good quantity of oil for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is moisturizing on my face when I need a little boost without feeling heavy or oily.  My skin drinks it in immediately, it does not sit on the surface.  I am confident putting it all over my face because I know it won&#x27;t clog my pores and it feels nourishing in the delicate dry eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty by Earth did a great job with customer service too!  The product had a shipping issue and they took care of it right away.  Also, the bonus lip balm that comes with it goes on smooth and feels wonderful on my lips!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Argan Oil as recommended by a friend.  I am pregnant and wanted to do whatever I could to prevent any stretch marks.  I have been using this product daily for nearly a month and am currently 25 weeks pregnant.  So far, no stretch marks!!  Hopefully it stays that way.  It also is great as it absorbs very well and therefore my skin doesn&#x27;t stay all oily.</li>
    <li> This argan oil made my hair very heavy and greasy that wont wash away. I used shampoo to wash it away 3 times but it is still there. The residue is so thick. I do not like it</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and I haven&#x27;t even explored all its uses yet. The biggest thing so far it has helped with was a rash and major dry patches on my daughter. I put the oil on after her bath last night and this morning it was nearly completely gone. And it looked pretty gnarly last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it on my kids scalps because they tend to really dry out here in the mountains. Made a good difference and their hair was nice and shiny afterwards as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking I would use it mostly on my hair, but I actually prefer using a few drops on my face after showering. Once I blot the initial oily-ness off my face after use, my skin is soft and moisturized the rest of the day. It makes putting on makeup much easier. A little of this oil goes a LONG way. I learned that the hard way when I first used it on my hair. I used too much while my hair was still wet, and when it dried it looked so greasy I had to wash it again. Lesson learned, and now I just use a small amount and work it through from underneath. I do think it makes my hair dry faster and it&#x27;s a good heat protectant as well. This bottle will last me a long time, so it was well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner for my daughter&#x27;s hair and does not have a funny odor like many there argan oils do. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> great product, well packaged - convenient dispenser&lt;br /&gt;I use it on hair, skin, face esp nice after a bath, to soften up skin &amp; replenish oils</li>
    <li> My first use was on my hair and it eliminated the frizz, as well as helped keep my hair looking good for two days without needing another wash and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second use was for a little sunburn that was stinging and a bit painful.  Within a few minutes of application the sting went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well as a gentle eye oil before going to bed or in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there is a myriad of other uses.  I love that it is all natural, has no scent and really does work.  Please do note the 4 oz size - it is very generous.  Most products that come in these dropper bottles are 2 oz and seeing a product picture on the internet can be deceiving.  This is in fact a good size bottle and lots of oil that will last for quite a while.  The price for this amount cannot be beat, in my opinion. :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience with ordering and using this oil, love it! I would recommend this to those of you with dry or damaged hair!</li>
    <li> I am pretty new to oil use so I wanted to try several uses before writing my review.  I think my favorite way to use this oil is as a serum with my moisturizer.  The first time I put it on, I used waaaaaay too much ( a few drops go a LONG way).  My skin is generally dry and the oil has really helped without feeling cakey.  The shine on the hair is incredible. I often wear my hair in a natural curl and it was really nice to add this on after diffusing.  I still need to try it on my &amp;#34;flip flop&amp;#34; heels.  I am excited to explore all the uses!</li>
    <li> A holy grail product! I use this combined with coconut oil and raw Shea butter and wow a powerful moisturizer. I add this to my shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product quality. Fast shipping and great packaging with awesome price . Will return to buy more ASAP I&#x27;m hooked!!! I use it as my daily face and décolleté moisturizer. Also on hands elbows, really all over I guess! I also mix it with organic raw she&#x27;s butter for a super serious body moisturizer and after shaving my legs. So many uses for this and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!!!!</li>
    <li> A little bit of a nutty smell I&#x27;m not used to, but a very high quality product! I was spending triple this amount on another argan oil that was much smaller. I work in healthcare and so wash my hands constantly. I take a bottle of this to work, my hands feel soooooooo much better! I also use a lot of it at night as a deep facial moisturizer and then a lighter layer under my makeup in the morning. And just a smudge run through your hair tames the frizzies!</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is amazing.  I use it for my hair and body and I love it.  It moisturizes and has so many benefits.  It&#x27;s pure and organic, I would recommend it to everyone.  Great job Beauty by Earth</li>
    <li> i use on my face too. goodbye expensive face creams, i now have one product</li>
    <li> I have not even experimented with all the different ways that Moroccan Argan Oil is used for, but it has already exceeded all of my highest expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a 5 - Star Skin Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and I have always had dry skin.  We moved to the Southwest Desert almost 15 years ago where the climate is dry and acrid and the condition of my skin became even drier.  I have also reached my sixties, and with age your skin dries even more...you might call my situation a triple whammy!  I first started using the Argan Oil on my face, right before my moisturizer.  Just three drops is sufficient for both my face and neck, just a minute or two after the oil has been absorbed, I apply my moisturizer.  I could probably skip the moisturizer as the Argan Oil is adequate for both softening and hydrating, but as I have stated, my skin is very dry and the climate here seems to strip all the moisture from skin and hair, so the extra protection is necessary.  I now use it both morning and evening, especially since I am in the process of derma-rolling six nights a week.  The evening application is extremely beneficial, because a derma-rolling session strips out all the natural facial oils leaving face red, raw, sensitive, and dried out.  The Argan Oil is soothing as it helps to replenish some of those stripped out oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 10 STAR Hair Repair Miracle!&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, course textured, colored treated, thick hair that is about shoulder length.  My hair has always been a challenge no matter what climate I have lived.  I use to live in a very humid climate on the east coast and my hair was constantly frizzy, out of control, and needed to be beaten down with a brush on a daily basis.  Here in the dry desert where I now reside, I also face &#x60;hair challenges&#x27; of a slightly different nature.  My hair is still dry, and frizzy, but with the lack of any humidity, it has become limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with Argan Oil as a hair remedy happened under the worst conditions and the incredible transformation that the Argan Oil performed was nothing short of miraculous.  Due to the arrival of unexpected company, I did not get the chance to use any moisturizing conditioner; I just wrapped my hair in a towel and it dried on its own, all bunched up.  When I finally removed the towel, my hair resembled a damp, dried up mass of tangled tumbleweed.  It was late, no time for a &#x60;do-over&#x27;, so I poured a small amount of the Argan Oil into an empty perfume atomizer, spritzed the hair with about five spurts, piled it on my head, proceeded with a brisk 20 second hair and scalp massage, and prepared to attack the &#x60;tumbleweed&#x27; with my comb and brush.  Miracle #1, the Argan Oil was a hair detangler, the wide tooth-comb glided through with ease.  Miracle #2, my hair was full bodied, that does not happen often in a desert climate, unless you&#x27;re at the hair dresser.  Now I cannot claim that my hair was shiny, silky, and glossy, because course textured hair generally does not have that characteristic unless one uses a silicone or other chemical product, but it certainly was very smooth, soft, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ends my review on Moroccan Argan Oil, but if you wish to read further, I have done some research on this fascinating product and the information below contains some interesting facts, along with useful information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting Argan Oil Facts&lt;br /&gt;* Argan oil is made with the nuts or the kernels of argan trees found in the hills in a rural town 2 ½ hours away from Marrakesh.&lt;br /&gt;* For oil used in cosmetics, the nut oil extracted is raw and native Berber women hand-process just one liter of argan oil every few days in a painstaking manner. This laborious process takes about 12 - 20 hours of hand processing to produce one litre of Argan oil. Oil produced by this method will keep for 3 - 6 months because it has extremely high vitamin E levels and is considered oxidatively stable.&lt;br /&gt;* Argan Oil is one ofthe rarest and most expensive oils in the world, and is gaining popularity as a \\&quot;miracle ingredient\\&quot; in the beauty product industry. It has extremely high levels of Vitamin E and 80% fatty acids, which make it perfect for healing many skin ailments as well as protecting against premature aging caused by oxidation.&lt;br /&gt;* Argan oil has a similar fat content to olive oil and is used for similar purposes. Commercial Argan oil is more expensive than olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Argan Skin Care Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;1. Argan oil&#x27;s rich combination of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and Vitamin E can prevent free radical damage to the skin and promote healthy cell turnover.  It preserves existing collagen and  stimulates new collagen growth.  The fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and keep skin cells healthy and well-hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply antioxidant products in the a.m. as a barrier to prevent environmental damage we all experience throughout the day.  The concentrated formula of 100% argan oil is dense, that it should be applied in small amounts, if necessary add more.  On the skin, apply a drop or two and then rub gently until evenly absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;3. People with oily skin should proceed with caution when using oil-based products.  Besides leaving a heavy feeling on the skin, they may even stimulate acne if predisposed to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti-aging&lt;br /&gt;Argan is considered an effective anti-aging oil due to properties such as the high levels of vitamin E /tocopherols (anti-oxidants help neutralize free radical damage, which is important for skin exposed to polluted environments) and saponins (skin-softening agents).  Besides cooling and soothing inflammation, it is also reputed to help reduce wrinkles by restoring the skin&#x60;s hydro-lipid layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healing and Protecting&lt;br /&gt;The active substances called triterpenoids that occur in Argan Oil offer skin protection benefits.  These include tissue healing (scars), anti-inflammatory, sun-protective and disinfectant properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil contains 80% unsaturated fatty acids and is more resistant to oxidation than olive oil.  Argan oil also contains 0.8% unsaponifiables (a large group of compounds also known as plant sterols or sterolins).  Sterolins improve skin metabolism, reduce inflammation, and promote excellent moisture retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair and Scalp Benefits&lt;br /&gt;For the hair, emulsify a drop or two in your palms and apply to the tips and shaft of your hair as needed.  On the skin, apply a drop or two and then rub gently until evenly absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;* Argan oil can be used to remedy dry, itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;* Dry Brittle Hair and Split Ends - It will improve the strength and condition of the hair strands as the oil&#x27;s healing blend of Vitamin E and Omega 3 fatty acids penetrate the hair&#x27;s cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;* For hair that is fine, look for a product with a blend of argan oil, which offers hydration without the heaviness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medicinal Properties&lt;br /&gt;* Argan oil contains rare plant sterols (schottenol and spinasterol), not found in other oils.  It is believed that these phytosterols are unique in their combination and that there are no other vegetable oils with a comparable phytosterol composition.  In general phytosterols reduce inflammation and help block cholesterol absorption from the intestines.  They also show anti-cancer properties.&lt;br /&gt;* Argan oil facilitates digestion by increasing the concentration of pepsin in the gastric juice.  It contains flavonoids that act as a natural anti-inflammatory both internally and externally.&lt;br /&gt;* The oil is considered highly beneficial for arthritic or rheumatic conditions.&lt;br /&gt;* It is helpful for lowering cholesterol levels, stimulating circulation and strengthening the body&#x60;s natural immunity.&lt;br /&gt;* It is used to soothe skin ailments like chickenpox, acne, psoriasis, and dry eczema.  It is also used to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brief Summary Instruction Guide:&lt;br /&gt;* Hair:Argan oil is a great product to calm frizzy ends, add moisture to dry hair, as well as add a little shine.  Apply to hair while still damp for an all over treatment or apply just to dry ends after hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;* Scalp: If dealing with dry scalp, apply some argan oil to a cotton ball and dab the scalp with the oil.

    <li> Love this organic argan oil.  I have very curly hair and put a small about in my damp hair and it helps define my curls and prevents my hair from becoming frizzy!  I recently heard from a friend that I can also use it on my skin, so started using it morning and nice on my face.  Its been really great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily at all.  It soaks right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this for anyone with frizzy hair or dry skin.  LOVE my bottle.</li>
    <li> This argan oil very nice and I especially like the fresh smell which suggests that it is indeed freshly pressed.  It is the best quality argan oil I have found.  I use it to moisturize my face at night time and it is perfect for this.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic! I use it for my face, hair and my feet. It has a dropper so you can get the amount you want. A tiny amount works great for fly away hair. It&#x27;s organic and I like that for my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so good. I can use it all over my body and hair. I can also use it on my little boy. It smells good, its rich and luxurious. I didn&#x27;t have any luck using it on my face, it made me break out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the face but everywhere else I would say it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me this bottle as a gift. i am not one to use Argon Oil but my wife pushed me towards it and so i conceded. i would have to say, it is great stuff. i put it on my face and in my hair at night before going to bed. there is no doubt that i see a difference. a little bit goes a long way. I have to highly recommend it! I went ahead and searched it on Amazon because i wanted to see how much this stuff cost. not bad at all. I&#x27;ll be re-buying for sure. And i noticed they also make a lip balm. I&#x27;m going to try that and will get back to you with a review. so far, the company is holding up to its standards.</li>
    <li> I have been using organic argan oil on my face for the last 4 months, and can really tell the difference....my face feels so good, and lines are disappearing.  And it&#x27;s funny, but in the last few months several people have commented on how great I look!  Hmm... I am trying to get away from all man made chemicals, and this product fills the bill!</li>
    <li> its amazing. thats all you need to know.</li>
    <li> Being a hairstylist and makeup artist I&#x27;m always looking for new beauty products to try. I have to say that this oil is a one stop shop. It feel amazing and you can literally use it everywhere on your body. It&#x27;s not greasy and has beautiful results. I&#x27;m happy to recommend it to all my clients with confidence</li>
    <li> I got this for my hair but found out it works wonders for the complexion.  My hair is shiny and my winter skin is soft.  It feels amazing on my face.  This works better than any moisturizer for the skin around my eyes.  I apply before bedtime and I my skin does not dry out during the day.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Nice, nutty smelling product. Working just as well as any other argan oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased at a lower price. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I ordered rhe product readimg the reviews it had... and I&#x27;m surprised how well it works. Thank you for such an amazing product. I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry curly hair that frizzes easily. Since I have been using this the change in texture has been amazing, it is tame and doesn&#x27;t frizz up in the beach air where I live. My skin is also on the dry side and since I have been using this it is soft and moisturized. This product has taken the place of my expensive skin care products, one thing does it all.</li>
    <li> I love the oil! And will get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the offer of the lip balm but I still haven&#x27;t used up the one I got.  Thank you for offer.</li>
    <li> I like this oil very much.  It&#x27;s replaced my nighttime moisturizer and it really keeps your skin moisturized and protected overnight.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so this will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product through some mutual mommy friends. I received this and started using it right away. I live in a very humid climate so mine and my kids hair is constantly needing an Argan Oil to maintain the frizz that comes with living in this climate. I can&#x27;t wait to use this for other suggestions as well (deep conditioner, facial product diaper rash, etc.). I also subscribed to the youtube channel they have. Great suggestions. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Update: I started putting this on with my body lotion and face lotion (as suggested on the box). My skin loves it. It truly does soak/sink into your skin right away and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like some other Argan Oil products. So Happy!</li>
    <li> Wow! My husband ordered this for me as I have trouble finding a moisturizer that will work for my skin. I have fair and somewhat sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of moisturizers with no luck. This oil is incredible. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and moisturizes it beautifully. I haven&#x27;t been able to use moisturizers on my face for years, though sometimes id get desperate and use one of the new organic ones on the market, and just end up regretting it. I was reluctant to try it as it&#x27;s oil, so I figured it would just make my skin oily, but it&#x27;s not oily at all! My face looks clean and healthy again. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s amazing being able to put a moisturizer on my face that&#x27;s actually healthy for my skin!</li>
    <li> I first have to say I&#x27;m obsessed with the lip balm that came with this.&lt;br /&gt;My son had a rash on his leg and I used the Moroccan argan oil and it totally handled it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> This high-quality product has been very helpful with smoothing my skin.  It gives your skin a nice, smooth feel.  The back of my upper arms get dry, leaving little red dots often; this product has certainly helped soften and condition the skin.</li>
    <li> This oil is just decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems diluted and is not pure to be. Somehow, it is too watery and the solution is not consistent throughout using it. I don&#x27;t like it even though I still use it because I have half a bottle left.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who constantly has to have lotion on their hands, I tried this today and love it!!!  I love the scent and how it feels!!</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find an argan oil that was larger than a bottle of food coloring!  This oil moisturizes hair and skin.  I apply night and after shower to my skin but apply through my hair at night.  Everything is soft and moisturized!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and really moisturizes. The only downside is that the smell is not great. This is only argan oil without any perfumes or added extras but the smell was pretty unfortunate. Other than that this was fantastic and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair so soft and shiny and helps protect it from hair dryer damage. I only have to use a few drops and it lasts for days, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the Beauty by Earth lip balm very much so decided to give the Argan oil a try.  I have been pleased with this oil.  I use it on my cuticles at night before going to bed as well as under my eyes and a light application on my face.  I like that the oil is unscented and will continue to use this product even more once the winter months set in and my hands get extra dry.  A satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks and so far I&#x27;m really happy with it.  It does a great job of removing my eye makeup.  I use it as instead of night cream and I feel like my skin has a lot more of a glow than it did before.  I put some on my lips at night and it&#x27;s very soothing because my lips are always dry.  I use a tiny amount in my hair on those mornings when the heat and humidity turn my curly hair into frizz.  Everything about this product makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it came with a free lip moisturizer and that&#x27;s about the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Both of my sons are totally addicted to Chapstick and I&#x27;m going to buy these for them so they can use something more natural and less like candle wax on their lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I do love this product!  I have an oily T-zone and Argan Oil does not leave an oily film on my face.  My skin is VERY sensitive (GRRR) but, this wonderful oil does not burn or hurt me.  My face is so much softer now and the oil does not leave an oily residue on my face.  Love it!  And thank you small company!!!!  Jodi</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this product, I&#x27;ve tried others and they worked but this argan oil sends to smell better, work better and so far last longer. The ebook has been extremely helpful as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! 💛💛💛&lt;br /&gt;So many uses, especially on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time too.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, large jar, I use it in my hair, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> The oil works as described.  I use it on my hair.  One of my co-workers complimented me on how nice my hair looks just yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a timely manner, and the packaging was very nice.  I found the free lip balm enclosed to be very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great and I use it as face moisturizer occassionally and it works well for that purpose as well. The chapstick they sent with it was also great! Would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and has been less dry since using it. Would recommend it to others. I have actually bought it for others who would also agree with me of how well it works</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Makes my skin feel very soft and it lasts forever. I use it in my hair as well and it makes it very soft and smooth. The lip balm is the best too, I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Works wonderfully and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my face.</li>
    <li> I just love argan oil and this bottle is such a great value.  My face just feel so wonderful using this product.  I do believe it is the best morturiser.</li>
    <li> This Moroccan Oil by Beauty by Earth is AWESOME. For 4 oz, I paid $14, which is an amazing deal. It&#x27;s really absorbable and lightweight. I can apply my foundation a minute or two after applying the oil. A representative from Beauty by Earth actually gave me a call to ask if I received my product on time and if it was everything I expected, which I thought was a really nice gesture. Will  definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil! It works really well to handle dry skin and moisturizer overall. The scent is nice, not strong like another one I had from another company.</li>
    <li> I have really thick coarse unmanageable hair - Argan oil is the best thing that happened to my hair. my hair looks much softer and healthier.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair. Leaves it soft and shiny with no oily residue.</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil and honestly think it has helped my skin. I have used it on my chest and chin area for approx 2yrs. I was fortunate to find this brand at a fraction of the cost of the one I was using. This will enable me to use it on my arms, legs and feet. I especially like the delivery system of Beauty By Earth, in a pump. While it is an oil, it absorbs quickly. I actually already ordered 2 more of this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Argan oil from Beauty by Earth!  I have used it on my hair and on my face.  It makes my hair so soft and managable.  I also use it on my face and I have been delighted to see how the argan oil has reduced fine lines and it has been a perfect moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Ordered as a Christmas gift for someone &amp; their review of the product is EXECLLENT used on hair &amp; body. Once it was opened, I used a little on my face. This oil is not oily, absorbs quickly into the skin &amp; has no odor. My face felt so smooth &amp; soft even at the end of the day. Next order will be for myself.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and I can&#x27;t wait to download the ebook.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Argan oil and I&#x27;m really impressed. I have combination skin and with frequent breakouts and the argan oil has cleared up my skin a lot. It&#x27;s also great for my dry and damaged hair. I love that its organic too. The seller shipped the product super fast and their website has ways to use the product. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I used it on my hair and it seemed to provide gloss, but then my hair dried up in the outdoor temps. I used it on my face and it burned through my sensitive skin near my mouth. Since this time, facial skin which was effected is sensitive to everything inclusive of water.</li>
    <li> I have softer hair and skin now,  thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> Great &amp;  fast service.  Good product.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this to protect our skin from weather damage. Its a really nice oil and I can see improvements in my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it. I also decided to try using to style my hair and it works well on my short hair in place of pomade. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love that oil! I use it on my face before going to bed and also on my hair every other weeks to moisterize. The spray makes it very easy to dose properly, and only a couple of drops are enough to moisterize your face and neck. All natural, so no unknown ingredients like most facial creams I have been using in the past. I would definitely recommend it! Shipping was also very fast, and I&#x27;ve never had issues with the supplier</li>
    <li> I LOVE this argan oil!  I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.  Overall it&#x27;s my favorite in comparison to Rosehip Seed Oil,  Jojoba, or even coconut oil.  I use it mainly for my face.  After the first week of using it my face feels like it did when I was young.  Five stars!!!!!!</li>
    <li> First off, I got way more product than expected.  The bottle is huge. This will last a long time even with daily use. Secondly, I like it. I&#x27;ve use lots of oils before but this is the perfect consistency and really does help.  I&#x27;m using it everywhere. Its a shock what your body does at it turns 30... 32... and i am really excited about this product to help me with these small scars and wrinkles.  I love using it on my hair ends as well.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my argan oil today! I used my friends to try it out, and I loved it! I&#x27;m excited about using it for my hair and face, but am really looking forward to using it on my belly. I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and have very sensitive skin. This kept my belly moisturized without irritation.</li>
    <li> Love me some Argan Oil and this one is top-knotch. I use it on my hair, skin &amp; on my clients under foundation for a dewy look. I love knowing I&#x27;m using a product that has not been tampered with and is completely pure. Plus, the bottle is super cute. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and customer service! !</li>
    <li> This argan oil is great and has no smell. The shipping was on time like usual.</li>
    <li> I use this oil when I straighten my very curly hair and my face/ lips after getting out of the shower in the winter.Works great and I live that a little goes a long way. I think I will end up having this bottle for awhile but will definitely purchase again when I run out</li>
    <li> Love the oil &amp; balm!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday before my other moisturizer.  For an oil, it is very light, and dries very quickly.  I find it very helpful in the dry weather of winter, and even use it on dry patches of skin such as my heels.  Does a great job!  One tip:  put it in the palm of your hand and apply from there.  You only need one or two pumps to cover your face, etc.  Be sure to rub your hands together to use up what is left.  It is great on your skin, with a light scent.  Not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil, and love the fact that Beauty by Earth gives it in 100%. It makes me hair soft, and I put it on my stomach because I have stretch marks from my pregnancy. And just after 1 application, I noticed they got lighter. If I went a couple days without applying they start to darken again. So I just need to remind myself to apply everyday to get the results I want. Another win for Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> Wish I had discovered this years ago. In my 50s, male that never bothered with skin care and after waking one morning not long ago and looking in the mirror I almost cried. But thanks to this product along with Vit C/Vit A serums, proper diet and exercise my skin and hair is really improving just within a few months. I can actually see improvement on a daily basis.  This is my 3rd bottle ordered. It goes a long way but I have been giving it away to friends too.    Did want to add that it is very absorbent and non-greasy a few minutes after applying to skin which I really like.  Also have applied it to joint pain I get from time to time and though I have not 100% determined it does seem to make the pain go away. I stay pretty busy and after so many years you tune aches and pains out but I will be taking note of this to come.     Even letting my LMT use this on me. She and I both love it. Little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I liked the effect this product had on my skin and hair.    Only a small quantity is needed.  Particularly when putting it on hair.    The only drawback was the unpleasant odor.  It smelled like some types of olive-oil soaked olives I have purchased.    This made me nervous so I did some research online about pure Argan oil.     Apparently pure Argan oil has  an odor that varies with the season harvested and can range from nutty to an strong olive oil like odor.    The odor quickly dissipates after use. Still I did not like the odor in the particular bottle I received, so I mixed about ten drops of a pleasantly scented organic essential oil into it.  I hope that does not compromise its effectiveness in any way, but it masked the unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I use it for my hair and I put it on my face at night. When I awake, my complexion just looks and feels better. I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using argan oil; I have been an avid coconut oil user for a few years, but it&#x27;s not the greatest thing when it comes to my hair. I love that argan oil doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel and I use a pump of it on my blow dried hair to help with frizz - and it really does work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive chemical laden hair products. A few weeks ago I switched to using Wonder Weeds (shop on Etsy) natural shampoo and conditioner and then turned to this for my frizz and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! My face is very sensitive but this oil is so moisturizing and calming. It also really helps with any acne or other skin irritations. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> ok product. very watery compared to my previous one( different brand but bought it from Amazon)</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil!  I have used it on my face for a night serum and hair for shine.  Great price for a great, natural product.  Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading about the benefits of argan oil in a book about better-for-you beauty products.  I love the silky feel of the oil in my hands.  I also like the way it helps with the frizziness of my hair.  My purpose in purchasing the argan oil was to use it as a replacement for my daily facial moisturizer.  My skin reacted to it very well at first, leaving me with moisturized, non-oily skin.  As the summer progressed, however, I started to break out from using the oil on my face.  I believe this was due to the high heat and humidity outside (I live in FL).  This did not change my opinion on the product; I have just adjusted the way in which I use it.  I still love it for my hair and will try it as a facial moisturizer again once the heat and humidity subside.</li>
    <li> I purchased this argan oil and shortly after bought a package of Josie Maran products that came with an argan oil as well  with this oil you get 2 times as much for the same price - they both seem to be of the same quality as for as sinking in to the skin and hair - the only difference is that Josies doesn&#x27;t have any smell to it and this one from Beauty by earth has a nutty smell to it - so I use it more at night</li>
    <li> love this argan oil, I was having  acne problems, scarfs and redness, this product save my face, I used in my hair and body to...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face, body, and hair for about 3 weeks, and I definitely notice a difference.  My skin feels softer, and my hair feels less damaged.  It makes it easier to comb, and protects against heat damage when I use the flat iron.  I think it makes it less prone to frizziness during high humidity also.  I put some drops in my hand with my night cream, mix together, and smooth onto my face.  It goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my body… hair, face, legs, and feet! I wanted something for my carry on suitcase and this is just perfect, the only thing you need!</li>
    <li> After some research I chose this product for my hands and face, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  It was a great deal and shipped fast. I find it a perfect remedy for the desert climate I live in, and I use it every day. It is light, not oily and softens my skin.  I was reluctant to try it on my hair which is straight and fine, but as an overnight remedy the oil soothes dry ends and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use underneath my eyes and on a few other spots of dryness on my face. For the most part, I have oily/combination/normal skin but just wanted something a little extra for the places I do get dry. I love it! No complaints. Just one drop is enough to moisturize both under-eyes for a whole day, so one bottle will last me a long time. I also occasionally use it on my forehead with great results. I will say that if you have contact breakouts, argan oil may break you out. As long as I avoid putting it on areas where I break out, I don&#x27;t have any problems though. Well worth a try if you have ANY dryness problems.</li>
    <li> Much thinner than expected. Works like any other oil.</li>
    <li> This is working really well to help my daughter&#x27;s dry scalp and to help make my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where this has been all of my life!  I love this oil! I put it on sores, even sores on my face, I put it on my skin, I put it on my feet to soften them.  I LOVE this Argan Oil!</li>
    <li> This Argan oil smells good and makes my skin soft. It lasts me for about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff..  Works great.</li>
    <li> Put YL essential oils in. Use as face moisturizer. LOVE this stuff. Soaks right in. No greasy shine on my face. My skin seems to be in much better condition than using those $50+ face moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It doesn&#x27;t clog the pores on my face.  I have a very dry area around my laugh lines and this moisturizers that area and takes away the tight feeling.  Other face oils like FRESH and BOSCIA (at Sephora $50) did not moisturize this area completely.  At first several uses, I had a about 3 random pimples as my skin got used to the change.  I also use a separate eye moisturizing cream (Shiseido at Sephora $55) and though this adequately moisturizes my dry eyes without being too heavy, I sometimes use the argan oil around my eyes because it feels so good (not irritating to my eyes or sensitive skin).  The smell:  It does have a fragrance that I liken to the smell of unwashed sheep&#x27;s wool - earthy and oily.  It is not overpowering or offensive (like sheep&#x27;s wool can be) and does not linger at all.  I&#x27;ve used this oil on my nails in winter to moisturizer which it stopped my peeling nails! It works in my hair too as a smoother on the end and makes it look sleek.  A+ Beauty by Earth request: I would like to have the option to order a dropper that fits this bottle (in addition to the pump) so that I can measure out the proper amount when following the recipes that come with it and also get less if I want to (for nails, hair and face).</li>
    <li> works great and smells the way it suppose to smell works wonderful on my skin and hair use it mostly for me and my daughter face for moisturizing and thanks for the lip balm I mostly make my own but am loving your natural lip balm you sent as a free gift I really appreciate the quality of both products will be purchasing again in the future since my daughter has escema  and I am glad when I can find natural products for her skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for a couple of years now. Thus us the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand. So far I find the product to be wonderful. The large bottle is a great value and there is little to no scent which I like a lot!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great - I use it on my hair and skin. I really like the free lip balm too, great value!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, high-quality oil.  Arrived securely packaged in a beautiful box.  Mild and does not irritate my skin.  Has an extremely light, pleasant scent - barely detectable.  Although I have not purchased argan oil in the past, from everything I have read this must be the genuine article.  I did use it as a leave-in hair conditioner.  However, I have extremely fine (nearly invisible!) hair which is easily weighted down with any oils.  It was not easy to shampoo the oil out (I think I used too much) but once I did my hair was extremely soft.  I can see how this product would be a real miracle as a hair conditioner for someone who has coarse, frizzy hair.  I also use this on my skin and in my various skin concoctions with essential oils.  It is a versatile, neutral base that lends itself to creativity.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work like magic .. may be i need to try longer!</li>
    <li> Have started using it recently. I love it.</li>
    <li> love this for the tips of my hair, and this is a huge bottle for a great price!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair almost every night.  I have highlighted hair that is dry and most other&lt;br /&gt;treatments that I have left on over night tend to be oily and greasy and leave my hair a mess by morning.&lt;br /&gt;The Argan oil is completely absorbed into my hair leaving it smooth not oily.  No need to wash out the next day&lt;br /&gt;either.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing Argan oil, and I am so happy that I went with Beauty by Earth through Amazon!  Not only did I receive a GREAT quality product (the oil is 100% pure and organic), I also received a free lip balm as well as an ebook that educated me on the uses of the oil, recipes, and so much more!  I will definitely purchase this oil again!</li>
    <li> Love this and use it daily on my very dry skin.  I already can see a difference in just two weeks.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! As I sat here thinking about what to write, I decided the truth would be best. I&#x27;m an African American woman in her early 30&#x27;s and noticed some changes in my complexion that I was not happy with. My skin no longer had the youthful glow it once did, My pores were enlarged, and I had bags under my eyes. I searched on Amazon initially for a brush to clear out my pores, and this came up as a suggested purchase. After reading the awesome reviews,  decided to give it a try myself. I&#x27;ve only used it for one week, and noticed the small changes in my complexion immediately. I can honestly say that I am extremely happy with my purchase, because it added much needed moisture, without being oily and filling my pores, and it faded the blemishes quickly. The balm is a plus, and it makes my lips very soft, and I love the minty flavor. Will definitely be a part of my routine going forward.</li>
    <li> I use this product for practically everything from my hair, my skin (makeup remover, with my lotion, etc.).  It seems like it will last forever as I only need a few drops.  Again, love the packaging and the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as an everyday facial moisturizer all week, and it has been all that I hoped.  In fact, it is better than expected and my skin is softer and finer than before.  my skin is highly sensitized to fragrance and I have no problem at all with it.  it does have a naturally occurring fragrance which I barely notice after using it for a while (pleasant enough to begin with).</li>
    <li> smells a little crappy but I guess its supposed to?</li>
    <li> Light and well absorbed, use it on face and neck! Lip balm is great, as well!</li>
    <li> I love this Beauty by Earth Argan Oil!  A little goes a long way, it does not have a harsh/strong smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the little &amp;#34;tips on uses for argan oil&amp;#34; .  The sample lip balm that came with my order was a wonderful surprise and I ordered some of that too--love it.  Very smooth.  Their customer service is exceptional and I will be buying more from them.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use it on both my hair and face. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this full in years and my face is glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on the recommendation of a friend and she was right, this stuff is &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use Argan Oil to moisturize my face during the Winter. The Beauty by Earth Argan Oil has worked well. It&#x27;s not too heavy to use on my face, but is moisturizing enough to also use on my arms and legs. The bottle it comes in gives you enough control so no product is wasted. The beeswax lip balm is a great bonus! I will buy both again.</li>
    <li> I love how it is thicker than the other Argan Oils I have tried - makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth and that it is not diluted like some others must be. I tried it first, a single drop in my dry grey hair. OHMYGAWD so soft and luxurious instantly! I couldn&#x27;t believe it - my daughter even commented on the look w/o me saying anything. Then I tried it on my face, accidentally pouring out 2 drops. Oh well, I thought, dry skin anyway.And I had just used toner. At first it was a bit oily but then it sank in and today  my skin is the softest it has been since, well since I was a baby MANY years ago! I will keep this on my shelf, using it often for all purposes! I even have an e-book to tell me what other uses there are they sent for free! What nice people they are too - I&#x27;ve had occasion to email Customer Service and had the best experience ever. Will buy again and DEFINITELY recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this oil a lot. my hands and hair looks and feels a lot better then before.&lt;br /&gt;I will order more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now. I mix it with distilled water in a fingertip spray and spritz it in my hair after showers. It&#x27;s great! I haven&#x27;t needed any other product since I started doing this. It moisturizes without being sticky or oily. I&#x27;ll be buying again!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I had ordered another brand of argan oil before this one but it seemed to be over priced for such a little amount. This 4oz bottle is very reasonably priced and works great on my skin. It is very moisturizing but does not clog my pores I dont noticed a strong sent which is a very good thing. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a great moisturizer to give a very healthy glow</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and the amount that you get for the price. I love using argan oil for the ends of my hair and for my hands, nails and cuticles. The brand I was buying before was a lot more expensive for much less product. I can now use the oil more sparingly and my hair and skin is thankful.</li>
    <li> Love the convience of the pump.It sits on my nightstand and is very accessible at bedtime. Will definately order again.</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my hair.  I&#x27;ve used other Argan oil products for my hair but this is by far too heavy, leaving my hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I really like this Argan oil.Not greasy at all and since I have dry skin it moisturizes me all day especially after washing my face.Great product and plus you receive a free lip balm .Thanks Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> Great, vesatile (great e-book ideas) product at an excellent price - the free lip balm is fabulous !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of Moroccan Oil/Argan oil products.  I have long, thick, color-treated hair that frizzes, and this miracle oil is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found to tame it.  They all work, some better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try this oil.  I was sure I&#x27;d like it.  I&#x27;m surprised to LOVE it.  It&#x27;s quite different from the others.  The first thing I did when I opened the bottle was sniff.  I was actually surprised to find no smell--whatsoever.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve gotten used to the &amp;#34;pleasant fragrance&amp;#34; of moroccan oils, but sometimes it&#x27;s a bit overpowering, especially when combined with other fragrances (shampoo, conditioner, etc).  This is PURE oil, no additives, and has no scent.  I love that.  Second, as it&#x27;s JUST OIL (instead of oil mixed with a list of unpronounceable synthetics), I soon learned that I have to use LESS.  I put a dime-sized dollop in the palm of my hand and worked it into half of my hair like usual.  I should have used that dime-sized dollop for my entire head of hair (did I mention my hair is THICK AND LONG).  I was quite surprised by this.  This bottle will really last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I did the usually styling after using the oil--blow dryer and curling iron.  My curls look better--healthier, and they&#x27;re staying put even without hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ll definitely be back, and plan to make it part of my routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan Oil as a facial moisturizer and for aging for some time now and love it. Love that Beauty by Earth&#x27;s is Organic and Extra Virgin as that has been a concern of mine on the other one. This one is pure and feels just fabulous, love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is so great for extremely dry skin. Living in a very dry climate I had cracked skin on my heels and this oil improved it 75% in just a few days. I had tried numerous foot creams that didn&#x27;t really make a difference. Also really great when applied to lips before using chapstick or lipstick to avoid dryness.</li>
    <li> This is great for your skin, hair and it&#x27;s 100% natural. It makes your hair shiny but still light and not greasy. It absorbs well and is a good buy for women who are looking for a natural beauty product that works. Also the peppermint chapstick it came with was great and better than Burts Bees.</li>
    <li> I mix the argan oil with some other carrier oil and use it on my hair and my eyelashes, so far im loving it and use it every other day. One thing I like about this seller is the package comes with a lip balm and a free book, very useful! I think this is a very high quality oil, it&#x27;s worth the money and a little goes a long way! Will repurchase if I run out of the oil!!</li>
    <li> This an awesome product. I use it morning and night on my face before my moisturizer and also on my hands and cuticles twice a day. Your hair loves it and will shine beautifully as a result of a couple of drops rubbed on your hands and then through your hair. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It has definite antiaging qualities that you can see within a short time of using it regularly. Wrinkles deminish and a healthy glow will surprise you. You&#x27;ll wonder why you haven&#x27;t heard of this magic little secret a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Very oily. Doesn&#x27;t absorb. I put a tiny on my hair and it stayed very oily and flat the entire time until I washed it.</li>
    <li> After much research I decided to try this argon oil since it&#x27;s 100% organic Moroccan. As a registered nurse, I am constantly washing my hands. This product has helped maintained the moisture in my hands. My hands look so much better &amp; not so dry. I use it along with philosophy hands of hope for added benefit. Will by again</li>
    <li> Works great from my kids,they have long hair that was hard to brush after they shower, but when this while hair is damp makes their hair silky smooth easy to brush and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t look to oily and way better than detangler spray that they don&#x27;t  use no more.</li>
    <li> I love how non-greasy the oil feels and it seems to moisturize really well. I use it on my heels, and around nails on hands and feet. I have really noticed improvement in dry skin there. I also applied to knees and hands, and it absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. I heard a lot of good feedback about properties of Argan oil and a lot of my favorite products have it in them, so now I am trying it in its pure form. What I also really love is the bottle it comes in - it has a very convenient long glass dispenser, so you don&#x27;t need to get a bunch of oil all over you while pouring out of a hole in plastic, like other products I have tried. You can target the problem areas and apply only there. Thus it goes a long way, since you use only as much as you need. I also plan on using on my hair and face as a night moisturizer. :) Oh, and it came with a super yummy lipbalm, I love that it actually has almost eatable taste and it moisturizes lips super well.</li>
    <li> I used to have dull, almost painfully dry skin on my face before I started using this. No matter what kinds of moisturizers I used, I would always wake up to flaking skin and dry spots--this totally changed that! My skin looks visibly better; after massaging it into my face after showers and in the morning, my face is soft, glowing, and moisturized, and even my acne scars have started to fade noticeably after only 3 weeks. Even though my skin is oily and acne-prone, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin visibly greasy at all, and a little goes a long way. I love that it&#x27;s lightweight and that my skin actually absorbs it! I used to use coconut oil on my face, but it would leave me with a film of oiliness that my skin never seemed to soak in. I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase, and am getting another bottle for my mom and sister to try.</li>
    <li> OMG this the best oil, that I have ever used, it is good for the skin, for the hair, for dry feet, I love it and we use it for everything, in the bath it is wonderful it leaves the skin so soft and moist... My husband even put some on our Yorkies paws, I will highly recommend and will buy this and other products again...I am very happy that I purchased this oil...Thank you so much....</li>
    <li> This a terrific product at a terrific price.  I use it on my hair, skin, and nails.  This oil is of the same high quality as others that cost 2 or 3 times as much.  Product was delivered in a timely manner.  I will definitely purchase this item again from the same seller.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Argan Oil! It&#x27;s a great quality for a great price! I am a forever customer!</li>
    <li> This review is for Beauty By Earth Argan Oil.  I love, love this argan oil!!  It meets all the criteria in the tips given for purchasing a quality argan oil.  I don&#x27;t know how long this huge bottle will last since I&#x27;m new to argan oil, but I will definitely repurchase from this seller. I also love the e-book and lip balm. Thanks for a great buying experience!</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality argan oil, my skin absolutely loves it. But really, you can&#x27;t beat the price. For an organic argan oil? It&#x27;s unbeatable. I pay $17/oz at Whole Foods, and this stuff is $20 for *4* OZ! Really amazing. Because of the reasonable price, I feel more at liberty to use it for more than just my face—I slather it on my hands, neck, chest, and use it in my hair and scalp quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a family-run business, which makes me feel warm and fuzzy supporting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, no reason to buy any other Argan oil, ever.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I started using it on my face at night underneath my moisturizer and I absolutely love it. It wasn&#x27;t greasy like I was thinking it was going to be on my skin and even the next day, my skin wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily. I never broke out because of it (I don&#x27;t normally break out anyway on my face though, but at least it didn&#x27;t create any breakouts). I just recently started using it on my hair now and I only use it at the ends of my hair only because my hair can get really greasy if I put a lot of oil in it. But I use it after straightening my hair and it really helps my hair. In my opinion, though, it is just like a lot of other types of hair oil, but I really like this one because it&#x27;s versatile. It does however have an unpleasant smell to it. It&#x27;s not unbearable, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good and that&#x27;s the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about putting it on my face, but other than that, it&#x27;s really good!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I&#x27;ve ua quite a few different Argan oils and this ranks at the top of my list. The package is great and I love the pump. Also received it very quickly. Thank you! I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Love that this oil does not have perfume smell that many others do.  We use this as a hair detangler and also as skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have very thick dry hair and was looking for a product to give it a more silky and smooth look. This product delivers and made my hair noticeably softer. I have recommended this to several of my girlfriends and will definitely order this oil again. Fast delivery and excellent service, follow up. Thanks Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> The timing of this arriving was perfect. The past two days my lips have gotten really chapped and cracked. Not anymore! It&#x27;s wonderful. Haven&#x27;t tried the oil for anything yet, I a happy (:</li>
    <li> Great product! Beauty by Earth was great to work with! I received my wonderful oil very fast! Love the lip balm also!! Will definitely reorder this product when my supply is low!!! Awesome... (&amp;#62;‿♥)</li>
    <li> It melts into my skin and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it for my hair every day. I am not using any shampoo at all just warm water to wash my hair and than massage argan oil into my scalp and the tips of my hair. It works like magic</li>
    <li> Amazing product that is also very affordable! Can be used on my skin, hair, etc. and is especially great since I live in dry Southern California! Gives my body that extra moisture and love it needs. I am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil as a moisturizer after showering as well as on stretch marks and it makes my skin so silky without any oily residue. My stretch marks also seem to be less and less visible! Love love love this product and to top it off, amazing price!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It makes your skin very smooth and clears it up right away.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with skin problems!</li>
    <li> Yep the headline says it all... Not kidding. I&#x27;m A black American woman and I wear my hair naturally curly. I add this to my leave in conditioner and my hair shines for days!!  Secondly, I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face at night and I wake up with a fresh look. Skin sometimes looks dry and dull in the AM... But I&#x27;ve been waking up looking in the mirror amazed:)&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased another bottle after using it for 2wks because it will definitely be a staple in my hair and skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> Love yourlong  hair again short hair people are just jealous</li>
    <li> I developed rashes when I started using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Referred to the guide provided and used it exactly how it was mentioned. Guess this product is not for moe</li>
    <li> I recently discovered Argan Oil from a friend.  She was using this brand on her face and hair and she really looked good and her hair was shiny and healthy looking.  She let me use some and I was hooked.  I just love the fact they they give you a free lip balm that is all natural too.  I am a chap stick addict and I am always on the lookout for something that doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals and a bunch of wax.I have to have a tube in my car, my desk, by my bed and in my purse at all times.  This is great stuff I wish they gave away 4 tubes in each box of Argan Oil  :-).  Highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> Just received a week ago.  Put it on my hands, feet and face every night before I go to bed. It is not grease at all.  It helped my cracking figures only after one applied.  I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 8 months pregnant - her belly has been dry and itchy.  What a difference this has made for her - she said it felt better almost immediately!  Thank you for the great product.</li>
    <li> I have skin bordering on oily/combination.  Since using the Argan oil by Beauty by Earth, I have been seeing a significant improvement in my skin.  My skin has evened out and and is not even oily/shiny despite applying oil on my face.  It has become my primary and only skincare.  I also use it on my hands, cuticles, all over my body, and on the ends of my hair.  Just try it! You cant beat the price for the six and quality of this product!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face at night and have been very happy. It&#x27;s not greasy and just a pump or two is plenty, so I think it will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> This deal almost seemed to good to be true because I was always told how ridiculously expense argan oil is. This seems like a great company and a look forward to exploring its product line.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of tea tree oil with Beauty by Earth argan oil for a blemish free, smooth, and radiant complexion. The oil has a very light scent that disappears in a few minutes. I used 3 pumps of oil and a leave in conditioner on my relaxed hair after washing it, then setting with hair curlers and WOW….my hair is soooo soft and bouncy. I wish I used this product sooner, but better late than never. I would highly recommend this oil to anyone looking for a no fuss natural product that produces excellent results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of Argan oil and I keep coming back to Beauty by Earth, since it&#x27;s a consistently great product that remains reasonably-priced. I also like the pump dispenser more than the dropper that many other companies use, since it&#x27;s more hygienic and easier to use.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! I use it at night on my face, my body scars and stretch marks and i can see improvements! I am very satisfied with the way it makes my skin glow, reduce scars and has a non oily after feel. I am excited for the new changes it will bring to my face reducing wrinkles and the way it helps with my dry spots in my body. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this oil once on my face a few days ago but it still feels fantastic. My order came with a free lip balm and after using it twice my lips felt better than they have in forever. I&#x27;m a Chapstick addict but think I will only use this lip balm from now on. Would be awesome to come in some different colors!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using the oil a little longer I wanted to add that I had a little scar on my face that I noticed after the first couple of days getting lighter and now, about a month later, I swear it is totally gone! Also my stretch marks from pregnancy two years ago are almost totally gone! And I had a couple of tough dry spots of skin that I had been using coconut oil on daily but they were still dry. After just a few days of this Argan Oil, these spots are nice and soft again! I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different Argan Oil products for my skin and hair and this is my favorite.  Many other manufacturers add fragrance, or even dilute with other less expensive oils.  This argan oil is also organic, which is awesome.  The price is very reasonable, especially considering the size of the bottle.  I&#x27;ve spent more on non-organic, diluted argan oil products in tiny bottles.  I use this on my skin, nails and hair daily. My skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;ve not had any issues, which is not the case with other &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; argan oil products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great oil, it absorbs fast and has so many varied uses. My fianc&amp;eacute; has a toe nail that is a problem child and he has been putting this oil on it. There was a noticeable improvement right away; I use it as a moisturizer for my super dry winter skin and am glad that I got it.</li>
    <li> I started using it on my face and body and I love it. Very easy to use and stays clean and also feels amazing. My skin feels really soft and healthy, and I love the idea that it&#x27;s organic and pure.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on Argan Oil recently from a friend on a trip. I had forgotten my Aveeno face lotion and needed moisturizer. At first, I was tentative on using an oil. Usually, my face hates anything oily. However, Argan Oil didn&#x27;t make me break out and my face felt soft the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I had to get myself some. At first, I only used it on my face but - after reading the directions and about the many uses it can have - I tried it on my sunburn, as lotion for the rest of my body and leave-in conditioner. It has been amazing for EVERYTHING I have tried it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am super white, I have these annoying red bumps on my arms. Sun helps get rid of them sometimes but the skin on my arms always seems reptilian-like because of this, no matter how much lotion I put on. With this oil, I noticed a difference within a week. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the bumps haven&#x27;t disappeared but the skin itself is MUCH softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it on my hair, I noticed it helps with the little baby hairs that I have that poke out and, overall, makes my hair seem less frizzy while also maintaining the natural bounce my hair has. When I use hairspray, I don&#x27;t get that bounce in my hair since it gets all rigid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I LOVE this product. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love using this on my face every night.  I can already see some of my fine lines on my face disappearing.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used a few different pure Argan oils, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. I use it on my hair after every shower and also on my skin because it gets dry very easily. My skin and hair feel amazing after using this product and one of the things I really like about it is that it&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily just soft and shiny. I have fine hair and it&#x27;s dry and I get so many compliments on my hair about how shiny it is! I would recommend this product to anyone, not just for hair but for skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, the shipping was super fast as soon as I ordered it the next day it was out the door and I love that!! I have bought products before where it&#x27;s taken up to a week to get out the door when it was &amp;#34;in stock&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s the worst wait when you buy something new and you&#x27;re so excited for it to arrive and it takes forever!!</li>
    <li> I love this bottle of Argan Oil that I ordered from Amazon.  It&#x27;s a 4 oz bottle that will last quite awhile!  And as an added bonus, I was surprised to see a Lip Balm included for Free! My only complaint would be the box it came in... it was very light weight and flimsy and was fairly crushed within the Amazon packaging.  However, the actual bottle of Argan Oil is what was important and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> So in love with this product! I use it mostly on my dry cracked heels which do not exist since I&#x27;ve been rubbing the oil on them. It work wonders on scars too!!</li>
    <li> I love to use all natural, organic and unrefined products as much as possible and I&#x27;m so happy I found this product! It goes on so silky smooth and makes my skin feel AMAZING. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping !! Excellent product ! Fabulous quality and value for the money.</li>
    <li> This product was so light and almost no scent and it works immediately! My face was so dry and my nose got flakey which make makeup look bad.... I don&#x27;t have to scrub my face like crazy anymore! Also works great on my tattoos! Makes them darker and newer! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I use this every single night before I go so bed!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful!  My family and I use it daily.  We use it on our hair, skin, it just works wonders!!! I would recommend it highly&lt;br /&gt;and do all the time to family and friends.  I&#x27;ve got at least five family members trying it so far.  They&#x27;re getting ready to reorder.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin, scalp, hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about a month now and I notice a significant change in my skin and hair--very soft, smooth and silky.  Thanks for a great product.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using and buying argan oil for many years now and this has been the best quality and deal I&#x27;ve come across. Will definitely purchase again! Also great quality of the container; I travel a lot and this has never broken despite all the abuse I&#x27;ve given it</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil is amazing. I use it on my face and hair. Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Smells disgusting. Don&#x27;t buy if you plan to use it after hair wash and still go out in public and meet people with functional noses.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of Beauty By Earth&#x27;s products last week and I am in LOVE. This company has skin and hair products down! Between the packaging and the ingredients, this is a 5 star company. I used the argan oil today after the shower as my hair was extremely tangled and immediately after putting it in it was 10x softer and I was able to brush it. Looking forward to trying the bath bombs next! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on sunburns, baby rashes, dry skin, you name it.  I love it.  It heals and rejuvenates almost instantly.  A little goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil and it came with some useful information.</li>
    <li> I have used argan oil from other brands and it was very light, easily absorbed, never living my hair or skin greasy and this one is terrible! It smells different the color is also different and it is too havy. It&#x27;s like olive oil, you can cook in it!</li>
    <li> It softens dry skin like nothing else. It is nice to know the product is organic, and us buying it helps plant trees.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of argan oils in the past. This product goes beyond any I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on my belly and face while pregnant a few months ago and my skin was immediately happy. No stretch marks:)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a dry oil so you don&#x27;t feel greasy and it won&#x27;t stain your clothes like some other pregnancy oils and lotions will. I loved it so much I bought my Mom some who now also loves it...&lt;br /&gt;My husband had an ongoing (possibly) candida rash on his calf that wouldn&#x27;t seem to go away. He tried changing his diet for months and used coconut oil and tons of different lotions but nothing seemed to work. I had him use this and the very next day he saw a major improvement. It&#x27;s practically gone now and if he feels any dryness he immediately puts this on and it handles it.&lt;br /&gt;I am so thrilled with this product! I&#x27;m a firm believer that this is magic in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;All you need is a few drops so it will last you awhile. You can&#x27;t beat the price for something so powerful!</li>
    <li> Wonderful  beauty oil!  very concentrated, only a drop needed for my face, more for neck and hands.  Unexpectedly healed a dime size spot on my chin(caused by sun/irritants), saved me a trip to the Dermatologist.  Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Argan Oil for a month now and the results are amazing! Coworkers notice my skin and asked me what I was doing. Will buy again for sure. Great for my face and hair and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This oil is the most amazing product I ever used on my skin. First aplication and had people asking what have I done to my face! It also goes amazingly well on your body just mix few drops with your favorite body butter or lotion. I use coconut oil. Love the product and love what is doing for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil. I use it on my face and I never get any breakouts. The oil is pure and fresh and I like the amber bottle.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to look into Argan Oil because I found that it was pretty much the same as Moroccan Oil, but you get it at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m pleased with this because i&#x27;ve found that a little goes a long way. The Beauty By Earth brand in particular, i&#x27;ve found, cost only a couple of dollars more than another brand that I have, but you get double, which is great. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a nice lip balm with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this oil. Good price, fast delivery, generous sized, smoothes on easily, reduced my ever-present, dry itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems immaterial to the oil itself, but I like the gentle to earth box in which it came, great gift item.  I will not only re-order this item, but will look at other products from this company.</li>
    <li> Thought the price was great on this sized bottle so I figured I would try this brand. The Argan oil is AMAZING. I use it as my nightly facial serum and my skin drinks it in. My skin is supple in the morning!  I also make my own hair moisturizer and used this in place of jojoba oil (which I was out of) and THIS WAS A BETTER CONCOCTION. I put it in my hair conditioners too. Even my husband uses it because it&#x27;s so light and non-greasy (he uses it on his hands too). Overall, I&#x27;m glad I went with this brand and love the product! As a bonus, their customer service is stellar as well.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I use Argan oil on my hands, cuticles, scalp, (which the dropper does a great job of distributing) and as an occasional overnight oil treatment on my hair.  The price here for a certified organic oil is sooo much cheaper than the oil sold on QVC, and it&#x27;s a very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about Argan oil is that it won&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin; your skin absorbs it beautifully. I never have been able to tolerate greasy skin, and this does a better job than even coconut oil IMHO.</li>
    <li> Love it! Takes the place of lotion! Just ordered second bottle!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading the reviews so I decided  to try it.  After the first 3 weeks of use, I started to breakout in my t-zone and chin, and on sides of my face.  I read about argan oil online and discovered others were having the same issue, but we all had a common theme: combination skin. Now, I use it sparingly and try to avoid my really oily areas on my face. (back to my Pond&#x27;s nighttime firming cream!) I will say, however, I do add a little of this to my hair before I blow dry it and it makes my hair so soft! Do not use too much or else it will make your hair oily.  I also rub it on my elbows and feet because they tend to get dry in the summertime and  it makes them so much softer.</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil has been great for my beard. Has a really nice earthy smell to it, and has made my beard quite a bit softer. It&#x27;s a touch oily, and I have to be careful what I touch after applying it, but other than that, no complaints.  Great product, will purchased again when container is empty.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This product was much better then I expected! Having bought other kinds of Argan oil this kind is far superior to others I have tried before. This was also the best price I could find online with free lip balm! A total steal with that included! The packaging was very ecogrovy and recyclable. Total plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the feel its velvety. I have mildly severe acne I was hoping for an oil that didn&#x27;t break me out or feel like a thick mess. I have stopped using coconut on my hair and face! Argan is also all over natural curly hair blogs right now so I decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t regret it! I will be rebuying from this company again. Very personable with very quick shipping! I wish I had realized that this was a dropper bottle. I never use it at the chance of contamination. I just put it in a pump bottle or just buy a pump for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for the lightest oil out there your search is over. If you need something to not weigh down 2B/2C hair type buy this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints for this oil and can tell its higher quality then others I have bought in the past!</li>
    <li> This oil feels so good on your face. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly. No oil on your pillow case! 👍</li>
    <li> Where is my lip balm? And The bottle came With half liquid inside. Not satisfied customer at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had amazing success with a variety of argan based products. But this brand caused my skin to break out horribly- worse than I ever have before</li>
    <li> I love it! This product helped calm down my thick, frizzy hair and make it softer.</li>
    <li> Real Deal!!! This product is amazing!!! I&#x27;ve been using it as face moisturizer, gives the perfect level of moisture without leaving that oily sensation on the skin.  Can&#x27;t wait to keep discovering its many different uses.</li>
    <li> The product has performed as expected. My hair has more shine and is easier to control.</li>
    <li> The best Argan Oil, great quality and best price. Shipment was really fast. Pleasure to do business with Beauty by Earth.</li>
    <li> Great for dry hair, not face.  I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for some time now and haven&#x27;t seen any skin improvement.  However, when I applied to my colored hair, it was great.  My completely damaged hair isn&#x27;t so brittle and hard to the touch. It&#x27;s soft and smooth, even though it looks oily/wet.  The hair is only great when it is on, not that it made my hair healthy.  It just prevents my hair from feeling so dry due to over processing.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and soothes skin. Have used on both face and hands.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brand.  Not only do I put a small amount in my hair almost daily, but I use in on my face and body as well.  Thank you for making a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product I can&#x27;t live without this ARGAN OIL!</li>
    <li> The first thing I did was open the bottle and sniff for heavy additive fragrances that I have found in all other Argan oils I have found. Very little smell at all. I am so excited to begin using this chemical free oil on my hair, scalp and in my homemade face serum!</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE ON THE DELIVERY AND I LOVE THE PRODUCE.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described. I really like this product!</li>
    <li> i like it.i put it in my shampoo,making mask for my hair,put on my lips and sometimes on my face</li>
    <li> 80 years old and does wonders for my skin</li>
    <li> I wish I would have discovered this stuff years ago!  This is such a fine oil that it truly penetrates your skin (unlike heavier oils that don&#x27;t absorb), and yet it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It&#x27;s worked wonders on my dry lips, I love adding it to my DIY masks, using it as a post peel moisturizer, or put it straight on my face at bed time in place of a night cream and my face is silky soft in the morning!</li>
    <li> very good product, at a wonderful price</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value and it works well.  It is a little heavy and concentrated to use in my hair on a daily basis,  but I put a little in my hair the night before I am going to shampoo, or on a day I don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere.  It is great for dry ends as well.  It also works for my skin.  I love argan oil and my hairdresser says my hair is in excellent condition and my hair is almost to my waist.  You may need a lighter version for everyday use. This would be fine however is really coarse, dry or thick.</li>
    <li> Have been putting on my face and love it. The ebook has lots of uses which is nice. It is not thick but feels silky on my face. Will definitely order more! Update: Okay, I cant say enough about this oil. It goes on my face and hair ends every morning. By the time I get to work my face is ready for my makeup routine.  I have shared samples with family and my sister who especially likes it around her eyes.  This stuff, two squirts, has lasted a long time and the bottle is still mostly full (three months worth of squirts)</li>
    <li> Did not make a difference in my winkles.</li>
    <li> I received the package, but it was missing the booklet and info on how to use the products. The lip balm lid cover was cracked and broken. It must have broke during shipping as it was packed together in the same box as the bottle of argan oil. I would suggest wrapping the lip balm so it wouldn&#x27;t crack. The argan oil seems to work well for now. It&#x27;s really good on skin,  but it&#x27;s a tad too oily for the hair and scalp unless you use a very little amount on damp hair. I do notice a glow to my skin since using it and will continue to use it. The argan oil bottle dropper is a bit challenging to use since the oil will leak regardless of using the rubber squeeze tip. I would suggest using a better bottle with a dropper that won&#x27;t leak. The lip balm doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special,  yet it&#x27;s a good bonus with less harmful ingredients. Since my lip balm was broken, I&#x27;m  not sure how well it&#x27;ll last.</li>
    <li> Volveria a comprarlo es un aceite excelente.</li>
    <li> This oil feels wonderful on my face and does not leave it looking oily.  I&#x27;ve used a cheaper argan oil in the past and can appreciate the better quality of this one!  I&#x27;m excited to experience this product over time.  The company was wonderful! Timely in fulfilling the order and extremely helpful via email when I requested information. This will become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; place when time to reorder!</li>
    <li> I use this every single day.  It absorbs quickly into my skin and IS NOT greasy.  This is much less than what you will find at Ulta, etc.  Be sure you buy virgin and cold-pressed.  A tiny bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> I need to use it correctly - used full strength on my face, and my face broke out :(</li>
    <li> I really like the argon oil. I primarily use 2 pumps on my face and neck and put the excess on my cuticles and hands.  It really helps soften and moisturize my skin. It helps give it a moist, dewy look which helps under makeup as well. During the daytime I put an spf face moisturizer over it. At night it can be used alone or under face moisturizer. I also dab under and around my eyes and a little over lids.  I even put a little in my makeup bottle so it would glide on better and moisturize as well.  Don&#x27;t use too much as you might have a small breakout.</li>
    <li> This solved all my problems... liquid magic. The smell is a little nutty but not bad. Its natural and it works so I don&#x27;t complain about the smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with some jojoba oil to use on my fairly dry skin as a moisturizer.  Good consistency, squirts quickly out of the bottle. Perhaps more moisturizing than jojoba, but feels similar on my face. Not much fragrance that I can tell.  Maybe a little nutty?  What odor there is fades quickly.  Two squirts is enough for my face and a light coating on my hands as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the lip balm that came packaged with it.  Softer than chapsitck, great peppermint scent and flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face and hands.  I place gloves on my hands after use so that I don&#x27;t smear oil all over everything.  While it does absorb quickly, there&#x27;s still residual oil on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is nice.  Heavy brown glass bottle with wrapper inside of paper box.</li>
