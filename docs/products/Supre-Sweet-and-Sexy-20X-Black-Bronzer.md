      <li>I love the Sweet &amp; Sexy line</li>
      <li>I love this product and the Sweet &amp; Sexy brand.</li>
      <li>The smell also is not bad at all!</li>
      <li>it absorbs easily.</li>
      <li>It has an okay bronzer in it, but not as much as I might have liked.</li>
      <li>Great product:-) definitely helps you achieve a golden bronze color!</li>
      <li>easy ordering thru amazon than the salon which has a huge markup</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this lotion twice in a level 1 and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge color difference.</li>
      <li>, it smells light</li>
      <li>and I bought it primarily for the smell.</li>
      <li>When I first used this I loved it and noticed a huge difference after the first day.</li>
      <li>And I am light to medium skin...</li>
      <li>I will be back for more thanks for a great smelling tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>but they charge so much more, this was the exact same product (which works really well for tanning and smells great) but much more affordable.</li>
      <li>This lotion is the best tanning bronzer I have yet to use in my past 4 years of indoor tanning.</li>
      <li>but this is by far my all time favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a tanning lotion that smells great before and after tanning, this one does!</li>
      <li>I love this bronzer so much.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for people who want to look tan quickly and not have to go to the bed as often.</li>
      <li>Ordered product and received it quickly.</li>
      <li>The lotion is thicker than, say, the Supre Sweet &amp; Sexy lotion with natural bronzers.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion by far!</li>
      <li>I tried this after using the supre sweet and sexy 25xoxo pink bottle (my favorite lotion)</li>
      <li>; I have spent over $70 on a bottle of bronzer half this size, that didn&#x27;t even work half as good as Sweet &amp; Sexy, so i&#x27;m happy!</li>
      <li>at my tanning place so the price was amazing, and i got it on the second estimated date.</li>
      <li>Well, this was my first purchase of a full body tanning lotion with DHA in it...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the pink bottle</li>
      <li>but this one is worth it.</li>
      <li>It provided a deep dark tan quickly and smelled delicious.</li>
      <li>The smell was so nice when I first started using it but after tanning it smelled a bit strange to me.</li>
      <li>Not terribly strong, just...not pleasant either.</li>
      <li>This lotion has the usual Sweet &amp; Sexy scent, kind of a sweet sugary musk, and the same ATO that I affectionately refer to as &#x27;pencil shavings-y.&#x27;</li>
      <li>I was worried about it being damaged or wrong, but it was perfect.</li>
      <li>This lotion is only okay.</li>
      <li>I am an avid tanner.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps I need to use it a bit more--maybe a higher level bed would do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but if you like a darker bronzer try the other sweet and sexy lotions.</li>
      <li>It smells a bit strong at first but that doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
      <li>a positive note</li>
      <li>It really is a streak-free bronzer</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hopefully you won&#x27;t have the same results and can enjoy the results you get.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping tho.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product because it works so well.  The only difference is that I paid $45 for it the first time and 1/2 that with Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t your average smelling tanning lotion. It smells sweet and delicious like candy. That&#x27;s the main reason I bought a sample packet of it.</li>
    <li> This lotion was just what I was looking for.  It provided a deep dark tan quickly and smelled delicious. I would definately recommend!</li>
    <li> this made me some what dark(for the price) this is regular almost 50$$ at my tanning place so the price was amazing, and i got it on the second estimated date. the only down side i had was that other people were telling me i looked \\&quot;orange\\&quot;. i thought i looked great, i told them they were just jealous!</li>
    <li> Lid was cracked into pieces. Fast shipping tho.</li>
    <li> Bought a sample pack of this at the tanning salon, and absolutely loved it! It really is a streak-free bronzer and I feel like it gave me a nice tan! I&#x27;m naturally a white-beige skin tone, and I haven&#x27;t been tanning for longer than a week, and it still worked great! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> works great for indoor tanning really speeds up the tanning process and has a great smell to it great product!</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful smell and it works great. I will be back for more thanks for a great smelling tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Sweet and Sexy tanning lotion! I bought the black bottle this last week, and they send me the green hempz bottle. Not what I paid for but I guess I will give it a whirl.</li>
    <li> I bought this and first off, my skin was itching like crazy, then after a visit to a knowledgeable source, I was shown the irregular things of the bottle and was told it wasn&#x27;t even a bronzed at all (not to mention it doesn&#x27;t smell very good). So my advice is the old &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; !!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of this bronzer for my daughters and was very disappointed when the box arrived and one bottle was cracked and the lotion had gotten all over. It was quite a mess. The box did have some packing in it but the two bottles were packed together inside of a plastic bag with no packing between the two bottles so they just banged against each other all the way through shipping and by the time I received them - one was cracked and leaking.</li>
    <li> I broke out in a serious painful, red, bumpy, &amp; itchy rash from it! No other lotion has ever caused an allergic reaction so severe. I bought this from my tanning salon and I bought it primarily for the smell. I am writing this review because I think people who are prone to allergies should be cautious with tanning lotions they can&#x27;t test before buying. it absorbs easily. If you have sensitive skin, and you are set on this lotion, I suggest trying a sample pack for a few days.&lt;br /&gt; if you dont have sensitive skin and you buy it, make sure you have time to put it on or ask for a few extra minutes before your bed starts. it pumps very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it smells light and I didnt notice any after tan smell at all. Even though I can never use it again, the bottle is so cute and looks great on my vanity.</li>
    <li> I normally would buy this at the tanning salon but they charge so much more, this was the exact same product (which works really well for tanning and smells great) but much more affordable. It is a good bronzer, helps soften your skin, and doesn&#x27;t smell weird like some lotions.</li>
    <li> Does an ok job, the smell is great though.</li>
    <li> I loved this product especially the softness of my skin but after several uses I started breaking out in a terrible itchy painful ugly red bumpy rash like nothing I have ever experienced.  I have no other allergies what so ever so this is very odd for me because I am not sensitive to products.  I have to stop using it and I am too scared to try another. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> have used this in the past. easy ordering thru amazon than the salon which has a huge markup and it is the same product</li>
    <li> It smells amazing but it doesn&#x27;t have a super dark color like I was expecting. It tanned well but if you like a darker bronzer try the other sweet and sexy lotions.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I have tried many others and by far the best. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Best!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Dont pay for the tanning lotions at the tanning salons! This stuff is perfect!</li>
    <li> This works &amp; was a lot cheaper than at the salons! Not the best smell...</li>
    <li> This lotion gave me a nice all over even glow. I will agree with the other reviewers, it doesn&#x27;t get you &amp;#34;super bronze&amp;#34;. It smells great and it&#x27;s definitely cheaper than buying it in the salon. I love the Sweet &amp; Sexy line so I will go back to the 50x bronzer that I have previously used.</li>
    <li> Bronzer helps speed up tan and affordable price.</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied and love the complimentary hemp cream!Would do business with again if I need any kind of tanning prodcuts.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does leave me with a nice color. And I am light to medium skin...</li>
    <li> This lotion is only okay. It has an okay bronzer in it, but not as much as I might have liked. I also cannot stand the bottle, the clear lid absolutely will not stay on, I just ended up tossing it. The smell was so nice when I first started using it but after tanning it smelled a bit strange to me. Not terribly strong, just...not pleasant either. Anyway, it&#x27;s a toss up for me. I doubt I will buy again. Shipping was fast, that was the best part really.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion by far! I love the smell and the way it makes your skin feel after tanning. I worked in a tanning salon for 2 years and have tried TONS of tanning lotions but this is by far my all time favorite! When I first used this I loved it and noticed a huge difference after the first day. Bronzers are the best lotions for me to use because I have fair skin and it is difficult for me to tan but this lotion did wonders! It helped me from burning and peeling and made my skin so soft. I always had this stocked in the salon I worked at and it flew off the shelves! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Five star for sure! Make sure to rub it in good so you avoid streaking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy for sure</li>
    <li> Great product:-) definitely helps you achieve a golden bronze color! The smell also is not bad at all! Some lotions have a pretty bad smell. Almost kind of a vanilla scent!</li>
    <li> This item does not have the bronzer that it should, have bought this at other location - was much darker</li>
    <li> Great! Less than a week shipping :)</li>
    <li> The pricing on this product was half that of the tanning salon I go to.  It smells pretty good and helps to reduce the &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell sometimes encountered after tanning.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels and smells after tanning. Great product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is definitely my least favorite tanning lotion the smell is terrible and it doesn&#x27;t work very well I would not recommend it .</li>
    <li> This product does not work I got more tan using nothing than when I used this product. I am extremely disappointed especially for the price and the 0 quality.</li>
    <li> Smells good and helps my tan look more natural...not orange. I would recommend this for people who want to look tan quickly and not have to go to the bed as often.</li>
    <li> I bought this product solely for the size and and pump. But I ended it up loving it. It smells great and does not stain if you do not apply evenly.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tanner.  I probably own every lotion my salon carries. No issues what so ever!!&lt;br /&gt;I actually LOVE Sweet and Sexy!! Sounds crazy, Right?  After a couple of applications/tanning sessions, I developed a skin allergy. I tried the S/S Sparkling Bronzer....Oh, bad decision, this time the hives and welts were even worse and I had to make a stop at the E/R and received a shot to help stop the reaction and itching.&lt;br /&gt;I really was very sad because I loved the results I was getting, but the allergy unfortunately out weighed the positive.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully you won&#x27;t have the same results and can enjoy the results you get.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It smells a bit strong at first but that doesn&#x27;t last.  I gave it a 4 rating because I don&#x27;t know if the lotion is no longer effective or I&#x27;ve reached the max darkness I will get for now until I go up in my tanning program.  Either way, I love the product and do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for several years.  Love the feel.  Love the smell.  Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a tanning lotion that smells great before and after tanning, this one does! I was surprised at how tan it made me skin, too. However, this is a THICK lotion. I kind of feel gross after tanning due to the thickness. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the Sweet &amp; Sexy brand. It truly smells like caramel &amp; it does keep your tan going for hours after using a bed or laying outside.</li>
    <li> good product,  and great price</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer so much. It works very well in high pressure UVA only beds. It doesnt make me itch like some other lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past. The bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using the supre sweet and sexy 25xoxo pink bottle (my favorite lotion) It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the pink bottle 25xoxo but it&#x27;s still a great lotion.  I would recommend the other to someone if they asked me though mainly because I love the way the other one smells.  Like cotton candy.  Yum.</li>
    <li> Well, this was my first purchase of a full body tanning lotion with DHA in it... and I&#x27;m generally pleased! To be fair, I&#x27;m very pale naturally, and I&#x27;d been tanning in a level 3 bed for about two months before I purchased this lotion; I had a pretty dark base anyway. I&#x27;ve used this lotion twice in a level 1 and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge color difference. Perhaps I need to use it a bit more--maybe a higher level bed would do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I&#x27;m happy I haven&#x27;t noticed any unfortunate orangey tones or streaks on my naturally cool, pink toned skin. The lotion is thicker than, say, the Supre Sweet &amp; Sexy lotion with natural bronzers. I prefer thicker lotions to thinner ones, myself. This lotion has the usual Sweet &amp; Sexy scent, kind of a sweet sugary musk, and the same ATO that I affectionately refer to as &#x27;pencil shavings-y.&#x27; If this lotion had a shimmer in it, I might offer another star.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like to use tanning lotion because it makes me orange and gets all over my clothes afterwards but this one is worth it. The color it gives is great and I notice a big difference when I use it vs. no lotion it also smells very good.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best tanning bronzer I have yet to use in my past 4 years of indoor tanning. I have used, smoke, bombshell, camouflage, &amp; all other brands of tanning lotions &amp; this is the one! Unbeatable price &amp; the size of the tube makes for a very good buy; I have spent over $70 on a bottle of bronzer half this size, that didn&#x27;t even work half as good as Sweet &amp; Sexy, so i&#x27;m happy! &amp; very impressed with the color I achive after a single session &amp; did I forget to mention that this stuff has the yummiest scent ever, something like cotton candy, brown sugary sweetness, Delicious! Love it! Another Beauty must have!</li>
    <li> Ordered product and received it quickly. Works great and was in great condition. I was worried about it being damaged or wrong, but it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Love the smell before you get in! Goes on smooth and most importantly gets you darker! I notice a little after tan smell but nothing too bad and compared to other lotions not that that strong.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Lotion is ok really no fragrance and didn&#x27;t care for the way it left my skin feeling. Thought it would do more then what it did. Ok product.</li>
