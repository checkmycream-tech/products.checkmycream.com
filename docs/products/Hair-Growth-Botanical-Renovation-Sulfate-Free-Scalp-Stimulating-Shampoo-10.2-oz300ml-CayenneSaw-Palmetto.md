      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is an honest company</li>
      <li>I tried the Cayenne Hair Growth Shampoo and I love the warm burning tingling sensation which opened the pores on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I think it is very important to massage it into your scalp with your fingertips.  </li>
      <li>my fav shampoo, i don&amp;#34;t care how something feels, or smells, i care if it works, and this works! :)</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I have told others about how well this shampoo worked for me, and I will purchase more again.</li>
      <li>then this is definitely the perfect shampoo.</li>

      <li>I love that the cayenne pepper gives the shampoo a tingling feeling when you’re using it.  </li>
      <li>I will give the 5 stars once I begin to see my hair filling in :)</li>
      <li>I used nioxin for almost a year and lost more hair in that time.</li>
      <li>The cayenne is potent and it will burn and sting any area that has been scratched or cut.</li>
      <li>and it is not terribly runny.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>But after I started using those shampoo and serum, I was losing my hair even more.</li>
      <li>and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>see how this infection looks when its in most &#x27;severe&#x27; condition.</li>
      <li>and I felt this was the better solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with the products and will purchase again and</li>
      <li>and it is not terribly runny.  </li>
      <li>I love it, but I don&#x27;t love the smell of the shampoo.</li>
      <li>The fact that this shampoo has cayenne in it is really exotic to me because I&#x27;ve never even heard of a shampoo with spices in it- herbs and botanicals sure but spices?</li>
      <li>There was plastic film around it but not on top to hold pop up in place.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo for more than a year, twice or thrice a week.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>love, love, love the fall spice smell it has as well.</li>
      <li>My scalp is clearer than ever before, and I love the way it feels going on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s antiseptic properties can be felt from the moment you apply it, and the shine and health of my hair is better than ever before.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo definitely tingles and the ingredients are awesome.</li>
      <li>So like many hair products it works for some and not for others.</li>
      <li>but it was the texture of my hair that I noticed most.  </li>
      <li>At 44, to think I might have thicker hair than I had in my 20s is very exciting!</li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>, can’t wait to have long beautiful hair!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping good product</li>
      <li>overall happy, and hoping for more improvement in week two.</li>
      <li>overall happy, and hoping for more improvement in week two.</li>
      <li>/&gt;that has any trace of this shampoo, you will get a strong sting in your eyes.</li>
      <li>The cayenne pepper must have been so strong that it stayed on my fingers and transferred to my face.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product I was searching for a long time for.  </li>
      <li>I have been telling all of my friends about how well this shampoo worked for me, and several of them have tried it with great results.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a month, and I can say that I enjoy using it.  </li>
      <li>Seems to work very well, and smells nice too</li>
      <li>He said they get patients but very rare to see at this level.</li>
      <li>, hair did not grow but it made my scalp feel really clean, hair felt light and rejuvenated</li>
      <li>It was recommended to my by my daughter, who said that these ingredients are fantastic for healthier hair and supporting hair growth, and we learned that using SLS-free shampoos are better for the environment.</li>
      <li>I am glad I found the cayenne and saw palmetto shampoo, it is my new favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I am so excited to keep using this product and seeing results</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;transfer burning&amp;#34; just wasn&#x27;t worth it!</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t helped significantly with dandruff or to moisturize my scalp.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my purchase of this shampoo, and I will definitely be purchasing more of this shampoo in the future.</li>
      <li>I tried cayenne and saw palmetto shampoo as a free sample from another purchase, and I will soon be purchasing a full size bottle.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Washes away clean.  </li>
      <li>Okay so far I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is made from many high-quality natural ingredients, most of which I recognize and are well known for their ability to improve hair issues.  </li>
      <li>I stopped it for a bit, but the shampoo did clean my hair well</li>
      <li>It does leave hair clean.</li>
      <li>I will keep using product for hair growth and will update my review when I see more positive results.</li>
      <li>My hair would barely grow and it kept getting more and more damaged.</li>
      <li>I had a fairly comprehensive hernia surgery about 6 months ago and began losing a lot of hair immediately following.</li>
      <li>It smelled good but the shedding continues to be the same.</li>
      <li>It’s a great value compared to other products that promote hair growth.</li>
      <li>The second application really yields the tingly feeling that feels great on the scalp.  </li>
      <li>This product accelerated my hair loss tremendously.</li>
      <li>I mean reading the ingredients list alone made me want to give it a shot, it’s packed with all kind of good stuff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product arrived on time. It spilled a little but not much to give bad review. Bottle is not that big, so Product does not last very long. I have hair past shoulder length. It does leave hair clean. Cannot tell yet if hair is growing yet or stopped falling out.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well, and smells nice too</li>
    <li> Just started using it last week.  Love the smell. After use it leaves my scalp tingly,  so I think it is working!  Fingers crossed!  I will come back in about a month to update!</li>
    <li> Be Very Careful not to get this Hair Product in your Eyes- It Burns like Fire !</li>
    <li> Ahhh what a feeling!!! My hair always smells nice and my scalp feels refreshed. I haven&#x27;t had falling hair lately unlike the previous shampoos where I see clumps of hair on my comb. The only draw back is the price. It&#x27;s way too steep for a shampoo. If only the company can reduce the price a bit for consumers it would really be great so that more people can avail of this excellent product.</li>
    <li> Bought it for myself but did not help much with thickening my hair so I gave it to my sister.  It worked wonders with her.  So like many hair products it works for some and not for others.</li>
    <li> Another WOW....I&#x27;m using this with the scalp care hair oil and have in the first two weeks seen a big difference in my hair in terms of shedding and in the volume and thickness.....I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.  So far....its a dream come true!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he was not  a fan. Could not tell any difference in hair. And you leave smelling like a burrito.</li>
    <li> It really works!  Everyone is noticing a difference in my hair.  Be careful not to get it in your eyes!!</li>
    <li> didnt see much change</li>
    <li> BUY THIS NOW!!! If you have hair that&#x27;s thinning then this is definitely the perfect shampoo. After having had my second baby, my hair was falling out like no other, I would see chinks of my hair everywhere and it was so depressing. I could see bald spots forming on the side of my head and everyone in my family made me feel bad about it. However, I read reviews on this Cayenne Shampoo and decided to give it a try. After only 1 week of using it, I saw that my hair stopped falling out! For the most part at least. I saw very little hair on my hair brush when I brushed my hair and no more clumps of hair in the shower. That was really fast! Then about a mont after that I noticed that my hair was thicker and I was growing new hair on the sides of my head where it was the most thin. Now after 2 months I feel like I have hair again and I don&#x27;t feel so self conscious anymore. This product is pricey but definitely worth every penny</li>
    <li> Burned my scalp and caused irritation. Don&#x27;t use if hyou have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described and has that fresh tingly feeling during the second application.  Yes, I do follow the instructions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, as the first application does not tingle, usually since my hair needs that cleaning during the first application as I am using this product every other day.  Because of this frequency, my hair is in the oily production stage due to using commercial chemical shampoos for so long.  The second application really yields the tingly feeling that feels great on the scalp.  I think it is very important to massage it into your scalp with your fingertips.  I&#x27;m using this product to get away from the commercial, chemical shampoos both because I am a 30-something, hair thinning male, and because I need to try and return my scalp to a healthy, moist condition.  Dandruff has recently become an issue for me and even the commercial dandruff shampoos (Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue) were not helping.  I will try to give my weekly updates for the first month of impressions as this type of product really does need time to cleanse and remediate the scalp and follicles, if this is possible.  It is ridiculous to expect substantial change and results after a single week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After week 1: Scalp seems to be improving slightly.  Dandruff is coming under control.  Over the last few years I have noticed gradual hair loss.  I haven&#x27;t been losing a ton of hair other than a gradual thinning in the normal male hair loss zones.  Amount of hair loss doesn&#x27;t seem to be affected either way right now.  I fully enjoy the feel of the second application, and the smell and aroma of the shampoo.  My wife does as well, as she could smell my pillow from afar, asking what I did to my pillow?  I just told her that it is from a new shampoo that I&#x27;m using, and she said it smells great!  Foam and lather production seems to be perfect for me.  In my palm, I use a squirt of shampoo that is slightly larger than a quarter for both applications.  At this rate, I assume that this bottle will last more than a month.  Some users mention problems getting the shampoo in their eyes.  You just have to be careful, and many shampoos and soaps are going to burn your eyes if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I tilt my chin upwards during application to prevent water trickle in my eyes.  No issues the first week.  I would also recommend shaking the bottle before squirting into the palm.  I&#x27;m not sure if gradual separation/settling of ingredients occurs, but I shake it well anyways and it is not terribly runny.  First week impression &#x3D; overall happy, and hoping for more improvement in week two., I assume that this bottle will last more than a month.

    <li> 3 stars because....I&#x27;m writing an early review of this product.  I purchased mostly because of all the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok the shampoo does have a scent that is not bad but not great either.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me but my girlfriend hates it.  It almost smells like a candle nobody like I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using according to the directions, it does tingle and feel a little different.  I usually take showers and quick ones so I&#x27;ve switched to baths because it says to leave it in 3-5 minutes.  Most of my showers don&#x27;t last 3-5 minutes.  I have not gotten this in my eyes so I can&#x27;t comment on that as some others have stated that it burns.  I will say that you should wash out your tub after every use.  The residue left from the previous bath will make your body tingle and you will smell like this stuff.  (No I didn&#x27;t  wash out my tub after every use until this stuff lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the bath/shower your hair will tingle for awhile maybe an hour or 2.  I did notice after a couple of uses my hair feels more coarse but it&#x27;s to early to tell anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff mainly to keep what hair I have left if it even does that I will be a very happy customer and future customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post another review 3 months from this date hopefully with pictures.  I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s to early to tell not that it&#x27;s a bad product (yet)</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my hair grow, my brother had a bald spot so I let him use it. He really liked it, his spot started to fill in. My hair got very voluptuous!  I notice a small growth increase so I&#x27;m pretty excited. It leaves my hair soft. The cayenne pepper burns, even when it&#x27;s off my hands in the shower I go to rub my eyes and just like jalape&amp;ntilde;os it still gets in them....and burns. I recommend to anyone who needs volume in their hair, bald spots, and wanting their hair to grow faster</li>
    <li> Will burn your skin and eyes other than that were pretty well have yet to see full results of course</li>
    <li> The shampoo definitely tingles and the ingredients are awesome. However, after washing my 4a? hair, it was very, very dry and there is no way I would attempt to comb it without using my Wen Fig conditioner.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and it is way to early to see if it is going to work but I am wondering how effective it could be for my hair given the instructions suggest using the shampoo up to 3 times a week for best results and I only wash my hair once a week.  Either way, I&#x27;m going to keep it around for now, but if you have natural African American hair, know that you will need a very moisturizing conditioner or 2nd shampoo to use after this product.</li>
    <li> On my 2nd bottle will continue. Works great for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I feel it working! I like the burn lol but &amp;#34;real talk&amp;#34; this is the most natural and effective way to stimulate blood circulation in the folicules especially those whom are blocked with DHT!!!! I love it, just been 3 days but I know it will work!</li>
    <li> Based all the positive reviews, maybe what I received was either very old merchandise or tampered with, since the bottle I received had a different cap and slightly different label. The  &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; was the consistency of water, and just dripped all over my face and into my eyes and burned like crazy. Left my hair dirty. Horrible stuff.</li>
    <li> Must be careful with your eyes... As with all shampoos but this one if you even get water from your wet hair&lt;br /&gt;that has any trace of this shampoo, you will get a strong sting in your eyes. But the product has made my&lt;br /&gt;hair stronger.</li>
    <li> This will wake you up!! Hard not to rinse n not get into eyes</li>
    <li> The fact that this shampoo has cayenne in it is really exotic to me because I&#x27;ve never even heard of a shampoo with spices in it- herbs and botanicals sure but spices? That&#x27;s what made me want to try it. I did have to be careful about using it because it does burn a bit, but when I get out of the shower after washing it out, my whole scalp feels so invigorated. I really recommend this shampoo, it&#x27;s really cool.</li>
    <li> It severely dried out my already thin hair. Even though I was very careful to not get this product on my skin, it was to no avail. I moisturized my face after lathering up with this shampoo in the shower. The cayenne pepper must have been so strong that it stayed on my fingers and transferred to my face. Holy burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say it worked well at regrowing my hair. After a week of use, I had to stop using it. The &amp;#34;transfer burning&amp;#34; just wasn&#x27;t worth it!</li>
    <li> I love it, but I don&#x27;t love the smell of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> It has not made a diffrence, my hair still falls out, I have been using it for about a month, hope to see an improvement, if not I should get money back</li>
    <li> This is kinda hard to use. It burns everywhere when you use it. So be very careful i usually lean forward and massage it in to really get the circulation flowing for the recommended time then rinse it off in that same position. Trust me otherwise everything will be burning painfully while you stand trying to rinse this off! I havent seen much of a difference but it does stimulate the scalp and I don&#x27;t use it as often because i don&#x27;t wash my hair as often.</li>
    <li> Hair loss runs in my family. I&#x27;m 26 years old and I started to lose my hair right after high school. My hairline started to recede and was becoming thin around the temple area. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4-5 months now and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using this shampoo with the mixture of using the oil as well, I&#x27;ve noticed a HUDGE difference! My hair stopped falling out! My hair grows faster and its thicker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this to grow hair where you lost it. It&#x27;s not going to happen. But to stop and prevent hair from falling out, this is the stuff for you!</li>
    <li> I was starting to bald, and I didn&#x27;t want to start shaving my head so I choose this as a test, By golly it worked! after 6 weeks I have hair were my scalp was shaded. Great product I am a believer and a loyal customer for life.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but JESUS this stuff really works im so amazed how you can feel the effects immediately. I just used it for the first time and my hair and my scalp actually feel clean for once ! I am so exited to see what results I will get.</li>
    <li> If you use this shampoo, make sure to slather petroleum jelly around the eyes, corners of the nose and on your lips; on any thin skin areas. The instructions say not to let the shampoo get in the eyes. That’s not enough of a warning. I kept it out of my eyes, but during the rinse some of the water got to the corner of my right eye, not in the eye, but in the corner of my eye and it stung like fire. The cayenne is potent and it will burn and sting any area that has been scratched or cut. Keep the shampoo out of the eyes. If you shampoo and rinse in the shower, do not let the shampoo and water run onto your face. If you do, you will scream and say a lot of four letter words. I know this from experience. I received the product a week ago and have only used the shampoo twice. I can’t comment on its effectiveness, but I will come back in about two months with an update.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has stopped my hair from shedding by 95% I ordered my second bottle and hope to see hair growth on the areas of my head that are extremely thinning. I used nioxin for almost a year and lost more hair in that time. I truly recommend this shampoo. I will give the 5 stars once I begin to see my hair filling in :)</li>
    <li> It only has been only 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any difference but I&#x27;d would like to continually use for a while longer to see how it works. The product did say that it takes 6 to 10 weeks to see some result.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the Real Deal! It has stopped my hair loss in under a month and it&#x27;s made with very good quality. It&#x27;s thick and foams really good so you only need to use a small amount for each wash. And it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients so it&#x27;s not going to harm your hair or add to your hair loss in any way. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> No I don&#x27;t like this shampoo i feel like there a lot of very many fake reviews here. It does not work at all and I have tried it for months now and I am greatly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really good product, but burns eyes so bad</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
    <li> First of all I know we are all different so with that being said this shampoo didn&#x27;t do nothing besides burn my eyes. It smelled good but the shedding continues to be the same. I know shedding is normal when showering or brushing but when a shampoo claims to stop hair loss or shedding you think it would do what it says. I&#x27;m sure this is an honest company but sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> great delivery and product</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for more than a year, twice or thrice a week. I can&#x27;t say if it grew any new hair but it appeared to be helpful. I was using rogaine before but at least I stopped using that and start this shampoo. Again I can&#x27;t really compare but I guess as long as I was doing &#x27;something&#x27; about the problem, I was sort of content and I felt this was the better solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howe recently I got an ear infection. My ear started to pain. i went to see doctor and when he saw my ear he jumped out of his feet it was that bad. He asked if I had been to swimming pool where I could have gotten this which I didn&#x27;t. When the doctor went away, he send in a nurse to check my ear just for her see how this infection looks when its in most &#x27;severe&#x27; condition. He said they get patients but very rare to see at this level. I feel like it got developed in a span of a week where I started to feel discomfort in ear. It felt like water had gone down it in shower but the feeling was not going away until I started using the drops doctor gave me which fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured it was due to this shampoo. I stopped using it but after a while a used again but I felt the ear was giving me problem again so I stopped it and that was it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Made my hair fall out more!</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement, however if it gets into your eyes, super painful. So be careful.</li>
    <li> Product  works, be carefull not to get in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for several weeks and definitely noticing much less hair falling out. My hair feels thicker, pony tail feels thicker, and my constant baby hairs around my face actually appear to be growing! At 44, to think I might have thicker hair than I had in my 20s is very exciting!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and I can say that I enjoy using it.  I don&#x27;t know how much it will truly help regrow hair but it works very well as a shampoo.  I will update in a few months when I can say how its other claims are.</li>
    <li> Okay so far I love this stuff. It works much better than a cheap version I&#x27;d previously purchased. It also lasts forever because you don&#x27;t need much. I have noticed an improvement but I have no way to measure the improvement. I will say that my hair appears to be growing thicker.</li>
    <li> 9 out of 10 people have only written reviews for this particular brand/product. I can&#x27;t trust this.</li>
    <li> it works like the first time you use it, i has work for me, my hair has grown faster, is stronger, i love it! my fav shampoo, i don&amp;#34;t care how something feels, or smells, i care if it works, and this works! :)</li>
    <li> Promote hair growth? This product accelerated my hair loss tremendously. I noticed my hair falling out more when I first used it, but I thought it was old growth leaving to get ready for my new growth. But no. My hair kept falling out. I stopped it for a bit, but the shampoo did clean my hair well and it gave my fine hair wonderful body, so I continued, thinking all would turn out okay. But the last 2 times I used it (I only used this product for about one month), my lost hair clogged up the bathtub, the bathroom floor looked like a hair salon floor after a haircut, the bathroom sink became a receptacle for my goodbye hair strands. A couple of days ago, a work colleague mentioned how thin my hair is and yesterday I noticed my ears sticking out through my hair (they didn&#x27;t do this before I started using this damn shampoo). I&#x27;m freaking out now, hoping this loss of hair isn&#x27;t permanent. And, on top of all that, I can&#x27;t return this bad product. There&#x27;s $40 down the drain (along with my hair)!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for 3 months, and it hasn&#x27;t worked for me. I bought this shampoo along with serum hoping at least stop my hair loss. But after I started using those shampoo and serum, I was losing my hair even more. I thought I should give it a time, and waited for 3 months, it never helped me. I m really upset..</li>
    <li> I tried cayenne and saw palmetto shampoo as a free sample from another purchase, and I will soon be purchasing a full size bottle.  The shampoo is made from high quality ingredients, and works well to clean my hair.  Soon after I began using it, I noticed a decrease in hair loss and my hair felt healthier.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know whether it is useful or not. But it smells great at least!</li>
    <li> could not see any improvement yet.</li>
    <li> Havent used long enough for results to be seen.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was a lifesaver. My hair is very curly so I constantly straighten it. The heat slowed down my hair growth, made my hair very thin, and I even started losing hair. I tried many different remedies, but nothing really worked. My hair would barely grow and it kept getting more and more damaged. Once the hair loss started I got really concerned and knew I had to take action. I gave this shampoo a try, and it worked so well with my hair! Within a few washes I noticed my hair wasn’t falling out as much. Within a month I noticed my hair growing! I am so excited to keep using this product and seeing results, can’t wait to have long beautiful hair!</li>
    <li> Can someone please tell me if I can use conditioner after putting this on?</li>
    <li> Excellent enhanced shine and texture! Leaving a fresh feeling on the scalp</li>
    <li> I like it a lot it leaves your hair very soft .</li>
    <li> Shampoo is nice. Didn&#x27;t really notice the burning like some other people have stated. Does kinda tingle. Only problem I have with it is the lid was popped up some and had leaked some out. There was plastic film around it but not on top to hold pop up in place. The picture shows a pump but it doesn&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> I am glad I found the cayenne and saw palmetto shampoo, it is my new favorite shampoo.  I tried this shampoo because of the positive online reviews and the price. It’s a great value compared to other products that promote hair growth. It worked as well as anything I have tried, for less than half the price of the stuff they tried to sell me at the salon the other day.  I have told others about how well this shampoo worked for me, and I will purchase more again.</li>
    <li> I tried cayenne and saw palmetto shampoo after I was concerned about hair loss because of both increased stress recently and the fact that I’m getting older.  It was recommended to my by my daughter, who said that these ingredients are fantastic for healthier hair and supporting hair growth, and we learned that using SLS-free shampoos are better for the environment. The cayenne and saw palmetto shampoo was much less expensive than other shampoos I was considering which are designed to reduce hair loss.  I love that the cayenne pepper gives the shampoo a tingling feeling when you’re using it.  The shampoo is made from many high-quality natural ingredients, most of which I recognize and are well known for their ability to improve hair issues.  My hairdresser and co-workers have all noticed how much healthier my hair is looking.  Within a few weeks I noticed that the hair loss I was experiencing had almost stopped completely.  I have been telling all of my friends about how well this shampoo worked for me, and several of them have tried it with great results.  I am very happy with my purchase of this shampoo, and I will definitely be purchasing more of this shampoo in the future.</li>
    <li> update:  Second purchase of this product - I  originally purchased the cayenne saw palmetto. This time I tried the copiaba turmeric mainly cause it substantially cheaper &amp; figured the only difference was the scent.  What a mistake. First off, the scent was overpowering and not appealing &amp; will last till your next wash. I also did not feel it cleaned as well as the cayenne formula (which as I stated in an earlier review made your scalp feel refreshed &amp; tingly).  Also I don&#x27;t usually complain about packaging when reviewing a product but felt it necessary as these new bottles are made of a cheap hard plastic which is hard to squeeze and easy to slip out of your hands - which happened - and the neck snapped off the bottle and half the shampoo ended up on the tub floor.  Very disappointed in this purchase this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.  Don&#x27;t know if it helps regrow but it&#x27;s good for stimulating scalp &amp; cleansing follicles.  It cleanses well. You have to be super careful not to get into your eyes as it burns.  I had a hard time with that aspect of this shampoo especially since the formulation is really watery.</li>
    <li> I purchased the #1 Shampoo for hair loss and I feel like I wasted my money.  I tried the Cayenne Hair Growth Shampoo and I love the warm burning tingling sensation which opened the pores on my scalp.  I actually like the Shampoo better than I like the Cayenne Hair Growth Serum but I will continue to purchase the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with the products and will purchase again and again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I really like the cayenne and palmetto shampoo treatment. I usually mix it with my regular shampoo and then scrub it into my scalp with a shower brush. However, ever since I&#x27;ve started it, my hair has been less greasy than before. I&#x27;ve noticed so much change over the past few weeks of using it and I&#x27;m very happy with the progress I&#x27;ve made so far.</li>
    <li> My reason for purchasing this shampoo was that I was looking for something that smells great, will help with my scalp/dandruff, slow down thinning as well as be all natural. The shampoo&#x27;s at department stores tend to have a lot of bad ingredients, which is why I chose this particular product. I have been using it for about a month now as instructed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 3 stars because I don&#x27;t feel that it has helped as much as I hoped it would as far as scalp care (Albeit only 1 month into use). Will I order it again though, most likely. It hasn&#x27;t helped significantly with dandruff or to moisturize my scalp. Since beginning, my dandruff has decreased and my scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy though. However, compared to some other shampoo&#x27;s that I have used, this seems to work much slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as thinning though, I would have to say that I will need at least another few months to determine how it is working. I had a fairly comprehensive hernia surgery about 6 months ago and began losing a lot of hair immediately following. I have always had thick hair and being a male in my mid-20&#x27;s, I was devastated to be seeing some of my scalp. That is scary regardless of your gender. I know that the surgery is most likely the cause for losing so much hair because my body didn&#x27;t take well to having a mesh implant. However, my father is nearly bald, so I know genetics could be at play as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing to shed a lot of hair and haven&#x27;t noticed any change. Throughout the last week or so, I have noticed new hairs sprouting on the front of my hairline. I have counted about 15 thus far and hope to see this continue. I am not sure if this is due in part to them returning or from the shampoo. I also have several other daily regimens including scalp exercises, cayenne/cinnamon in my diet, biotin and dermarolling. I hope to update this in the near future as I use this for the upcoming months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have been using it for nearly a month, I still have nearly 3/4th&#x27;s the bottle left. I am not sure how much to use each time so I am just using enough to lather my hair and to let it stay in for the 5 minutes. This is a great product for anyone looking for a great smelling shampoo that is all natural. I would recommend it to anyone but I also hope that they have a larger bottle that is more economically priced in the future.ly a month, I still have nearly 3/4th&#x27;s the bottle left.

    <li> Holy hotness, it tingles and WARMS your head like no other. Try not to get it on your forehead as much as possible. No sure if it works yet but I DO LIKE THE STIMULATING WARMTHNESS it has which continues for about 20 min after you get out. Certainly feels like something invigorating is going on. love, love, love the fall spice smell it has as well. A bit watery but it lathers quite well.</li>
    <li> After a few months of using their products, I&#x27;m absolutely committed to the Green Touch Beauty Cayenne brand.  Their products never fail to deliver on what they promise, and this hair growth shampoo is no exception.  My scalp is clearer than ever before, and I love the way it feels going on.  It&#x27;s antiseptic properties can be felt from the moment you apply it, and the shine and health of my hair is better than ever before.  Cayenne makes great products with quality ingredients, don&#x27;t pass this up if you&#x27;re looking for a hair loss solution.</li>
    <li> I think the formula of this shampoo is truly amazing. It’s nothing like any shampoo I have ever used, and that is what makes it actually work and deliver real results. I mean reading the ingredients list alone made me want to give it a shot, it’s packed with all kind of good stuff. I didn’t have good hair to begin with and constant dye jobs on my hair took a toll, my hair was thin, damages, and plain dull looking. I started using this shampoo 4-5 weeks ago, and there is a noticeable change in my hair: it’s stronger, healthier, and shinier than it’s ever been. I never knew that a shampoo alone could make such a difference. I recommend trying it out!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I moved 2 years ago to gorgeous home that has well water.  Ever since I noticed a big difference in my hair.  It was dry, frizzy and knotty.  I used many professional products but still was getting anxiety with the amount of hair in the tub and in my brush.  Yes, I&#x27;m certain that genetics, hormones and stress can cause hair loss but it was the texture of my hair that I noticed most.  When I left my salon my hair is soft and shinny....But when I washed my hair at home with the same products my hair did not look or feel the same.  I did lots of research and hard water can really do a number on your hair.  I purchased this product after reading reviews and desperate to find products that will defeat hard water.  I must say after using this product along with the serum I can feel and see a big difference in the texture of my hair.  Did not want to get a water softener because they make my hair limp.  This is the first time in 2 years I can run a fine tooth comb in my hair with little hair on my comb.  I also use Rusk smoother leave in conditioner and Rusk Argan Oil Serum.  My hair looks and feels like hair again instead of a brillo pad.  I have a natural wave and my hair looks full and full of life.  This is a very good product I was searching for a long time for.  Also I did not have any issues with my thyroid.  I will keep using product for hair growth and will update my review when I see more positive results.</li>
    <li> It burns like it says it&#x27;s supposed to.  I&#x27;m not sure if that makes any difference to hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes away clean.  Cleans your hair.</li>
    <li> Gave me volume but unfortunately I stopped using it after 3 washes because my hair turned a yellowish color? I have salt and pepper hair and it turned the salt into mustard...lol! What I find more disappointing is that, after shipping, I&#x27;m out $67.00 and I have a shampoo that is just sitting there doing nothing! What I&#x27;d like to know is, am I the only one?</li>
    <li> Not at all impressed with this product. It did nothing beneficial for my hair nor did it feel that great. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I really  like this shampoo...I like the smell and I believe it has helped my hair grow faster. I also like that it helps with dandruff.</li>
    <li> Great product...used for about 30 days, hair did not grow but it made my scalp feel really clean, hair felt light and rejuvenated</li>
    <li> Burns our skin too  bad and we will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very interesting product.  I can&#x27;t say that it causes hair growth - but I can say that I noticed the hair of the person I got it for - and I said - did you start using this product?  Yes.  It makes a difference.  I just can&#x27;t say how.  Makes it seem like there is more hair on his head!</li>
    <li> So Far There is no visible effect.</li>
    <li> Liked this shampoo a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a few weeks, every time I shower.&lt;br /&gt;Noticed that I am not loosing as much hair as before, and also, my hair is growing superfast.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it hoping that it helps on the regrowth on the areas I already lost my hair (using also Rogaine and had a hair surgery 2 months ago. cant wait to see the results).&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy a second bottle to see if I get more improvements .&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this product is very nice. She fixed a problem with delivery really fast and gave me this shampoo as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it a lot, and I will start to keep buying it from now one</li>
