<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love it love it love it ohh did I say I love it it wen came with 1 extra price thank you I will defiantly order again.💁💁💁</li>
    <li> Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  This was absolutely perfect.  And the price just can&#x27;t be beat.  Thank you so much!  And they put extras in there too!  I would definitely buy again.  Everything was unopened, sealed, and brand new just as the description says.  Yes a lot of the makeup looks like discontinues in the Hard Candy line.  But that&#x27;s not always a bad thing.  Lots of things get discontinued and then are brought back by popular demand later.  Everything was in great shape, great products and the colors and consistency is wonderful.  Everything was different or at least different colors or flavors of the repeats.  Nothing spilled or was dried out as some have mentioned.  Shipped the day after I ordered it.  Found it rolled up nicely in my mailbox on the 2nd day.  Thanks again.  My friend is gonna love it!  I wanted to surprise her with a random makeup gift and this was perfect and within my budget.  Plus, everything fits perfectly in this clear makeup bag I also ordered on Amazon that came the day after.  Thanks again seller.  And keep up the good work Amazon.  Wow!  :)</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this but the more products I opened the more I found wrong with it I received 26 pieces one mascara was opened the split decision shadows were half dry and so was the eye glitter which only makes me wonder how old this products are and if they&#x27;re safe to use.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of lipsticks/lip liner. Lots of weird colors I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never use but, I&#x27;ll order this again. Great fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> I was in love the minute I opened it. Everything was sealed , unopened and no duplicates. Its a good buy, I mostly received lips products.</li>
    <li> Great products,  definitely getting more than your money&#x27;s worth.  There were a couple broken items and a few duplicates,  but still an incredible deal.  I would buy again</li>
    <li> This package was completely full of GLITTER. It was thru out everything. All over my clothes and couch and carpet. It&#x27;s everywhere.</li>
    <li> Makeup was very old and damaged  will never purchase again</li>
    <li> Some of the product were old and dried up</li>
    <li> Awesome lot! I received 1 bonus item, so 26 items total, all in shades and colors I love. Definitely worth the price. almost all were eye and lip products with a few nail polishes and a bronzer. No expired products.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money all the products are new not used . I think I got money&#x27;s worth and then same .</li>
    <li> Here is a head&#x27;s I go to Walmart and get every thing new what is in the picture is over 2 years old so never order makeup if you do not have a good view on the site and if you look at 2014 and even know in 2015  that stuff is old but your choice..........</li>
    <li> I was really happy when I ordered this but when I received it I was really disappointed.  I received moslty metallic eye shadows and gel eye shadows.</li>
    <li> Lots of great stuff but the cream eye shadows came melted. Can&#x27;t wait to try all the new goodies!!</li>
    <li> I love everything!! It came before it said it would. No expired or opened products. Package very well, I opened four packages to get to it lol, It was like opening a Christmas gift. Thank you : )</li>
    <li> My daughter is making me order another set.</li>
    <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Children-Families-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1622127269/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418769206&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;understanding+children+and+families+with+autism+spectrum+disorders</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order it again, it came today on time but most of it was clearance makeup past its prime and all the makeup worked for me because I&#x27;m darker skinned but I feel for those who have ordered this and have pale skin. There was one lipgloss past its prime so I threw it away..this is honestly not worth it to all who are considering purchasing it&#x27;s garbage and I&#x27;m disappointed the packaging sucked as well a few things looked used and had actual clearance stickers on them from Walmart.</li>
    <li> I really liked the lip products in this. However, all that came in my package was eye shadows and lip gloss. Which is fine, but I hardly ever wear either. There were also duplicated products. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again for myself, but all the items were unopened, which will make for perfect stocking stuffers. :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the makeup colors and variety!</li>
    <li> Wonderful color combinations</li>
    <li> Super cool I love it;) verything is very nice</li>
    <li> Didnt Really like everything that came in the package. I could of been fine without the lip glosses because theyre more For children. too many mascares as well but loved the nail polish. It dried so quick wish the package came with more</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I got this for my friend that loves make up and she was so happy to see that this make up had no animal testing so this was definitely good! :)</li>
    <li> All the makeup came in a big bag. Couldn&#x27;t believe how much I got. none of it was broken or anything.</li>
    <li> It was ok. A lot of the make up was old. Still sealed but old. Used it as stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> I received a few things that I would use, but over all I think this is more so for like little girls/teenagers who wanna play dress up or play around with makeup. A lot of glittery products. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone who is in their mid 20s.</li>
    <li> Some items were damaged or melted. On time delivery as stated.  Not 100% satisfied but ok.  Did not receive my 12 piece as of yet....7/20/15 6:34pm mountain time.</li>
    <li> really happy with the products, got some cute colors!</li>
    <li> No eyeliners which was kinda what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> I received my order today and I have to say I am very pleased with my items. It was a lot of fun opening it up and reaching in and not knowing what or what color you would be getting. I got a good mixture of items and nothing smelled old. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! IT WASN&#x27;T ANY DUPLICATES, AND EVERYTHING WAS NEW AND WELL PACKAGED IN THEIR BOXES! IT REALLY WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> Everything was new non expired and very cute</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order this and even more excited when I opened it. I love eye shadows and my box had more eyeshadow than anything. Nothing was the same color and it had a little bit of everything in it!</li>
    <li> Impressed at what I got. No duplicates and all pretty cool products. There was one box with mascara and eyeshadows that was way old, but it was only the mascara that is unusable.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered on the 25th of May and it came on the 31st way sooner than expected. EVERYTHING came new and sealed. I&#x27;m very pleased I order 25  items but it came with 31 so how awesome is that.  Only 2 items I will not be using which are the color correction items not for my skin tone. I&#x27;M very critical when it comes to buying on Amazon but this was a great  purchase will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this package on the 2nd of march and received it on the 5th! I am so in love with it! I did get a duplicate of lip gloss which is fine! But, I also seen where one of the products the sent me is valued at $10 by itself on the Walmart shelf! That&#x27;s awesome cause I only spent $25 and just one item I got cost half that price! I am so satisfied. I absolutely love this and will be ordering another one very soon! Like, right now. (: Seriously, thank you for such an amazing offer.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter as make up was on her list. I received mostly lip sticks.Only 1 eye shadow and it was crushed into pieces. There was a few items that she can use. Don&#x27;t think I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Was not a real picture of the makeup......did like any of it....gave it all away....wast of money.$25.00....</li>
    <li> Was exactly what it says it is and i will be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I ordered this on a Tuesday, I got it the following Saturday. Awesome shipping. I got quite a few hit or miss items. A few of my items had expired three months ago. I don&#x27;t really pay attention to cosmetics expiring all that much, but if you do, be careful. Another thing I noticed was that I got a crazy number of lip glosses, half of my package was gloss. I am not a fan at all of lip glosses. I did however get products for the face that I would not have bought on my own. Buy it at your own risk. I do with I would have gotten a mascara and more liners, but I am over all okay with what I got.</li>
    <li> Most of it was old, dried out and unusable.</li>
    <li> I just received my 24 piece hard candy makeup set and I love it everything is new and no duplicates it took like 5 days to receive this the seller is amazing I also bought a 10 piece set so I recommend you guys to buy this it&#x27;s amazing and it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow singles were broken and got all over everything. I had to wipe them all off with makeup remover wipes. The foundation and bronzer weren&#x27;t for me, but otherwise, a really good bargain. I got an eyeshadow that my co-worker had been bugging me about, so I can give it to her. The liquid eyeshadow, lip crayons and eyeliners are really nice.</li>
    <li> Some of the makeup was very old and smelled and not much of a color variety kinda disappointed that i had to throw away about 5 to 6 items i received</li>
    <li> A lot of sparkly stuff. Did get some foundation and concealer palette as well as a few other big items. All the sparkly stuff probably won&#x27;t get used for every day wear but I am very happy. Is a great deal. Will order again. No duplicates. Thanks!</li>
    <li> everything in this package matched my skin tone...how did they know??? definitely will be buying again!!!!!</li>
    <li> it was a awesome gift for my girls. My girls loved all of it. It was all different none were the same. Got a deal cause it was all Hard Candy items. Sometimes they lie and only one or two are what you ordered but all 25 pieces were HARD CANDY.</li>
    <li> I was sort of dubious about buying this set at first but I figured for the price it couldn&#x27;t really be such a waste. I was super surprised when it arrived though: lots a variety, no duplicates, everything in perfect condition. My set had a good mix of products, there&#x27;s lots of lip products in there as everyone has been saying but I also got a pretty nice selection of eyeshadow, liner, BB cream (a pretty nice one even), some really cute loose glitter and even a little blush palette with 4 different shades. It&#x27;s sort of fun to just get a random haul of stuff I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily normally buy. It is fairly nice quality as well. If you just want a collection of random colours and products, I totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> It was complete crap. All I got was lip gloss and literally nothing else. Dont order this! If I could I&#x27;d give it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> Love all the stuff....well worth the price make up was all brand new in the seal still recommend</li>
    <li> It was a decent buy but not much variety. mostly lip products that i dont use. one eyeshadow was busted. the quality was decent.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I was satisfied. I&#x27;ll break down what I received.&lt;br /&gt;5 nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;1 box of temporary body tattoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;2 boxes of eye tattoo&#x27;s. (Each box contains 3 applications)&lt;br /&gt;1 loose eye shadow&lt;br /&gt;1 eye glitter gel&lt;br /&gt;1 loose bottle of glitter&lt;br /&gt;2 lip glosses&lt;br /&gt;1lip pencil&lt;br /&gt;1 lip stain &amp; gloss duo.&lt;br /&gt;1 tinted moisturizer (light)&lt;br /&gt;1 under eye brighter &amp; concealer (medium)&lt;br /&gt;7 eye shadows&lt;br /&gt; (2) were one shadow per container&lt;br /&gt; (2) were duos &amp;&lt;br /&gt; (3) were more like pallets containing 5 colors each. Also, two of them came with eye shadow primer. The 3rd was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a box of items choosen at random I was impressed. I honestly order solely because I love Hard Candy Mascara. I may not have recived any but that is the chance I took buyibg at random. It is not a reason to lower my rating or blame seller when it clearly indicates AT RANDOM. Each nail polish came with a ring on the topnin color of the nails polish. Out of my five nail polishes one ring was missing. Im not upset though because the rings were too small for me and ill be giving them to my daughter. Along with the temporary tattoos. Just not my style and for someone many years younger. But,again.. the seller has ZERO when they package this if its for an adult, a child, a gift or what. I hate having to dig threw when people leave bad reviews for stupid reasons. You are taking a gamble when you order this, to me my gamble paid off &amp; I just ordered another. I almost didn&#x27;t order because of bad reviews of people complaining about colors, age appropriate ect. you are tolds in the description it is at random, dont leave negitive reviews because you cant read. If you went to any store to buy all of this seperatly you would soend at least double.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just reordered and will contact the seller to see if it is possible to get mascara in my next lot. If not I will still be very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very very pleased. I love everything I received and they were all colors I can wear.  I did get a dark cc cream but I can use it when I am tan. Lots of fun products! 2 eyeshadow duo cream sticks. Two eye roller eyeshadows. Cream eyeshadow.  Shimmering 2 color eyeshadow pod.  2 pigments. One loose glitter.  One two color blush stick. One two color bronzer highlight stick. 2 wood eye liners. One retractable eyeliner. One loose eyeshadow keg. Two different mascara a. One lip gloss and lip liner set. One lip gloss stick. 5 nail polishes. Everything is sealed and no damaged projects. Nothing appears dried out. Awesome set.</li>
    <li> It was alright it just had alpt of the same stuff in it lile i got 4 things of thr same lipstick it wasnt the best and u was a little disappointed</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I&#x27;m barley though everything I relieved but i love all of it so far. Definitely order at your own risk. I was super nervous about this because of all of the bad reviews, but this is an awesome purchase!! And I plan on ordering it again! And the seller cared enough to put the word &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; on the bag, which means they actuLly care! I will be reordering this again im the future !</li>
    <li> I only got 1 unusable thing. So worth it.</li>
    <li> Its great but alot of lipgloss.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first since there was not many reviews. One was good and one was not. However for the price of about 1 dollar an item I thought it was worth a shot. Considering Hard Candy products at the store can run high. I had my order within a week and it was packaged very well. I opened it up like a kid at Christmas. I loved everything in it. It was a good mix of eye, lip, foundation products. I loved the nail polish I received as well. Everything was new and unopened their was no duplicates. Everything seemed in good condition but haven&#x27;t tried any yet. So far for the price I paid I really liked what I have got. I think I might look into buying more sometime. I love make up and trying new things so this was a nice assortment to do just that. I would recommend this for anyone who would like something new but unsure what.</li>
    <li> Hate it I don&#x27;t want it and it won&#x27;t let me cancel my order</li>
    <li> everything was neatly packaged, as far as the product some of the stuff was dried out but overall everything was great. Would definitely purchase again :)</li>
    <li> 😍😍 awesome!!!!&#x27; Loved what I got</li>
    <li> Best products ever definitely approved by me</li>
    <li> Everything was exactly as promised. The products are all sealed, different and great. I&#x27;m so pleased! The photo is just a sampling of the great things I received.</li>
    <li> It was mostly lipglosses, i  thought i would get a little bit of everything!!! But the price was great for the bunch!!</li>
    <li> I like the diversity a lot of the make up is very unpigmented and the foundation is very watery but what can i expect anyway what really caught my eye wusz the matte top coat varnis i got from this packet it is sooo matte and amazing it dryed almost instantly which is something i found great being that i am married so i dont have a lot of time to myself i needed a fast drying topcoat that would look as fab as this one its dry just in time for dinner!!</li>
    <li> granddaughter loved the gift &#x3D; the other 2 want the same thing for their birthdays!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I got a ton of her favorites for little money.</li>
    <li> it was old makeup and two were duplicate. out of 25 only 9of them were hard candy. not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Never getting this again the mascara were super dry and the concealer was dry ! Want money back !</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking makeup. Not very happy</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was really happy until she found 2 mascara that were unsealed a dry mascara and 2 lip glosses that looked used. She threw the products away and I purchased her replacements even though I feel the products that were no use should be replaced with something else or products that are alike.</li>
    <li> did not come with conceler</li>
    <li> Great Bargain! Ive always loved the hard candy line but had never actually purchased as many as i would have liked. This is a good way to get to know the brand. Im not sure why some people whine and complain. I get that there are different strokes for different folks. but if you go to Walmart you would know that everything they sell is $ 6.00 and up so this makeup lot is a HUGE bargain. If you&#x27;re not into glitter or taking risk  i suggest that you find something a little different. But if you love collecting makeup and love getting bargains than this is a must. I definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it bc I only got 23. Also when I compare mine to all the customer pictures it clearly states that I got ripped off because I only saw 3 things I got in the customer pictures.</li>
    <li> I love it. I got it before the delivery date and I&#x27;m impressed. If I&#x27;m ever in need of makeup I know where to go :) Very cheap</li>
    <li> Luckily I have a job where colorful makeup is acceptable and sometimes encouraged. I got almost 30 pieces. Have not really dug into it yet but love that I have options.</li>
    <li> Great deal and very pleased with my purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> Some of the items were old. The mascara was dried up and I wish I could have picked my colors.</li>
    <li> amazing fast shipping ordered in the middle of the week before Christmas and got it on a Monday I am NOT allowed to look at my package right now my husband looked at it for me it&#x27;s a Christmas present the one thing he did say is that there was a tattoo in there and he said it looked cool but the thing is is I didn&#x27;t know tattoos were make up? Other than that everything is sealed I can use a lot of the stuff some things I can&#x27;t use but hey it&#x27;s worth it worth the price you can&#x27;t go to Walmart and get that much make up for that little of a price so I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Lots of great stuff. Nothing dried out. Shared products with my 3 daughters. A great value.</li>
    <li> i would order this again and i just might do it soon&lt;br /&gt;i looked at the previous ratings reviews and horror stories about this but i thought that it was too good a deal to pass up&lt;br /&gt;so after i ordered it i suprised to see how fast it showed up&lt;br /&gt;First off threviews i read were mixed i have gone through what i received and i have not had any problems with the products at all there are some products i would not use because of the reason of the shades that were sent (i am hispanic)&lt;br /&gt;i only have one product that i will not use because of the condition of it&lt;br /&gt;ALL OF THE PIECES WERE SEALED AS IF THEY WOULD BE IN THE STORE</li>
    <li> Got delivered one day before anticipated, so that was nice.  I got a LOT of lipgloss/lipstick.. at least 6 or 7.  One seal was broken on one of the lipsticks.  I also got 4 or 5 eyeshadows that were really nice, a bronzer, a blush, 3 nail polishes, a glitter pencil, 2 glitter gels for eyes, a loose glitter, a blue (ugh) mascara, and a BOX OF TATTOOS (to the seller..that&#x27;s NOT makeup!).  I was so thrown off by that, but the other stuff was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the items definitely looked older.. wish I could post a picture.  I doubt that it will affect the makeup itself though, as everything except the one lipstick was sealed.  For $27 it wasn&#x27;t a bad deal. This makeup selection would definitely be more well-suited for younger (16-30) people, as some of the colors are a little wild.  All in all (besides feeling jipped one item due to the stupid box of tattoos).. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This was an incredible deal with beautiful , quality makeup.  There were a few duplicates!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money! Only things included are colors and things nobody wants! Do not buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Great great buy. Would buy again</li>
    <li> This is not worth it. i was under the impression that it was 200.00 worth items. this stuff is on sale at walmart. 50 cents a item. I will never buy from them again. it was all melted and dried up it was not what i wanted. who wears hotpink eyeshadow. please beware</li>
    <li> Came in on time, but my eye shadows were messed up, now its just powder. Shows the shipping was a bit lousy. But other then that fantastic items. I love the nail polish and eye liner that I got.</li>
    <li> Great bag of goodies for the price.</li>
    <li> We were missing items and when I contact company the solution was a partial refund. Now the items I got where nice and some what assorted. Not a lot of colors variety. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> My product came in fast and all the products and so much more was there. I was very impressed with the brands that where sent. Definitely would order more.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected based on what was advertised and shown in pictures. Makeup is mostly still usable, but multiple pieces were not properly sealed or were open.</li>
    <li> I loved this package. The only thing I did not care for the glossy lip pencil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m soooo happy with this product! All of the items are excellent of quality! They even threw in an extra item! I would without a doubt order this set again!</li>
    <li> No Hard Candy makeup at all. One of the lip glosses had a cut in it and leaked in the box. It was sloppily packaged and the makeup was old/not a wide array of colors at all. I would not buy again and would suggest no one else buy it either. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with what I got, other than the one broken eyeshadow. It&#x27;s usable, but it&#x27;s very messy. Otherwise, I am pretty satisfied!</li>
    <li> A very satisfied customer I am.  I will certainly be purchasing again in the VERY near future.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> As most have said they were concerned on what they would get exactly but being myself in my 20&#x27;s i gladly can say this was worth it i got all types of products and most were glittery which is something i quite enjoy, also none of my products were opened all were sealed and thats a huge thing for me. either way if your buying this set or not its a gamble just keep an open mind about it.</li>
    <li> Loved everything I got. Thank you very much to the seller.</li>
    <li> This was a really good deal. I got 28 products that were sealed and never used. I don&#x27;t know if the products are discontinued or expired,  but  one item was dried out. One of the eye shadows was broken but not a big deal.  I feel like it was a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Package arrived today, everything was sealed and unopened as described. Some of the colors included I can&#x27;t use like the foundation which is too dark, but for less than a dollar per piece I&#x27;m okay with that. Overall a great purchase though, I&#x27;m very happy with what I got and will probably be able to trade the ones I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Received today, two days earlier than expected. There were 26 things in the package, only 3 of which I&#x27;ll probably not use. And only two things were duplicates, which is fine because I love both things. I&#x27;m about to order a second one!</li>
    <li> I was VERY iffy about ordering this to be honest. Especially after reading the reviews. However, everything I got was brand new in good condition, and the only thing I can&#x27;t use is a tinted moisturizer BUT I just gave it to my boyfriend&#x27;s sister since she&#x27;s not as pale as I am. And honestly, I think unless it shows up damaged or something I feel people have no room to complain. You&#x27;re choosing to order random stuff without being able to pick what items go in the package and honestly at less than -$1 per item and free shipping, I feel I definitely got my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> I got my package in the mail today, three days early(which is a plus), and i love it all! There probably about 2 items i wont be using but thats because i just dont like the type of product all together! I also got 33 items so obviously more then they said id be getting! But i will be buying again in the very near future.</li>
    <li> way to much glitter in this set, really should specify</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with everything that was in the picture that was the reason I ordered it and the makeup looks old</li>
    <li> Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel as though I received a bunch of makeup that was sitting in a box deep in the back of someone&#x27;s closet. Most of the product I received was old, two items were opened and the rest was extremely greasy as if baby oil spilled in the box it was sitting in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again. Wasn&#x27;t even good enough for me to pass to a friend.</li>
    <li> Me llegoo justo a tiempo, excelente maquillajeee a la moda, super geniales y llegan todos y exactamente los 25 LOS RECOMIENDOOOO</li>
    <li> This was a great set of makeup. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and still have not had a chance to use everything but love every piece they sent. I do think I will order another one when I need to.</li>
    <li> It was a good makeup kit, how ever I would have liked to have gotten to either pick my eyeliner colors or have gotten a little more eyeliner than just one thing of it.</li>
    <li> A few of the items arrived broke but, I am still able to use them.  I also received some things that I wouldn&#x27;t use myself, but I can give to a friend or family member that would.  There were also a few out-of-date things but overall this is still a good deal.  I ended up saving a lot of money all things considered, and will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this bundle of Hard Candy makeup many times. I save a ton of $. If you think about it these products cost anywhere from 4$ to 9$ each This bundle would cost over 150$ If bought in the store. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves makeup. And whatever I don&#x27;t like I give to my sister and I still save money.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars, but the lipsticks were unsealed so the lids came off during shipment. Obviously, they were unusable. Other than that, there were a lot of shimmery tones, which I&#x27;m fond of. All of the makeup was good quality, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased from oneofakinddeals!</li>
    <li> False advertisement. Just hard candy brand. Más colours are not useful</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. But some of the items were broken or old. Seems to be clearance items.</li>
    <li> loved the items , you get a good variety of products, the only thing I wish it had was more base powder and lip gloss , perhaps a choice to say what colors you are interested in you know earthy tones or skin tone option , all the products were sealed and not dried out . I recommend it for a fun surprise :) I had a blast with my daughter going through some of the stuff and I love love love the lick-able honey body powder !</li>
    <li> LADIES!!!!  Do not listen to the bad reviews!!!  I just got mine today and it&#x27;s fabulous!  Lol I was soooo worried after reading about &amp;#34;old makeup&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; smells&amp;#34; ect great assortment EVERYTHING was there all wrapped and new .. BUY it so worth it I&#x27;m ordering another one right now !</li>
    <li> Would give it 5 stars but 2 of my items were open and used. Aside from that I liked almost everything. For the price totally a steal and will certainly be making another purchase.</li>
    <li> Seems like a great deal but only if you want dried out mascara, clumpy eyeshadow, sticky and half dried out lipgloss.I would find another supplier.</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. One of the mascaras were dried out, but I didn&#x27;t like the color of it anyway so no big deal. I had some duplicates in product type, but each were different colors. I had a nice variety, and able to use most of it. The few items that were too wild in color for me, I gave to friends. You can&#x27;t really complain when you are getting this stuff so cheap. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I rather enjoyed this product. The price was much less than it would be buying everything separately, one could normally buy four or five products for this price. The variety was fairly good, even if there were a bit too many lip products and semi-repetitive products, ie extremely similar shades. The shipping only took 5 days, which was a huge plus for me. Nothing broken, although some of the cream sticks had been pushed up against their lids. As for the sealing and old makeup problems I&#x27;ve heard, I agree about 25%. Nothing was old or unusable, and all but a few things were in their original sealing. Nothing had been previously used or touched, but it was still a little odd. As for the products, some of them seemed a little out there, such as flavored body powder(?), and a gold glitter mascara topcoat. There were 8 products that could be acceptable anywhere and anytime, while the rest were in extremely vivid colors that would be better for nights out. I would recommend the product in general, but the fact that you can&#x27;t choose what you get and the occasional opened seal were a bit offputting.</li>
    <li> love this make up long lasting</li>
    <li> This was great. Only problem is one of my eye shadows is broken and one of my finger nail polish bottles was broke and dried up. I wouldn&#x27;t have used the nail polish anyways and I can give the ring to my daughter so I&#x27;m very happy with my order</li>
    <li> I am beyond in love with the verity I recieved, only one item I can not wear and that is the foundation because I got deep and I&#x27;m very light and only wear fair. Other than that one piece I will wear all the rest. I love it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 16 year old and it was fantastic, well worth the money. I will be ordering again for myself and my daughter</li>
    <li> Excellent choice, the best make up I have purchased on line to date !</li>
    <li> Some of the makeup was sealed but looked like it was old. Some of the items were terrible colors such as light pink mascara. I loved all the lip glosses. Most everything else I didn&#x27;t like very much. You are better off just going to Walmart and picking out the items from Hard Candy yourself.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal! I loved it. The only thing was the liquid foundation I received was in the color deep and I have pale skin but that&#x27;s okay I gave it to my mom and it looks amazing on her.. anyway overall this was such an amazing bargain. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> tattoos are not make up</li>
    <li> I love the variety of what you get and all the colors I use. I am considering buying more for stocking stuffers. Awesome Price too</li>
    <li> Love the makeup good combo good prize</li>
    <li> I have bought this about 3 times. This is ALWAYS a great buy. I plan on buying it again!!</li>
    <li> I was doubtful about buying this but I&#x27;m very glad I did! As advertised, the makeup was still in original packaging and no duplicates. Two lip glosses and a mascara were dried out but that&#x27;s it. I would definitely recommend buying if you&#x27;re looking for stocking stuffers or a random bit of nice makeup :)</li>
    <li> Most of the items were lip color; of them only two were ugly colors (very dark brown). Nothing was dried out or broken; my favorite item was a hot pink liquid eyeliner. I wish I would have got more eyeshadows; but I am overall Happy with my makeup.</li>
    <li> I got nothing that was suppose to be in this package</li>
    <li> First of all, i was very excited when i found this package online. It&#x27;s such a deal and i&#x27;ve always been a fan of deals annnnd hard candy. I did exactly what everyone else does. Reads the reviews. Most of them are positive except for the few i saw that claimed they had gotten items that were old or broken. Which is what my case was. I gambled and most of my products from this package are lip glosses. Not that i don&#x27;t like lip gloss but literally all of them are these really light colored glosses. I got like 5 different glosses that ended up being all the same color anyways because theres no tint to the gloss in the slightest. This picture advertised for the 25 piece collection does nothing but get your hopes up. I seriously didn&#x27;t get even half of the other stuff shown in the pictures. I ended up with more lip stuff than anything. Very disappointed with this entire purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i&#x27;m giving it two stars is because it came faster than expected.</li>
    <li> I got 3 of the same light concelors and two of the same lip pencil. I thought there was not duplicate. concealors were light I have to give to a friend my tone is medium but overall I was very excited and tested them they were not old saw that they were from walmart from the nailpolish label I am ordering a 45 count lot and I am very excited to get</li>
    <li> Over half the pieces were broke or melted! They were basically just threw in a box! Colors were not cute.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with the makeup and my daughter who I got it for loved it</li>
    <li> Total surprise! You never know what you will get but I got enough stuff to split between myself and my sisters. Some of the foundation didn&#x27;t match anyone but it was worth it and I will do it again :)</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic buy. Everything came brand new, everything was usable. The only complaint I have was that some of the products smelled funny (the &amp;#34;Just Face It&amp;#34; foundation I received smelled a bit like B.O.), but apart from that, I am very happy with these products. This was such a steal, and I would 100% buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome selection, super fast shipping, everything was new, in good shape, not expired! PLus we got 2 bonus items!&lt;br /&gt;We got an assortment of lipgloss and pencils, eye shimmer, pencils, loose dust, glitter. foundation and the nice skin even out stuff, nail polishes, eye liner, and shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;All 4 of my girls surrounded me and it was like christmas! We will be ordering another set and probably more after than &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> 2 of the products were broken (Blushes) and some of the products still had WalMart reduced sale stickers on the products.</li>
    <li> Some of them were broken</li>
    <li> My niece thought she won the makeup lottery!</li>
    <li> Bottles were leaking, eyeshadow cakes broken, a couple items appeared old and clumpy</li>
    <li> I love my box of hard candy make up. I shared it with my sister. I am really looking forward to purchasing more. Thanks for the great deal too by the way.</li>
    <li> I got more lip stuff than anything but what I got I was happy with wish I would have gotten more of a selcetion other than that it was a great buy and ill defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> Just wonderful for my granddaughter (7)she want to be a stylist and I told her this will help in her drawing her thought of style thank u for you valuable kit</li>
    <li> Love everything I received! It came before the day it was supposed to which was amazing. I would definitely order more makeup! I received 28 instead of 25 and everything I received was everything I was expecting and wanting. The colors are amazing also. I would recommend this to someone who likes wearing glitter and bright colors though.</li>
    <li> Their are crazy colors like Pepto bismol color mascara and bright blue eyeliner, but I liked it for the purpose I was using it for.</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t have nothing to complain about for 26 dollars was worth getting the makeup I agree some looked old but worked amazing still</li>
    <li> 4 items of makeup were broken upon arrival. Make up seems to be old. I only like 2 items out of 25. Junk. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this today and boy am I HAPPY!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved NO duplicates and everything is brand spanking new. Instead of 25 items I got 27!!!!! I will definitely order again. LOVE!</li>
    <li> The makeup quality was the worst that I could have possibly imagined. The eyeshadow a pick up NO product. It says that you don&#x27;t get any duplicates, but I did. I hate most of the products. I had 3 lipstick that were already opened and used. You do not get any extras like the other comments said. If I could give this zero stars, I would. the nail polish was clumpy and horrible. I got tattoos, and that isn&#x27;t even makeup! I didn&#x27;t even get any products that I could use. I saw all this at the dollar store. Two products were broken. It is definitely not worth the price. If you want makeup, but it form someone else. I do not reccomend this to anyone</li>
    <li> a lot of the items were open already making me not really trust that they werent used.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about ordering this after reading so many negative reviews, but decided to do so anyway. I&#x27;m incredibly glad that I did!!! I can&#x27;t say that everything in the shipment was new, there were a few pieces that had issues: a mascara that, though sealed and in its original packaging had dried out (but actually works wonderfully as an eye shadow), and oily concealer (actually just one of the six on the palette-after cleaning it it works just fine), and quite a few products that have been discontinued (Also VERY pleased about because I love them and have missed them!). My box was incredibly well-packed AND true to description: everything was in factory sealed condition, there were no duplicates of items (I got multiple eye liners and shadows, mascaras, glitters, nail polishes, lip wear, and even temporary tattoos!), and there were *Bonuses*. Oddly enough, I was expecting just one or two bonuses to be in there. When I saw the 4 trial size pieces I has thought that that was what those were. I got just over thirty pieces. I was so happy over this that I was actually moved. This box has turned my whole day around and I&#x27;ll no doubt get another one.</li>
    <li> Nothing but crap $1 store make up is better than what I got</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this. Was a great buy</li>
    <li> This lot was amazing. When I first saw Hard Candy in Walmart, I was in love. The packaging drew me in and I bought a duo eye shadow and an Eye Def Glitter. They were the only 2 things of this brand I had ever purchased because for Walmart makeup, it was pretty pricey. SO you can imagine how excited I was to find an assortment of Hard Candy for essentially a dollar a piece. I was almost expecting a bunch of lip pencils and blushes and things I would never use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh how I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a beautiful assortment of lips, eyes, and mascaras. Everything I got was brand-new, with security tags and in original cellophane wrapping. I received 3 mascaras that weren&#x27;t expired or dried out, and one of them was pink! I can&#x27;t wait to use that for something fun. All the eye colors I got were completely different, from bright blues, to metallic gold, green glitter, deep purple, silver shimmer, gold shimmer- the list goes on! The lip colors I got were all different shades too, I even got a really rich and creamy lip balm with no color that I have been  using daily. All in all, Im super happy with this and Im glad I ordered it. I want another one but I do not know if I&#x27;d get the same exact things, but I might just get one anyways and find out.</li>
    <li> I have boughten a couple of these and my mom as well.  The fun of a surprise!  There are always going to be a couple of things you do not want but with the amount of stuff that i got it paid for the couple of things i didnt like.  you go to the store and for one item it is 7.99..this is good for teens to practice, halloween, and to try out something different before spending a bunch of money on an item.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is amazing</li>
    <li> Some of the cosmetics are expired. Others were open and dirty. Some were good .</li>
    <li> All great products .. very happy for the money but I did notice that some of the products had been opened and most of the liquid products were dried up and not usable .. overall great buy!</li>
    <li> Not very good quality</li>
    <li> Everything was amazing! Ive been using everything :) i got 27 pieces and they were all different. Super satisfied. Definitely would buy again! Guna recommend to friends :)</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Definitely worth the price. I added up all the prices and it added up to more than $100. I got a few things that were similar but no duplicates! I would definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Not good. Everything was very old, dried, weird unwareble colors. It was better idea taking my money and going to walmart and buy what I actually wanted.</li>
    <li> i did receive a lot of items but none that i will probably use. i would have liked to receive at least one concealer or blush but nope.</li>
    <li> my FAVORITE. All their makeup is cruelty-free (not tested on animals.)&lt;br /&gt; (:</li>
    <li> my daughter n i love this</li>
    <li> It came as expected!!! Soooo cute!!!</li>
    <li> There was a good variety of items and different colors. Some of the make up was older and didn&#x27;t apply well but overall a good purchase for the price. I only gave 4 stars due to the product being a little old.</li>
    <li> The product looks nothing like the picture!! I received the box and it&#x27;s literally a box full of junk!!! Not to mention there was no lid on a consealer and some glitter and it was a huge mess. There was hardly any eyeshadow. The box I recieved and the picture was definitely 2 different things. Very displeased. A waste of 24.00!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love love love the makeup I got. Perfect colors for me. I am absolutely in love with this makeup. Going to order three more boxes soon and put them up for my daughters for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Loved it well worth the money everything was new arrived earlier than expected range of colors from pinks to gold greens to brown and lots of different products only complaint is got two of the same pink mascara will roder again</li>
    <li> the Hard Candy Bad Girl Next Door&#x27;s mascara was completely dry, everything else was ok</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this. Everything was usable and all 25 pieces were in great condition. I got this to add variety to the makeup I already have. I only got a few things I wouldn&#x27;t use but did I try them all out. I gave the few leftovers to my daughter to play with. A few products needed to be shaken to keep from separating but that happens.</li>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like were the tattoos, I don&#x27;t consider them make-up. But other than a few things I will not be able to use, I can&#x27;t complain, I&#x27;m satisfied with all the colors. This is definitely my favorite brand &amp; I may soon risk ordering another lot to see what I get. I almost felt like Christmas morning lol.</li>
    <li> There really were no duplicates!</li>
    <li> Everything was as described. Igor one broken eyeshadow however kinda expected that with shipping.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. They were brand new but its definitely stuff i wouldnt wear. Its like halloween make up or kiddy stuff. Im about to give it all away to kids from my church. I was expecting better stuff. But its mostly all gliterry eye shadow and eyeliners....</li>
    <li> I love this set! All new makeup in wrappers. Pretty colors! Would definitely recommend this to friends &amp; family! Great buy, fast and prompt service! I will definitely be buying from them again!!! 😊</li>
    <li> no it did not it was borke when i got it</li>
    <li> For the most part I&#x27;m pretty  happy with what I got for my money.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice to know exactly what I was getting though.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a gift set for my younger sister. seeing how I&#x27;m not close to them i got it sent to her. to find out half the items were dryed up,broken,or had open seals. i feel like a terrible gift giver now that she had to toss out her gift. don&#x27;t waster your time or money.</li>
    <li> thanks, all new and unopened and no two pieces were the same.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE....DON&#x27;T BUY! I wish I could post the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order today and should have listened to previous customers. This crap looks like floor samples that 100 people have tried on.The lipsticks are open and previously used. The foundation is old and seperated. The colors are atrocious. Eye tattoos...really, in the ugliest patterns and colors. I am not a picky person but this is a rip off especially since I love the Hard Candy brand.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a ten piece before all was great n I got 11 ideas so this time I got a 25 piece set n this time I did get my 25 pieces but one of the eye-shadow s came busted my concealer was open n all over as well as a lip gloss and they sent me two duplicates same lip gloss n same glitter mascara n all the price is great even kind with the mess up n I love the surprise but when its a bit messy lol that the surprise it said to contact and they try make better but I don&#x27;t see how I&#x27;ve tryed what they said didn&#x27;t work....if I can get to at least address this problem I would still get it again cause I love hard can&#x27;t makeup n once I washed everything else off what wasn&#x27;t messed up I loved them but ...so please help me find out how to fix so I don&#x27;t fall out of love with my fav makeup</li>
    <li> This is a great deal, I ordered 3 days ago and it said I wouldn&#x27;t receive till next Tuesday and it came in early! I am very satisfied with what I received..everything was sealed! I recommend this package if you like hard candy makeup then this is a awesome deal!!</li>
