      <li>I use it in many didn&#x27;t ways.</li>
      <li>Every thing came compact no hairs were shed and the brush top stayed on for me.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I use this brush almost every day and it is absolutely A-M-A Zing!!!!</li>
      <li>Works good at FIRST.</li>
      <li>Being that It&#x27;s my first e.l.f  brush, I&#x27;ve never knew It would be this good quality of a blending brush.</li>
      <li>but i love this brush and its easy to apply eyeshadow with but the bottom part of it did fall off</li>
      <li>The brush itself looks nice, and overall, seems to be a great purchase.  </li>
      <li>the quality is pretty good and the price was cool!  </li>
      <li>I purchased this from Target after trying some other e.l.f. products, and I continue to be very happy with them all.</li>
      <li>You could probably order two, so if one of the brushes is not the best you could use the other.  </li>

      <li>If you want a cheap alternative this is the brush for you.</li>

      <li>Really surprised how soft and perfectly shaped these are.</li>
      <li>Sometimes with blending brushes it is good to have more than one, in case you forget to clean it in between uses, and you don&#x27;t want to mix colors you used one day with different eyeshadow colors.  </li>
      <li>Thanks amazon!!!</li>
      <li>My favorite blending brush it doesnt shed on me and it picks up the product very well!</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this brush, but the bristles come off during use consistently.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for emergency needs but honestly spend a couple extra dollars and get a softer brush.</li>
      <li>So if you want something quick for cheap get it</li>
      <li>great as expected.</li>
      <li>- they give you a nice and soft blended out look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this brush,  it just took quiet a long time to get.  I use it in many didn&#x27;t ways.</li>
    <li> Great brush, great price!</li>
    <li> a bit big for my eyes</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty much the same as the contouring brush just with longer bristles.  It puts shadows on well, however when it comes to blending that&#x27;s where it fails.  I like this brand but please; recreate it, with fluffier and longer bristles.  I don&#x27;t feel like spendingg $30 on a MAC or Lancome blending brush.</li>
    <li> The first thing the brush did when I removed it from the packaging was break. I had to use nail glue to glue the metal and brush hairs back to the wood base. It is a very stiff brush and is completely different from the picture,it is very dense instead of being light and fluffy. I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush and when i washed it no bristles fell out and while using no shedding. Awesome!  It blends my shadows well. I have NO COMPLAINTS. It&#x27;s a $1.00.  Update Feb 11th :bristles are coming out and sticking out if that makes sense. I bought another one and a professional one from Urban Decay!</li>
    <li> Looking for a blender brush for half the price here it is .....I didn&#x27;t.want to buy a mac shader brush so this is an great alternative</li>
    <li> My favorite blending brush it doesnt shed on me and it picks up the product very well! Recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I like this brush the quality is pretty good and the price was cool!  At first there was some light shedding, nothing major, but with a few more uses the shedding has almost completly stopped!  I washed the brush and conditioned it before the 1st use and I enjoy this product a lot!  I would buy again and reccommed!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because i needed a new blending brush and this was the cheapest one... EXACTLY.. the cheapest.. It&#x27;s prickly and the bristles fall out when you&#x27;re trying to blend.. I do use it though because it does blend well after a couple minutes... I think i&#x27;m going to have to purchase a new one from a better brand... It stinks because i think e.l.f makeup is good but, obviously this brush is just not..</li>
    <li> Love the brush. Great price. They also have this at target for $1 were i also purchased many other e.l.f. brushes. It blends my eyeshadow perfectly!</li>
    <li> great as expected. i dont do alot of dark colors so this was perfect especially for my small eyes</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be way bigger and fluffier. Not pleased at all and hoping to get a refund...</li>
    <li> I actually use this brush for almost all of my shades. I plan to buy another one so that I don&#x27;t use the same brush for the overall lid and the crease. Picks up the shadow well and blends well on the lid. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Spend a couple extra dollars to buy a better brush. This brush sheds EVERYWHERE, I mean little brush hairs all over my eyelids after application. Not only that, but my brush was cut asymmetrically. One side had the wonkiest long hairs rather than a smooth curved brush. Really regret not spending my $$ on something of higher quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Bad. The hairs on the brush constantly come off and gets all over my face when I use it.</li>
    <li> Just perfect. Nice, fluffy blending brush. The metal part holding the actual bristles had fallen off the wooden stick when I got it - I just hot glued it back on and now it&#x27;s a regular staple in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> For just 2 bucks, it is worth. But, there is some hair slip and not soft enough for my eyelid.</li>
    <li> I love how soft this brush is and how easy it makes my application of eyeshadow. Love this product very much!</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve had low expectations on this brush. Being that It&#x27;s my first e.l.f  brush, I&#x27;ve never knew It would be this good quality of a blending brush. This brush is one of my all time favorite blending brushes, out of all my high-end makeup brush collection.</li>
    <li> Awesome blending brush love it.</li>
    <li> Really surprised how soft and perfectly shaped these are. Great for small eyes. Super blend able density. Like better than my mad brushes.</li>
    <li> Good quality, stands up to Sephora and Mac products. I apply alot of shadow daily from different types of palettes. It held color great. Deposits pretty even. A few bristles have fallen out but that is expected with heavy use on any applocator. Great price. $4 cheaper than Target. Arrived quickly. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> these are just ok. i needed to buy some blending eye brush and did not want to spend much. for starters this will be ok but when you want to take your makeup to the professional level, you will need a more quality brush than these.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people have a negative opinion on this brush, but I love it! Maybe I just got a good one…..It&#x27;s perfect for blending, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. The bristles are really soft and it works well for me, plus I think I got it for like $2.00. Short and sweet, I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> you can get this at target for 1 dollar they are very good quality though for the price you can also get them at harmons or sometimes at ross</li>
    <li> A great eye blender,you can buy it for a dollar at Jack&#x27;s 99¢ shop,but over all great product though i REALLY font like e.l.f</li>
    <li> I am a fan of all e.l.f. cosmetic brushes, and I really like this one; it blends very well. However, I noticed that sometimes some of the bristles fall out. I&#x27;m hoping that no more will fall out, because I like this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I&#x27;ve heard good things about the e.l.f. brand. Although I don&#x27;t believe all elf brushes are like this, this one was a dud. The first time I used it, the hairs felt stiff and were falling out of the brush. It could barely hold the eyeshadows I was using. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing their white handled brushes again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Target after trying some other e.l.f. products, and I continue to be very happy with them all. It&#x27;s a standard brush, nothing more, nothing less, at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I liked that this arrived a day early. Every thing came compact no hairs were shed and the brush top stayed on for me. Honestly I don&#x27;t like how packed the brush is, I thought I would be getting something lighter; but that&#x27;s just my opinion other than that the brush came exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> It works fine but the moment I took it out of the package it had shed and at least 4 hairs from the brush are around my eye whenever I use it. But it does what it was supposed to do and I got it on sale enough that it doesn&#x27;t really bother me that much.</li>
    <li> I would call this a crease brush.  It&#x27;s very soft and dense.  Perfect for placing shadow in the crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I was expecting to get ELF&#x27;s true blending brush (pictured here in this Amazon listing).  It&#x27;s fluffier and blends shadow all over the lid.</li>
    <li> I like this brush the bristles are soft and it gets the job done if you know what you are doing.</li>
    <li> If you have the option to buy this brush in person and be able to look at the brush you choose before buying, this is a great brush.  At the store I went to (the stores with the red and white circle logo), all of the eye blending brushes from this brand were good.  But as others have said, there are some flukes out there, so be careful of that.&lt;br /&gt;  But for the great price, it might be alright to take the chance online.  You could probably order two, so if one of the brushes is not the best you could use the other.  For the brush itself, the bristles are very soft and bendable, which is good for blending the eyeshadow.  There is another brush specifically for applying eyeshadow, but if you&#x27;re in a pinch, you could use this brush for that purpose.  However the brush is soft and flexible so applying makeup might be a little challenging.&lt;br /&gt;  The brush seems to hold up well.  There is no problem with the fibers falling out.  The metal clip that holds the fibers in place seems sturdy.  The brush itself looks nice, and overall, seems to be a great purchase.  Sometimes with blending brushes it is good to have more than one, in case you forget to clean it in between uses, and you don&#x27;t want to mix colors you used one day with different eyeshadow colors.  With the price of this brush, that is possible.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush at Target but I felt the need to write a review here and on target website! Don&#x27;t spend the dollar I know it&#x27;s just one dollar but this brush sheds so much it&#x27;s not even normal. I ended up with hairs all over my face and some went inside my eye. Put your dollar towards a better brush.</li>
    <li> This is suppose to be an eye shadow blending brush! The brush&#x27;s bristles are so hard it can peel your eyelids off. blending brushes are suppose to be soft and a little wide so that it can do its purpose which is blending. This one not so much what I was looking for and for that price I expected to get something better!</li>
    <li> This brush is so stiff and terrible, it&#x27;s worth it to invest in a nicer brush rather than this</li>
    <li> Its okay does the job but isn&#x27;t amazing. It is cheapy and after doing my first brush wash the bristles got weird and don&#x27;t blend as good . You can get this at target for one dollar to</li>
    <li> I seriously love this brush. It is soft and a quality item. It is exactly what I needed and I would def purchase this brand again!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this brush i use this brush every single day ...its one of my really good brushes....i would most def recommend this brush</li>
    <li> This brush helps me achieve the looks I need.  The bristles don&#x27;t scratch and it blends eyeshadow nicely.  Great cost compared to what I have paid for other brushes.</li>
    <li> Bristles are actually shorter than pictured and it sheds like crazy. They&#x27;re not very soft either. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money if I had a choice to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great size but doesn&#x27;t do well for makeup blending, bristles a little stiff and shape is a little odd so I will use it for cleaning up my nail polish mistakes</li>
    <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup all the time, I didn&#x27;t want an expensive blending brush, so this particular brush is great. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it does its job well</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! I use it as a highlighting brush for under by brow and it does so perfectly. Holds color well and is the perfect size for that area. Blends well when being used as such too. No shedding at all. Good quality brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good fluffy eyeshadow brush for the price. Hairs tend to fall out of it, but for the price, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  This brush blends eyeshadow very nicely.</li>
    <li> The brush is holding up well. I&#x27;ve gotten this brand before and I love it. This is a very good choice. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for quality.</li>
    <li> I received this brush broken. I did glue it back together and I live in Australia so sending it back was not possible. Pretty disappointing. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> love it and easy to clean</li>
    <li> If you want to buy e.l.f. brushes, just buy them from their website. This goes for a lot of the brushes and \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; sets available on Amazon. Some are the same price and some are upcharged so much! E.l.f. always have some sort of promo code going on to get free shipping too. This brush is $1 online and in stores like Target. Personally, I have all of their Studio brushes because this head of these can fall off really quickly. Pay the extra $2 bucks and get a nicer one. Just do yourself a favor and go to [...]</li>
    <li> This brush is harsh on the eyelid it hurts to apply eye shadow and it makes it difficult to blend</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It works just as well as more expensive brands and it is so soft. I love creating my smoky eye with it. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good brush! Blends well and is super soft :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this brush, but the bristles come off during use consistently.  I&#x27;ll be buying a new blending brush in no time, and am going to shell out the $$ needed for the MAC 207 brush so that I know it lasts.</li>
    <li> the women that sold the brushes sent me a hand written card to thank me for buying her prouduct it is so good even wrapped with a bow ! other then that great prouduct</li>
    <li> *** LOVE E.L.F! GREAT PRICES FOR GREAT BRUSHES! THERE CHEAP BUT DO A GREAT JOB! I WILL BUY MORE ***</li>
    <li> Its perfect for picking up the darker eye shadow colors for smoky eyes. The bristles are soft, and not prickly as I&#x27;ve seen them described. It hasn&#x27;t shed yet. I am very happy with this purchase, accept for the price.</li>
    <li> As soon as I took this item out of the packaging, it did shed some. But I used it and it was fine. I LOVE this brush. Blends perfectly, I recommend to any brush starters!</li>
    <li> The brush is a bit big for my eye, but it did what it was suppose to. I would definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> Good brush for the price. I have noticed some shedding but it isn&#x27;t shedding too badly. If you want a cheap alternative this is the brush for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Best if used for blending. Other than that, I could get a better quality elsewhere, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought these at my daughters request and she just loves them. Almost all she uses now. She said that she was able to get rid of some of her other brushes.</li>
    <li> Works good at FIRST. After a week the hair starts falling out and after only 3-5 weeks expect the brush to be bald. Not a good product but its kind of cheap (should be cheaper for the crappy quality). So if you want something quick for cheap get it but if you want good quality for a long time this is not the thing for you</li>
    <li> Oh elf...how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...1...2...74734 little hairs that have fallen out of the brush. It still works ok but eventually it will be reduced to nothing. Maybe it&#x27;s a defective brush.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKED THIS BRUSH. THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE WAS THAT IT SHED A LOT. BUT FOR THE PRICE ITS AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I looked at these in a store the other day and out of the 10 or so on the shelf, about half were unevenly shaped and had long stray hairs sticking out.  This was the case for all of the e.l.f. professional brushes (the ones with the white handles).  I bought a couple of them that WERE shaped nicely and I am so impressed.  They are perfect for applying a darker shadow to your crease.  They pick up and deposit shadow wonderfully, and make blending a breeze.  I have never had my eye makeup look so good!  I compared this to Clinique&#x27;s blending brush, and although this brush probably won&#x27;t last as long as the Clinique one, it holds its own performance-wise.  And the price really cannot be beat (in stores it sells for $1).  You have to be careful ordering them online because I have received duds.  It&#x27;s better if you can see them in person and pick the best ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I tried e.l.f.&#x27;s studio line of brushes (the all black ones) and I was not impressed with the eye brushes.  While the larger powder brushes are superb in the studio line (and far superior to the professional line of large brushes), the smaller eye brushes just don&#x27;t pick up eye shadow all that well.  I&#x27;ve decided that the studio brushes (black) are best in the large category, and the professional brushes (white) are best in the small category.</li>
    <li> If you need this brush, go to WAL Mart and look in the $1.00 ELF section as this is where I bought this exact brush.  I already have this brush  and from the pic, it looks like something different than what I own. But its not. I ordered it  because i thought it was a fluffy blending brush for my crease work.It is not fluffy, quite dense,compact and sort of a tight brush bed. However, shipped very quickly and arrived way sooner than expected.Not what I needed and would not have spent $4 on a $1 brush.</li>
    <li> this brush is amazing for such a cheap price i dont understand why people buy expensive brushes when this brush works just as good</li>
    <li> i love this crease brush its awesome but i would not buy it from amazon again because you can buy it at the store cheaper than you can on amazon but i love this brush and its easy to apply eyeshadow with but the bottom part of it did fall off but it still works this brush is amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I lost my sephora blending brush. Luckily I found my sephora brush, because this one sucks. It blends, just takes longer and I&#x27;m impatient. Get a sephora one, it blends quicker!</li>
    <li> Good eye shadow blender.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this brush here, I actually purchase this brush at a local store called DOLLAR TREE for just $1.00 much better price. Hope this helped. The store carries all the ( e.l.f.) brushes and all are just $1.00 I am very impressed of the quality and performance of the brush, trust me you can&#x27;t go wrong for $1.00 dollar.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. I wasn&#x27;t going to spend $20 on something more high end than this. They&#x27;re all the same stuff. It works for me.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these brushes,especially the Blending Eye Brush one. I&#x27;ve tried &amp; purchased sooo many brushes,even the \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; ones but ELF brushed r extraordinary! So soft yet hard enough to get desire look. I used to struggle with shadows at the crease now it&#x27;s a few second thing &amp; the results r amazing. After purchasing the 1st one,the next day I bought myself another,the exact same one!</li>
    <li> absolutely perfect for blending.  the width of the brush is exactly what i was looking for.  it didn&#x27;t fall apart or anything, you&#x27;d think since it only cost me a buck!!!! great buy!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product because I was in desperate need for a blending brush. Unfortunately the first use of this product went awful. Not only were the bristles, rough and stiff, they fell out while I was trying to blend my shadows. Either I got a bad batch or my expectation for this elf product was too high.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for emergency needs but honestly spend a couple extra dollars and get a softer brush. The bristles hurt and it takes too much force to actually blend the eyeshadow which is a huge problem because the skin around the eyes is very delicate and need extras TLC. Take care of your eyes!</li>
    <li> terrible product, all the bristles are falling out.  Very dangerous because they can get in your eye and cause irritation. i wouldnt even give it a one star but had no choice</li>
    <li> I use this brush almost every day and it is absolutely A-M-A Zing!!!! I would definitely recommend this for others!! Thanks amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I have 3 of these and they definitely do their job: diffusing color. None has shed on me, despite repeated washes. None has fallen apart. They are not necessarily the softest blending brushes, but I would also not call them scratchy. And they do their job very well - they give you a nice and soft blended out look. I like it and I&#x27;ve repurchased it.</li>
